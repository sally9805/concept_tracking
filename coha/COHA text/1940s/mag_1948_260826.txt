Not all refugees had to take to sailing ships to escape the Red grasp . Last week 's news was full of D.D.s-displaced diplomats . In Washington the Polish embassy military attache , General Izydor Modelski , ordered home by his Communist-run governme'nt , had point-blank refused to go , asked asylum in the U.S. He had a soldier 's blunt reason : " I have never been a member of the Communist Party , nor have I ever been in sympathy with its aims . " <P> Jan Wojnowski , Poland 's consul in Milan , Italy , was a bit subtler about it but he had the same general idea . A studious , courteous , bespectacled book collector , he had never been very happy in his consulate . Last summer , after a trip home , he cut out meat , ate only tea and toast for supper and gave up buying books . Staffers wondered why he was saving his pennies . Last week they found out . <P> Two days after his replacement arrived from Warsaw , the ex-consul bade them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice . Boarding the train next day , he bundled his family off before it reached Venice , roared across the Swiss border in a taxi and hopped the first plane to Johannesburg , South Africa . At the same time the Czechoslovakian Ministry in Rome became impervious to telephone bells . Czech Minister Jan Pauliny-Toth had slipped across the Swiss border , London bound . <P> Timid , red-nosed Grigor Moisil , Rumanian ambassador to Turkey , may have longed to do much the same thing . He heard that Foreign Minister Ana Pauker had purged his good friend Justice Minister Lucretiu Patrascanu , and lived in fear that he himself would be called home . Last week , within a 24-hour span , four announcements in Ankara gave a clue to his state of mind : 1 ) the Turkish government announced that Grigor had decided to quit his post and move to Switzerland ; 2 ) the Rumanian embassy announced that he had died of eating poisoned mushrooms ; 3 ) the Rumanian embassy announced that its first announcement was a hoax to get even with the Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all former announcements were greatly exaggerated .
