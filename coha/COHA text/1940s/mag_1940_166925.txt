Up for judgment in Manhattan 's galleries last week , as in every week of the art season ( October-May ) , was enough canvas to put sails on a four-master and enough sculpture to ballast one . Some 60 U. S. artists were there , of all ages , regions and schools , plus a varied assortment of Europeans . In time , they ranged from Drer to Disney . In place , they ranged the globe . <P> The Ferargil Galleries showed the raw-colored , precise paintings of Georgian Lamar Dodd , one of the South 's few good painters . The Boyer Galleries showed the kaleidoscopic water colors of Nathaniel Dirk , a camoufleur in World War I. In the Bonestell Gallery , Frenchman Jean Charlot , a founding father of the famed Mexican school , exhibited deceptively simple pictures of broad , squat peons and solemn babies . The Downtown Gallery had as fine a first one-man show as a crowded season has seen-Julian Levis serene , spacious paintings of the seaside . <P> Topping them all was the James Chapin retrospective at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Alden Jewell went off the deep end . Wrote he : " It establishes his position as second to none in our contemporary roster . It contains some of the finest painting of our time . It ... constitutes a full and ringing American challenge . In a word , this show is the real thing . " <P> Not American but post-Impressionist French were the canvases of agile , sensitive James Chapin up to 1924 . Czanne was his idol . That year he left Greenwich Village , took a walking trip in the hills of northern New Jersey . There he found a two-room log cabin , decided it would be a quiet place to paint . He rented it for $4 a month from the Marvins , a tightfisted , hard-working farm family . <P> Soon Artist Chapin got so absorbed in spare , taciturn , unschooled Emmet , George and Ella Marvin that he stopped painting cubist arrangement of rocks , scaffolding and apple trees , became instead a limner of the U. S. scene long before it became the popular thing . The suspicious Marvins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them in the fields , helped round up the pigs . For five years he stirred from the farm no more than the Marvins did , sketched them ploughing , foxhunting , planting potatoes , sharpening a scythe , clustered round their old iron kitchen range . The paintings that resulted are strong , bleak , solid as the Jersey hills . <P> But Artist Chapin is no repeater of formulas . In 1929 he left his log cabin and went back to Manhattan . His brush has since touched many another phase of U. S. life-touts , lobster fishermen , subways , baseball players , blues singers , lime kilns , Utah strawstacks . Sometimes his paintings are crisp and tight , sometimes loose and fluid . They are always vital . At 53 , an art teacher one day a week at the Pennsylvania Academy , James Chapin is still undogmatic . " We are all students together , " says he . " I 'm trying to learn how to paint too .
