Only two U.S. operas have been produced at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House in the past eight years ; both were written by the same man . Yet 34-year-old , Italian-born Gian-Carlo Menotti , the composer , is no admirer of the Met . <P> His Amelia Goes to the Ball ( 1938 ) and The Island God ( 1942 ) got fair to middling notices , but they did not stay long in the Met 's repertory. * Says Menotti : " Opera should be taken out of the museum . The trouble with opera is n't that it is n't what it used to be , but that it is . " <P> Last week Composer Menotti had a premiere to his liking . His latest music-drama , The Medium , was produced under his own direction by Columbia University . On a set by Ballet Designer Oliver Smith , The Medium unfolded a grisly plot thick in horror and thin in music . <P> It tells the story of a phony spiritualist who , in the midst of a seance she has rigged , finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never finds out if her assailant is mortal or ectoplasmic , but it sees a first-rate flagellation and a ghostly murder before the curtain rings down . Every word of Menotti 's English libretto had the merit of being understandable , and some of the atmospheric horror music was more blood-curdling than Puccini 's . <P> But the best performance last week was that of a mute who did n't sing a note . This week Menotti 's seven-year-old opera bouffe , The Old Maid and the Thief ( TIME , May 1 , 1939 ) is to be sung to beer and hot dogs at a Carnegie Hall pop concert . Next month , Menotti will sail for Europe to visit Milan , his home town , and do research in Paris for a ballet about Marcel Proust . He lives at Mt . Kisco , N.Y . in a glistening glass and wood house called " Capricorn , " with Symphonist Samuel Barber , an aspiring poet named Robert Horan , and a female cocker spaniel . The cocker , Menotti says , " is very musical and neurotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog has a preference for the works of Ravel and Debussy . <P> <P> * Of the 1 8 U.S. operas produced by the Met , only Deems Taylor 's The King 's Henchman ( 1927 ) and Peter Ibbetson ( 1931 ) , and Louis Gruenberg 's Emperor Jones ( 1933 ) were mild successes . The last pre-Menotti U.S. opera was Walter Damrosch 's The Man without a Country , which got one performance , May 12 , 1937.
