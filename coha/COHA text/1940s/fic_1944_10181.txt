from magazines , and crumbs of colored wax . Johanna had lately taken an indolent interest in making the wax flower pieces which had become so fashionable . Though outside the front windows dazzling sunshine sparkled on the partly frozen river , the brown plush portieres were still tight-drawn , and the room had a sour airless smell . If this were only my room , thought Miranda , who had examined everything in one quick glance , how beautiful I would make it . It could be the loveliest room in the house . Johanna was finishing her breakfast . She wiped her mouth and pettishly pushed an empty cup toward Magda . Tell Annetje to have more cream whipped into my morning chocolate . This was thin as dish water . Take my tray away . ' The maid silently complied . Johanna hoisted herself up on the frilled pillows and acknowledgedthe girl 's presence with a discontented sigh . ' Oh , good morning . I wanted to talk to you . ' ' Yes , ma'am , ' said Miranda anxiously . ' Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened as she surveyedthe girl . Against the vivid blue of Miranda 's dress the carefully arranged ringlets shone brightly gold . Johanna 's resentful gaze lingered on the tiny waist , which Miranda 's new stays pinched down to eighteen inches . ' Such tight lacing ca n't be good for you , ' she said sharply . It 's not suitable to your station . Nor is the way you wear your hair . It should be confined neatly in a net . ' A slow wave of rose washed up to the fluffy curls on Miranda 's forehead . ' I 'm sorry ma'am , ' she said with difficulty . ' Is that  --  is that what you wanted to speak to me about ? ' ' No . I 'm not satisfied with Katrine 's progress . You do n't pay enough attention to the child . ' I try to , ma'am , ' returned the girl unhappily . ' Well , I want you to take her into Hudson today . She has a whitlow on her finger . Let Doctor Hamilton on Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been looking forward to this day . Two nights ago at dinner , Nicholas had said suddenly , ' Miranda , do you skate ? ' ' Oh , yes , indeed I love it , ' she had answered , thinking of happy winter outings on Dumpling Pond at home.  |p101He  had nodded , his brilliant eyes on her eager face . ' The creek behind Bronk Island is well frozen . On Tuesday if the weather holds we 'll cross the river and skate . ' This was Tuesday , and the weather had held clear and sharp in spite of bright sunshine . There would have been the joy of exercise ; her muscles often rebelled against the ladylike inactivity which was now expected of her . And then she would have been alone with Nicholas . ' I do n't think it 's a whitlow , ma'am , ' she protested . ' Trine had a splinter that I took out ; you can hardly see the place now . ' Johanna pursed her mouth . ' Magda says it is a whitlow . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Street and have her Sunday boots mended , and here 's a list of things which you may get for me in the town . ' She held out a scrawled piece of paper . ' You will go at once . ' ' And where is Miranda to go at once ? ' Both women jumped . Nicholas stood in the doorway , on his mouth an inquiring smile . He ignored Miranda , fixing his gaze on his wife . Johanna 's pasty face disintegrated into shapelessness . She moistened her lips . You  --  you startled me , Nicholas . You so seldom come in here  --  ' He inclined his head , and continued to wait for his answer . Johanna with a nervous motion pulled her bed jacket tight across her great breasts , straightened her crumpled nightcap . ' Miranda must take Katrine to Hudson today . The child needs a doctor , ' she said at last . His eyebrows arched . Could a doctor not come here , as usual ? ' ' It would take too long ; besides , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defiant note : ' I ordered the carriage . It 's waiting now . ' Nicholas inclined his head again . ' I see . The trip to Hudson is very important . Miranda and Katrine must certainly go . It changes my plans a trifle , but no matter . I 've been meaning to talk with the county sheriff for some time . Your wishes are always paramountwith me , my dear , as you know . ' Johanna drew a labored breath . ' What do you mean ? ' ' Why , that I shall of course accompany them to Hudson , ' saidpIO2Nicholas gently . They could hardly get back before nightfall , and with the temper of the farmers what it is , the roads are unsafe . The Livingston coach was waylaid last week . ' Miranda could not suppress a delighted glance at Nicholas . But he still ignored her , his unwinking gaze on Johanna 's face , over which now passed an expression of helpless bewilderment , and something else . Can it be that she 's frightened ? thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he had been now . And it was quite true that he usually did exactly as Johanna wished , especially in these last months . What a fool she is ! thought the girl impatiently , and forgot Johanna , whose wishes were negligible now that Nicholas had taken hold of the situation . That November day in Hudson was to be one of those vivid days which come seldom and unannounced , when every slightest incidentis gilded with emotion . Of the dark undercurrents beneath that glowing day , she had no conception then , nor for many years . It was enough that from the moment Nicholas seated himself beside her in the closed barouche , she should feel for the first time with him at ease  --  excited , adventurous , and beautiful . She wore the green silk , into which she had sewn a fresh ruching of cream lace . Over this , for warmth , went a wadded fawn-colored pelisse , and her gloves and reticule were lemon yellow . Though she had had few occasions to wear it she knew how becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumes . Her handkerchiefwas perfumed with heliotrope , and the seductive yet delicatescent added to her sense of confidence . For the first mile , as the two cream horses drew them smoothly through the village , then slowed down for the icy puddles and ruts on the river road , Nicholas said little . But she felt him looking at her , felt the electric atmosphere within the warmed carriage , and was content . Katrine sat on the seat opposite them crooning to her doll . Now and again she examined her bandaged finger with satisfaction , pleased with its importance . It did n't hurt , but Mama said it was very bad . That 's why Miranda was taking her to Hudson . It was a treat to go to Hudson . Perhaps there 'd be ices to eat , and maybe Papa would buy her something . The child looked doubtfully at Nicholas . It was queer to have him there . Sometimes for days she did n't see him at all , and when she did , usually he did n't pay any attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annetje could have gone with us too , thought Katrine . Straighten your pantalettes , dear , ' said Miranda , smiling . ' They 're all rumpled . ' She leaned over to help , and her golden curls fell across Katrine 's pudgy legs . This tickled and Katrine was pleased . She liked Miranda , who was so pretty and gentle . Besides , she always smelled nice . Will we have ices in Hudson ? ' asked the child suddenly . ' Papa , can we ? ' Nicholas ' face darkened , and Miranda thought , he 's wondering if she is going to be like Johanna . Then he relaxed , leaning easily against the brocaded padding of the carriage seat . And he laughed , seeming much younger . Certainly you may have ices . We 'll go to the Hudson House for dinner . I 'd planned to drive down to the Widow Mary Livingston'sand trespass on her hospitality . But perhaps you 'd rather dine at an inn . ' ' Oh , yes , please , Papa , ' begged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Miranda ? ' said Nicholas . At the intimate note in his voice her breathing quickened . The inn , please , ' she said eagerly . This was no day to visit anotherManor House where the awesome widow would immediately engulf Nicholas , leaving Miranda stranded as usual . After that Nicholas began to talk in his most charming manner . He told her about the country through which they were driving . By now they had passed out of his own manor , but he knew every step of the road to Hudson . At Nutten Hook he showed her a shanty where lived a witch . ' At least my farmers think so , ' said Nicholas , laughing . ' She sells love potions and on moonless nights flies as far as Kinderhook on her broomstick . ' Miranda laughed too , not at what he said but for delight that he was talking to her like this . Nicholas was so rarely light and gay , and now for all the dark reserve which he never lost , he was gay . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Look ! ' he cried as they crossed the Stockport Creek . Do you see the falls upstream ? ' She nodded . ' Once when I was a boy I made a wager with friends that I could dive down the cataract. ' pI04 ' But that was terribly dangerous . How could anyone do that ? ' ' I did , ' said Nicholas . ' And though I broke my leg , it was worth it . It 's always been my pride to master circumstances . ' Yes , thought Miranda . Even as a boy he must have been able to master any situation . The carriage jounced over a deep rut and she was thrown against him . Her cheek brushed the shoulder of his blue broadcloth coat . There was a faint odor of starched linen , peau d'espagne , and the leather of his boots . As it had been at the ball , her will and her body both seemed to melt like soft wax at his nearness . In his eyes there was a peculiar expression . He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen , and she noticed that his hands trembled slightly . By noon they reached the Dugway Road and pulled up the sharp hill on Second Street into Hudson . ' How pretty the town is ! ' cried Miranda . She would on that day have thought a collection of squatters ' huts on a mud flat pretty . But the little town did have charm . Its neat houses were of brick or fieldstone and plainly showed their New England origin . Hudsonhad been settled by Nantucket Quakers who sought after the Revolution a newer and safer whaling port , and though encircled by land-loving Dutch farmers , the Folgers and Macys and Coffins had been profitably going down to the sea in ships for fifty years . ' Where 's Diamond Street ? ' asked Miranda . ' Cousin Johanna said that Doctor Hamilton lived there  --  for Katrine 's finger . ' Nicholas shook his head . ' Hamilton 's an old fogy . He knows no remedies but calomel , bark , and brandy . Take the child to that young Turner . He seems very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's a down-renter ! ' cried Miranda , startled into protest by the aversion she had felt to the brusque young doctor . ' All the more reason to flatter him with my patronage , ' answered Nicholas easily . ' He 'll soon lose his silly views if I make him the Manor physician . ' ' Oh  --  ' she said . ' I see . ' How clever Nicholas was ! He gave the coachman instructions , turned back to her . ' I 'm going to see Mayor Curtis and the sheriff . There 's been more trouble in collecting the rents . I 'll order this ridiculous business settled once for all . Then I 'll meet you at the Hudson House at two . ' pIO5He got out of the carriage , stood hat in hand until the horses started . She watched his tall figure  --  made even taller by the high beaver hat  --  walk rapidly down the street . People stared , whispering . Once he uncovered his head and bowed to an old lady in gray and his wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Union and she could no longer see him . It stopped at a low brick cottage on Front Street near the river . A tin sign nailed on the whitewashed door said ' Jefferson Turner , M.D.Miranda sighed . ' Come , Katrine . This is the doctor 's . ' The child , hugging Cristabel , obediently followed . As Miranda lifted the brass knocker she was astonished to hear a confusion of voices from inside , and a male one louder than the rest shouting , ' Blast them , ' t is no time for half measures , I tell ye ! ' Miranda 's knock produced a dead silence . Someone said ' Hush ! ' She waited five impatient minutes before the door was opened by Jeff himself . His sandy hair was tousled , his shirt sleeves rolled up , disclosing heavily muscled arms with freckles and red hairs on them . The girl 's lip curled . She drew up her green skirts and lifted her chin . ' Miss Van Ryn has a sore finger , ' she said haughtily , puttingher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you look at it . ' Jeff continued to stare . His sharp gray eyes looked past the two on his step to the waiting Van Ryn barouche with the coat-of-arms l blazoned on its door . He looked again at the annoyed girl , then he threw back his head and emitted a guffaw . ' Well , I 'll be damned ! ' he said . ' Come in , madam  --  I 'm most extraordinarily honored . ' Miranda threw him a furious glance and swept past him . The cottage had but four small rooms besides the kitchen in back . The front room and surgery were full of men , a dozen at least , and one weeping woman who hastily wiped her eyes when she saw Miranda . ' Look what I found at my door ! ' cried Jeff , still chuckling . ' Miss Van Ryn , no less  --  ' he made a sweeping bow to the bewildered Katrine , who put her finger in her mouth and clung to Miranda 's skirts. '  --  And  --  ' continued Jeff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She too is tinged with royalty , folks , for she is the patroon 's cousin . '  |p1o6  A murmur ran round the room . A small , slight man with mousecoloredwhiskers pulled at Jeff 's arm and whispered something . The woman stood up , her threadbare gray shawl falling off her thin shoulders . ' Aye , ' she said bitterly . The Van Ryns can mince in silks and velvets while I and my children go hungry . ' She sidled past Miranda , who stood her ground , her heart beating fast . The woman went out the front door . - 'We 'll meet later , men , ' said Jeff . ' It 's maybe wise to make new plans in view of this . ' He motioned toward the Van Ryn carriage . There were exchanged looks of understanding . Several nodded . They filed silently from the room , leaving only the small slight man and Jeff . Miranda found her tongue . That was a down-rent meeting ! ' she cried indignantly . The two men looked at her accusing face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to introduce Doctor Smith Boughton . ' The small man bowed coldly . Smith Boughton , she thought . Fenimore Cooper 's words at the banquet came back to her . Tuppenny little doctor , skulks about preaching rebellion and defiance of the law . ' This , then , must be the one who was organizing the farmers . ' I should think you 'd be ashamed , ' she said to him hotly , stirring up trouble , telling people to do wrong . They were happy enough on the manors until you came along . ' The two doctors exchanged glances . Though Boughton was the older they had both been medical students at Castleton , Vermont . Always they had been friends . Since Boughton , burning with fervor and the true crusader 's spirit , had come to Columbia County , Jeff had done what he could to help the cause . But Jeff had balance and a sense of humor , which the other did not . Now the little doctor stepped up to Miranda , his eyes blazing . She saw that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard , ' he shouted at her . The farmers have never been happy on the manors . My own people were Rensselaertenants and I know . You feather-brained girl , d'ye realize why your forefathers left the old country ? It was to find freedom and be quit of tyranny . All the length and breadth of this great land white men are free , except here on these manors . I tell youpI07'tis a black and rotten spot here . A stinking survival from the past ! ' He clenched his fist and Miranda stepped back . Katrine , wide-eyed , peeked around the edge of her skirt . ' But it 's the law ! ' said Miranda weakly . She felt force in the 1 little man 's oratory , but she was not in the least convinced . ' The law is wrong , ' said Boughton more temperately . And it shall be changed . ' ' Without violence , ' put in Jeff on a warning note , adding directly to his friend , Our cause will suffer if there 's violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , ' he said to Jeff . He bowed curtly to Miranda and went out . Now , young lady , ' said Jeff , smiling at Katrine , ' let 's see the finger that brought you here at this interesting moment . ' He took the child 's hand and led her gently to the surgery . It was a small room with a red drugget carpet . Besides the scrubbed oak bench on which lay iron forceps and a couple of scalpels , there was only a cabinet filled with bottles and pill-boxes , a stone mortar and pestle , some medical books , a table and two chairs . A beam of sunlight fell through the single uncurtained window . Miranda reluctantly admired the deftness with which Jeff 's blunt fingers unwound the bandage , and the reassuring way he spoke to Katrine . But she found nothing else to admire . She loathed his thick-set , aggressively masculine body , his boorish manners  --  and above all his treacherous alliance with the down-renters . She chafed II to be gone and tell Nicholas . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' There 's nothing wrong with this finger , ' said Jeff , raising his head after a careful examination . ' No , ' she answered , ' I did n't think there was . ' Jeff straightened and folded his arms . ' I find that most interesting . Dare I hope , then , that I 've aroused a secret passion in your maiden breast ? Can it be that it was solely from the hope of seeing me again that you came today ? This condescension overcomes  --  ' Fiddlesticks ! ' Miranda burst out , and was immediately horrified . Well-brought-up young ladies did not shout ' fiddlesticks ' ; that was a deplorable lapse into her childhood . And now the insufferable man was laughing again . She pulled up her yellow gloves and straightened her bonnet . ' We came today , Doctor Turner , because Nicholas  --  ' she cor-pIo8 rected herself instantly  --  ' the patroon wished it . I now bid you good day . ' Her little slip and the tone of her voice as she had said ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her fragile gold-andwhitebeauty did not appeal to him . He preferred a buxom bosom and high spirits along the lines of Faith Folger , who flouted her Quaker background with rosy cheeks and hearty laughter , and a passion for wearing cherry-colored ribbons in her dark curls . Miranda , with her little pretensions , had irritated him as much as he had her . Moreover , knowing her to be a farm girl of simple upbringinghe thought her a traitor to her class . The girl 's head had been turned by luxury . But , he now thought , perhaps it was deeper than that . It would be a pity if the little goose fancied herself in love with Van Ryn , who was undoubtedly a handsome and romantic-lookingfellow . There would be no solution to that situation , except heartbreak for the girl . Worse yet , suppose Van Ryn seduced her . Even as the idea occurred to him he rejected it . Whateverthe man 's faults , a desire for shoddy intrigue was not one of them . Jeff was as sure of that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Ryn come with you to Hudson today ? ' he asked abruptly . ' Yes , ' said Miranda . ' Mr. Van Ryn escorted us . ' Her eyes flew to the clock with transparent longing . She moved definitely toward the door . Jeff on impulse put his hand on her arm . ' Miss Wells , ' he said earnestly , ' why do you stay at Dragonwyck ? Do n't you miss your home and your family ? ' Miranda colored angrily . ' You 're impertinent , sir ! ' she said , throwing off his hand ; and sweeping up Katrine she made a grand exit . Jeff , shrugging his broad shoulders , watched her glide into the waiting barouche . He stayed frowning at the window until a knock on his door aroused him . A frowzy old woman stumbledin . ' Oh , doctor , ' she whined . ' My pains 're back again . I need more of the medicine . ' ' Come to the surgery , then , Mrs. Potts , ' he said kindly . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . ' And in examining the aching body and searching for illuminating symptoms , he forgot everything else , as he always did. pI09The newly rebuilt Hudson House on Warren Street provided the Van Ryn party with an excellent dinner . Their table was set in a corner of the white-pillared dining-room , and the watchful proprietorsaw to it that no lesser mortals approached the patroon . Except , of course , three anxiously hovering waiters . Miranda told Nicholas at once about the down-rent meeting and Smith Boughton , but he made light of it . Its nothing but childish hysteria . I 'm surprised that so sensible a man as Turner should have part in it . But it 'll soon stop . I 've spoken to the sheriff . ' He was in no mood for unpleasant matters . He too was enjoying the day . He had bought Katrine a rag doll and a paint box . There was something for Miranda too . A gold-and-enamel vinaigrette for smelling salts . She and Katrine were both in an ecstasy of gratitude . The afternoon passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas made no move . They wandered to Parade Hill , the promenade terrace at the foot of Warren Street , and walked leisurely about admiring the view of the Hudson and two old schooners , whalers both , which lay beside the docks below . Soon there would be no more whalers , and in a few years trains would come snorting through the peaceful river bank and deluge the terrace with soot and sparks . But today it was quiet . There were other promenaders  --  girls in Quaker bonnets and demure fichus , laughing children with hoops which rolled merrily round the central fountain , old gaffers stretchingtheir legs in the crisp sunlight . Miranda and Nicholas spoke little . A soft contentment held them both . Nicholas , who so often retired into a remote place where she could not follow , was that afternoon all hers , responsive to her interest in the lively waterfront scenes , smiling with her at the children 's antics . And then unpleasantness marred the golden afternoon . They walked past a secluded bench on which sat two old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryn ? ' crackled the high-pitched voice of the deaf . ' For sure that 's not his lady with him ? ' ' Indeed ' t is not ! His lady 's monstrous fat and does n't go abroad . ' The other voice exploded into senile chuckles . ' By hokie-nettie ! Perhaps it is his  --  ' Sudden discretion obliterated the last word , hut even to Miranda the meaning was clear . Sharp misery shat-pII0 tered her happiness . For hours she had managed to forget Johanna . Nicholas gave no sign that he also had heard . The red sun dipped behind the Catskills and a chill breeze sprang at them from the river . It whipped the ready color into Miranda 's cheeks , fluttered her curls and green bonnet ribbons . She shivered . He looked down at her . ' We must go home now , Miranda . ' He put the faintest emphasis on ' home ' and she responded with a bitternessshe could not control . Dragonwyck 's not my home . I 'm there only on sufferance , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet sent me away .  --  Johanna does n't like me , ' she finished very low . They were descending the steps to the street , and though he took her arm it was with so light a touch that she could scarcely feel it . And he was silent for so long that she was frightened . She should n't have said that . Perhaps he was annoyed that she had seemed to criticize his wife . Or perhaps he thought her ungrateful and pleadingfor more of his bounty . That would be dreadful . He handed her into the waiting barouche , and still he did not speak . She settled miserably into her corner . Katrine yawned and stretched out on the seat opposite them , Cristabel , the new rag doll , and the paint box all hugged tight in her arms . Miranda covered the child with a carriage robe . She stole a pleading look at Nicholas . In the shadows she could barely see his profile , the thin aquiline nose with flaring nostrils , the full , compressed lips , the planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheek . Despite his stillness there was intensity in his attitude , an effect of concealed violence which had no outer manifestation . The day 's sympathetic companion had disappeared once more , and she was alone . Before they again crossed the Stockport Creek it was black night outside . The horses slowed down to a walk . The oil carriage lamps threw a flickering and uncertain light on the fir trees which hemmed the road . They entered a thick wood with underbrush so close that it scratched against the sides of the carriage . Miranda could bear the silence no longer . Are you angry with me , Cousin Nicholas ? ' she asked faintly . He turned his head , but before he could answer they were both jolted from their separate preoccupations . A weird clamor broke from the quiet forest , war whoops and the tooting of horns . Be/neath these the steady beat of a fife and drum , and defiant voices singing to the tune of Old Dan Tucker . ' The barouche was surrounded with dozens of masked figures in lurid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears and clubs . The near horse shied violently , and the carriage stopped . Batter the coach in ! ' yelled one of the figures , and a heavy blow from a pitchfork rebounded from the carriage 's sturdy roof . Stop that ; that 's not the way ! ' shouted another man in a blue sheepskin mask . Down with the rent , Van Ryn ! Get out so we may talk to you . ' Nicholas was already out of the carriage . Though her heart was beating fast Miranda was not frightened . In spite of the weapons , there was more comedy than threat in this crazy collection of childish masks and calico nightgowns . It 's all right , dear , ' she said to Katrine , whom the racket had only half wakened . ' Go back to sleep . ' The child subsided . Miranda , moved by curiosity and a desire to be near Nicholas , also got out . He walked up to the man in the blue sheepskin mask who seemed to be the leader . The others pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nicholas to the blue mask . ' Pray what is all this ? ' He spoke as casually as though this were a garden party on the Dragonwyck lawns , and before the leader could answer , a large figure in pink calico with a headdress of turkey feathers broke from the circle and brandishing a torch in Nicholas ' face shouted : Ye know very well what we are . We 're Indians ! We 've banded together on the warpath to right a grievous wrong ! ' Nicholas ' eyes traveled slowly from the speaker 's muddy hobnailedboots beneath the home-dyed nightgown to the rawhide belt from which dangled a tin horn . Finally he raised his eyes to the clumsily painted mask . Nicholas ' lips curved . I 've no objections to your playing at Indians , though it seems a childish amusement for grown men . But kindly play your games elsewhere ; you 're blocking the road . ' A threatening growl issued from a dozen throats . The group moved closer , but as well as the hatred which flowed from them toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudep112confounded them , for they saw that he was not bluffing , that their demonstration provoked in him no emotion but contempt and annoyancethat his carriage should be delayed . And allegiance to the patroon was in their blood , violently as they resented the system . The group wavered , several of the masks turned toward the one in blue sheepskin as though for guidance . ' You tell him , Blue Eagle , ' muttered the man in turkey feathers . The leader nodded and raised his hand toward Nicholas in a gesture of command . ' We 're warning you , Van Ryn , ' he said in a stern voice muffled by the mask . ' You wo n't collect the next rents . We Indians will see to that . Our chief Big Thunder has promised the farmers . You can send all the sheriffs and mealy-mouthed bailiffs you 've a mind to but you 'll not collect the rents . ' ' Indeed ? ' said Nicholas . ' And now , having conveyed your message , I take it we may proceed . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the discouragement which emanated from the leader and gripped the others , and she amazed herself by feeling a twist of pity for them  --  the utter unreason of trying to assault the patroon 's impregnability with puerile warnings and masquerade . At last the blue mask dipped in assent . ' You may proceed . ' As Nicholas turned toward his carriage a few pitchforks were waved , and there were scattered tootings from the tin horns , but their defiance had flattened . ' Oh , you were so splendid ! ' cried Miranda as they once more seated themselves in the barouche . ' So  --  ' Her voice broke into a frightened scream . The glass windows in the doors on either side of them shattered simultaneously , and above the crash there was a report and the high whine of a bullet . Without conscious thought she threw herself into Nicholas ' arms . 9 They tightened convulsively around her , holding her pressed against him . Her bonnet fell to the floor , and bending his head he touched her hair with his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrified horses the left-hand door was thrown open . and Jeff Turner 's anxious face peered in at them . ' You all right ? ' he cried . By the light of the torch he had seized as he ran to the carriage he saw Miranda 's bright head against Van Ryn 's breast , and even in hisp113dismay he had a swift thought  --  Oh , Lord , so that 's the way it is  --  before Nicholas put the girl gently from him . ' That bullet was a mistake , Van Ryn , ' said Jeff . ' I 'm mortal sorry . One of the men lost his head and we 'll deal with him . We do n't mean violence . ' His quick eyes saw that no one had been hurt . Katrine , who was now wailing , had been protected from the falling glass by the carriage robe , and the bullet had passed harmlessly in and out the windows . Still trembling , Miranda pulled the frightened child onto her lap , glared with the anger of ebbing terror at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallor was composed again . They both saw the blue sheepskin mask which Jeff had hastily shoved down below his chin when he heard the shot . ' So Doctor Turner is Blue Eagle , ' remarked Nicholas without particular emphasis . ' Do n't you think you might keep your companions in better order ? ' ' Yes , of course , ' answered Jeff impatiently . ' I told you I 'm sorry , but there 's no harm done , and it 's no wonder one of us lost control . You 're mighty provoking , Van Ryn , with your god-like airs and your stubborn refusal to see any viewpoint but your own . Do n't you realize these men are desperate  --  you fool ! ' Jeff snapped his mouth shut against his rising temper . Neither violence nor abuse was the way to right this injustice that was unfortunately backed by law . The two in the carriage infuriated him . But for Nicholas he felt an unwilling admiration . The man was cool and brave enough . ' It 's you who are the fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and walked slowly back to the group of disgruntled maskers . Silently they all watched the carriage speed down the road and disappear between the pines . They had accomplished nothing , except to put themselves in the wrong and in danger of the law by that reckless pistol shot . ' Never mind , men , ' said Jeff , tacitly admitting the affair 's failure . ' Take heart , we 'll win out yet . We 'll show ' em we mean business over at Ancram next week ! ' There were mutters of assent . They formed a straggling file , the fife and drums began again . A few voices took up the refrain : ' The moon was shining silver bright , The sheriff came at dead of night.  |p114High  on a hill an Indian true , And on his horn a blast he blew . Get out of the way , Big Bill Snyder , We 'll tar your coat and feather your hide , sir .

It was not only the fright and danger , nor shame at the way she had thrown herself into Nicholas ' arms . It was the realization that he had pulled her violently against him and she had felt the hard pressure of his face on her hair . This time there could be no doubt of his response , and beneath the exultation of that knowledge she felt a corroding fear . She could not look at him : above Katrine 's head she kept her face turned toward the blackness of the broken window through which an icy wind blew . Though her teeth were chattering she scarcely felt the cold . I must go home , she thought wildly . I must get away . It 's true I must go . Tomorrow I 'll tell him . No , now  --  quickly , before I lose my courage . ' Cousin Nicholas , ' she said , her voice high and strained , ' it 'll soon be Christmas time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's always so much to do . I think I should go at once . Tomorrowor the next day  --  perhaps  --  ' Nicholas reached out in the darkness and put his hand on her arm . At his touch she fell silent . Be patient , Miranda , ' he said in a quiet tone of absolute command . ' You will go back to the farm in due time . In due time  --  ' he repeated on a lower note . He took his hand from her arm . What is there to be patient for ? she thought with anguish . I ca n't go on like this . But she had not the strength to protest . Her head drooped against the cushions . Later , she thought , when I 'm in my room alone and warm again , I 'll be able to think clearly . I 'll know what to do . She shivered as they emerged from the forest and the wind from the river blew through the broken panes with redoubled force . Katrine was dozing again .

SHE MENTIONED THE possibility in a letter to her mother , but Abigail , suppressing her longing for her favorite child , wrote back by the next post that Miranda must not think of returning if the Van Ryns were willing to keep her . I can see that you are learning many gentle ways and becomingquite the lady . Mind you take full advantage of this rare opportunity . ' So it seemed foolish to insist on going , particularly as Miranda found her sudden panic inexplicable when coolly examined in the morning light . There had , after all , been nothing shameful or astonishing about that moment in the carriage . What more natural than to turn for protection to one 's escort , and Nicholas ' behavior  --  that had been really nothing more than chivalry and the affectionate impulse of an older relative . Even Ma would n't think it queer if she knew , thought Miranda . But she had not mentioned that episodeto her mother . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hudson had never been . Nicholas sent to New York and Boston for books . Boxes of them arrived on each boat and were carried from the dock straight up to the tower room , where he now spent most of his time . An Albany schooner homing from the Orient brought a fresh consignment of foreign plants , and to Miranda 's regret all the exquisite Persian oleanders were removed from the conservatory to make room for palms , an aloe , and some bulbous Ceylonese ferns that she thought hideous . She had admired the oleanders ' waxy rose blossoms and the vivid green of their lance-shaped leaves , and she missed the fragrance which had delicately penetrated to the dining-room . But Nicholas seemed to have lost interest in flowers . By early December everyone had a more vital interest than thepI16 placing of shrubs . The anti-rent wars were gathering momentum . December the sixth was Saint Nicholas ' Day , and according to Dutch custom the time for giving and receiving presents . Several of the neighboring children had been invited to celebrate with Katrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huysmann , the pastor , with his wife and three solemn children , the Verplancks from Kinderhook with their brood , two Van Rensselaer grandchildren , and the little Dejongs from Stuyvesant . It was Nicholas himself who represented his name saint , not in the later convention of a jolly Santa Claus , but in the original conception of a fourth-century ecclesiastic . The blue satin robe stiff with embroidery , the gold miter and episcopal staff , had come from Holland , as had the traditional ceremony which Nicholas invested with an awe-inspiring solemnity . Though he produced no faggotsfor the punishment of naughty children , Katrine and the others  --  sat terrified while he lectured them on their sins in the prescribed manner . Even when he raised the crook high over his head and slashed open the muslin bag which released a clattering rain of sugar plums onto the floor , the children waited until he vanished through a side door before precipitating themselves on the candies . After they had sated themselves with the sugar plums , the double doors to the Italian drawing-room were thrown open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay a row of wooden sabots gilded at the tips . These sabots also waited from . year to year with the Saint 's costume in an attic room . On each one had been pasted a child 's name and they contained besides a wisp of hay  --  for Saint Nicholas ' horse  --  a quantity of small trinkets andtoys . ' There were no gifts for adults , New Year 's Day was the proper time for that ; and while the children examined their presents the elders gathered in the Green Room for gossip and refreshment . Miranda sat apart from the group in a chair designated by Johanna . The girl no longer resented these continual reminders of her inferior position , for since the day in Hudson she had felt a nervous desire to propitiate Johanna  --  an unreasonable desire , Miranda told herself , for had she not conclusively proved that there was no basis for guilt ?  --  still she now made constant efforts to please the mistress of Dragonwyck and had even taken to confining her ringlets in a net. pII7The general conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river families until Nicholas , dressed in his own clothes , joined the group . At once Dominie Huysmann turned his lean , apprehensive face to the patroon . ' Oh , mynheer , that was shocking about the canopy , ' he cried , his Adam 's apple working . ' I trust mynheer understands that I knew nothing about it . They 're ruffians . I think they 've gone mad ! ' Miranda looked at Nicholas . What was all this about the canopy ? She had no doubt that some new down-rent demonstrationwas referred to , and she soon heard the details . While she had been busy helping to fill the sabots , Johanna , Katrine , and Nicholas had that morning driven to the village church for the saint-day services . They found that the carved oaken canopy which covered the Van Ryn pew had been chopped down in the night . Splintered wood and mangled carvings littered the aisles . There had been a sign tacked on the pew door : ' Canopiesare for kings and we 'll have no kings here . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathetic audience . ' I assure you there were splinters on all the cushions . ' The Dominie listened respectfully to his patroness 's complaint , then turned back to Nicholas . ' But mynheer , the matter is getting desperate . What shall we do ? ' ' Do ? ' repeated Nicholas . His eyes rested on the pastor with detachedamusement . ' Why , we 'll build the canopy again tomorrow . I 've already given orders . I think this time it 'll be of black walnut , somewhat in the gothic manner but more delicate . And the Van Ryn arms shall be blazoned in sable and gules upon the front panel . ' Huysmann swallowed . ' It 'll make the tenants very angry . They  --  they might harm you , or  --  ' he squirmed , scarcely daring to link himself with the patroon but made bold by fear , ' or me and wy family . They know I 'm loyal to the manor . ' The ladies rustled and looked at each other anxiously . The Dominie 's wife bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom as though it were one of her children . Nicholas frowned . ' There is nothing to fear from my tenants . Nothing . Do you think we ca n't guide and control them as we have done this two hundred years ? This hysteria will pass as it has before . '  |p118The  Dominie , after a quick glance at his patron 's face , bowed his head . Yes mynheer . Doubtless you are right . ' The ladies subsided . After all , this was men 's business , and if , the Lord of Dragonwyck believed the matter unimportant it must be so . None of them had had any first-hand contact with the down-renters . Only Miranda was not so sure . She had the memory of the sullen meeting in Jeff Turner 's surgery , of the pitchfork rebounding from the carriage roof  --  and the pistol shot . CouldNicholas possibly be wrong ? Nicholas was not wrong in so far as the immediate outcome of the rebellion affected him personally . And no broader consideration interested him . That the events of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part and ignored until they were over  --  were eventually to mould his life he neither knew nor would have believed . The unrest in Columbia County culminated outside of DragonwyckManor on Van Rensselaer lands . On December 12 , in Copake , Sheriff Henry Miller and a deputy attempted to dispossess two farmers who were behind with the rent . They were met with violent opposition . The little doctor , Smith Boughton , disguised as Big Thunder , inflamed three hundred of his calico Indians with his oratory . They seized the sheriff and burned his legal papers in a tar barrel . After this they allowed the disconsolate officers to ride back to Hudson with jeers and the tooting of horns for accompaniment . By December eighteenth matters had come to a head . Big Thunder called a mass meeting at Smoky Hollow near Claverack . Nearly a thousand Indians gathered on the square before the tavern , a whooping , yelling mob in masks and gowns . This time there were many guns and the tavern 's cellar full of whiskey was raided . The combination produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to quiet his rioting Indians , a stray shot killed one of them  --  young Bill Rifenburg , a gentle boy from a near-by farm , the only son of a widowed mother . The suddenly hushed crowd flocked around the still figure on the ground gaping at the spreading stain of red on the calico shirt . Someone snatched off the boy 's fox-shaped mask . Jeff , not yet dis/guised , had been upstairs with Boughton . The two doctors exchanged a look of horror . ' That 's done it ! ' cried Jeff . See if you can quiet ' em down , while I do what I can for that boy . ' Big Thunder leaned over the balcony railing ; Jeff pelted down the stairs and knelt by the quiet body . There was nothing to be done . Jeff was still kneeling there wondering how to break the news to Mrs. Rifenburg , and bitterly regretting the tragedy and inevitable blow to their cause , when Sheriff Miller and five deputies galloped through the subdued crowd . ' So it 's murder too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking in the situation . Then seeing the figure up on the balcony he cried exultantly , ' Come , boys  --  we 've got Big Thunder at last ! ' With pistols cocked the officers rushed into the inn . They found Boughton flattened against the fireplace in the upper room , his mouth twisted with despair . For a few minutes he resisted arrest , exerting his slight strength and cursing . The six men hustled him downstairs and bundled him on a horse . Jeff watched helplessly . He could do nothing for his friend then , and a further brush with the law would damage them irreparably . The sheriff paid no attention to him . He had no warrant for Doctor Turner , whom he knew and liked , and he was in a hurry to get away from the dazed , silent mob before they turned threatening . He slapped the rump of the horse on which Boughton was tied : he and his men mounted swiftly and herded their prize down the road to Hudson . Jeff helped carry Bill Rifenburg to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow . Then , heartsick , he too returned to town . Big Thunder was in jail , but the authorities were nervous . The tooting of horns continued all that night from the near-by hills . The down-renters sent threats . They would release their leader by force . They would burn the town down . The Hudson Light Guards mobilized , the Albany Burgesses came down river to help . Finally as the panic grew a message was sent to New York City , and Captain Krack 's troop of German-American cavalry steamed up the Hudson on a chartered ship . Jeff stood on the doorstep of his house and watched the dashing troop prance from the dock along Front Street toward Warren.  |p120They  were preceded by a brass band whose martial din made eloquentaccompaniment to the splendor of gold epaulettes and braid , metal helmets with white plumes and gilded eagles , dangling scab- and glossy patent-leather boots . All this to subdue a handful of farmers in bedraggled shirts and one small imprisoned man . Jeff turned wearily and went back to his surgery . He sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rillah , the grizzled old colored woman who tended him , shuffled into the room and put a mug of mulled wine at his elbow . ' Drink dis here , massa , ' she said . ' Den you wo n't be so down in de mouf . ' ' What would I do without you , Rillah ? ' said Jeff . ' Sames you done befoh I come , but I ain ' gwine let you try , ' announced the old woman , wagging her turbaned head . She was an escaped slave from a Georgia plantation who had managed three years ago to reach this particular station on the underground railwayto Canada before collapsing with exhaustion and pneumonia . Jeff had cured her and she had attached herself firmly to him ever since . ' Now you stop studying ' bout dem pore farmers , ' she added , patting his shoulder . ' Dey time foh freedom comin ' someday just like niggahs ' time comin ' someday . Never did see such a man foh frettin ' ovah other people 's troubles . Quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug and smiled absently . He was used to her affectionate scoldings . No , the time is not yet ripe , he thought . Someday the farmers will surely win , but it ca n't be done with rioting and violence . We 're fighting for democracy and we must use the democratic system . Election 's the only way . We 'll put our own man in the Governor 's chair , fair and square . He sighed . That would take a lot of doing and in the meantime the Manor lords had won again . Boughton 's trial was postponed until March and Jeff had no hope of the outcome . Against the little doctor and his farmers would be all the power of wealth , prestige , and established fact . Jeff got up and putting on his hat and greatcoat walked out of the house toward the jail , where he intended to console his friend as best he could . As he forced his way through the crowded streets , jostling gaudy uniforms at every step , he thought of Nicholas Van Ryn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Damn him , ' said Jeff under his breath . He had a second of impotent hatred.  |p121The  Livingstons and the Van Rensselaers had finally bestirred themselves in the anti-rent war ; their complacency had been shaken , they had even been frightened . But not Nicholas , entrenchedin superiority , so sure that nothing could change the world which he had inherited , or threaten his own supremacy . I believe the man 's really dangerous , thought Jeff . God help the person who thwarts him , if indeed anything can pierce his armor . And he thought of Miranda . Affected little ninny ! Perversely clinging to that atmosphere of decadent luxury , pretending she was an aristocrat , openly worshiping the dark , unpredictable ruler , of Dragonwyck . Her wings would be badly singed before she got home where she belonged . Honest work , she needed , with those smooth white hands she was so obviously vain of , honest work and a simple , honest man to knock the nonsense out of her and give her a houseful of babies . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat on her bones , thought Jeff irritably . So preoccupied was he that after crossing First Street he bumped squarely into a soft body . There was an explosion of giggles and a pair of black eyes looked up into his . Mercy on us , Doctor Turner , thee need n't run a person down ! ' It was Faith Folger , her seductive figure clothed in Quaker gray , no cherry-colored ribbons today in the dark curls beneath the demurebonnet , because her mother had caught her before she left the house and inflicted severe chastisement . But Faith needed no ribbons to catch and hold the male eye . Even now while Jeff laughingly apologized for his clumsiness , two of the cavalrymen had drawn their horses to the curb and were ogling her hopefully . ' And what are you doing , my girl , running about in this mob of bawdy soldiers ? ' asked Jeff with a teasing inflection . Faith tossed her head , not neglecting a sidelong glance at the two cavalrymen . ' I 'm but going on an errand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pouting her lips and looking up at Jeff through her lashes . Jeff glanced at the red mouth , as he was meant to . He had several times stolen kisses from it and enjoyed the process immensely . Now , suddenly , Faith did not tempt him as she usually did . She seemed a bit lush and full-blown . ' Well , mind you do n't break any military hearts , ' he said lightly , and raised his hat.  |p122The  girl was startled . Will thee not escort me , Jeff ? ' she asked . Always he had been eager for her company . And though nothing definite had been said as yet , she knew that her family approved and she herself was more than willing to settle down as Mrs. Turner . ' I 'm mortal sorry that I ca n't now , ' said Jeff , who could have perfectly well . ' I 'm on my way to see poor Boughton . ' ' Oh , ' said the girl . She gave him a small , bewildered smile . For the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes cast down as a Quaker maiden should and ignored the two cavalrymen , who walked their horses on the street beside her making to each other loud complimentary comments on her charms . It had always been the Van Ryn custom to close Dragonwyck after New Year 's and embark with servants for New York and the town mansion on Stuyvesant Street . This year Nicholas vetoed the plan . ' But why not ? ' asked Johanna pettishly . ' This place is dreary enough in winter , and I ca n't see reason for owning a town house if we do n't use it . Besides , I 'm quite longing for the theater . ' It was evening and they were sitting in the Red Room . Johanna , having decided to make good use of Miranda 's proficiency with the needle , had loaded her with a great pile of new damask napkins to hem . The girl sat sewing in the far corner by the harpsichord in a small straight chair which had gradually , by an intangible ruling , become her only rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a dozen recent evenings in which Johanna yawned , read a word or two in a magazine , and yawned again while the gold-and-ormulu clock ticked off the minutes to bedtime , in that Nicholas was with them . Usually now he left them the instant dinner was over , and they heard his steps ascending the winding staircase to the tower . Unlesshe went to the pianoforte in the music room and played to himself , sometimes softly , sometimes with torrential chords and dissonances . But tonight he sat in a chair opposite his wife . This winter I prefer to remain at Dragonwyck , my love , ' he repeated . ' If you need new clothes you may send for a dressmaker to come here . ' Johanna 's big face puckered , she moistened her lips . ' But why , Nicholas ? I had made so many plans . '  |p123He  rose from his chair , walked around the center table , and smiling slightly stood looking down at his wife . Her red-slippered foot , which had been beating an irritable tattoo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be because of the rebellion . You said yourself that was all over now Boughton is imprisoned , ' she persisted , but her voice had grown fainter . And it 's damp here in the winter , I shall get one of my heavy colds  --  ' Nicholas made a hardly perceptible motion with one hand . ' That would be most unfortunate , my dear . You must take every precaution . But we 'll stay at Dragonwyck . ' Johanna shifted in her chair . Her eyes dropped under her husband'sgaze . For a moment Miranda felt sorry for her , an emotion immediately eclipsed by relief . The move to the city would certainly have resulted in her being sent back to Greenwich . They would hardly have included Miranda in the New York household too . Yet why do n't I want to go home ! she thought passionately . What is there that keeps me here ? She lifted her head and looked at Nicholas . The soft candlelight cast his shadow against the redpaperedwalls . He dominated the room as he dominated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head and looked at Miranda . Again the girl felt a little shock that in that dark face the eyes should be so light and vivid a blue . It was this anomaly that gave the curious effect of blankness , of shuttered windows which showed no sign of the life which moved inside . A chill passed over her , but with it a fascinated compulsion so strong that had he held out his arms to her she would have run to him , blindly forgetting Johanna and all decency . Instead he bent over and picking up Johanna 's handkerchief , which had fallen to the floor , restored it to her with a bow . ' Good night , ladies , ' he said softly . May you rest well . ' And he left them . For the remaining half-hour until Tompkins came in with wine and cakes the mistress of Dragonwyck sat silent in her chair , her eyes fixed on the handkerchief which lay where Nicholas had placed it on her lap . January and February passed swiftly for Miranda . The riverp124was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were no visitors . The days were outwardly monotonous , but she did not find them so . There was tension at Dragonwyck . A subtle sense of mounting expectancy which seemed to have no cause . Each morning she awoke to excitement which each quiet winter evening denied . There was no change , and yet the excitement recurred . In the middle of March there was a blizzard , and Johanna kept to her bed nursing one of the heavy colds which she had feared . The sounds of coughing and violent nose-blowing penetrated even through the shut door of the great bedchamber . Miranda , passing the door on her way to the schoolroom , saw Magda run in with a basin of mustard and water and a pitcher of steaming negus ; heard Johanna in a clogged voice demanding fretfully whether the butteredtoast were not ready yet . Even when she 's sick she thinks of nothing but eating , thought Miranda contemptuously , and passed downstairs to call Katrine for her lessons . The schoolroom was bright with a fire on the hearth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blew with diminishingforce . The two blonde heads , flaxen and amber gold , were bent together over a scrawled slate when the door opened . Nicholas walked in and the child 's round eyes repeated Miranda 's astonishment . How nice to see you  --  Cousin Nicholas , ' she stammered . ' We  --  I was just correcting Katrine 's sums . ' It was the first time he had ever entered the schoolroom . And her amazement was increased to see a trace of uncertainty in his manner . She felt that he had wanted to say something to her , but that now suddenly he had changed his mind . He walked over to the window , stood a moment staring out toward the gray river which was nearly hidden by eddies of snow . ' Is the child doing well ? ' he asked without interest . ' Oh , yes . She 's learning fast . She 's good at figures . I think she 's ready for a textbook on arithmetic . Perhaps we could send to the city  --  ? ' Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers whitened with pressure as she nervously clutched her slate pencil . He gave a short laugh.  |p125'Why  bother with a textbook ! A little addition and subtraction are enough for a girl . ' Still further bewildered by the bitterness in his tone , which seldom betrayed any emotion , Miranda said timidly , ' It  --  I suppose it must be disappointing that you have no son . ' A peculiar expression ran over Nicholas ' face . ' I do not brook disappointments , ' he said , and going to the fireplace held his hands out to the blaze . She colored . It had been presumptuous to mention such matters to him . But did he mean that he would not allow himself to feel disappointment over the failure of an heir to carry on the unbroken Van Ryn line , or did he mean that he and Johanna yet might  --  ? The pain that shot through her at this unfinished thought rushed her into speech . ' I think it 'll stop snowing soon ; I mean there seems to be a lightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Nicholas . ' Or the doctor will be delayed . ' ' Doctor ? ' she repeated blankly . ' Certainly , ' he answered with increased coldness . ' Mrs. Van Ryn is ill , and I have naturally sent for a doctor to attend her . ' The girl was hurt by his tone as well as by his saying ' Mrs. Van Ryn . ' It was as though he were deliberately putting her in her place . ' I did n't realize that Cousin  --  that Mrs. Van Ryn was that ill . ' Nicholas did not answer . He deserted the fire , walked with quick restless steps back to the window . He jerked together the heavy portieres , turned back into the room , and said to Katrine : ' When you are through with your lessons go to your mother . You pay her little enough attention . ' ' Yes , Papa , ' said the child . She hesitated , then overcame her awe of her father and asked , ' Will Doctor Hamilton let me play with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles ? ' Nicholas frowned . ' It wo n't be Hamilton who 's coming . I 've sent for Doctor Turner . ' Miranda raised her head quickly . Why ? she thought . Why that Turner , who is a boor and a down-renter ? There were other doctors available besides Hamilton . Jeff , in Hudson , when he opened his door to a stable boy in thepI26 Van Ryn livery and received the summons to Dragonwyck , had wondered the same thing . He had made a rueful face at the snowdriftsand thought of refusing . But curiosity had won , curiosity and a feeling of gratification . If Nicholas had so much faith in him as a doctor as to overlook their clash , he might well be generous too . Jeff saddled his horse , and lashing his carpetbag full of pills and instruments to the cantle , plodded away after his guide through the snow . It was dusk by the time Jeff reached Dragonwyck village . Lights from scattered windows looked warm and comforting . The parsonagein particular gave an impression of cosiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children were gathered around the lamp on the center table , which was covered with a cheerful red cloth . As Jeff 's tiring horse walked past the window he noticed many homely details , a moon clock on the mantel which chimed five times , an iron kettle steaming on the hob beside the fire . The pastor 's pinched face looked relaxed . He peered benevolently over his spectacles at his wife , who was mending a small pair of breeches while a sleepy baby leaned against her knee . It must be pleasant , thought Jeff , shivering in his greatcoat . A scene like this to come back to after long hours in the saddle . Instantlyhe pictured Faith in the place of Mrs. Huysmann ; the babies that would be with them were nebulous , but there was nothing vague about his reconstruction of another scene . Faith and himself upstairs in a billowing feather bed shut in against the world . Here there would be warmth and vitality and comfort . tTomorrow , he thought , I 'll ask her . The horse dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his snow-packed shoes rounded the bend before Dragonwyck . In the twilight the great pile of stone looked gigantic as its turrets and gables loomed against the dark sky . The portieres had all been drawn and no light showed . Here there was neither warmth , vitality , nor comfort . It 's evil and unhealthy , this place , thought Jeff . It belongs to a dying age . Though he was the most practical of men , Jeff had an instinct of repulsion so strong that he very nearly turned his horse before they reached the porte-cochere . He could ask for shelter at the parsonageor at one of the farmhouses  --  and give what excuse forp127having covered all those miles to no purpose ? thought Jeff , angry with himself . Ridiculous fancies , my lad . Besides , there was a sick person inside who needed him , and this call Jeff would never deny . He banged the silver door-knocker . At once the door was opened by Tompkins . Good evening sir . I fear you 've had a nasty ride . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew on his fingers and advanced to the farther end of the long hall , where there was a fire . Firelight and candlelight did little to relieve the effect of luxurious gloom . Jeff pulled up his coat tails and tried to warm his chilled legs . I hope Mrs. Van Ryn 's not very ill , ' he said . How 's she feeling now ? ' Better , I think , sir . But my lord has been anxious for you to come . He 's always so solicitous for his lady 's health . ' Is he indeed ? thought Jeff . He could n't picture Nicholas as a solicitous husband . But he might be wrong . With unusual humility Jeff admitted to himself that he did n't understand these people . Tompkins ushered him upstairs and Magda received him at her mistress ' room door . Johanna greeted him sulkily . ' I ca n't think why Mr. Van Ryn did n't call Doctor Hamilton as usual . ' She held out a fat hand , which she withdrew at once , letting it fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , ma'am , ' he said with some embarrassment . But I 'll do my best to cure you . ' And he proceeded to make a thorough examination , undeterred by Johanna 's grudging co-operation , or by Magda 's disapproving eyes . Except for the heavy cold there was nothing wrong with Johanna . Considering the vast bulk through which it was required to pump blood , even her heart was in good condition . Nothing to worry about , ma'am , ' he told her cheerfully . ' Take these drops three times a day , and a bit of scraped onion in sugar for the cough . You 'll soon feel right . One thing more , though  --  ' said Jeff , seeing a sodden pile of nibbled sweetmeats on the bedside table . The diet should be light for a few days . Gruels and tea , a boiled egg or so . Nothing more . ' He was dumfounded at the anger which transformed her face . What nonsense ! ' she cried . Everyone knows one should stuff a cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , ' said Jeff temperately , you wo n't lose strength in a day or two in bed , and it 's wise to rest the digestion . ' He felt inclined to laugh at the violence of her reaction to his simple directions . Johanna 's mouth set stubbornly . ' I shall eat as I please , ' she said . ' Magda , be sure they are making that tipsy cake I ordered , I 'm longing for it . ' Her little eyes threw Jeff a look of defiance . Jeff shrugged his shoulders . He had an inkling of the true state of affairs . Eating was to her the greatest sensual satisfaction . Baulked of other passions , she had gradually poured all her desires into one channel . It 's a form of lust , he thought with pitying distaste , and in itself a disease . ' Your cold will mend faster without the tipsy cake , ' he said . ' But it will mend anyway . ' This was a fool 's errand he had come on , and he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of really sick people who might need him . He cast around for some remark with which to close the fruitless interview . His eyes roamed over the frowsy room , lighting on the most attractive thing in it . ' What superb flowers ! ' he said pleasantly , pointing toward a low shrub which stood in a cloisonne pot upon the large table . The blossoms , which grew thick as red stars amongst the long green leaves , gave forth an agreeable fragrance . The anger faded from Johanna 's eyes . ' It 's one of Mr. Van Ryn 's Persian oleanders , ' she said slowly . ' He had it brought here today to brighten the sickroom . It is pretty , is n't it ! ' She spoke in a curiously strained voice . Evidently the patroon did not often trouble himself to bring his wife flowers , thought Jeff , and in truth , were I married to this lump of suet , I would n't either . He smiled vaguely , agreed that the shrub was pretty , and retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was standing at her own door . The girl gave him a cold nod and a resentful glance from the corner of her long beautiful eyes . In the green dress trimmed with cream lace at the throat and with her lightly poised head and undulating walk she put him in mind of a valley lily . He returned the nod as coldly , annoyed by her continued hostility . A hostility not shared by Nicholas , he discovered when his hostp129came forward to greet him downstairs . The patroon was at his most charming . He listened attentively to Jeff 's account of his wife 's health , saying at the end : ' Yes , I 'm sure you 're right . The cold is already breaking up , but it 's well to be sure that the lungs are not affected nor any sudden complication threatened . Do n't you think so , sir ? ' Jeff agreed and added brief mention of his efforts to reduce Mrs. Van Ryn 's diet . ' Did she agree to that ? ' asked Nicholas . ' Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She ordered a tipsy cake instead . ' There was a short pause , then Nicholas said , ' Ah , yes , I fear my wife is very much given to the pleasures of the table , ' and he smiled indulgently . The smile and the tone were just that  --  indulgent , the half-pitying , half-amused attitude one has toward a wayward child . Natural enough , and yet deep in Jeff there was a little psychic tremor , a faint unease . He looked sharply at his host and the tremor disappeared . The smile on Nicholas ' handsome face seemed genuine . His startling blue eyes expressed nothing but courteous interest in his guest . Jeff enjoyed that evening . A guest room had been prepared for him and Nicholas overruled his objections to spending the night . It would have been folly to set off on the long ride back at that hour . Miranda joined them at supper , and though at first the girl was very quiet and constrained she gradually responded to Nicholas ' conversational brilliance as Jeff did . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night around the damask-covered table . He told them stories of his travels in Europe , using rich and vivid words so that they saw the castle on the Rhine where he had met the mad countess , or the dingy alleywayin Florence where his purse had been stolen . He spoke of events nearer home , the coming of the Croton water to New York two years ago , when the populace went mad over the fifty-foot fountains of free water which gushed from the new-laid pipes . Or he told them of the theater , the delirious night when the divine Fanny Elssler mislaid her ballet slippers and danced ' La Tarantule ' in her stocking feet to the accompaniment of a pelting of roses and love notes from the ecstatic audience.  | But Nicholas did more than simply dazzle those two who knew nothing of Europe or the theater . It was in no sense a monologue . Using that most subtle of all flatteries he constantly included them and their opinions . He described the divine Fanny 's costume and appearance . She wore white , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better suited her brunette beauty . What do you think , Miranda ? ' Or to Jeff when telling of strange customs or food he would ask , ' How does that seem to , you from the medical side ? ' and in each case listened intently to the answer . They were at once stimulated and relaxed . They were scarcely conscious of each other , both concentrated on their host . It was nine o'clock when he rose from the table and Miranda , seeing that the evening was ending , gave a sigh of disappointment which Jeff inwardly echoed . Nicholas had made him feel important and brilliant , and Jeff was too human not to have enjoyed it . I 'm going up now to see Mrs. Van Ryn , ' said Nicholas . Jeff uncrossed his legs . ' Shall I have another look at her ? ' he asked without much enthusiasm . ' No . I 'll call you if I think there 's a reason , ' and Nicholas left the room . Miranda 's eyes followed him . ' Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must admit that he can be very charming . ' She blushed , bringing a bemused gaze to his face . You do see it now , do n't you ? ' she said . How wonderful he is  --  and  --  ' ' Never mind , ' said Jeff crossly . Though he felt more admiration for Nicholas than he had ever expected to , he did n't relish that look in the girl 's eyes . ' I ca n't think why you always treat me like a child ! ' she cried indignantly . Jeff pushed his chair back . ' I 'll spare you the obvious answer . ' As she flounced from the room , he thought that it would be a great satisfaction to spank her . His palm tingled . He went upstairs to his bedroom , took off his coat , and put on the dressing-gown which he found laid out for him . It was of yellow brocaded satin with velvet reveres . He fastened it gingerly and looking at himself in the great pier glass burst into laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ridiculous inp131that elegant garment . ' Fine feathers 'll never make a fine bird out of you , my lad , ' he said , and sat down by the fire to wait in case Nicholas summoned him . An hour passed and nothing happened , so he clambered into bed . Miranda too had gone upstairs , her mind filled with irritation at Jeff . When she reached the landing she turned and went down the hall to Katrine 's room meaning to say good night to the child , though nearly certain that she would be asleep . She opened the door and peered in . The night light burned by the bed and she was surprised to see Katrine sitting bolt upright , her eyes wide open . Why are n't you asleep , dear ? ' chided Miranda . ' I ca n't , ' said the child . There 's so much noise downstairs . ' Noise ? ' Miranda smoothed the pillow and straightened the bedclothes . ' There is n't any noise , pet . You 've been dreaming . ' The round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The piano 's going and going . And some lady keeps laughing , high and clear . ' Miranda listened a moment . There was no sound but the drip of melting snow from the eaves . She shook her head . ' Lie down , dear . You must n't make up stories . ' The child pushed her away . You 're being mean , M'randa . I hear it just as plain . You listen in the hall . ' To humor her , Miranda opened the door . So far from being noisy the house seemed unusually quiet . There were no servants about ; all the bedroom doors were tight shut . She wondered unhappilyif Nicholas were still in there with Johanna behind the big door at the end . There was the faint guttering of a spent candle , but no other noise of any sort . The stillness was heavy , pressed down . ' Now you hear it , do n't you ? ' cried the child . ' The laughing 's so loud , except it does n't sound like happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Room . ' And suddenly as though a hidden water gate had burst , fear drenched the child . It 's Azilde , ' she moaned . ' It 's what Zelie said . The piano and the laughing . Make it stop  --  please , please make it stop . ' Her eyes were black with terror . Miranda seized the little shoulders and shook them . ' Listen , Katrine  --  ' she cried , trying to penetrate through the panic . ' Therep132is n't anything . I do n't hear anything . Zelie 's a stupid old woman and you must n't believe her crazy stories . ' The child held her breath , listening . In spite of herself Miranda listened too while an icy prickle ran up into her scalp . There was still no sound of any kind . The child lay back with an exhausted sigh . ' It 's stopped now , ' she said . ' Nor ever started . ' Miranda 's voice was sharp , but Katrine did not listen . Her eyelids fell , her stormy breathing gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda went back to her own room , annoyed with herself becauseof a desire to run through the hall and tug at her bell pull to summon anybody who would come and talk to her for a moment . Utter nonsense , she told herself . I did n't hear anything , nobody else heard anything . Its only the fancy of an excited child . After a while she became calmer , but not calm enough for sleep . She lay on top of the bed in her white dressing-gown and watched the dying fire . Repeatedly she pushed away the thought of that soulless laughter the child imagined she had heard , and replaced it with memories of Nicholas ' fascinating talk . ' Lake Como , ' she said the little name to herself lingeringly . He had described a marble palace amongst cypress trees , had made her feel that she was there with him listening to the lap of the water , the singing of a nightingale , the love serenade of a boatman on the lake . Piangi , piangi f anciulla , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known that he could sing . She raised her arms above her head and stretched . She was at last becoming sleepy . She thrust her feet into the bedclothes , then drew them out again and sat up , wide awake . There was the stamp of running footsteps in the hall , a murmur of voices , then thunderousknocks on a distant door . She put on her slippers and went out into the hall . Servants were distractedly running about with candles . Magda stood wringing her hands , her shrewish face gray . Under her directions a footman was banging on Jeff 's door , who that moment appeared . ' What is it ? ' he asked , calmly alert , though his speech was thick with sleep . ' Mevrouw is taken bad ! ' cried Magda . ' Hurry , sir . ' Jeff picked up his bag , pulled the magnificent dressing-gownpI 3 3close around his nightshirt , and went to Johanna 's room . Miranda followed . There was a horrible noise in the room , the sound of retching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapeless figure threw itself backward and forward in a monotonous , mechanical way . Jeff stood for a moment appalled , then he groped for the pulse , which was terrifyingly slow and irregular ; the flesh beneath his fingers was clammy as an eel . ' What 's happened ? ' he said sharply to Magda , who stood moaningbeside the bed . The woman 's fright had conquered her resentmentof the new doctor . ' It began sudden , near an hour ago . Vomiting and purging . I thought it would pass . ' ' Did she eat that ? ' asked Jeff . On the table by the bed were the remains of an enormous tipsy cake , its moist crumbling sweetness soaked in sherry and filled with preserved fruits . A silver nutmeg mill stood beside it . Johanna was fond of nutmeg . The maid nodded . ' She ate a lot of it . Mr. Van Ryn asked her not to , but her heart was set on it . ' ' Where is Mr. Van Ryn ? ' snapped Jeff . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia spirits to help the flaggingheart , but she could not retain the draught . He put hot cloths on her head and distended abdomen , but she knocked them off . ' He 's up in the tower ; I sent for him . ' Acute indigestion ? thought Jeff swiftly . Inflammation of the bowels ? The cake would explain it , all that rich stuff taken into a depleted system . And yet he was n't satisfied . Johanna 's rolling pupils were distended so that her eyes appeared to be not blue but black . Some drugs do that , thought Jeff . ' Has she had any medicine of any kind ? ' he asked Magda . The maid shook her head . ' Nothing , sir , except those drops you gave her . ' The drops were a harmless little carminative . ' What has she eaten since I saw her last ? Think , be careful . ' ' Nothing but the tipsy cake . ' Jeff went on working grimly , but while the retching grew less , the pulse also got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that Nicholas would be there any moment and that he must hurry with the question which he did n't want to ask and had not time to phrase properly.  | Did Mr. Van Ryn give her anything at all ? ' The maid shook her head . ' I was in the room all the time putting things away . He handed her the cake when she asked for it , that 's all . ' I 'm a fool , thought Jeff , frantically chafing the fat , chilling arms . Nicholas strode in , pushing past Miranda , who stood paralyzed by the door . He went up to his wife and she seemed to feel his presence . Her eyes focused painfully and her swollen lips moved . Her breathing became shallow and gasping . What is it ? ' cried Nicholas , turning a white face to Jeff , who made a hopeless gesture . ' Acute indigestion . I fear the heart is failing , ' he whispered . He piled blankets on her , he had fresh warming pans brought . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood as though dazed , motionless . Twenty minutes later , Johanna ceased to breathe at all . Magda gave a scream and rushed sobbing from the room . Jeff drew the sheet up over the staring eyes and sank into a chair profoundly shamed and miserable . He had been here all the time , somehow he should have been able to save her . Had he missed some symptom in his examination this afternoon ? There might have been disease he had not discovered . And I was so cocksure , he thought bitterly . Nicholas turned from the bed , moving as though awakened from sleep . Her foul gluttony has killed her , ' he said . There was no emotionin his voice except a faint sadness . It was a statement of fact . Nor was it until the next day that it struck Jeff as a strangely unfeel-11ing remark , for it was what he had been thinking himself . Nicholas walked to the door and saw the frightened girl . ' Go to bed , Miranda , ' he said . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of approaching that room the events had had the unreality of nightmare . She was stupefied . She obeyed Nicholas and walked back to her room like a somnambulist . The patroon , going out into the hall , called the awed servants together and gave instructions . Jeff raising his head saw that he was alone in the room with the 5sheeted figure . Scarcely knowing why he did it , he broke off a piece of the tipsy cake and wrapping it in the napkin , stuffed it in his pocket . Then he picked up his bag and prepared to leave that dismal room . On his way he passed the little oleander bush . He remembered Johanna 's apparent pride in it . Poor woman , he thought , there has been mighty little pity or tenderness about her passing . Soon , as he left the manor behind him he heard , as did everyone else in Dragonwyck , the tolling of the village church bell . Dong , Dong , Dong , clanged the great iron clapper . Thirty-four times , one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SECOND DAY AFTER JOHANNA 'S death Dragonwyck teemed with strangers . Coach after coach , the curtains drawn down , rolled up to the black-wreathed door to dischargethe Van Tappen relatives from Greenbush , from Albany and Watervliet . The halls and stairs resounded with the shuffling of countless feet as friends , tradesmen , tenants  --  anybody who felt the wish to do so  --  mounted to the bedroom and paid their last respects to the Lady of the Manor . She lay there in state upon the ancestral bed between two burningtapers , a black velvet pall covering all but her face . There were flowers enough now in Johanna 's room , masses of white tuberoses and lilies to replace the oleander . Messengers from Hudson had brought bolts of black materials for which all the drapers had been ransacked . Magda and the maids sewed furiously . By four o'clock Miranda had completed her own dress . The untrimmedblack gave her a vivid distinction , but for once she had no interest in her appearance . She was numb with horror and unbelief . It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't happen like that so quickly . She did n't seem very sick . The girl had not left her room since Nicholas ordered her into it . Her food had been brought up to her on trays , and Magda , who had assumed control of the household since the patroon had locked himself into his room as a bereaved husband should , made it clear that Miranda would not be welcome downstairs amongst the Van Tappens . But the great bedroom at the end of the hall drew Miranda with a morbid fascination . At dusk she crept out and joined a group of strangers who were murmuring in shocked undertonesbefore Johanna 's door . She walked with them into the silent room and took her turn at filing past the bed.  |p137That  's not Johanna ! she thought appalled . For on the still , waxen features there lay a quiet dignity that had never been there in life . The grossness had gone ; it seemed in the soft light of the tapers that the actual flesh had been purified . And the bloodless lips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an involuntary sound ; heads turned and stared at her curiously . Controlling herself with effort she hurried back to her own room . Where had it come from , that dignity , that look of power which transformed the face she had never thought showed anything but discontent and greed ? Could it be that deep hidden in Johanna there had been qualities never realized , never guessed ? And that smile  --  as though in death she had discovered a secret and triumphantillumination . Had Johanna really been like that  --  or was it only a trick of the great magician , an accidental part of the ultimate mystery ? I wish I had n't hated her so , thought the girl ; and suddenly tears ran down her face . For she had n't known until that moment how much she had hated Johanna . It was Magda who brought Miranda 's supper tray and flung it on the table . ' You 'll be leaving , of course , after the funeral , ' said the woman rudely . Miranda swallowed . ' I suppose so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . She could n't stay here alone with Nicholas . Nicholas ! The girl clasped her hands tight and walked over to the window , hiding her face from the maid 's spiteful glare . When the woman had gone , Miranda pushed the tray away untouched . Nicholas was immeasurably farther away from her after this tragedy than he had ever been . For him , too , his wife in death must have assumed a strange new importance . How much sorrow and loss he felt , she was n't sure . She had never been sure what Nicholas felt for Johanna . And yet she was his wife  --  the mother of his child  --  he must feel it terribly . And Miranda buried her face on her arms . After a while she undressed and went to bed , exhausted by the previous night 's sleeplessness . At midnight the house was quiet . No more footsteps shuffled down the hall . The Van Tappens had long since retired . Miranda slept heavily so that she did not waken when the door opened andp138shut again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Nicholas looking down at her . She lay mute , her beautiful eyes staring and still clouded with sleep . He put his candle on the table , came back by the bed . She saw the black mourning band on his arm and could not look past it , nor raise her gaze to his face . ' Miranda ! ' he said . Look at me . ' Slowly , she obeyed him , dragging her eyes upward from the black band . He drew a harsh breath . With one violent motion he a jerked her up against him . He kissed her savagely , and against her . shrinking breasts she felt the pounding of his heart . ' No , no  --  ' she whispered , terrified , struggling to push him back . He raised his head , withdrawing his arms so that she fell back against the pillows . He stood up , gave a short laugh . If I wished " Yes , " do you think your silly " No , No " would stop me ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His tigerish ferocity had frightened her , but now that he stood apart from her , again cool and controlled , her eyes filled and she looked at him with pleading . Get up and put on your dressing-gown , ' he said . While she did so , he turned his back , went over to the fire and poked up its dying embers . When she was ready she went to him , stood tall and slender in her white robe , her hair pushed childishly back behind her ears and cascading down about her shoulders . He reached forward and took her left hand . She watched uncomprehendingwhile he pushed a massive ring onto her third finger . She stared at the ring . It was . of old gold made into the likeness of two tiny hands with diamond tips which clasped a dark red carbuncle roughly heart-shaped . ' It 's the Van Ryn betrothal ring , ' he said . She lifted her bewildered gaze from the ring to his face . ' I  --  I do n't understand . ' ' Ah , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An incredulous joy leaped in her and died . She drew back . For not fifty feet away lay that still sheeted figure smiling the strange little smile . ' Johanna , ' she whispered . Nicholas ' eyes hardened . In the moment of silence she heard the unhurried ticking of the clock on the mantel , a dog barked somewhere out by the stables.  |p139'She  never wore the ring , ' he said . ' Her finger was too thick . ' Thank God , she thought in confusion , it must be all right , then . Of course it 's all right if she never wore it . ' You will do exactly as I say , ' said Nicholas . The dark red stone on her finger glowed in the firelight , the tiny diamonds sparkled . ' Yes  --  oh yes , ' she whispered . ' Always . ' ' Hide the ring . Mention it to no one . Friday you will go home . In exactly twelve months I shall claim you . ' ' Twelve months  --  ' she repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' But Nicholas , ' she cried , clasping her hands and looking at him in despair , ' I ca n't believe  --  I never hoped or thought  --  Do you really love me  --  you have n't said so  --  ' Nicholas smiled . He put his hands on her shoulders . ' I 've asked you to share my name . Tender speeches are for schoolboys . Live for the future , Miranda  --  as I shall . ' He bent and kissed her swiftly . Then he was gone , and the girl alone by the fire sat staring as though hypnotized at the betrothal ring . At the same moment in Hudson , Jeff in his locked surgery , the curtains carefully drawn , finished the last of the experiments he had been making . He had no book on toxicology , but had found some pertinent data in one of his pharmacological textbooks . On a plate before him lay a few crumbs , all that remained of the specimen of cake he had abstracted from Dragonwyck . The rest he had examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have shown up any tiny grains of white or gray powder . There were none . Following the directions in his book he had burned a portion of the cake in a retort , and on still another piece had poured certain chemicals . All the results were negative . Now with a sudden revulsion of feeling he picked up the plate and shied it into his stone sink , where it smashed to splinters . I ought to be ashamed of myself , he thought . My suspicions are nothing but childish pique that my medical knowledge was at fault and I lost a patient . He shut the textbook and put it back on the shelf to accumulate dust . He tidied up the surgery and went to bed , resolving never to think of the matter again.  |p140JOHANNA  WAS BURIED WITH ALL THE POMP BEfittingher station . There were the twelve pallbearers  --  Livingstons , Van Rensselaers , Schuylers , and Van Tappens  --  to head the funeral procession . Each had a small white satin pillow to support his share of the coffin 's weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was covered with the traditional dood kleed ' of black wool from which hung fifty silken tassels which swayed with the bearers ' labored tread . Behind the coffin walked Nicholas alone in his black silk suit , his face expressionless , his eyes on the ground . Katrine followed with her mother 's relatives . Miranda found herself relegated to a position barely ahead of the servants . It took half an hour to cover the half-mile to the church , and by that time the pallbearers ' faces were running with sweat . Of the funeral service Miranda heard nothing , for as she seated herself in the corner of the back pew assigned to her she was aware that someone was staring at her . She turned and encountered Zelie 's eyes . The old woman 's fixed gaze was both knowing and malicious . She nodded her head once , and her shriveled mouth widened in a melancholy smile . The girl 's hand flew to her bodice and touched the outline of the hidden ring . And at once anger at her own folly jerked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ! She did not turn again , but the service was over and Johanna 's coffin carried to its final resting place in the churchyard before Miranda was sufficiently composed to pay attention . The rest of the day passed in the traditional ceremonials . The black-draped dining table was loaded with elaborate side dishes besides the baron of beef , the roast hindquarters of a lamb and a baked carp . To these the company did full though solemn justice , aided by copious draughts of wine and punch.  |p141Nicholas  presented to each of the pallbearers a ' monkey spoon , ' a small trinket of carved silver with a tiny figure on the handle , supposedto represent one of the twelve Apostles . Nicholas gave each spoon with a courteous murmur of thanks , and everyone thought him the model of dignified sorrow . ' Poor , poor man , ' murmured Mrs. Henry Van Rensselaer , resting her knife and fork and looking at him with sympathetic admiration . So young to be bereaved  --  and so handsome . ' Her thoughts turned to her four unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that . She picked up her knife and fork again . Miranda took no part in these proceedings . No one invited her to do so . She stayed alone in her room . And the next morning she started on her journey home . The river being still closed to boats , Nicholas sent her in the light coach with Dick , the second coachman , to drive , and Greta , a middle-aged chambermaid , to chaperone her . They would have to spend two nights on the road , the first at the Beekman Arms in Rhinebeck , the second in Peekskill ; and a young lady could not stay alone in an inn . There was a dismal feeling of indifference , almost of disgrace , about Miranda 's hurried departure at seven in the morning . She went to Katrine 's room to say good-bye , but the child was sleepy and unresponsive ; all her interest was centered on the projected visit to Aunt Van Tappen in Albany . Far worse than Katrine 's indifferencewas Nicholas ' absence . The girl had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had no chance for a private word . But he did not . Greta , plump and stolid in black alpaca , already waited in the coach ; Miranda 's parcels and new trunk filled with the clothes she had acquired at Dragonwyck were neatly lashed on top . Dick 's red face was impatient and the horses snorted and stamped , anxious to be off into the chilly spring morning . There was nothing to do but get in . The heavy door slammed and the coachman cracked his whip . Miranda pressed her face to the window pane and looked her last at Dragonwyck . Its tower and gables shone bright as brass in the rays of the rising sun . Desolationseized her and the image of the great house dissolved in a mist of tears . Her hand crept to the ring in an effort at reassurance which waspI42becoming habitual , and she sank back on the seat trying to hide her face from Greta . The woman opened a string bag and drew out a letter , which she tendered Miranda . ' Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you after we leave . ' Her stupid face showed no curiosity . She was a good , obedient servant , incapable of initiative or speculation . It was for this reason that Nicholas had picked her to accompany Miranda . The girl 's heart beat fast as she opened the letter . It said : I regret very much not bidding you farewell . It 's better not , and there is that between us that needs no words to express . Already one day of the appointed time has passed , my dear one .  --  N.Forgetting discretion , Miranda pressed the note to her lips , then looked nervously at the silent Greta wondering if she had been observed . But the woman had gone to sleep . Miranda tucked the letter in her bodice next the ring . Her desolation was forgotten . A year was not so very long to wait . I 'll be so good , she thought ; I 'll study and improve my mind so as to be worthy of him . Then there was much to be done , dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not come to him empty-handed . She suppressed the disquietingthought that all this preparation would be hard in view of Nicholas ' command to ' tell no one . ' She would manage somehow . With each mile that separated her from Dragonwyck the horror and gloom of the last few days dimmed . Her relationship to Nicholas changed and became as she wanted it to be . He loved her and she loved him and soon they would be married  --  the natural termination of any romance . She shut her memory against Johanna , as against Nicholas ' black and inexplicable moods . One must never look back , she thought blithely , feeling mature and philosophical . Its only the future that matters . Just as Nicholas said . The coach was passing through Hudson when she reached this conclusion and she thought briefly of Jeff Turner . Even the thought of him had the power to make her uncomfortable , and resentment rose in her . But soon they left behind the town of brick houses and church spires . The horses trotted vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances of ad/miration for her equipage  --  the smart liveried coachman on the box , the matched bays with their jingling silver harness , the impeccablemaid beside her . Miranda held her chin high . After noon on the third day they passed through Bedford Village and continued down the North Way . In a few more miles Miranda recognized landmarks near home . She welcomed these with eagernessand her long submerged yearning for her mother at last claimed her . When they reached Stanwich she leaned forward hanging out the window , excitedly directing the coachman and straining her eyes for the first glimpse of the farm . Still when at last she saw the square white frame house beneath the elm trees , she was dismayed . It was so small , so insignificant . And in the yard before the kitchen door stood the farm wagon steaming with a load of manure which Tom and her father were pitching from a pile by the stable . Both men looked up as they heard the carriage approach : she saw that they were unshaven , sweating , and dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she found her voice . ' Turn here , ' she called to the box in a small , defiantvoice . ' This is where I live . ' She suffered under the man 's stare of astonishment . He pulled up the horses and guided them through the narrow gate . Greta , stolid as ever , glanced at the farm with incurious eyes . The coach stopped just short of the manure pile , and Dick , opening the door for Miranda , waited respectfully , hat in hand . Tom and Ephraim stood transfixed , then the boy 's jaw dropped . ' Gosh almighty , Pa . It 's Ranny ! ' he cried . Ephraim recovered from his surprise and his bearded face set in disapproval . ' So I see . ' He advanced to the girl , who stood nervously on the carriage step , unwilling to risk her delicate kid slippers in the barnyard muck . ' Well , miss , ' said her father , ' did your fine folks get tired of you and pack you back again ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushing . Though she was not particularlyglad to see , her father she had expected a warmer welcome . ' Mrs. Van Ryn died last Monday , and of course I came home . There was no time to write . ' ' Indeed , ' said Ephraim , wiping his hands on a spotted red handkerchief . ' I 'm sorry to hear of the poor lady 's passing , but we 're all mortal and the Lord strikes where He will . Home is the place for you and always has been . Stop swaying on that step like a chicken with the pip . You 'll find your ma around to the back in the herb garden . She 'll likely be glad to see you . ' Thus commanded , Miranda gathered up her silk skirts and descendedgingerly . Ephraim turned to his son . Tom , I reckon we can find room to stable these horses , but the coach 'll have to stay outside . As for you , ' he paused , having just discovered Greta inside , and clearly not knowing what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook you up some supper , we 'll find you beds somewhere . ' ' Oh , no , Pa ! ' Miranda cried again in embarrassment . She saw the twinkle in the coachman 's eyes at the thought of her cooking him up some supper . She who at Dragonwyck had always been served by a dozen hands . ' Mr. Van Ryn has made arrangements for them to return at once . They 'll spend tonight on the road . Good-bye , ' she added quickly to the servants . ' Thank you very much . My brother 'll help you get my trunk off . ' And she fled around the corner of the house . She saw a thin figure in an old gray sunbonnet stooping over the herb patch , and forgetting her shoes and skirts she flew with a cry of joy . ' Ma , dear ! Oh , Ma , I 'm so glad to see you ! ' Abigail straightened and was startled out of her Yankee reserve by the sight of the slender fashionable figure . She opened her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Miranda a period of difficult adjustment . Nearly a year had passed since she left them . Home had not changed , but she had  --  immeasurably ; and except for Abigail , her family that first evening appeared to her as rather uncouth strangers . The baby did not know her , and screamed with terror at the scented and ringleted lady in rustling green silk . All three of her brothers eyed her in wary embarrassment after a stiff greeting . Tabitha , flushed from tending the oven , her apron awry , cried , My land , Ranny ! I 'd never have known you , ' and the sisters exchanged a brief kiss . But there was no warmth in Tibby 's greeting , either . Her scrutiny of Miranda mingled envious resentmentwith disapproval . Silk dress , low-cut bosom , lace , kid slippers  --  and she 's got powder on her face , thought Tabitha , horrified.  |p145She  tightened her lips , and while they all sat down to supper around the kitchen table , she glanced at her father , sure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Ephraim disappoint her . When he had finished grace , he rested his carving knife and fork on the home-cured ham hock before him , and surveyed Miranda . ' You aiming to do the dishes in that ridiculous rig ? ' he inquired . Tabitha giggled , and the smaller boys nudged each other . Before Miranda could answer , her mother leaned forward and said quickly : ' It 's just for tonight , Ephraim . Ranny was tired from the traveling . She 'll get into the hang of things tomorrow again . ' Ephraim grunted . ' She 'd better . I 'll have no idle , furbelowed , fiddle-dee-dee girls around here . ' He picked up the carving knife , and said no more . The family , who were braced for a protracted lecture , settled in some surprise to their food . Miranda 's appearance discomfited her father . He could not help but see that the girl had grown extraordinarily pretty , and that in both her dress and her manner she now resembled the fine ladies he had seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival this afternoon , the blazoned coach , the two servants , the sleek horses in their silver harness . Mr. Van Ryn must have thought a lot of the girl to provide her with such state . But now she was home again , any high-faluting nonsense she had learned must be knocked out of her . He helped himself to fried potatoes and shoved the dish toward Abigail . Miranda toyed with her food . She was not hungry and the salty ham , greasy potatoes , and even Tabitha 's fresh bread cut into thick slabs were unappetizing to a palate used to Dragonwyck 's sophisticatedcooking . She noticed things that had never bothered her before . Had the boys always gulped like that , and wiped their mouths on the back of their hands ? And after Nicholas ' chivalrous politeness , it was disconcerting to see that her mother and sister must wait for each dish until the hungry males had helped themselves . Being at home again was like settling slowly down into the narrowend of a funnel . Everything oppressed her : the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her absence Ephraim had finished the New Testament and was back into Deuteronomy  --  the eight o'clock bedtime , the sharing of her bed with Tabitha. pI46 ' It wo n't be for long , ' snapped Tabitha , seeing the look of dismaywhich Miranda cast at the bed that seemed to her incredibly narrow . ' Soon you 'll have it all to yourself . ' Miranda examined her sister 's plump , triumphant face . ' Why  --  what do you mean , Tibby ? ' ' Ob and I are being married next month , ' said the younger girl , thinking : and that 's more than you 'll be , for all your fancy clothes and that you 're two years older . Miranda sat down on the bed , remembering Obadiah 's broad face , his little stutter , his thick hands . ' Are you in love with him , Tibby ? ' she asked gravely . The other girl nodded , embarrassed . One did n't speak of love right out like that , but Ranny had always been queer . ' Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda , her voice not quite steady . Nicholas  --  she thought with a paroxysm of longing . The year now stretched forward an eon . Will it ever be ' next month ' for me , too  --  She longed to tell Tabitha , just for the pleasure of speaking his name . But she knew that she must not . The ring was safely concealed beneath the high-necked nightgown . ' I have two silk dresses , ' she went on quickly . ' Choose either one you want , Tibby , and I 'll make it over to fit you . ' ' Oh , Ranny , thank you ! ' cried her sister , overcome . ' That 's real sweet of you . You always were much cleverer with the needle than me , ' she added , determined to be generous too . She dropped most of her touchiness as she discovered that Miranda did not mean to patronize her . And that far from having to listen to long accounts of the glories and refinements of Dragonwyck , Miranda did not want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tibby 's description of Ob 's virtues , and the three-room cottage which was being built on a corner of the Brown farm for the young couple . ' Parlor , kitchen , and bedroom  --  and the parlor papered , ' whispered Tabitha exultantly to the quiet figure beside her in bed . ' Of course later  --  the house wo n't be big enough , ' she added , blushinginto the dark . ' Ob said  --  said he hoped we 'd have to add more space every year . Was n't that awful of him ! ' ' Shocking , ' agreed Miranda . She tried to picture Nicholas and herself in a three-room cottage . It was impossible . The image of Nicholas was inextricably mingled with magnificence , with brocades and gilt and invisible service , the somber and regal atmosphere of Dragonwyck.  |p147She  put her hand down the collar of her nightgown and felt for the ring . The heart-shaped carbuncle was warm from her body . She slipped her finger through the gold circle . Long after Tabitha had gone to sleep she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , but slow tears trickled down her face onto the uncomfortable cornhusk mattress.  |p148TABITHA  WAS MARRIED ON SATURDAY THE THIRTYfirstof May in the Second Congregational Meeting House on the bill . The church was crammed with representative Greenwich families  --  Meads , Reynoldses , Pecks , Closes , and Husteds . Ephraim and Abigail in a front pew nodded decorously at these friends and neighbors who had all turned out to honor the young couple . Ephraim 's satisfaction was increased by the absence of the Reverend Noah Coe , whose eight years of unpopular ministry had culminated last week in his stormy dismissal by the Society . Well , Coe 's gone at last and good riddance , thought Ephraim , eyeing the Reverend Clark , the young substitute pastor , who had been brought in temporarily until the Consociation should decide on a permanent incumbent . A sound minister and a fine new stone church , that 's what we need . I daresay I can squeeze out a couple of hundred , Bob Mead and Eliphalet Peck 'll do considerably better  --  He started as Abigail nudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she whispered . Recalled to his duty , he hastened down the aisle and took Tabitha on his arm asthe congregation cleared their throats and struck up ' Rock of Ages . ' Tibby looks lovely , thought Miranda with pride as she followed her sister and father up the aisle . Tabitha wore Miranda 's watered gray silk trimmed with ruching . The difference in their heights had made it possible to cut enough from the bottom to piece out the bodice and waist , which were much too small . Miranda had also donated tiny green ostrich feathers to trim the poke bonnet . A white wedding dress would have been unthinkable extravagance for a farmer 's wife , and without Miranda 's generosity Tabitha would have been married in a serviceable cashmere or alpaca . Obadiah waited beside the pulpit for his bride , his broad face scrubbed and shining.  |p149E|phraim  handed over his younger daughter , and stepped aside with Miranda . The Reverend Clark opened the Bible and raised his hands . The congregation bowed their heads  --  all but Abigail . She clenched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the group beneath the pulpit . Obadiah 's mother glanced sidewaysat the tense figure beside her and whispered sympathetically , It 's hard to have them leave us , Abby , but Ob 'll be a good son to you , and they 're not going far . ' Abigail nodded . It was not at Tabitha that she had been looking but at Miranda . For she had surprised on the girl 's downcast face an expression of suffering , and a pain so obvious that the mother 's heart was shocked . I knew it , thought Abigail , deeply troubled ; something has happened to the girl that she 's not told me . While searching for the cause of Miranda 's unhappiness , an unhappiness which Abigail had felt and tried to deny to herself during this past month , the marriage service was finished , and she realized with compunction that during Tabitha 's supreme moment she had had no thoughts for her younger daughter at all . Some thirty guests drove down the turnpike to Stanwich Road and then to the Wells farm for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham , doughnuts , coffee and cider . Abigail and her daughters had been cooking for days . Ephraim would serve no intoxicating liquor , but some of Ob 's young friends had fortified themselves with a jug of Connecticut rum , and before the afternoon shadows cast by the wineglass elms had even touched the east wall of the farmhouse , the merriment had grown rough and rowdy . The older people sat apart beneath the trees and watched the young ones play kissing games . Even Ephraim saw no harm in that at a wedding , nor did any of the other farmers , who might enforce their blue laws , but enjoyed a strenuous and unrefined frolic just the same . Miranda longed to go off by herself to the quiet of the little attic room which she would no longer have to share , but she dared not , knowing that her absence would annoy her father . She tried to keep out of the way , busying herself with carrying pies and plates back arid forth from the kitchen , and the young people let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes at her , but they were afraid of her . til-ie was tall and lovely and remote in her green silk dress.  | ' Stuck up , she is , ' whispered little Phoebe Mead to Deborah Wilson in the corner of the barn where they had both run for refuge from Zach Wilson , who was ' it ' at the moment and lurched blindfolded now this way , now that , trying to catch one of the girls in his outstretched arms . Miranda shrank behind a tree as she saw her former admirer stumble in her direction , and would have escaped him except that Ob , her new brother-in-law , seized her around the waist and shoved her toward Zach 's groping hands . Everyone stopped running to watch . There were titters . She stood stiff as a fencepole while the rough fingers pawed her dress , her hair . " T is Ranny ! ' shouted Zach , and tearing off the blindfold he gave her a wet smacking kiss on the mouth . Quick as thought , she slapped him hard across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shocked silence . A kiss was the usual forfeit for being caught . If one did n't like the kisser one might giggle and duck , but this blaze of disgust and anger on the white face  --  and the mark of her fingers standing out livid on Zach 's cheek ! He rubbed at it , bewildered . ' What in creation 's the matter with her ! ' he muttered . ' Catch yourself an iceberg next time , Zach , ' shouted a male voice . ' Leastways they do n't slap . ' Miranda turned slowly . She saw Tabitha 's indignant look . Ranny making a scene , spoiling everybody 's fun , and at the wedding too . Color rushed to Miranda 's cheeks . ' I 'm sorry , Tibby , ' she whispered ; then catching up her skirts she ran into the house . Abigail had seen the whole incident , though Ephraim fortunately had not . ' I 'll just go look at the oven ; it cools down mighty quick , ' she murmured , and followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , and crying so hard that she did not hear her mother 's light footstep . But she felt the touch on her hair and jumped up . ' Ranny , lass , ' said Abigail gently . ' Tell me what ails you , I can see  --  ' She stopped , staring . Against Miranda 's bodice there hung a carved gold ring with a heart-shaped red stone . The girl covered it quickly with her hand , but her mother shook her head and pulled the ring from under the clutching fingers . ' What is this , Miranda ? ' she said sternly . ' And why are you hiding it ? ' Shouts and laughter from the renewed game of Blind Man 's Buff carried through the open window into the hot room . A fly circled lazily , buzzing against the rafters . I 'm waiting , dearie : She put her arm around the girl 's shoulders , and Miranda with a choked sound hid her face on her mother 's thin chest . It 's the Van Ryn betrothal ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp dismay . Could it be that Ranny had taken the ring in some clandestine way , and afraid to admit her fault , therefore hid it ? It was obviously of great value . Her protecting arm fell away . How do you come by it ? ' she snapped . Miranda lifted her head . Now that it had been forced on her , it could be no breach of faith to tell . ' He gave it to me , ' she said proudly . ' Nicholas . ' For an instant her mother was conscious only of relief . It was not surprising that Mr. Van Ryn should have made the girl a present at parting , since he had been most generous throughout . Then her bewilderment returned . ' But why a betrothal ring ? And why do you hide it ? And  --  ' she added with growing apprehension , You called him Nicholas ; surely that 's not respectful , Ranny . ' Miranda got up , she moved slowly from the bed to the little deal table on which she had arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced ; she shifted it , picked up her horn comb and laid it down again . ' I 'm going to marry him , Ma , ' she said . What ! ' cried Abigail . Miranda turned . Her chin was lifted a little , het long eyes were both frightened and defiant , but on her mouth there was a small smile . ' I am , Ma , next spring . ' ' But Ranny , it 's not possible ! You must be mad , girl . ' Abigail laced her hands , all her usual decisiveness dissolved in confusion . ' He 's too old for you  --  ' From the many crowding objections , this was the first that came to her . Her picture of Nicholas as a settled , niddle-aged gentleman . Miranda gave a soft little laugh , remembering that her mother oust still think of Nicholas as they had imagined him last summer . Oh Ma , he 's only thirty-two , and the handsomest man in the world . I to looks like  --  like  --  ' If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie had wished it . Wait a minute ! ' she cried , and falling to her knees opened her horsehair trunk . Pinned to the lid was an illustrationwhich she had cut from a gift book , ' A Garland of Rosesfor 1844 . ' She thrust it at her mother . ' This is something like him , I though Nicholas is far better-looking . ' Abigail frowned at the picture of a tall , dark young man , leaningnegligently against a balustrade . It was titled ' Lord Allingham awaits his bride . ' She placed the illustration on the bed . ' I see that he is not as I thought him , Miranda , ' she said gravely . ' But it makes no difference . How can it be that his wife died on Monday , and you left on the Friday , and yet he gave you a betrothal ring ? ' Her voice fell like a cold stone through the little room . The girl made an involuntary gesture of defense . The eager , happy light which had shone in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , ' she said , groping for words , ' I know it seems  --  I know it 's hard to understand , it was n't exactly that way  --  ' She swallowed . Suddenly she flung herself down beside her mother , clasping the spare knees and looking up at Abigail with a desperate pleading . ' I love him so , Ma . I loved him from the beginning , I think . Oh , wo n't you try to understand , please ? And he  --  he never was happy with Johanna . ' Abigail slowly relaxed , allowing her love for this child to stifle the doubts which afflicted her . The ways of gentry are different , she thought , and who am I to judge them ? She was silent , stroking the girl 's hair , and there came to her gradually a half-guilty pride . It would be a very grand marriage . ' Your pa  --  ' she began , still trying to adjust herself to the staggering idea . ' Pa must n't know for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that  --  Nicholas . ' Frowning , Abigail turned from her daughter 's appealing gaze . She saw the reason for secrecy : all of Greenwich would be scandalizedif they knew Miranda 's plans . And yet this hole-and-corner business  --  Something wrong about it , something snide , thought Abigail . But the lass loves him . She 'll be a great lady . I 'll not spoil her chances . She rose briskly , smoothed down her poplin dress . ' Wash your face and see if the fresh pies are ready . I 'll keep your secret , Ranny. ' pI 5 3Tabitha 's wedding day ended in a boisterous skimelton party , a kind of local charivari . She drove beside her husband on the spring wagon to the new cottage on the adjoining farm , and no sooner had the young couple retired upstairs than the racket broke out . Twenty of Ob 's friends serenaded them with catcalls and the banging of kettles . Two of the Mead boys fired muskets into the air at great peril to the yelling bystanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and swelling with additional importance because they were brothers to the bride , marched around and around the house with a fife and drum . The noise kept up until midnight and made sleep impossible for any of the near-by farmhouses . ' Tibby 's got a rare send-off , ' said Ephraim , kicking off his best shoes , and settling into his chair with a tired grunt . ' She and Ob are well liked , and no mistake . ' Abigail and Miranda were cleaning up the kitchen ; neither answered Ephraim , who was relaxed and pleased with life . It had been a good wedding , tribute to his standing in the community . A muffled boom rattled the window panes . It was followed by shouts and huzzahs . ' Consarned if they have n't brought the old cannon from Cos Cob , ' said Ephraim , chuckling . ' Has n't been such a skimelton in years . ' He glanced at his older daughter , who with a checked apron tied over her dress was neatly washing dishes . ' Likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said kindly . Heaven forbid , she thought . Nicholas would be disgusted by this method of starting marriage . Would he perhaps be disgusted by her whole background , she thought , dropping the greasy dish rag in sudden panic . She looked at her father 's stocking feet , which were propped comfortably on the table . ' But yell never get yourself a husband ' less you drop those high and mighty airs , ' continued Ephraim , his good temper waning at her silence . ' Men do n't like it . Yell be an old maid yet , if you do n't mend your ways . ' ' I hope not , Pa , ' said Miranda . She took an empty pie tin from her mother , and the women 's eyes met in a quick glance . ' You dry , ' whispered Abigail , ' I 'll finish the washing . You must n't let your hands get rough . ' She gave her mother a look of fervent gratitude . There was comfortin having shared her secret . The sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed that she must have dreamed Dragonwyck and all that had happened to her there . Suppose Nicholas forgot her  --  suppose he had n't really meant it  --  suppose he met someone else  --  The summer days dragged by , and Miranda 's fears grew . Abigail spared her many tasks , but the inexorable farm routine demanded every pair of hands , and now Tabitha was gone . Baking , boiling , and washing , milking the cows , the care of Charity , who was a lively two-year-old , and into everything , through these chores , Miranda moved automatically , preoccupied and dully miserable . Nor was she efficient . She let the bread burn , or the fires go out . Once she scorched an entire kettle of the precious blackberries which Abigail was cooking into a winter 's supply of jam . ' Land 's sake , Ranny , you 're no more use than Charity ! ' snapped her mother , exasperated , when she discovered this last tragedy . The girl 's eyes filled . ' I 'm dreadful sorry , Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stirring the kettle , and then somehow I got to thinking  --  and I forgot  --  ' ' Take the baby for a walk , and keep out of the way , do  --  ' Abigail took the blackened sticky kettle from her daughter . ' I 'll clean it . Rather do it myself than watch you mooning and puttering . Go on out  --  scat ! ' Miranda obediently took the baby 's hand . Charity gave a crow of delight . ' Pick f'owers , Ranny ! ' she commanded , tugging at her sister . ' Make w'eath for baby . ' Abigail watched the two wander across the north pasture . The girl 's heartsick , she thought . It 's a wonder he would n't write to her . All these months , she 's been pining . She attacked the kettle vigorously , her lips compressed . Abigail too was beginning to have doubts . By the end of September , Miranda could stand the silence no longer . She could not eat , she slept badly . Her talismans , the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of her departure from Dragonwyck , no longer served to reassure her . It was true that she had intuitively accepted the fact that he might not write her . And she knew as surely that there had been a tacit interdiction 5against her writing to him . Yet why not ? thought Miranda feverishly . What could be more natural  --  a few words thanking him for his kindness to her , asking about his health . A letter that anyone might read without suspicion . One morning when the men were working in the fields , and Abigail had gone down the road to see Tabitha , Miranda stole into the front room and sat down at her father 's cherry desk . She made four drafts , and finally copied the last one onto a sheet of lined paper , from the back of Ephraim 's ledger . There was no other paper . Stanwich Road , Greenwich , Sept. 25th , 1845 . Dear Cousin Nicholas : It seems eternity she scraped this out with a penknife and substituted ' a long time ' since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health , and Katrine as well . My thoughts ever turn to you  --  she stopped , hastily added an r your kindness and hospitality . Please she erased that I would esteem it a great favor to hear if you are quite well . She laid the pen down and gazed with miserable eyes out of the window into the rustling elm leaves . How to sign it ? Not ' sincerely , ' not ' affectionately . ' There was no word that she dared write . She picked up the pen , and put down ' Miranda , ' carefully embellishedwith the flourishes she had learned at the Academy . She folded the sheet , sealed and addressed it . That afternoon , she walked three miles to the Horseneck Post Office , had the letter franked , and walked back again through fields of goldenrod and up the shady Stanwich Road , and her heart was lighter . Surely he would understand , would read between the lines and send her a word of reassurance . But weeks passed and there was no answer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching her daughter anxiously . I wish she 'd never gone to Dragonwyck , or heard of that Nicholas . She was always over-romantic , and to my everlasting shame I guess I encouraged her . ' Eat your vittles , Ranny , ' she would urge with irritation born of worry . ' You look like a picked crow . '  | ' Aye , ' agreed Ephraim on one occasion , wiping his mouth and examining his daughter . What ails you these days , child ? You wear a face long enough to eat oats out of a churn . ' He had been better pleased with her lately . She was quiet and biddable . It had occurred to him that she seemed a bit mopish , but girls were unstable , moody creatures , full of silly whims . Well , ' he continued , with an idea of cheering her , next week 's Harvest Festival in Peck 's barn . I hear they 've got a fiddler coming from Stamford . It 'll liven you up . Likely catch yourself a beau . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , her lids dropped , staring vaguely at the table . Her father frowned and opened his mouth to speak when Nat created a diversion . ' Looky  --  ' he cried , peering through the kitchen window  --  there 's a stranger on a roan horse just turned through our gate ! ' Miranda started . Against all reason , wild hope set her heart to pounding . She crowded with the others to the window . They all watched the approaching horseman : strangers were an event . ' It ca n't be a peddler , ' said Nat . ' He has no pack . ' The roan horse walked slowly , its head drooping . The rider was concealed by his woolen cape and battered beaver hat . Someone who 's lost his way , ' suggested Abigail . A thought struck her , the same that had come to Miranda . She glanced at the girl , and saw from the hopeless disappointment in her face that at any rate this was not Nicholas . I ' 11 see what he wants , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger raised his head , and Miranda gave a cry of surprise . ' Why , it 's Doctor Turner ! ' She stared at the powerful shoulders , the square , smiling face , hating him because he came from upriver , because he reminded her poignantly of Dragonwyck , and yet was not Nicholas . He might have news , though , she thought with rising excitement . Of course he would have news . She ran down the steps as Jeff alighted . For a moment he hardly recognized her . Her golden hair was braided and pinned tight around her head ; she wore pink challis and an apron . She was too thin and pale , so that her long hazel eyes now looked enormous in her sharpened face . Her lips trembled as she smiled at him.  |p157'Oh  , Doctor Turner  --  ' she cried impulsively  --  ' have you  --  did you  --  ? ' She broke off , conscious that Ephraim was staring at her . Jeff took her hand in his , hardly hearing what she said . He thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , that she was happy to see him . Warmth flowed over him . In her simple clothes , she seemed to him far more beautiful than she had in the fashionable silks and ringlets she had worn at Dragonwyck . He was touched by hollows in her cheeks , and the shadows beneath her lovely eyes . ' And who may this gentleman be , Ranny ? ' inquired Ephraim sternly . Jeff dropped her hand and grinned in some confusion . ' I 'm Jefferson Turner from Hudson , Mr. Wells . Perhaps Miranda has mentioned me . ' She has not , sir , ' said Ephraim . He too misinterpreted his daughter 's behavior . This young man must be the reason for the girl 's pinings and sighings . But though he liked Jeff on sight , as people usually did , he had no intention of unbending until he had been given a full explanation . Jeff was soon established at the table , while Abigail plied him with roast pork and pie . Miranda saw that her own questions must wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stove to the table and back to the stove again in a fever of impatience . It seemed that Jeff had made a trip to New York . For there 's a fine doctor there , Doctor John Francis . He has a new treatment for cholera . The old whaler " Nellie B "  --  put into Hudson in July and she brought us some cholera from India . We only had five cases , praise be , but I lost two of them . ' He put down his knife , and his face sobered . ' I hope they were good Christians , and died in the faith of our Lord , ' said Ephraim . Jeff nodded . ' Oh , their souls are safe enough ; it 's the welfare of their bodies that concerns me . ' ' Young man  --  ' said Ephraim , ' that remark smacks of levity . The body is but dust and ashes . Still  --  ' he went on , because he was interested , and despite a possible laxity of principle , the young doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a new medicine for the cholera in the city ? '  | " T is nothing in the world but clay  --  ' said Jeff ruefully . ' Chinese clay . Doctor Francis has tried it and it works well . ' ' To eat , you mean ? ' put in Nat . All three boys were listening intently , delighted with this break in their lives . Only Miranda paid no attention . What did she care for cholera and its treatment when her whole being was centered on one subject ? The meal seemed to her interminable . Even after everyone had finished eating , Ephraim ignored the lengthening shadows outside and sat on at table talking to the guest . And this in spite of the filled wagon in the yard and the team ready harnessed to drive a load of late potatoes to the dock . Jeff explained the uses of clay in cholera , and he told them of his trip from Hudson . He had come by horseback because he wished to stop along the way in Poughkeepsie and Fishkill and White Plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This morning I was in Rye , ' he said , smiling , ' and finding myself so near Greenwich , I thought to come and see Miranda . ' This was not entirely true . He had meant from the beginning to call on the Wellses . But he did not himself clearly understand why he had wanted to see her again , and the fact embarrassed him . ' I 'm glad you came , ' said Ephraim heartily . ' You 'll stay with us tonight , of course . You can share Tom 's bed .  --  Ranny , ' he turned to the silent girl , ' you might walk about a bit with the doctor . Show him the orchard ; I 'm certain they do n't grow apple trees like that where he comes from . ' Ephraim had made up his mind . No doubt the young fellow had come a-courting . He would have preferredone of the neighbor boys , but Jeff had passed muster . I 'll not be harsh with the girl , thought Ephraim ; she might have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed by a puzzled look from her mother , Miranda and Jeff went for a walk in the apple orchard . ' You 're not looking very well , Miranda , ' said Jeff gently . ' I think I must give you a tonic . ' She walked fast , anxious to get out of hearing of the house . She brushed his remark aside , and climbed swiftly over the stone fence . He followed , and when they stood on the bumpy ground amongst a few worm-eaten russets , she turned to him with urgency . ' Tell me , have you been to Dragonwyck ? Have you seen Mr. Van Ryn ? '  |p159So  , he thought , surprised to see how much he minded , that breathlesseagerness of greeting was not for me at all . She is still obsessed with the lord of the manor . Dragonwyck 's closed , ' he said ; ' has been since June . Mr. Van Ryn is traveling , down South somewhere . Did n't you know ? ' She shook her head , trying to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears start to her eyes . ' I did see him once in September , at poor Boughton 's new trial , ' he said unwillingly . He had not meant to tell her this , nor of the message Nicholas had given him for her , for he had persuaded himself that she would have forgotten Nicholas , now that she was back home . And he profoundly believed that it would be better for her if she had . But in the face of her anguish , he could not deny her . ' How was he ? ' she asked breathlessly . ' Oh , please , please tell me . ' ' He seemed very well . I only saw him for a minute . ' He sighed , remembering the crowded little Hudson courtroom where Smith Boughton had stood his second trial for sedition against the Manor lords , the first one having ended in disagreement . This time things had gone as badly as possible . The steely-eyed Circuit Judge John Edmonds had presided . Boughton 's lawyer , Ambrose Jordan , had lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Buren , who represented the manors . From the beginning , Jeff had had small hope of the outcome , but the verdict was even worse than he had feared . Smith Boughton had been sentenced to life in Clinton Prison . They had been sorry after that , some of those who had persecutedthe little doctor . There had been tears in the courtroom ; Mrs. Van Rensselaer had fainted . Jeff had watched them all with hatred  --  the well-fed , smug lot of them ensconced in the whitepanneledgallery , so avid for their dubious rights , so terrified of one small , white-faced man who had dared to threaten their wealth and power . Nicholas had been amongst those in the gallery , conspicuous inhis black suit . He had watched the proceedings impassively , hishandsome head turned a little , his blue eyes showing little interest . As soon as the verdict had been pronounced , he had risen andleft the gallery . Jeff too had quitted the courtroom , moved by anp16o impulsive and quite impossible wish to go to his friend . The guard soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he had been walking sadly down the courthouse steps , when he felt a touch on his arm . It was Nicholas , who said , ' Good day , Doctor Turner . This must be a bad time for you . ' ' At any rate , it 's a pleasant one for you , ' said Jeff , starting to walk on . ' The verdict is just but harsh , ' said Nicholas calmly . ' Were I he , I would kill myself . He 'd be far better dead than in prison . ' I really believe he means that , Jeff had thought , and he had answered : ' I do n't agree with you , Mr. Van Ryn . Life is precious , and what 's more the sentence may be commuted some day . Now if you 'll excuse me  --  I leave soon for a trip to New York and I 've much to do . ' ' Indeed ? ' asked Nicholas politely . ' When I 'm thereabouts , I may call on Miss Wells , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say than anything else . He had said nothing for a moment and the peculiar shut expression had appeared in his eyes . ' If you do see her , ' he said at last , ' you might tell her that I shall come down-river in April . ' ' Certainly , ' said Jeff , thinking it a very trivial message . He had continued to think so up to this moment , and now he wondered . When he delivered the message to Miranda , he no longer wondered . She was transfigured by a blaze of joy . ' Did he say that ? ' she cried . ' Oh , thank you , thank you , Jeff . ' She was unconscious of her use of his name , half-laughing and halfcryingin her relief . It was all right then . Nicholas had n't answered her letter because Dragonwyck was shut and he was traveling . But he would be with her in April as he had promised . She no longer doubted or even wondered why he did not write her . He had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had given her his word , she had been shameful to need the confirmation . But oh , it was sweet to have it . She smiled at Jeff , including him now in her joy . ' You 're easily pleased , ' said he crossly . It was plain enough now that she hoped to see Nicholas in April  --  six months off  --  and on this distant meeting she must be building a foolish romanticp161structure  --  the little goose . The real facts never occurred to him . He knew that Miranda had been but three days in that shrouded house of mourning , and he had heard how during that time the widower had shut himself into the tower study with his grief . ' Miranda , ' he said on impulse , ' why do you make yourself unhappy , always hankering after things you have n't got ? Ca n't you be content here at home ? This farm is beautiful  --  ' ' Beautiful ! ' she repeated in amazement , looking around her . The orchard where they stood was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dove beneath hemlocks and the tall protecting elms . The fields , checkered by stone walls , undulatedgently toward the sapphire strip of the distant Sound . A late October haze , faintly lavender , filtered the clear air and intensifiedthe perfume of burning leaves . Maples on the Cat Rock Hills blazed red and gold , colors repeated even more strongly by a riot of sumach and goldenrod against the gray wall of the little burying ground . In the adjoining pasture Buttercup 's bell tinkled rhythmically , as Seth guided her toward the barn and the evening milking . ' I suppose the country 's pretty enough , ' said Miranda vaguely , ' but it has no refinement , no elegance ; and as for the farm  --  it 's nothing but work . ' She looked down at her hands . Despite her care they had reddened a little ; two of her almond-shaped fingernails were broken off short . ' Work 's not such a bad thing , ' answered Jeff . ' There 's joy in gettingthings done , in being useful . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeter far  --  ' He shut his mouth , seeing that her eyes held the look of passive endurance which descends on a congregationtoward the end of a tedious sermon . D' you think for one minute  --  ' he shouted , suddenly angry , ' that your precious Van Ryn with his estates and his carriages and his idleness is as happy a man as I am , or your own father ? ' He was pleased to see that he had startled her , but otherwise he produced no effect . She gave him an indulgent smile , and said softly , as though she did not want to hurt his feelings , ' I should never think of comparing you or Pa to Mr. Van Ryn in any way . ' ' Miranda , you 're  --  ' he began , and then he laughed . There was no reaching her . ' Come and show me the rest of the farm , I 'm interested in it even if you 're not . ' And taking her arm he helped her back over the stone wall.  | Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightof his arrival the baby developed a virulent sore throat . Some hours later , the dreaded white spots appeared and the terrified Abigail , who had lost one child from this cause , did not need Jeff to tell her that Charity had diphtheria . She did not need Jeff for diagnosis , but she needed him badly when the suffocating membrane threatened to close the little throat , and only his promptness in making and inserting a hollow reed to the trachea saved the child . Jeff and Abigail worked together for three days and nights , sponging , poulticing , and making inhalations of turpentine . Miranda , who had never had the disease , was banished from the sickroom , despite her protests . When it was all over , and Charity with the elasticity of childhood had started on a quick recovery , the family embarrassed Jeff by its gratitude . I 'll never forget what you 've done  --  never , ' sobbed Abigail , exhausted by strain and relief . And that night at family worship , Ephraim abandoned the chapterswhich should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayer he thanked the Lord devoutly ' for that Thou hast sent us one to succor us in our hour of need . ' Ephraim accepted Jeff 's refusal of any payment for his services , because of the conviction that the young doctor would soon be his son-in-law . He was therefore amazed when Jeff mounted his horse one morning , and after warm farewells to each one of them , departedfor Hudson without having asked permission to woo Miranda . i'I ca n't make it out , ' Ephraim told Abigail that night in the conjugal bed . I made sure he 'd speak for the lass , and she brightenedup like a spring morning directly he got here . ' His wife sighed , turning restlessly on her pillow . She knew , now , why Miranda had brightened and that it had nothing to do with Jeff . Would that it were Jeff the girl loved . She and Ephraim were of one mind in that . But Abigail was loyal to her daughter  --  and there was that betrothal ring  --  Ranny had given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so patently had , given her love as well . I ca n't understand the young people nowadays , ' Ephraim growled . Flighty , do n't know their own minds . ' A new thoughtp163struck him . ' Very like Jeff 's gone home to make arrangements there before he speaks . He 'll be back again . That 's what it is . ' ' Perhaps , ' said Abigail faintly . She knew better than to upset her husband before it was necessary.  |p164NICHOLAS  ARRIVED IN GREENWICH ON THE SECondof April , exactly one year from the day on which he had last seen Miranda . He went to Weed 's Tavern on Main Street , found the accommodation offered him cramped and noisy , for his rooms fronted on the Boston Post Road , where market wagons , carriages , and stages continually clattered by ; so he had his coachman make inquiries , got back in the coach , and traveled through spring mud up the North Street to Stanwich , where he took over the second floor of a little inn . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldomhad guests nowadays , had unpacked for him , Nicholas ordered a glass of Madeira . Then he opened his writing case and began a note . An hour later a stable boy delivered this note at the Wells Farm . It was addressed to Ephraim , who was sluicing his head and face at the pump preparatory to eating supper . He stamped into the kitchen , where Miranda and Abigail were laying the table . He held the note out in his wet fingers . I 'll be consarned if this do n't beat all ! ' he cried . Your fine Cousin Nicholas is stopping in Stanwich , and he 's coming to see me on a matter of the " greatest importance . " ' Miranda took one look at the well-remembered handwriting . The kitchen stove , her mother and father , spun slowly around her . She clutched the edge of the table and shut her eyes . Then quite suddenly she was calm . The long uncertainty was over . There would be trouble now , Pa would be difficult ; but she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that he wished to . ' What in tunket could he want ? ' grumbled Ephraim , running a comb through his beard . ' Ranny  --  ' he turned to his daughter , but Miranda had slipped upstairs . The green silk dress , long un/worn , was ready . She took it from the lavender-scented bag where it had hung , waiting . She parted her hair and brushed it around her finger into curls on either side her face and rolled the rest into a heavy coil on the nape of her neck . She touched the heliotrope Cologne to her wrists and forehead , and when she stood fully dressed , she untied the silk cord and , drawing the betrothal ring from its hiding place , she kissed it and put it on her finger . There was the sound of carriage wheels outside when she got downstairs . As she entered the kitchen , they heard a knock on the front door , the one that was never used . Ephraim went to open it and all the family crowded after him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas walked in . He bowed to Ephraim , paused by the threshold , his head nearly touching the low ceiling , while he searched the other faces which he did not know . Then he saw Miranda , who had held back , her heart pounding , her hands shaking , now that the moment had actually arrived . Nicholas ' face lighted , his eyes burned into hers as though he asked her a question which needed no answer except the expression on her face . He moved swiftly across the room and before the gaping boys and thunderstruck Ephraim , took Miranda 's hand and raised it to his lips . What 's the meaning of this , sir ! ' shouted Ephraim . Nicholas released the girl 's hand and turned to confront the astonished father . May I speak to you alone , Mr. Wells ? ' His tone plainly indicated that he was in a hurry to have done with a boring task . He made a gesture of dismissal to the others and they obeyed it at once ; not even Abigail thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . The door of the front room shut behind them . Well  --  ' whistled young Nat , sinking into a kitchen chair and staring at his sister . ' So that 's your Mr. Van Ryn ! You 're a deep one , Ranny . ' She stood proudly amongst them , her head thrown back , a little smile on her lips . Her whole body seemed to glow and bloom . The boys gazed at her as though they 'd never seen her before . Her mother glanced at her and felt a sharp dismay . This Nicholas was all that Miranda had said and more . She had never seen a man 6 6 so handsome , nor one who seemed more masterful . There had been tenderness and the proper homage in his greeting of Miranda . You could n't ask more of a husband than that he should be masterful and tender , especially when wealth and position went with it . What 's the matter with me , then ? thought Abigail . She opened the oven door and turned the loaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . The bread was doing well . She shut the oven and seizing a knife began to pare apples with vicious jabs . After the second apple she laid the knife aside . Might as well face it . From the instant that he had walked through the door into their house , Abigail had felt a queer revulsion , not quite fear but akin to fear . No reason for it , she told herself  --  but the feeling of recoil and apprehension remained . ' Get to your chores , boys  --  ' she addressed her sons briskly . ' This matter does n't concern you . ' They rose , pausing as they heard their father 's voice raised in angry protest , and the calm slow tones which answered . Reluctantlythey filed out , Tom to the evening milking , Seth and Nat to the woodpile . On the way they covertly examined the shining carriage , the sleek , beautifully matched horses , and the coachman , who entirely ignored the boys . In the kitchen the two women drew closer . Miranda took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran through the girl 's body as the parlor door burst open and Ephraim shouted , ' Miranda , come here ! ' Nicholas stood at the fireplace , he wore his usual air of detachment ; but Ephraim sat in his armchair , his fingers beating a tattoo on the table , and Miranda saw that his empurpled face showed not only anger but perplexity . ' He says he wants to marry you , ' said Ephraim to his daughter , in a tone of grim disbelief . He drew his bushy brows together . ' Says you know all about it . ' She hesitated a second , then she nodded . ' Yes , Pa . I 'm going to marry Nicholas . ' She walked to the fireplace and smiled timidly up at her lover . His eyes kept their expression of controlled annoyance , for he found this scene with Ephraim tedious and unnecessary ; but he put his arm around the slender waist and drew the girl to him . Ephraim stared at them both and suddenly his daughter became to him a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to forbid the marriage , to order Van Ryn from the house . But he could not find the words . There were no valid objections , as Nicholas himself had contemptuously pointed out . What d'ye think about this strange business , Abby ? ' Ephraim turned to his wife , who had followed Miranda into the room . She too looked at the couple by the fireplace . Already she 's gone from us , Abigail thought with pain , for the girl 's face reflected some of Nicholas ' remoteness and condescension . It seemed to the mother as though a black chasm had opened across the oak planks in the flooring and the two of them stood alone upon the farther side . She put her hand on her husband 's shoulder . ' I think it is to be , Ephraim . And we must make the best of it , ' she said quietly . Ephraim made a few more protests , but he was helpless against Nicholas ' implacable purpose , and Miranda 's feverish desire . He was outraged to discover that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the parsonage and engagedthe Reverend Clark for three o'clock on the next day but one , engaged him to come to the Wells farm . ' It 's indecent , it 's too soon ! ' roared Ephraim . And my girl must be married in church like a good Christian . I 'll have no hole-andcornerwedding here . ' ' Our marriage shall not be solemnized before a lot of gaping strangers , ' returned Nicholas . He considered that he had already made sufficient concession in securing the Wells ' own pastor rather than importing a Dutch dominie who would have been more suitableto a Van Ryn wedding . ' As for the day  --  ' he continued , ' I can see no reason whatever for waiting . ' But she has nothing ready  --  ' put in Abigail . ' No wedding gown . ' ' She needs nothing . There 's an entire wardrobe awaiting her at my house in New York . ' Abigail 's mouth tightened ; she looked at Miranda , wishing that the girl would stick up for her rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place herself . But the hazel eyes fixed on Nicholas were blind to everyone else . Miranda was therefore married at three o'clock on Sunday afternoon , April the fourth , in the farmhouse parlor , with no witnessesbut her family and Obadiah . Tabitha and her young husbandhuddled together in a corner behind the cherry desk , both bewildered by this extraordinary turn of events . I do n't envy her , thought Tabitha , she 'll be a second wife , and he 's so much older . But she looked from Nicholas to Ob 's patient , ox-like face and sighed unconsciously . Outside it was raining hard , not a spring shower but a steady downpour from which drops spattered against the window panes with tiny hissing sounds . Dankness seeped through the parlor and found its way to Abigail 's heart . She closed her eyes to shut out the picture of the minister in his black robe , Nicholas ' erect back in dark blue , and Miranda in the green silk dress , very pale , making her responses in a muted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail . Not only the green dress , but everything about this marriage was unlucky . She was sure of it , though how or why she knew so surely she could not have told . Ranny child  --  do n't ! do n't ! she cried silently to the slender figure . You 'll never know happiness , you 'll tear your heart out against him  --  But the golden head bowed for the final prayer . It was already too late . Come , perk up , Abby , ' said Ephraim , joggling her arm . ' No use wearing a long face now . The girl 's made her bed and must lie in it . No doubt she 'll do well enough if she obeys Holy Writ , looks to the ways of her household , and eats not the bread of idleness . ' Now that the thing was done , he saw no point in further protests and ' misgivings . Abigail had prepared a wedding supper , but Nicholas would not stay for it . ' I wish to leave at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda . These were the first words he spoke to her after the ceremony . Nor had he touched her . But all during the hurried farewells his eyes were on her . She clung to Abigail when the moment came , but Nicholas allowedher no time to feel the full sorrow of the parting . ' Come , Miranda , ' he said , and indicated the waiting carriage where beside the open door the coachman stood , his cockaded hat in his hand . It wo n't be for long ! I 'll see you often , often ! ' she cried to the silent family group on the steps . They were now inexpressibly dear , all of them , even Ephraim and Tibby . Oh , what have I done !  |p169Why  am I leaving them like this ? Oh , Ma  --  darling  --  She stretched her arms out to them , in an abandon of longing , but Nicholas lifted her into the carriage . He shut the door , beckoned to the coachman . The horses started forward . She flung herself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave half-heartedly , saw Abigail pick up the baby and lay her cheek against the soft curls as though for comfort . They all turned , and for a moment the kitchen door stood open , outlining a. rectangle of glowing warmth and light in the gathering darkness . Then the light vanished and the farmhouse melted into the twilight . A sensation of unreality seized her . She leaned against the blue velvet cushions and closed her eyes . This is not I , she thought , it ca n't be that I 'm married . When I open my eyes I 'll be back in the little attic bedroom . Ma is down there in the kitchen setting dough , the baby is crowing in her cradle waiting for me to pick her up . Pa and the boys are out in the fields . She opened her eyes and saw Nicholas watching her . She raised her left hand , staring in unbelief at the heavy golden band on her finger . ' Yes , ' said Nicholas . ' We 're married , Miranda . ' His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . How can I be married to you when I do n't know you ? Again she stared at the wedding ring . She saw another hand , a fat one with a gold ring not unlike this on its puffy finger , saw it lying on the black coverlet , clear in the light of two tapers . She made a small sound and shrank to the farthest side of the seat . Nicholas ' eyes narrowed . He put his hand on her shoulder , his fingers closed so that her flesh beneath the green silk was bruised . He pulled her to him and kissed her once . His kiss effaced Johanna as it effaced the memory of Abigail 's strained face . She tasted fear and beneath the fear a strange and shamed delight . He released her and laughed . ' We 'll soon be home , ' he said . ' This is no place for love-making . ' She was hurt by his laugh , it was as though he had triumphed over her and having seen her submission had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Post Road and turned west toward New York , the rain stopped , and the surface of the road improved so that they no longer bumped through puddles and mudholes . From time to time a cluster of lights emerged from the darkness and they slowed a little for the main street of a town , Port Chester , Rye , Mamaroneck ; but soon each one was left behind and the night closed around them again . How did this year of separation pass for you ? ' inquired Nicholas , breaking the silence , and she understood from his tone that he wished her answer to be as casual as his question . She had yet fully to comprehend that he welcomed emotion of any kind only when it initiated with him , and that it amused him to control his own emotions as a chess player controls his pieces ; but she obeyed his tone , saying as lightly as possible : ' Why , it seemed very long . I tried to keep busy . You  --  you were traveling , were n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Erie and then down the Mississippi as far as Memphis . But I found nothing in the West to interest me . Everything is barbarous and uncouth . I spent the past winter visiting friends on a plantation near Savannah . This type of life I liked better . In the South they have both culture and beauty . ' ' Oh , ' she said . How many girls he must have met during this past year , wealthy and beautiful girls ; even Miranda , ignorant as t she was about the geography of her country , had heard of the 1 languorous and tempting beauty of Southern women . Had he ever repented of his promise to claim her , had he ever made love to any of those others  --  that dazzling multitude which she wistfully pictured ? He did not enlighten her . He talked instead of the plantation system and slave labor , of which he heartily approved . ' It 's deplorablethat our short-sighted laws no longer permit it up North , ' said Nicholas , ' though it 's true our climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked of the loveliness of Southern gardens , of the charm of old cities like Savannah and Charleston , and the coach rolled steadily onward . At Pelham he turned to her , saying , There 's a tavern here where we can get some wine and food if you want to , though everything 's prepared for us in town . ' She was chilled and faint , but she saw that he did not want to stop. pI71No , ' she murmured , ' I 'm all right . Let 's go on if you want . ' ' Good , ' he said softly , in the darkness . ' We shall go on . ' Go on to what ? she thought , and panic broke through . Last night when she had gone to the little attic room Abigail had tried to talk to her . nanny  --  I hardly know how to  --  how to prepareyou  --  ' Her mother had paused , slow color flushing her thin cheeks . She had turned from Miranda , fixing her unhappy eyes on the room 's farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it  --  no matter what  --  you must do as he wishes . You see  --  ' Yes , Ma  --  I know , ' Miranda had interrupted . She too was embarrassed , but stronger than that was the feeling of desecration . Even her mother might not touch on any aspect of the miracle that was occurring , the unbelievable joy of her union with Nicholas . She had stopped Abigail from further speech by running to her trunk and making pretense of last-minute packing . She remembered now her mother 's look of pity and the sudden mist in the sharp anxious eyes . She had resented the pity , thinking how little her mother knew of love , and that whatever marriage proved to be  --  and she had lied to her mother , for she had only the haziest idea of its intimacies  --  how could she fear it with Nicholas ? Their love would make everything simple and easy , she had thought , forgetting how often she had feared him in the past . And now they were married , and the magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings as she had expected . She knew him no better than she had before . But it will be all right , she told herself . I 'm foolish to feel frightened . All brides feel this way . Even Tabitha did , I know she did . She gave a choked sigh , and Nicholas looked at her . We 're nearly home , ' he said . ' See , these are the lights of Yorkville ; only three more miles . ' ' Is your house right in town ? ' she asked , now as anxious as he for the relief of impersonal talk . ' Yes , and at the rate the city is growing it will be downtown soon . The house is built on the site of one of the Van Ryn farms , next to old Petrus Stuyvesant 's own bouerie . ' ' Oh  --  ' she said , ' and what is a bouerie ? ' He explained briefly that it was Dutch for farm , and while the carriage continued down the Post Road , which was now called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter 's Field at Fiftieth Street , the dim bulk of the Croton Reservoir at Forty-Second Street , Peter Cooper 's residence on Twenty-Eighth . On Tenth Street they turned east to Stuyvesant Street and the horses , knowing their nearness to the stable , broke into a canter . She saw a flash of open iron gates , the curve of a short drive , and the carriage stopped before a large , three-storied brick house with a graceful white portico . Nicholas took her arm and ushered her through the front door into a paneled hall which seemed to her , tired as she was and giddy with excitement and weariness , to be filled by bobbing , whitecappedheads . ' This is your mistress , ' said Nicholas , thrusting her forward , and a confusion of voices chorused , ' Welcome , Mrs. Van Ryn . ' Startled , she stepped back and looked behind her . Nicholas scowled , his grip tightened on her arm . ' Your servants are greeting you , ' he said . She stiffened , holding her cloak tight around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aprons and caps , the maroon liveries filed out . ' They 're all strangers  --  ' she whispered , while underneath her brain repeated dully , Mrs. Van Ryn . I am Mrs. Van Ryn . Miranda Wells is Mrs. Van Ryn . ' Of course , ' he answered , leading her into a small breakfast room where a table was spread by the fire . ' I dismissed all the Dragonwyck servants . Eat now , my dear  --  ' he indicated the table . ' You must be famished . ' ' All those servants are gone , ' she repeated , wondering . Tompkins , Annetje , Magda , all part of the Van Ryn household for years . Thank God they were gone : they would never have accepted or obeyed her . Was that why Nicholas dismissed them ? Had he seen how hard it would have been for her ? She looked at him gratefully . ' And old Zelie ? ' she asked . ' Zelie is dead . When I dismissed the others she refused to leave . She stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter . ' He moved to her side with a quick motion . ' Darling , this is our wedding night . Now that we are at last home , shall we not forget everything but us ? Here 's a glass of wine for you . Drink it . '  |p173The  supper was exquisitely prepared . There was cold capon in jelly , an oyster-and-mushroom patty , an elaborate frosted wedding cake topped by a spun sugar wreath of orange blossoms . But though the wine refreshed her a little , Miranda found that she could eat nothing . Nor did Nicholas ; and seeing that she had not touched her food , he rose . Come , ' he said . Color drained from her face and her throat grew dry as sand . They mounted the stairs through the quiet house ; he threw open a door on the landing and led her into the room he had prepared for her . He had had it redecorated in the Empire style : the finest woods both gilded and inlaid , azure satin draperies embroidered in rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hundred flowers that assailed her at the threshold , white roses and lilies which stood in porcelain vases upon the tables and shone with luminous whitenessin the light of long wax tapers . Two of these tapers had been placed in golden candlesticks , one on either side the bed . Her eyes slowly focused on these , moved to the masses of bridal flowers . Nicholas  --  no , ' she whispered , throwing out her hands with a convulsive and imploring gesture . ' Oh , do n't you see  --  the flowers and those candles by the bed  --  Do n't you remember  --  ' She gave a cry as he turned on her , his eyes blazing . She thought he was going to strike her and she recoiled against the wall . He did not strike her . He walked to the two tapers and blew them out . Then he came back to her . ' No  --  ' she cried . ' No , no , please  --  ' He picked her up and threw her across the darkened bed . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block away , rang the hour through a cold and misty dawn . A faint light stole between the blue draperies at the window . She had been waiting for this , her aching , tearless eyes fixed on the windows , as they had been for hours . She moved her body cautiously an inch at a time away from that other who slept beside her . With infinite care she raised her head , straining through the gloom to discover the things which she must put on . If she could assemble them , there must be some place that she could dress , some way to slip out . Though she had nop174money , her desperation would persuade someone , a teamster , or peddler , to take her along the road . The light strengthened and she moved again nearer the edge . She raised herself on one elbow , and on the white skin of her arms and breasts were livid marks . She moved her head farther , calculatinghow she might slide from the bed in one silent motion ; but her long flowing hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to loosen her hair , but she could not . She heard the difference in the quality of the breathing behind her , and she held her own breath . Saint Mark 's bell clanged once for the half-hour , and a chorus of chitterings arose from starlings who nested in the pear tree outside the window . She heard a distant cry on the street in front of the house . Milk , ho ! Come buy my nice fresh milk ! ' The town was awakening . She must hurry , hurry , hurry  --  She dug her fingernails into her palms . Stealthily as if it moved without her knowledge , her head turned and she looked down at the figure beside her . Her terror ebbed in diminishing waves , leaving amazement . This was not the same man who had inflicted on her the luridstreakedblackness of those hours just past , who had violated withoutpity her soul as well as her body . This was not the aristocratic lord of Dragonwyck , nor even the charming and responsive companionshe had known once or twice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; almost a boy he looked with his black hair rumpled as she had never seen it and the cruel lines about his mouth smoothed away . He sighed a little as she stared down at him , and moved his hand . She saw then that his cheek and his right hand lay on her hair , and her throat tightened , for his unconscious position and movement were unmistakable . It was as though he turned in appeal , blindly seeking comfort in the soft masses of gold that lay outspread on the pillow . His eyes opened and he looked up at her . She braced herself for the change to the expression she knew so well , the cold intensity that held no kindness . But he gazed at her quietly seeing the sharp inrush of fear in her face . ' Miranda  --  ' he whispered , with pleading . Still she hesitated , her body curved and poised for flight.  |p175His  lips twisted into the shadow of a smile , a smile tinged with sadness . ' You ca n't leave me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing but death will ever separate us . ' ' No , ' she whispered . ' I do n't know . I 'm afraid . ' Tears began to roll down her cheeks . He raised his arms and pulled her gently down to him . Her taut body relaxed . This is the way he really is , she thought . I must never forget that no matter what he does or says , he 's really good and he does love me . It was the beginning of a long and painfully maintainedself-deception , for the precise type of goodness and love for which her heart yearned had not existed in Nicholas since he was twelve , and his mother died.  |p176THE  FIRST WEEKS OF MIRANDA 'S MARRIAGE WERE happy . Nicholas , during that period , was usually the husband she had dreamed of  --  tender and indulgent . The horror of her weddingnight faded , for Nicholas showed her no more violence . She forgother fears , and began to bloom with a softer and maturer loveliness . Her arms , her bosom , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her beauty , no longer ethereal , became seductive , and was enhanced by the magnificent wardrobe which Nicholas provided for her . Some of this wardrobe she found ready waiting in the closets of her dressing-room . It had been made by Madame Duclos from the old measurements . But Nicholas also furnished her with a list of other shops , mantua makers and milliners , directingher to buy whatever she liked . She spent many hours reveling in the fairy-tale unreality of ordering not one , but six leghorn or satin bonnets trimmed with point d'esprit , imported French flowers , or the finest ostrich plumes . In her excitement she bought far more than she could hope to wear , even if she changed her whole costume five times a day , and she made some mistakes . She was n't able to resist a vermilion taffeta dress which darkened her hair and dulled her complexion . But on the whole her natural clothes sense guided her . Nicholas put no curb on her buying orgy , saying : ' I want you to be well dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon we 'll begin to entertain a little ; you must learn to take your proper place in society . ' This prospect frightened her , for Nicholas expected a great deal . She must be beautiful , cultured , and witty and she must be a brillianthostess , so that the Van Ryn reputation for **25;9134;TOOLONG might not only be maintained but acquire added luster . During Johanna 's lifetime this hospitality had been largelyp177Nicholas ' concern ; the first Lady of the Manor had had no interest in anyone who did not belong to the river families , and to all other guests had shown a passive indifference . But from Miranda he demanded active co-operation . She must understand current topics : the stormy Oregon question , the annexationof Texas as a slave state , the immediate probability , in view of President Polk 's attitude , of a war with Mexico . She must be able to discuss Mr. and Mrs. Kean 's Shakespearean productions , the singing of Madame Borghese at Castle Garden , or Donizetti 's new music for Sir Walter Scott 's The Bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opinion on the remarkable results of mesmerism . She must above all take an intelligent interest in the new books which were appearing from England : Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton 's strange romance , ' Zanoni , ' a Mr. Thackeray 's ' Notes from Cornhill to Cairo , ' Mr. Dickens ' scandalous treatment of America in ' Martin Chuzzlewit . ' Miranda raced through these as Nicholas gave them to her , payingdutiful attention to the passages he marked , for each morning after breakfast they went to the little study off the drawing-room for an hour of concentrated instruction . He was a good teacher , stern over any negligence in her study , but gifted with the ability to make a subject vivid . She slipped easily into the pupil-teacher relationship with him at these times , and was grateful as she began to appreciate the completeness of her former ignorance . She had little intellectual curiosity and she accepted all Nicholas ' pronouncements without question . He said that Walter Scott 's historicalromances were overrated , and that Dickens ' novels were vulgar , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic about Emerson 's Essays ; their militant individualism agreed perfectly with Nicholas ' own conviction . He required that she learn by heart certain passages from ' Self-Reliance . ' ' Let us bow and apologize never more . A great man is coming to eat at my house . I do not wish to please him ; I wish that he should wish to please me . . . . A true man belongs to no other time or place , but is the center of things . . . . Let a man then know his own worth and keep things under his feet . ' This she accepted without question as applying to Nicholas or perhaps any man ; it never occurred to her to make application to herself . But there was one sentence from the same essay which shocked her . ' As men 's prayers are a disease of the will , so are their creeds a disease of the intellect . ' ' Oh , Nicholas  --  ' she cried when she read this . ' What a dreadful thing to say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up from the book and regarded her with tolerant amusement . ' My dear child , no intelligent person believes in God . Only the immature and ignorant need a prop from without ; there is no god but one 's self . ' I do n't believe it ! ' she cried indignantly . It was true that the family prayers and incessant Bible reading had sometimes bored her , and that in church her mind often wandered , but she had guiltily recognized these derelictions as faults in herself ; they had nothing to do with the eternal verities , Heaven , salvation , and God . ' You ca n't really mean that , ' she persisted , thoroughly aroused . ' It 's wicked , Nicholas , and if you are n't a true believer why do you go to church ? ' His amusement deepened . He had never before seen her spirited and indignant . It became her . Her long eyes flashed hazel fire , her pouting mouth was mutinous . He shut the book , leaned back and crossed his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example to my tenants . The lower classes need idolatry , it steadies them . ' For the first time she felt resentment at this calm superiority which she had always admired . ' And what about me ? ' she said hotly . ' I believe in religion , is that because I 've come from the " lower classes " ? ' He shrugged his shoulders and stood up . ' Very likely , my dear one . But you 'll get over it . I 'll see that you do . ' ' No  --  ' she cried , never ! ' He stood quiet looking at her averted head . She felt the changing quality of the silence . ' Come here , Miranda  --  ' he said softly . I wo n't , she thought , I wo n't go to him or look at him . She felt the power of his will beating on her . Her head turned . Slowly she raised her eyelids . He sketched a brief motion with his arms , and while her mind still resisted , her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not shown her since the first night . But now his violence gave her a dark pleasure . She clung to him , yielding . At once he released her , withdrawing his arms so abruptly that she lost her balance and swayed against the table . He gave a short laugh . ' Arrange your dress , my dear , the servants might come in . ' She flushed scarlet , pulling up the shoulder of her blue morning gown . Even her humiliation was overshadowed by a sense of being degraded , of having lost part of her integrity . She turned from him and went to the window , staring blindly at the passers-by on the sidewalk outside the gate . He watched her bent head , the white neck with its tendrils of gold curls , and his gaze softened . ' This afternoon , we might visit the American Museum , ' he said . ' It 's a pity that the theater season is over . ' She pressed her cheek against the window pane , not moving . I 'm not a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered a treat the next . But she knew that Nicholas was making an extraordinaryconcession . She had longed to see Mr. Barnum 's collection of marvels , whose fame had long ago reached Greenwich , but Nicholas had . refused to take her . Such exhibitions were cheap and fit only for yokels . Except for her drives in the closed carriage to the dressmaker , she had seen nothing of New York . Society had left them to the conventionalseclusion of the honeymoon period ; no one would call on the bride until signaled to do so by receiving invitations to a party . She turned at last from the window and Nicholas met her with one of his astonishing changes of mood . ' Shall we pass the remainder of the day exactly as you 'd like to ? ' he asked , smiling . ' You shall see whatever sights you want , and I 'll not object , I promise . ' I 'll never understand him , never , she thought , staring at his smile , which was frank , open , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the impersonal schoolmaster , or that half an hour ago he had treated her to a brutal passion followed by indifference . ' Come , my dear one , ' he said . ' What shall it be ? Barnum 's freaks ? The minstrel show ? The pantomime at Niblo 's Gardens ? Or all of them ? ' pI80'Oh , Nicholas , could we ? ' she cried , dazzled out of her resentment by this catalogue of amusements which she had longed to see . He jerked the bell-pull . ' I 'll order the carriage . You change to a walking costume , not too elegant , for I do n't want you to be conspicuous . ' She chose a simple sapphire-colored cashmere with a modified hoop , black gloves and shawl , and a black satin bonnet trimmed with sapphire ribbons . She found when she joined Nicholas on the stoop that he was also dressed in a subdued manner  --  slate-colored suit , plain white shirt , and buff cravat . You look most charming for our democratic expedition , ' he greeted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He had even ordered the open victoria , to which he usually objected because he disliked curious stares . The May day was warm and brilliant ; along Lafayette Street the budding elms and maples were tipped with fresh tender green . Geraniums bloomed in window boxes and reflected rose on the faces of the passers-by , who walked alertly , buoyed by the electric sparkle of the New York air in spring . Miranda , basking in the sunlight , excited by the people , the motion of the carriage , and anticipation , pressed her gloved hands tight together in the old childish gesture of delight . The day was perfect . If only Nicholas does n't  --  if only he  --  she thought , unwilling to be more specific . It would be foolish to spoil this pleasure by dread of the moods which transformed him between one minute and the next . When they reached Mott Street , he said : ' It 's after two . Shall we dine before we go to the Museum , and what sort of an eating place would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' She considered a moment . ' I 'd like something different , please . Lots of people laughing , and music , and do you suppose I could have fried clams and crullers ? ' He laughed . ' Certainly you may . ' ' But  --  ' she added , could we go to the museum first  --  Oh , look ! ' she cried , interrupting herself and forgetting that it was rude to point . ' What a queer-looking man ! Oh , what is he ? ' Along the eastern sidewalk there shuffled a figure in black silk with a high-necked jacket . His face was yellow , his arms were folded in his loose sleeves , a small black cap surmounted a shaven head from which dangled a long tail of coarse hair.  |p181'That  's a Chinaman , my dear , ' said Nicholas . ' There must be about a hundred Chinese living in that section . The first ones came some years ago , when a Chinese junk sailed home without them . Our country , ' he added with a trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreigners . It 'll be increasingly hard for the ruling class to govern them properly . ' ' Maybe they 'll all mix up together , ' she said vaguely . She knew little of the torrent of Irish , Germans , and Scandinavians which poured into New York . Still less of the black stream which flowed steadily from the Congo to the Southern States . ' Oh , there 's the museum ! ' she cried , happily gazing at the high white building on Park Row . It was decorated with American flags , and painted on its facade , one between each window , were the oval portraits of impossible animals tastefully picked out in crimson and gold . Nicholas dismissed the coachman , paid twenty-five cents admissionfor each of them , and they joined the crowd of farmers , sailors , immigrants , and children who had come to be thrilled by Barnum 's marvels . Miranda rushed from exhibit to exhibit , tugging in her excitementat Nicholas ' arm but grateful for his protection and the expert way in which he opened a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ' Educated Dogs ' and the ' IndustriousFleas ' ; horrified by the Fat Boy , the Giants , the Albinos , and the thirty-foot boa constrictor which lay torpidly coiled around a large egg . This egg , said a sign over the cage , contained ' a fearsomejuvenile sarpint , ' which added to the horror . She was impressed by the Moving Diorama of the Funeral of Napoleon Bonaparte , and the ' very particular identical ' club which killed Captain Cook in the Fiji Islands . Still more awed by an old colored woman , who doddered and chattered to herself upon a high platform . ' Joyce Heth , ' said the sign , ' is 161 years old . She was George Washington 's nurse , and used to dandle him on her knee . ' ' How wonderful ! ' breathed Miranda , staring with all her might at this remarkable being who had bridged the distance from the dim historical past of the country to now . Nicholas forbore to tell her that this was the third Joyce Heth so exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to the gem of the collection . At the far end of the hall separated by red velvet ropes from the lesser attractions , General Tom Thumb dressed in full military uniform lolled upon a miniature golden throne . He was no bigger than a six-months-old baby , and although he was actually a child , his tiny good-humored face was shrewd and knowing . ' Oh , is n't he sweet ! ' cried Miranda , adding her bit to the chorus of feminine admiration . A heavy man with a beard stood behind the tiny General 's throne ; he looked sharply at Miranda and then at Nicholas , bent down and whispered in the dwarf 's ear . The little creature jumped up and advancing to the edge of his platform held out his hand to Nicholas . ' Mr. Barnum is honored to see you in his museum , Mr. Van Ryn , ' he piped . ' Shall I dance the Highland Fling for you ? ' The crowd drew back murmuring and staring at the Van Ryns . Miranda flushed at their sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his business to recognize anyone of the slightest importance , felt a glow of flattered vanity . Nicholas , however , frowned ; but he touched the infantile hand , answering that they would be gratified to see the Highland Fling . When the dance was finished , Nicholas hurried Miranda away before Barnum could come around in front and accost them . ' Yes , I 'm ready to go . It 's been splendid , but just one more exhibit , please , Nicholas . ' She pointed to a red-and-white sign which said ' To the Egress ' and was further embellished by an arrow which indicated a mysterious passageway . ' Oh , do let 's see the Egress ! ' she pleaded . He looked down at her serious , expectant face . ' Certainly , my dear . It 's of all things what I most want to see . ' Delighted with his enthusiasm , and still unsated , she pressed ahead eagerly as they entered the dark hall which presently turned into a flight of stairs that ended in a door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight , she looked around her . ' Where 's the egress ? ' she asked , puzzled . He gave one of his rare laughs and indicated the door . ' You just passed through it . That 's Barnum 's way of getting rid of the stupid crowds . ' You might have told me , she thought . Might have prevented me from making a fool of myself too . The trivial incident hurt her.  |p183If  one really loved a person , one protected them from humiliation , one did not laugh . But he does love me , she thought fiercely . He is doing all this today just to please me . And , indeed , Nicholas lived up to his bargain as he would always fulfill any program upon which he himself had decided . They walked to Franklin Street and dined at Contoit 's New York Gardens ' at a small wooden table under a chestnut tree . A German band provided the noise for which Miranda had longed ; she had her fill of fried clams and crullers and her first taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy and contented . The sleepinesspassed , but the contentment sharpened into bliss , for it seemed that they had barely begun their rounds of diversion . They picked up the carriage and drove to Palmo 's Opera House to see the black-faced minstrel show . With absorbed attention she followed the jokes which flew from the end men to ' Mr. Bones ' ; her small slippered foot tapped time to Doo-dah , Doo-dah . Gwine to run all night . Gwine to run all day .  --  Bet my money on de bobtailnag  --  Somebody bet on the bay . ' And after that there was still Niblo 's . Here they had ices and wine , before strolling through a gallery of paintings , and attending the Ravels ' marvelous pantomime of Hades , complete with devils , ghosts , and skeleton deaths . Besides the theater and the picture gallery , Niblo 's amusement palace offered an exhibition of exotic and indigenous plants . ' Here 's something you 'll really enjoy , Nicholas ! ' cried Miranda as they passed the entrance of the Botanical Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine as you grow in Dragonwyck greenhouses . Look , there are orchids and camellias and oleanders . ' He was silent so long that she thought he had n't heard her . She looked up inquiringly and saw that he was staring not into the perfumed dampness of the hall but at her . The coldness that she dreaded had suddenly appeared in his eyes , but they held as well a faint ironic questioning . ' Do n't you want to see the flowers ? ' she asked nervously . ' Not particularly , ' he answered . He drew out his gold watch . ' We 'll be late for the pantomime if we do n't hurry . ' He does n't want to be reminded of Dragonwyck yet , she thought . The memories are still too painful . A jealous misery stirred in her . Since the moment of their meeting at the Wells farm neither of them had ever mentioned Johanna 's name . Can it be , she thought with sudden anguish , that he misses her ? No , it is n't possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young and so ignorant of men that I never know what he is really feeling ? she wondered as they drove home up Broadway . It was late ; moonlight silvered the brownstone houses and the Gothic splendor of the newly completed Grace Church . It eclipsed the disheartened flicker from the gas street lamps . Few sounds disturbed the quiet  --  an occasional snatch of song or laughter from the shuttered houses , the steady clop-clop of their horses ' hoofs on the cobblestones . ' Have you enjoyed yourself , Miranda ? ' he asked as the carriage turned east on Eighth Street . ' Oh , yes  --  ' she cried . ' It 's been wonderful ! ' And moved by an impulse of loving gratitude , she slipped her hand into his . His fingers remained slack and unresponsive , her hand lay unwelcomed . She withdrew her hand and averted her head . The passing gas lamps blurred and ran together . Why did he act that way ? Why would n't he respond to her simple , natural gesture ? A flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural ; these qualities were as absent from his treatmentof her as they were absent from his complex personality . She had not , as yet , enough introspection to realize that part of his fascination for her had arisen from his unpredictability , and her conception of him as a mysterious being from a superior world who had miraculously condescended to desire her . Nor did she realize how tightly she was enmeshed by his physical attraction , a bondage woven not only from the magnetism of his body but from the very fear and pain he caused her . ' You 're crying , Miranda ? ' he asked in a tone of amusement . ' Kindly spare the coachman your sorrows anyway . It 's a singular way to end what you assure me has been a happy day . ' She pressed her handkerchief against her mouth , controlled the shaking of her shoulders . The carriage drew up to their stoop ; she stumbled out before it had fairly stopped , frantic to get away , to be alone , locked into a room  --  alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gravel on her right ankle . She gave a sharp cry and Nicholas was beside her on the instant . He picked her up in his arms , carried her into the house and upstairs.  |p185The  ankle was not badly wrenched , and as the pain abated she watched her husband with amazement . For it was Nicholas who bathed and bound it for her , touching the swollen foot as tenderly as would a woman . He refused to call the maid and himself undressedher . He ordered port wine and held the glass , watching her anxiously while she sipped it . When he had made her comfortable in bed with her foot on a pillow , he lay down beside her and drew her head to his shoulder . He held her without passion , as though she were a child . How can he be so cruel to me at times  --  and then like this ? she thought . And again her awakening perceptions gave her the answer . He would hurt her himself , take pleasure in doing so , but he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . A week later a few select members of New York society received engraved cards bidding them to a soiree and supper at the Nicholas Van Ryns ' on Thursday , May the twenty-eighth , at seven o'clock . Miranda 's debut was not to be a large affair and Nicholas had hand-picked the list : Schermerhorns , Brevoorts , and the Hamilton Fishes to represent the Knickerbocker ' aristocracy . Old Philip Hone and his wife , because Mr. Hone who had once been Mayor of New York , was amusing , and went everywhere . After some hesitation all the Astors had been invited : the senile John Jacob , the William B. 's and their son John Jacob , Junior , with his fiancee , Miss Gibbes . That the Astors were the richest family in the country influenced Nicholas not at all , and certainly did not outweigh their lowly German background . But he approved the fine new mansion on Lafayette Place and young John Jacob 's cool gravity . Moreover , his fiancee , Charlotte Gibbes , came from an excellent Southern family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there or rounded out the list with a few more of the elite , the Aspinwallsperhaps or the Verplancks , but he was indifferent to the high boundaries which separated the sections of New York society , knowing that any gathering was enlivened by a touch of the exotic ; accordinglyhe asked Madame Teresa Albanese , who had been singingat Castle Garden , Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet , a sharp-tongued poetess from the Ladies ' Literati Group , and Herman Melville , a young sailor who had just published a book called Typee ' which was startling the reading world not only by the originality of its vivid prose but by its titivating descriptions of naked Polynesian maidens . For days Miranda had been worrying about the party which was to present her publicly as Mrs. Nicholas Van Ryn . Her nervousnessovershadowed President Polk 's declaration of war against Mexico . After all , everyone had expected the war , and whatever was happening was so far away in places with outlandish names , Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma . In this she reflected Nicholas ' own lack of interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare war , ' he said , ' but I daresay we 'll win and the country will be much enlarged . At any rate there 'll be another slave state for the South . ' ' Wo n't the North mind ? ' asked Miranda , remembering the Abolitionist torchlight parade that she had watched from her window . ' Very likely , ' he answered , shrugging . ' I do n't doubt that the North and South will be at each other 's throats some day . ' ' You mean they 'll fight each other ? ' she asked , startled . ' Oh , but they could n't , it 's the same country . Why ca n't things go on as they are ? ' ' Because men are fools , ' said Nicholas , and changed the subject . ' By the way , the little Count de Grenier is back in New York . He arrived on the Celtic yesterday and sent me a note . I 've asked him to the soiree . His wife did n't come with him this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted , remembering the plump Frenchman and his gaiety and compliments at Dragonwyck . How long ago it seemed ! The night of the Fourth-of-July Ball ! The Coryantis Waltz with Nicholas . That was when I first knew that I loved him , she thought , and there was pain in the memory . She had been happy that night for a while , but there had been humiliation too  --  from the Van Rensselaer girls  --  from Johanna . ' Nicholas , ' she said abruptly , ' when are we going to Dragonwyck ? ' Her heart beat fast as she waited for his answer . Yet why should she be frightened of so natural a question ? The Manor House was his real home , as it was now hers . ' Why , it wo n't be ready until the end of June , ' he said . ' The workmen are there now , painting and making certain changes . I think we 'll leave here in a fortnight and go to the Mountain House at Catskill to escape the heat before we go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How silly she 'd been ! Imagining thatp187he avoided not only the mention of Dragonwyck 's name but any thought of living there . She was completely wrong , as she so often seemed to be with Nicholas . It 's like Ma used to say , she thought ruefully ; I 've a head stuffed full of silly fancies . She went upstairs to her writing desk and wrote a long , rapturous letter to her mother , detailing her happiness and Nicholas ' virtues as a husband . When Abigail received this letter three days later and first read it , she was reassured . She passed it on to Ephraim . ' Seems contented as a pig in clover . I told you to stop fretting about her , ' he commented , handing the letter back . But Abigail , again running her eyes over the flowing script , frowned . ' I do n't know , though ; she says almost too much . Seems like she was trying to convince herself as well as me . ' Land o ' Goshen , Abby ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Good Lord handed you a golden crown you 'd worry for fear maybe it was plated . Ranny 's happy and she says so . What more d'ye want ? ' Nothing , I guess , ' said Abigail , sighing . She plunged her fingers into the soft feathers of the goose she was plucking when Miranda 's letter arrived . On the afternoon of the party , Miranda lay in the darkened bedroom and tried to rest . The hairdresser had come and gone and she dared not move her head for fear of disturbing his handiwork . Everything was ready , thanks to Nicholas and the staff of experiencedservants , who neither needed nor welcomed her timid suggestions . ' Do n't fash yoursel , ' madam , ' said Mrs. MacNab , the Scotch housekeeper , when Miranda asked if the ices had yet arrived from the caterers . The Maister 's given strict orders , and Sandy and me 'll tak ' care of ever-r-a thing . ' They treated her like a charming but useless child , and Miranda overcame annoyance with the realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to meet people , she thought with rising excitement , shutting her eyes determinedly , though sleep was impossible . Except on the day of their expedition , and on occasions when she had gone to services at Saint Mark 's Church around the corner , she had during these weeks seen no one but the servants  --  and of course , Nicholas.  | 8 8 Not that , she told herself hastily , she wanted anyone but Nicholas . It was n't that she was lonely , but sometimes she longed for a friend . Another woman with whom she might discuss silly things like clothes or embroidery stitches . With another woman one could laugh and say the first words that popped into one 's head . Instead of being on guard , and anxious . There was a knock on her door and Mrs. MacNab came in holding a letter . ' Just came for you , madam . ' From Ma ! thought Miranda eagerly . But it was n't from Abigail . The handwriting was unfamiliar and the postmark was Hudson , New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Jefferson Turner . ' How strange that he should write to her ! She had seldom thought of him since the week that he had stayed on the farm , and so compellinghad been her preoccupation with Nicholas at that time that aside from gratitude for his help in saving Charity he had made little impression on her except as an instrument for delivering Nicholas ' message . My dear Miranda said the letter : I have recently heard of your marriage . I confess it was a great surprise . I hope you 'll be very ' happy . When you come up-river , I shall not be here to congratulate you because I 've joined the army and leave at once for Mexico . I do n't know what sort of a soldier I 'll make but I guess they need doctors anyway . Please remember me to your family when you write . I hope all will go well with you . God bless you . It had taken Jeff a long time to write that letter . He never would have written it but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to return . If a Mexican bullet did n't do the job , yellow fever or dysentery almost certainly would . He had understated the matter when he wrote that Miranda 's marriage was a surprise . He had been thunderstruck , then this emotion had given way to blinding anger , a veritable fury at Nicholas . The fury had been enlightening , and when he calmed down he faced its origin squarely . Jealousy , and a feeling for Miranda which would not in the least tolerate the thought of her as another man 's wife. pI89Ephraim had not been far wrong when he had told Abigail that Jeff would return to Greenwich , for that had been in his mind . All along , Jeff realized now , he had been marking time , waiting for Miranda to recover from her obsession . And yet this feeling had stolen upon him so gradually that he had been unaware of it . ' Why in the name of all that 's foolish do I want that girl ? ' he asked himself derisively when the news of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  badly . But being Jeff he wasted no time in moping . He translated his feelings into action . He would have enlisted in any case , not being troubled by any hairsplittings as to President Polk 's exact motives . The country was at war , and he was needed . That was enough for Jeff . But a decided unwillingness to see Miranda ensconced at Dragonwyck as Nicholas ' wife speeded up his decision . Then he wrote to her . Miranda , knowing nothing of this , was puzzled and touched by his letter . There had been antagonism between them from the first . Even during his stay at the farm she had thought that he disliked her . Now it seemed that he did not . She was still staring at the sheet of paper when Nicholas opened her door and looked in . ' You 're not resting ? ' he said disapprovingly . He walked over to the bed . ' What are you reading ? ' ' A letter from Doctor Turner , ' she answered . There was a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . ' She gave it to him , a trifle surprised . He never showed any interestin her letters from home . She watched him while he read and was puzzled to see tenseness vanish from his face , and in his eyes a fleeting impression of  --  what ?  --  satisfaction  --  relief  --  she could n't be sure . ' He handed back the letter . ' I find his tone rather familiar . Since when does he know you well enough to invoke the blessings of deity upon you ? ' ' He spent a week with us at the farm last fall , you know , ' she answered nervously . Nicholas ' question had held the frequent note of irony ; she was n't sure whether he was really displeased or not . And if he were displeased at her receiving a letter from another man , why had there been that undoubted flicker of relief ? ' I did n't know he stayed a week , ' said Nicholas without par- titular emphasis . ' But he 's a pleasant young man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed his company  --  ? ' There was no mistaking the sarcastic inflection this time . She turned her head wearily , settling back on the pillow . ' No  --  ' she said , ' I thought only of you . ' The little Count de Grenier arrived first at the soiree . He had grown stouter during the year he had been back at Lyons directing the silk business , of which certain matters of export had required this new trip to New York . His plum satin suit and embroidered vest fitted him like the casing on a sausage , but his black eyes were as lively and curious as ever , his waxed mustaches quivered with the same zest . He had been very much interested by the change in the Van Ryn menage , and was impatient to see Miranda in her new role . When she came , preceding Nicholas down the stairs , moving with her own peculiar grace and hesitating a minute on the threshold to master her nervousness , his Gallic heart was overcome . ' But she 's veritably beautiful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' She 's incredibly changed . ' He saw at once as no man but a Frenchman would have that part of the change came from outward adornment ; the cleverly cut white satin gown with black Chantilly lace ruffles , the touch of coral salve on the lips , the increased blondness of her hair , which she owed to the hairdresser 's camomile rinse . And then , of course , the Van Ryn diamonds sparkling on her bosom ! It was the first time that she had worn any of the jewels which had been presented to her by Nicholas ; she had done so tonight only because of his express command . Her resistance had died away when she saw how becoming were the newly cleaned and dazzling diamonds , but the great ruby pendant , the pendant Johanna had worn on the night of the ball , she felt that she could never touch . She had never even lifted it from the jewel case . The change in Miranda was , however , by no means entirely due to clothes or jewels or grooming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer and lost its provincial tone . She smiled and murmured with surprising poise , ' I 'm so happy to see you , Count . ' And her long eyes no longer met his with transparent innocence.  |p191She  was waking up , the little one , as well she might married to this handsome enigma . He reluctantly released Miranda 's fingers and turned to greet Nicholas . Ciel , what a couple ! Standing side by side in the doorway they were like one of Winterhalter 's smooth , impossibly perfect portraits . But it was a fairy tale come true , this marriage !  --  Cendrillon  --  he thought  --  the fat wife considerately dies , and the little country mouse captures her rich and handsome prince . Now they will live happy ever after . Where but in this amazing country could Fate be so kind ? The Count continued to enjoy himself . He delighted Mesdames Schermerhorn , Brevoort , and Fish by his gallantry and compliments . He knew this type in France  --  solid , well-born matrons who were grateful enough for masculine attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iniquities of the administration , the progress of the war , or , with increased tempo , the convenient manner in which ancestral farm lands on Manhattan turned themselves into valuable city real estate . That was the basis of all their fortunes , thought the Count , catching a phrase here and there while he amused Mrs. Fish with chitchatof Louis-Philippe 's court . The Van Ryns ' too . He felt a prick of envy , knowing that Nicholas had never had to think of money . He had an honest agent , shrewd enough to sell the Van Ryn holdings to an advancing city at good profit . But it did n't take much shrewdness. ( ' a marche tout seul , the Count reflected gloomily , and making graceful obeisance to the three ladies he maneuveredover to another group in the adjoining parlor . Here he found the Astor family clustered around old John Jacob , who persisted in going out of an evening though he invariably fell into a restless doze , his shrunken chin sunk on his chest , so that he presented to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Count had met the Astors before on his previous trip and had not found them stimulating . William and young John Jacob were both tight-lipped and dour men who took so long to answer a question that the Count 's volatile mind had forgotten it before they began . He had derived some amusement at parties in Paris from mimicking this trait of the richest family in America , but that was vieux jeu now . He bestowed an appreciative and sympatheticglance on Miss Gibbes , who was about to join her future to that of the sour-faced John Jacob , but then his eyes wandered.  | Over in the corner near the rosewood piano he saw Miranda talking to a big man with an astonishing golden beard which gave him a Jovian appearance and conflicted with the youthful awkwardnessof his gestures . Beside them sat a sharp little woman like a squirrel , her bright , malicious gaze fixed flatteringly on the bearded man , who seemed embarrassed . I must see what 's going on there , the Count promised himself , and cast around for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas provided , for he came up to them with the Philip Hones and the Count was released . He paused long enough before starting across the room to admire the effortless way in which Nicholas managed his guests . By a word , a smile , or a questionhe amalgamated the three groups  --  the men by the fireplace , the forsaken ladies by the window , and the Astor family . Soon he had them all talking and even old John Jacob woke up and contributedmumbling comment . He is suave , that Nicholas , the Count thought . When he wishes to be charming , he is irresistible . But I doubt very much that he always wishes to be charming . He approached Miranda and her two companions . She rose at once and said : ' Count , may I present you to Mrs. Ellet , she writes such delightful poems , and this gentleman is Mr. Herman Melville , who has just given us that fascinating book , " Typee. "  --  The Count de Grenier , ' she added to the others . Bravo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gracefulintroduction worthy of a duchess , except that duchesses always had bad manners , showed the vast distance she had come from the tongue-tied , nervous girl he remembered . ' I have heard of your so exquisite poetry , madame , ' he said quite untruthfully , bowing to Mrs. Ellet . ' And it is a great pleasure to meet two American authors . I have longed for the opportunity . ' He examined Melville curiously . He had not read Typee ' but he had heard of it , chiefly that it was indelicate according to the Anglo-Saxon standards set by the young English queen , and that it was so well written that most of the literary critics doubted that it could really be the work of an uneducated sailor . ' You have had an interesting life , monsieur , ' offered the Count , for the bearded young man seemed disinclined to say anything . ' Oh , yes , Count , ' cried Mrs. Ellet , clasping her hands in prettyp193pleading . ' Mrs. Van Ryn and I are just dying to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  too , too dreadful . ' Melville turned his massive head and contemplated Mrs. Ellet with calm , sea-colored eyes . ' The Marquesans are not cannibals , ' he said , ' but I would n't blame ' em if they ate up the missionaries . ' Mrs. Ellet gave a piercing scream of laughter . ' Oh , my , how very droll you are ! Why , I give five dollars every Sunday to send to the missionaries who convert the poor , naked heathen . ' ' Then you 'd better save your money , ma'am ; they 're much better off as heathen . ' He lowered his gaze to Mrs. Ellet 's decollete , which revealed a great deal of craggy bosom . ' And they 're no more naked than you are , ' he added with emphasis . The lady flushed furiously . The Count quivered with repressed mirth . But Miranda , horrified by this contretemps , for surely an accomplishedhostess would have prevented it , brought out the first thing she could think of . ' Mr. Melville comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hastily , with a confused idea of mollifying Mrs. Ellet . ' His mother was a Gansevoort . ' ' Indeed , ' said the insulted lady , dripping ice . ' Ah , look who is coming , here ! ' cried the Count , tactfully creatinga diversion and recognizing a familiar European figure . ' It is La Albanese herself . Now we shall have a treat ! ' They all turned to see Nicholas greeting a vision in orange satin and rhinestones . The Italian singer radiated good nature and peasant vitality from her oily black hair to the broad feet on which she wore dirty red slippers . She pumped Nicholas ' hand in a cordial grip , seized Miranda 's , and pulling the girl toward her crying Ah , que bella ! La bimba ! ' implanted a garlic-laden kiss on Miranda 's forehead . She waved to the Count , whom she had met in Paris . ' So ' appy to see everywan , ' she boomed , describing a sweeping gesture . ' Now I seeng for you . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musk through the rooms . ' Who will accompanee me ? ' she cried , drawing a sheaf of music from under her arm . ' I shall give myself that pleasure , signora , ' said Nicholas , bowing and seating himself on the stool . Mrs. Schermerhorn raised her lorgnette and peered doubtfully at La Albanese . An Italian opera singer in the drawing-room ! Most startling ! In any other house she would have been affronted.  | But Mr. Van Ryn 's reputation for conservatism and savoir-faire was impregnable . And his blood was of the bluest . Before the rich earthy voice had finished the Carta Diva ' from ' Norma , ' Mrs. Schermerhorn had relaxed and was wondering if it would be possible to persuade Madame Albanese to appear at a little soiree next week . Gradually according to their separate natures they , all succumbed to the spell . The singer had great artistry , her flexible voice fell pure and true on the exact middle of each note , but far more persuasivethan that was the vitality that flowed from her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sapete ' from the ' Marriage of Figaro , ' and the mad scene from the new Lucia : And the applause was much louder than the decorous gloved spatter expected in a drawing-room . La Albanese bowed , flashing a toothy , delighted smile . ' Never ' ave I seeng so good , ' she announced , beaming . But she knew what none of the audience had enough musical knowledge to guess , and she swept ' round dramatically , extending her hands to Nicholas . ' But eet ees you who inspire me , signor . You play con fuoco , con amore  --  maraviglioso ! Nevaire do I teenk to find soch playing een America . ' ' You do me too much honor , madam , ' murmured Nicholas , smiling . Tiens , thought the Count , craning to see his host , who was hidden behind the music rack , that 's true . Who would expect to find so much fire and brilliance in a man like that ? The Count ran over to himself the many social gatherings he had attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman concern himself with music , beyond lending an embarrassed tenor to a duet with a young lady . Piano playing was entirely relegated to the fair sex : And yet no one could possibly think Nicholas effeminate . He was unclassifiable , thought the Count crossly ; like all his countrymen he liked analysis which resulted in things being neatly labeled and docketed . Now I geef you a song een Eenglish , ' announced Madame Albaneseproudly , and the Count moved his chair a trifle so that he might see Nicholas . The diva sang Maritana 's plaintive ballad , ' Scenes That Arep195Brightest , ' contriving somehow to invest the trite words and simple melody with an indescribable pathos . The tragedy of vain hope , of unfulfilled love . During the singing of this ballad , the Count saw Nicholas turn his head so that his intense blue gaze rested on Miranda 's averted face . There was longing in that look , an appeal . But when the girl shifted her position , unconscious of his glance , his eyes fell quickly to the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not right between those two , the Count reflected . Suddenly he was bored with his own speculations and delvings . Zut alors , he said to himself , stretching his plump legs , I make mysteries like an old woman . He wondered how long it would be until supper . He had not long to wait . The recital finished with a gay Italian folk song ; then amidst the chorus of appreciation , Madame Albanesebowing and smiling made her way to Miranda . I want the W.C. , ' she announced with simple Latin realism . Weel you show me ze way ? ' ' Oh  --  oh yes , ' stammered Miranda , blushing scarlet and hurryingthe prima donna from the room . More embarrassment awaited her upstairs , for her guest gave a cry of delight when she saw the bedroom . She admired the curtains , the rugs , the bed . Your ' usband mus ' be verra fine lover , ' said La Albanese enthusiastically , patting the bed . ' I can tell . You are lucky , bambina , and verra happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she responded to the genuine friendly interest in the shining black eyes . ' Of course , ' she said , ' very happy . ' La Albanese frowned , unsatisfied . But you are too serious ! ' She put her large orange silk arm around Miranda , enveloping the girl in scent and garlic and good will . ' Look , bimba  --  In my country we have a  --  how you say ?  --  a proverb . Amare , cantare , mangiare.  --  Loving , singing , eating  --  these are God 's three gifts . You don ' need more . ' Miranda smiled . How wonderful it would be if life were as easy as that ! But why ca n't it be ? she thought suddenly . And under the influence of that vibrant personality , she felt lighthearted and gay . When they got downstairs the guests were starting toward the dining-room . Nicholas came over to her and whispered , Everyone is delighted with you . The party is going well , ' so that her new mood was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the supper table , all nervousness forgotten . Nicholas had placed Madame Albanese between the Count and Herman Melville , knowing that the other gentlemen might find her a bit overpowering . But Melville did not ; he talked with animationand from time to time his laugh boomed out . Whereupon Mrs. Ellet glared at him across the table . She was placated , however , when Nicholas asked her about Edgar Poe , in whom she had a proprietary interest . The lady bridled , shaking her sparse ringlets . Poor Mr. Poe . Such misfortunes  --  his little wife  --  dying , I fear  --  and they 've moved miles out in the country to a positive hovel . ' She lowered her voice to a piercing whisper which immediately stopped all other conversation at the table . I feel so sorry for him  --  his terrible failing , you know  --  too dreadful ; and then this scandal with Mrs.  --  Oh  --  ' she cried with a little scream of confusion . ' Everyone is listening ! ' Everyone was , but with a collective start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them except Nicholas had much interest in the poet 's misfortunes ; they had simply been hypnotized by Mrs. Ellet 's whisper . Nicholas , however , felt otherwise , and to Miranda 's astonishment , for she thought Mrs. Ellet a vulgar and unpleasant woman , he engaged her to drive out to Fordham with them on Monday and introduce them to the Poe household . But why , Nicholas ? ' Miranda asked him later after the guests had gone . ' Why are we going to meet the Poes , and do n't you think that so much of Mrs. Ellet 's company will be tiresome ? ' ' I do , ' he answered . But we can hardly appear there without someone to introduce us . ' ' But why go at all ? ' she persisted . The expedition seemed to her highly unattractive , a hovel in the country , a drunken , and some said unbalanced , man with a wife who was dying of consumption . Nicholas ' mouth set . He disliked being questioned , nor was he accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dressing-table brushing her hair , which fell like a rich gleaming mantle nearly to the floor . In her cream lace negligeep197she looked very fresh and lovely , and she had behaved well tonight , had profited to perfection by his careful coaching . He suppressed the sarcastic and final reply which he had been going to give her . ' You would n't understand , my dear , ' he said . She put the brush down and turning on the satin seat looked up at him . ' Why would n't I ? ' she cried passionately . ' Why do you always shut me out ? Tell me sometimes what you 're thinking and feeling , before  --  ' she stopped . She had nearly said ' before it 's too late . ' How had so much emotion been aroused in her by so little ? No wonder he stared at her . He was silent for a second , then he pulled his violet dressinggowncloser around him and sat down in a chair opposite her . ' My love , ' he said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing to meet Poe were so important to you . I 'll gladly explain them . I admire the man 's genius , I sense in his writings a strong kinship with my own mind ; they have a macabre quality , a voluptuousflavor of mystery and evil which attracts me strongly . And I am curious to see his present degradation . It interests me . ' His ironic voice ceased , and she made a hopeless little gesture , while tears came to her eyes . Her mind was closed to the meaning of his words , some of which she did not know  --  ' macabre , " voluptuous . ' She had thought for a moment that he was really going to confide in her , to answer her appeal with frankness at last . It never occurred to her that under the masking lightness of his tone he had told her the simple truth . And he , seeing this , laughed . ' Come , my pretty one . It 's very late . Go to bed and do n't perplex yourself with matters you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT FOR THREE years , the visit to the strange and unhappy little household at Fordham had far-reaching effects on her life . On Monday she and Nicholas dined very early at one , picked up Mrs. Ellet at the exclusive boarding-house where the lady residedwhen she visited the city , continued up Broadway , crossed the Harlem River , and arrived at last upon the Kingsbridge Road . The day was exceedingly hot , typical of this summer of 1846 , which was to be the hottest that New York remembered . Inside the closed brougham it was oppressive and made Miranda feel languid ; she and Mrs. Ellet both used surreptitious handkerchiefs to remove tiny beads of perspiration from their upper lips . But Nicholas , who seemed impervious to temperature , was cool as usual while he questioned their guest on the various recent accomplishmentsof ' the starry sisterhood , ' as the feminine literati , Mrs. Anna Cora Mowatt , Margaret Fuller , Mrs. Osgood , and Anna Lynch , had come to be known to the irreverent . Eliza Ellet considered herself a whole blazing constellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the salon 's brilliance , even more delighted to recite little snatches of transcendental verse which she had herself indited ' in that hushed hour between midnight and dawn when Morpheus ' sable hands touch the rosy finger tips of Aurora and even the fairies are slumberingon their flowery couches , ' said Mrs. Ellet with a rapt look . But she spoiled this pretty fantasy by an uncontrollable sniff , and sudden , glistening pallor . ' It 's so warm , and there seems to be an odor of  --  ' she paused , '  --  of boiled ham . ' ' Oh , I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Eller , ' said Miranda , rousing herself , for the transcendental snatches had not held her attention . ' It mustp199be the hamper we 're taking to the Poes . You know you said it was the custom to take them something . ' A large wicker basket crammed with provisions , a roast chicken , a game pie , calves ' - foot jelly , and the offending ham had been placed under the seat . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine and a bottle of brandy . ' The port for the invalid , and the brandy for Poe , ' he explained to Miranda . ' Oh , but Nicholas  --  should we take spirits to him  --  if he has that  --  that failing ? ' she had protested . ' I hear he 's far more interesting when he 's drunk , and I intend to find out , ' said Nicholas . She did not feel quite the shock that this speech would have given her two months ago ; she was living in a new country where the moral precepts that had formed her conduct no longer prevailed . Now , while with courteous apology that his guest should have been made uncomfortable , Nicholas spoke to the coachman and had the hamper moved outside to the box , Miranda rested her head against the cushions and thought : I suppose I 'm too serious . Madame Albanese said so . The Poe cottage was not a hovel , but a small workman 's frame house with two doors and a porch wreathed in jasmine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a shading tulip tree , bees droned around the honeysuckle , and as the Van Ryn carriage approached , the monastery bells of the near-by College of Saint John clanged melodiously on the hot , still air . There was here a paradoxical effect of rustic peace . Paradoxical , because there was no peace within the house where a dying girl and a half-crazed genius were ministered to by the harassed and kindly mother , Mrs. Clemm . She hurried out of the kitchen door to greet Mrs. Ellet , who introduced the Van Ryns . Happy to see you , I 'm sure , ' said Mrs. Clemm . ' Eddie likes company , and my poor Virginia does too , though this is one of her bad days  --  poor lamb . Doctor Francis is with her now . ' She sighed , her plain middle-aged face puckered with anxiety . She was immaculate in her black dress and white cap with long lappets , but the dress was shiny and frayed , and Miranda noticed with pity that Mrs. Clemm 's right shoe had split and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p200'If  Mrs. Poe is ill  --  perhaps we should n't intrude ? ' said Nicholas , at the same time motioning to the coachman to bring the hamper . ' Oh , no , it 'll do ' em good , poor children , to see you and dear Mrs. Ellet . Come on in , do . ' She accepted the hamper gratefully without false pride , just as she accepted the Van Ryns ' visit . A good many people found their way out to Fordham  --  literary critics , editors , and feminine admirers  --  and it was on their occasional contributions of food and delicacies that the family largely subsisted . For poor Eddie never seemed to make any money , and somehow or other he always seemed to get at odds with the men who could help him . Mrs. Clemm ushered the visitors through a tiny whitewashed passage onto which opened a cubbyhole of a bedroom . There were but two other downstairs rooms , the kitchen and the parlor , both meagerly furnished and small , but all was scrubbed and shining with cleanliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitewashed walls , even the low raftered ceiling . Virginia lay on a makeshift sofa by the window ; her little wasted body hardly raised the covering quilt . Her face , of an unearthly pearly white , was framed by black hair , glossy and neat from her mother 's careful tending . Her eyes , brilliant with fever , were up ' turned to the elderly physician who sat beside her holding her wrist . As Mrs. Clemm motioned the others into the room , Poe rose from the rickety writing table where he had been hunched in apathetic despair . How short he is ! thought Miranda , surprised , for she and Mrs. Clemm both topped him by inches , and Nicholas ' height completely dwarfed the poet . She had come to judge all masculine appearance by the standard of Nicholas ' classically etched features , and though many women had found Poe attractive , Miranda did not . His high forehead bulged beneath straggling dark locks and seemed to overwhelm his mouth and chin so that his sallow face was pear-shaped . His mustache was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was slack beneath his eyes , gray eyes which could be magneticallypiercing and alert , but were now dulled by a recent dose of laudanum . He looked much older than his thirty-seven years . His greeting of Mrs. Ellet was unenthusiastic , for he knew her to be a malignant gossip whose tongue was largely responsible for the blackening of his platonic relationship with Mrs. Osgood.  |p201Miranda  , seeing this coldness , wished more than ever that they had not intruded themselves on the distressed family , but Poe 's dullness lightened and his tone warmed when he turned to the Van Ryns . It 's good of you to make the long drive from the city , ' he said , bowing to Miranda , and shaking Nicholas ' hand . I 'm sorry that we are at some disadvantage in welcoming you . ' He indicated Virginia 's couch . ' I admire your work immoderately , Mr. Poe , ' answered Nicholas at his most charming , and I could n't leave the city without giving myself the pleasure of meeting you and telling you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he brightened still further at the sincerity in Nicholas ' voice . You 've read some of my stuff ? ' he asked eagerly , adding with bitterness , " The Raven , " I suppose . Such fame as I have appears to rest entirely on the plumage of that gloomy bird . ' I 've read everything you 've ever published , ' replied Nicholas , obeying the other 's motion to seat himself on one of the stiff-caned chairs , both fiction and poetry . I find your stories provocative and fascinating , although I confess that I prefer the verse . There it seems to me that your genius reaches its highest peak . ' Poe thought so too , and when he found that Nicholas actually knew most of his poems by heart and could quote even from the obscurer ones , those which the public had long since forgotten , Tamerlane ' or The Sleeper , ' the gratified poet pulled his chair over and conversed animatedly . While the two men talked and Mrs. Ellet hovered beside them trying to interject literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew Miranda to the couch , where the doctor had finished his examination . The sick girl looked up at Miranda . So nice of you to come and see Eddie  --  ' she whispered . How pretty you are  --  ' she added , with naive sweetness . Miranda smiled , and clasped the transparent little hand . She was touched by the patience and gentleness of the childish face . For though Virginia was actually older than Miranda , neither poverty nor illness had aged her : she was the same docile child who had married her cousin Eddie ten years ago . I 'm sure you 'll be better soon , ' said Miranda , and knew immediatelyhow hollow was that conventional phrase , for the red spotsp202of the consumptive rushed to Virginia 's pale cheeks , a paroxysm of coughing shook the small body , while the handkerchief she pressed to her mouth was flecked with scarlet . ' Come away , ma'am , ' said the doctor brusquely to Miranda . ' She must n't talk just now . ' He took the girl 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in here , ' the doctor explained in answer to Miranda 's look of surprise . ' Too many people already . ' It was true , the sitting-room 's three chairs were occupied by Mrs. Ellet , Poe , and Nicholas , while on the far side Mrs. Clemm bent over her daughter , whose eyelids were drooping with exhaustion . ' Well , well  --  ' said the old man as they entered the kitchen , and his eyes twinkled . ' That poor creature in there 's right . You 're a well-shaped piece of woman-flesh , m ' dear . Glad to meet you . My name 's Francis . John Wakefield Francis . Expect you 've heard of me , hey ? ' And he chucked her under the chin . Miranda drew herself up , but it was impossible to resent Doctor Francis . His bonhomie , his genial appreciation of pretty women , and his vigor were only equaled by his generosity . His professional skill and purse were always at the command of the needy . ' I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York such a short time  --  ' And yet his name did have a reminiscent ring , though she was positive she had n't heard it recently . ' Sad household here , ' said the doctor , shaking his gray head . ' Sorry for all of ' em . Poor worms . Nothing but failure and trouble and sickness . Guess you do n't know much about those things  --  hey ? ' He peered at her rose moire dress , her lace-covered bonnet , the pearl earrings and brooch . ' No , ' she answered with a little inward shudder . ' I guess I do n't . ' ' Never be worth a damn till you do meet trouble and lick it , ' said the doctor , suddenly thumping the table with a stubby and not very clean hand . ' Ca n't live soft all the time or you turn to mush . You do n't want to be mush , do you ? ' ' No , ' she said , laughing . She saw that the doctor thought her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had then eliminated all taint of the potato farm , the drudgery of manual labor . And it was Nicholas who had translated her , she thought with gratitude . ' I 'd sell my soul for a cup of tea , ' muttered Doctor Francis , seizingp203a poker and rattling the stove 's grate . Long drive back , lot of patients to see tonight . Do n't suppose you know one end of a teakettlefrom the other ? ' She hesitated . A girl brought up as he thought she had been would never have been able to handle that balky stove . It would be easy to say no , to settle back with her hands folded and wait for Mrs. Clemm to come to the kitchen after finishing with Virginia . But the old man looked tired , and also he reminded her of someone ; somewhere below the surface of her mind there was a quiver of recognition , though as yet it sent up no conscious certainty . But the quiver was pleasant . Give it me , ' she said , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth around her waist to protect the swelling rose skirts from the stove . In a very short time the kettle was boiling . You 're not so useless as you look , my beauty , ' said the doctor . ' Here 's the tea . ' He pulled a packet from his sagging pocket . ' Would n't do to use any of their tea  --  doubt they have enough for themselves . ' At the precise moment in which she poured his tea for him , Miranda recovered the buried memory . Last fall in the farm kitchen at home , she had poured like this for Jeff on the night of his arrival when he had bored her with talk of cholera  --  and Doctor  --  surely it was Doctor Francis ! She sat down on the other chair , startled  --  not by the coincidence , nor by the fact that despite the difference in age there was some resemblance between the two physicians , but by her own emotion at thinking of Jeff . ' Do you know a Doctor Jefferson Turner of Hudson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ! ' the old man answered . But how do you  --  aye , I forgot , you Van Ryns live up-river there . Jeff Turner came to see me last year . I du n no as I ever took to anyone right off as I did to him . He 's a splendid boy and a damn good doctor . I offered to set him up in New York , like to 've kept him near me , but he 's got some bee in his bonnet about caring for the community where he grew up . And he do n't give a hang for money . ' No , ' she agreed , half-impatiently . From the beginning , Jeff 's frank contempt for the Dragonwyck luxury in which she had reveled had caused friction between them.  | Doctor Francis pushed his cup back with sudden explosiveness . This plagued war ! Do n't suppose you know , Turner 's gone down to Mexico . Do n't blame him , ' d go myself if they 'd have me . But it 's foul waste to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess he wo n't get killed , ' she said , smiling . A gust of anger swept the old man . He glared at her . What do you know of war , ma'am ? Come to that , what d'ye know of life ? You and your kind ' re wrapped a foot thick in cotton wool ; because your own precious hides are safe , you think there 's no such thing as danger , or blood and death .  --  Of course he can get killed , and likely will be because he 's got guts . He 'll not only be out on the battlefield tending to the wounded , but he wo n't rest until he gets a crack at the enemy himself . ' He stopped and said in a quieter voice , What 's Jeff Turner to you , ma'am , anyway ? ' Miranda averted her eyes . She had been staring at the angry old man with startled dismay . I do n't know , she thought , what Jeff is to me . A friend , ' she answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sandy hair , the gray eyes which quickly kindled into humor , the powerful hands that could be so gentle in touching a sick child , and with this image the feeling of confidence and the unsentimental sympathy which were as much part of him as his body . Yes , a friend , I think , ' she repeated slowly . He made a lot of trouble for my husband on the Manor , but he also saved the life of my baby sister . ' The old doctor snorted . Both just like him !  --  Well , ma'am , I must be going . Likely you 're dying to join that **26;9161;TOOLONG that 's going on in there . ' He pointed a stumpy thumb toward the sitting-room . Sorry I bellowed at you . Pretty young things like you are n't really required to face unpleasantness . Might spoil that Dresden-china complexion . ' He pinched her cheek , picked up his pill bag , and went out the kitchen door . Miranda got up and washed the teacup , put another stick of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was anything but anxious to join the confab ' in the other room . The familiar tasks which she had despised , this homely little room , seemed to her a momentary resting place in which to gather strength before plunging again into the tempest of dark emotions which whirled her around Nicholas.  |p205Knowing  him , as she was beginning to know some aspects of his nature , it was amazing that he had permitted her to be out of his sight so long . It could only mean that his interview with Poe was proving exceptionally interesting . When she finally opened the low door into the other room , she saw that this must be so . Nicholas motioned her with his eyes to sit down , but paid no further attention to her . The two men had moved their chairs around the table , and in the middle of it stood the brandy bottle , half-empty , and two glasses . Mrs. Clemm had taken Virginia to the bedroom and stayed there with her . Mrs. Ellet , ignored by the two men , had moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated little flaps . Her maliciousgaze missed nothing of the scene at the table , and she was mentally arranging its recounting . ' Poe was positively intoxicated , my dear ! You never saw anything more shocking . Even after the first glass . I could see that poor Mr. Van Ryn  --  a gentleman to his finger-tips of course  --  was as embarrassed as I. ' Miranda quietly sat down on the third chair . Little light came through the small windows now , for the sun had dipped below the hemlocks which bordered the Kingsbridge Road . Shadows had gathered thick in the corners of the room , but there was still light enough to see the deplorable change in Poe , the constant tremor of his sensitive hands , the twitch which pulled at his slack lips and the glitter of his staring eyes . Miranda turned her head away in horrified pity . Inexperienced as she was , she knew that this was more than simple drunkenness . The very smallest amount of alcohol acted as a violent poison on the poet 's precariously balanced system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ease , his arms folded , gazing at the spectacle before him with sardonic interest . He had himself taken but a quarter-glass of the brandy . Poe raised the shaking glass to his mouth . Fame ! ' he cried thickly . I said I despised it . ' T was a lie ! I dote on it . ' He lurched forward , the glass fell from his hand and shattered on the floor . At the crash Mrs. Clemm hurried in , took in the situation at a glance . Oh , Eddie dear , how could you again , when you promised ! ' she cried , catching up the bottle . She gave the guests a look of mortified apology . Do n't take it away , Muddie ! ' Poe clutched the substantial arm feverishly . ' It 's anodyne  --  the liquid Nepenthe . Give it back . Fool  --  woman  --  give it back . Do n't you see that with that golden liquid I become a king  --  a god ? It points me the path to the skies , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie dear , ' said the old woman , stroking his forehead . ' That 's from your new poem , is n't it . Why do n't you read it to them ? ' She hid the bottle behind her , pulled out the table drawer and extracted a quantity of foolscap . Pray do , sir , ' said Nicholas , crossing his legs . ' We should be greatly honored . ' The poet scowled , shaking his head from side to side , his hand still clawing at Mrs. Clemm 's restraining arm . Then from the bedroomcame the sound of Virginia 's agonized coughing . A spasm of terror passed over Poe 's face . His head jerked and was still , but his wild , unfocused gaze gradually sobered . ' Read them the poem , Eddie , ' repeated the motherly voice . Through long experience , Mrs. Clemm had discovered this recipe for bringing him to if he had not already entered that terrifying borderland where no human appeal would reach him for days . She vaguely understood that his unintelligible poems  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  represented an outlet for the misery which tortured him , an outlet like the far more dangerousliquor . She sighed with relief as the clutching hand fell from her arm to the sheets of foolscap on the table . He jerked them toward him . ' The skies they were ashen and sober ; The leaves they were crisped and sere .. His voice at first harsh and incoherent slowly gained timber . Soon each syllable was accentuated with delicacy , each word rounded to the fullest melody . From his actor parents he had inherited the talent of communicating emotion to an audience . Mrs. Ellet ceased fanning and leaned forward . They were all hushed  --  even Nicholas  --  as the voice throbbed and deepened in the weird evocative cadences . It was ' Ulalume ' that he read to them . The elegy that foreshadowedVirginia 's death and the recurring defeat of his own soul . The first stanzas meant nothing to Miranda , except for their inescapable music.  |p207'And  now , as the night was senescentAnd star-dials pointed to morn  --  As the star-dials hinted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And nebulous luster was born ... ' But it was in the next stanza that the meaning caught her . It was as though the voice with its interpretation swung wide the iron gate and precipitated her into the mists beyond  --  ' the region of sighs . ' Sadness engulfed her like a shroud , sadness and an eerie foreboding . For a few seconds she was held by fear like that she had felt in the Red Room , and each word seemed directed at her . ' But Psyche , uplifting her finger , Said  --  " Sadly this star I mistrust  --  Her pallor I strangely mistrust :  --  Oh , hasten ! Oh , let us not linger ! Oh , fly ! let us fly !  --  for we must . " In terror she spoke , letting sink herWings till they trailed in the dust  --  In agony sobbed , letting sink herPlumes till they trailed in the dust  --  Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust . ' Miranda , without conscious will , turned her frightened eyes to her husband . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own soul , ' Sadly this star I mistrust . ' She made a slight motion , and Nicholas , seeing it , smiled at her and shook his head in warning not to disturb the recitation . Reality came flooding back . She relaxed . Here was nothing but a small roomful of people and a drunken , though eloquent , poet . In her reaction , she listened impatiently to the rest of the poem , thinking it unnecessarily gloomy . She had had enough of this morbid , poverty-tainted little cottage . She was sorry for them all , terribly sorry ; but she longed for the spacious elegance of her bedroom . Her head had begun to ache and the heat grew steadily worse . ' Well I know , now , this dank tarn of Auber , This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir . ' The poem was finished . ' Magnificent ! ' said Nicholas heartily , and to Miranda 's relief he stood up.  | ' Too utterly divine  --  ' observed Mrs. Ellet , also rising . She touched Poe 's hand gingerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pleasure , gave a loud disapproving sniff directed at the brandy fumes which permeated the room , and scurried out to say good-bye to Virginia . ' It 's not right yet  --  there are many changes to make , ' said Poe dully . All vitality had drained out of him , his speech was sluggish again . He made a couple of futile pencil marks on the manuscript , then his head sank forward onto his outstretched arms . His breathinggrew stertorous . ' Poor Eddie , ' said Mrs. Clemm . ' He 'll sleep it off now . Tell me , sir . ' She looked up at Nicholas pleadingly . Did you really like the poem ? ' ' I think it one of his very best . ' The anxious face brightened . ' Would you help a little to get it published ? I know you do n't have anything to do with such things , but if you could just say a word here or there ? Mrs. Gove heard it and she said she 'd try . ' ' I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left Mrs. Clemm to the tending of her two sick children . That evening when Miranda and Nicholas sat down to late supper in their cool dining-room , she summoned the courage to ask him the question which had been in the back of her mind on all the long drive home . ' Was the visit what you expected , Nicholas ? Are you glad we went ? ' He put down his coffee cup and frowned into space . ' The man is worthless , ' he said contemptuously , ' but I envy him his dreams . ' ' His dreams  --  ' she repeated , not understanding . Nicholas nodded , but he shut his mouth firmly and did not explain . The man Poe had disappointed him . Nicholas had hoped for a kindred spirit , one as unhampered by petty morality or the conventionalattitude toward evil as Nicholas knew himself to be . Insteadhe had found despicable weakness , a sick man clutching at his mother and crying out for anodyne , a man terrified by the thought of death . There had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had-unknowingly suggested an unusual avenue of escape into the mystical realms of power and increased consciousness . An avenue not to be compared with the muddy downhill path which liquor represented . Some day , thought Nicholas , perhaps I shall experiment . Could you send the poor things some money  --  ? Anonymously , of course , ' said Miranda , seeing that Nicholas was through with the subject . He shrugged and picked up his coffee cup . The sooner the wife dies the better for everyone , I should think , but I 'll have Bronck send them something if you wish . ' She was as anxious as he to forget the Poe household and she soon did forget it . But as it was with Nicholas , one legacy from the visit remained with her . Hers was the memory of the unexpected pleasure she had felt in that dismal little kitchen at talking about Jeff . And the doctor had disturbed her . Though she did not think of Jeff very often , she nevertheless took to reading the war news . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching the bottom name with deep relief.  |p110BY  THE MIDDLE OF JUNE THE HEAT HAD SETTLED into a succession of broiling days and muggy nights . Even in the Stuyvesant Street garden there was no relief , for the city pressed around it too close . Street smells  --  manure , garbage , and dust  --  completely overpowered the garden 's mignonette and roses . All noises were magnified , the harsh shouts of the street vendors , the rattle of wagons on the cobblestones . And through that stifling air the bellowing of doomed cattle penned in the great market at Forty-Second Street added to the sleep-shattering confusion . Everyone who could left the city , and the Van Ryns with them . On a Thursday morning Nicholas and Miranda boarded the Reindeerand started up the Hudson . They were to disembark at Catskill Landing , and proceed twelve miles by stage to the Pine Orchard Mountain House . Miranda had hoped that as long as Dragonwyck was not yet ready Nicholas might take her traveling . During the past fortnight they had gone to parties given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more ambitious summer plans than theirs . Some ' were going to the ocean at Rockaway Beach , some to the White Mountains ; two couples were even going as far afield as Niagara Falls and Lake Erie . ' How I should love to see the real ocean ! I never have , you know  --  or Niagara Falls , Nicholas , ' she had said wistfully , but he would not consider any change of plan . He had had his fill of traveling during the year of their separation , and besides , he wished to be in the vicinity of Dragonwyck so that he could be present on the July Rent Day and oversee the opening of the house . ' We might go up to Saratoga for a few days if we tire of the Mountain House , ' he said , and that was the end of the matter . I suppose I was greedy and ungrateful to want more , she thought ,  |p211leaning  against the Reindeer 's mahogany rail and watching the Palisades slide by . How strangely different this was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same as the one on which she had sailed then ; but the Swallow , the graceful Swallow with its name bird so bravely painted in blue on the wheel box , was now nothing but a mass of rotting timber at the bottom of the Hudson . The Swallow had raced the Express once too often , and the year before had split herself in two on the rocks of a tiny island called Noah 's Brig . A dozen people had been drowned . I wonder , thought Miranda , if I had a premonition that day , when the racing frightened me so . By turning her head she could see a corner of the deck almost identical with the recess on the Swallow where Nicholas had placed her on that other June day two years ago  --  a shabby figure in brown merino , clutching the farm basket and wearing that hideous cheap bonnet . How dazzled she had been by the boat 's carvings and archways , chandeliers , red plush carpets and statuary ! The Reindeer was even more elaborate , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blue moire traveling suit , watching the bell-shaped hoop sway in the fresh breeze . This costume had cost a hundred dollars , and she had not even thought it expensive . That other girl who had sat in the corner there would have been horrified , despite her love of clothes , at the thought of paying such a sum . It was as much cash as the farm often brought in in a year . How I 've changed ! she thought ; but beneath the surface pride of that thought was disquiet . She had her heart 's desires , everythingthat the Miranda of two years ago would have considered a paradise  --  wealth , position , and Nicholas . Why then should she suddenly remember a Spanish saying she had read long ago in ' The Gipsy 's Revenge , ' one of those idiotic books she used to borrow from Debby Wilson : ' May all your wishes come true , and may they all curse you ! ' I do n't know what 's the matter with me , she thought impatiently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner , my dear one , ' he said gaily , drawing her arm through his . ' The captain is waiting for us in his cabin . ' He was enjoying the trip . He had a deep feeling for the stately river which flowed by his manor , and though he shared little else with most of mankind , he shared that feeling of holiday freedom which a boat ride gives.  |p212In  the deserted passageway before the captain 's cabin , he bent down and kissed her . It was the type of tender kiss that any newly wed husband might give his cherished bride . She entered the cabin , glowing and happy . The happiness lasted through the bustle of landing and the tedious ride in the stage up the mountains to the hotel . The Pine Orchard House on South Mountain was considered one of the noblest wonders in the East . All foreign visitors were taken to see it as a matter of course . Harriet Martineau had written of it that she would rather have missed the prairies , the Mississippi , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested not on its excellent cuisine , nor its elegant Greekrevivalfacade with the thirteen white Corinthian columns , nor yet on the Beach family 's efficient management ; it exalted the romantic nineteenth-century heart by its location on the edge of a twenty-five-hundred-foot precipice and in consequence its spectacularawe-inspiring view . When Miranda walked through the hotel and stepped out on the piazza , she gasped , as everyone gasped . The Hudson Valley lay spread out beneath her , its fertile fields stained mauve in the sun 's afterglow . Eight miles to the east the great river , diminished to a brooklet , curled like a silver shaving from Albany to Rhinebeck . Fifty miles away in Massachusetts the Berkshires thrust dark , irregular humps against the horizon . From time to time a trailing cloud mist floated by , obscuring the farms so far below , and accentuating the feeling of dizzy height . Flying must be like this  --  ' sighed Miranda . Always intensely affected by her surroundings , it seemed to her that living in the presence of that view one could be eternally joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately receded to a nebulous vagueness where her hurried and self-conscious prayers did not reach . Nicholas ' amused contempt for religion had had its effect . She no longer read her Bible at all , and she had skipped church on the last three Sundays . Not that Nicholas prevented her from going exactly , but there did seem to arise many difficulties ; even though Saint Mark 's was around the corner from the town house , he insisted that she be accompanied by one of the servants and take the carriage . Nor would he go with her himself . Moreover , she was gradually sleepinglater and later in the mornings , for there were social events inp113the evenings , and even when there were not , Nicholas was seldom ready to retire before midnight . Her lifetime training had not been disrupted without a feeling of guilt . But here in this heavenly place , she thought , buoyed by that youthful conviction that a change of location inevitably producedinward change as well , here all would be simple and easy . For some days she rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain air , the well-dressed , pleasantlookingpeople whom she saw in the dining-room at meals , or in the ballroom during evening concerts , or on the piazza , rocking and enjoying that wonderful view . She longed to meet some of these people , the young couple from Charleston , the noisy Benton family  --  mama , papa , and four assorted children who had traveled here from Boston and never tired of amusing the dining-room with humorous accounts of that journey  --  or even the trio of placid old ladies who pre-empted one corner of the piazza in which to knit and rock and sip lemonade while they gossiped . But Nicholas , it seemed , had no intention of fraternizing with anyone . He snubbed one or two tentative overtures , and after that they were left to themselves . This remoteness produced no hostility , everyone knew they were on their honeymoon , but it did increasethe other guests ' interest in the romantic couple . When they entered the dining-room all conversation ceased until the head waiter had ushered them to their private table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryn would be wearing this time . The two of them were so conspicuously handsome , so much the embodiment of the aristocratic bridal couples one read about that even the men were interested and listened tolerantly to their womenfolks ' admiration . Two weeks passed quickly , for though there was no relaxation near Nicholas , neither could there be boredom . It was in fact for dullness that she unconsciously longed , a slackening of the tension . Nicholas ' comparative indifference to the marriage relation , an indifferencewhich had lasted for weeks and which she in her innocenceassumed to be normal , gave place again to violent passion . These opposing cycles were to continue throughout her marriage , and it was not surprising that she never learned to anticipate them , nor dared receive either mood with anything but submission . Marriage , she thought , must always be like this , and if it were n't , there was no way of finding out . One would die rather than speak to anyone about such subjects . Often there was the dark shamed pleasure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was to him only an instrument without personal identity . But one must submit , out of fear  --  for the slightest resistance increased his brutality ; out of duty  --  a wife should always obey her husband . Under these lay like a layer of granite beneath quicksand the fundamental reason  --  the willing enslavement of her senses and soul . On the first of July Nicholas told her that he was going to leave her next morning for three days , and she felt a wave of quickly suppressed relief . I 've given orders for you to have all your meals served in the sitting-room while I 'm away , ' said Nicholas . Naturally I do n't want you to appear alone in the dining-room . ' She knew it was useless to protest , but she was disappointed . She had vaguely hoped to make friends with the Benton family or even one of the nice old ladies who sat on the piazza . If only I had someone to talk to , she thought , and then reproached herself . A bride did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having breakfasted , and her eyes turned to the window . The morning sun gilded the valley beneath ; so clear was it today that behind the Berkshires appeared the shadowy peaks of the White Mountains . The glory of that view had been a constant joy , but now for three days it would be her only companion as well . It was , she thought with a faint , dismal humor , a good deal to ask of scenery . Come , my dear , ' said Nicholas , ringing for the hotel valet , ' let 's get dressed for our walk . ' This was the usual morning procedure ; they had explored all the mountain paths for miles around . Nicholas had sent his servants to Dragonwyck to help in preparingthe house , knowing that the excellent hotel service would be sufficient for their needs . Miranda indeed had little use for a personal maid ; she enjoyed caring for her lovely clothes herself . Her skill with the needle always gave her pleasure and she consumedmany happy moments in running fresh rose and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heliotrope or verbena in the bodices of her gowns before hanging them awayp2I5in the capacious closets . But there was a great deal of laundry and pressing to be done as well , petticoats to be starched , body linen daily renewed , morning caps freshened with the pinking iron , and this she could not do herself . This work was attended to by one of the two chambermaids who were assigned to their suite ; silent automatons in calico aprons and mob caps who had no individuality for her except that she had noted that one of them was very young and walked with a slight limp . It was this maid who presented herself this morning in response to an angry ring . For Miranda , on examining the freshly laundered pile of linen from the night before , had discovered that a ruffle on her best India muslin negligee had been scorched to shreds , then clumsily sewn together in a transparent effort to hide the damage . ' Do you know how this happened ? ' asked Miranda sharply , pointing to the gown . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apron . ' Well ? ' Miranda persisted more quietly . ' Did you do it ? ' The girl was painfully thin and nondescript , the pink uniform hung slack on her undernourished body , the perky mob cap was askew on lusterless brown hair . The square face with its prominentCeltic cheekbones made a dim setting for the staring , frightenedeyes . Miranda waited and at last the girl moistened her lips . ' The iron was too hot , mum  --  please do n't tell , mum . They 'll turn me away without a character . ' She swallowed , her jerking hands twisted the apron into a ball . ' Oh , lady dear , ' she added in a choking voice , ' I 'm terrible shamed to be a-spoiling of your pretty things , but I 'd niver a flatiron in me hand till I come here . ' Miranda put the scorched gown on the bed . ' Should you be doing the pressing if you do n't know how ? ' ' No , mum . ' The girl hung her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a faint impression of the irrepressible Irish twinkle appeared . ' But they do n't know that , mum . Sure and I had to be telling a bit of a fib to get this job , the blessed saints forgive me . ' To her own surprise , Miranda felt attracted by the girl ; she was appealing and might be pretty if she did n't look so much like a starved kitten . ' Is the job so important to you , then  --  what is your name , by the way ? ' she asked  |p216Peggy  O'Malley , mum , and I 'm fresh off the boat last month . Sure and I 'm as green as the shamrocks that grow in the fields at home , but as to the job , mum  --  ' she sobered again , the light went out of her eyes . It 's all I have in the wor-rld , my job . And not so easy to get for me . ' Miranda suddenly remembered the limp . No , it would n't be easy for a raw Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such hordes of husky , able-bodied ones to choose from . I 'll mend the ruffle , Peggy , and you 'll be more careful , wo n't you ? ' The girl seized Miranda 's hand and kissed it . The saints bless your kind heart , mum . I 'll try ivery iron on me own skin before I touch it to anything of yours . ' She bobbed a curtsy and hurried away down the hall . Miranda watched the girl 's pathetic effort to control the twist of the right leg and pity awoke a new train of thought . When she and Nicholas had taken the path toward North Mountain and the Artists ' Rock , she brought up the subject . What happens to all these Irish who keep coming into the country ? I mean , is there anything for them to do but go into service ? ' Nicholas was amused . Since when do you concern yourself with social problems , my love ? Why , they can go to the manufactories , I suppose . ' But the working conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had left Greenwich to go and work in a weaving mill near Hartford . The girl had come back six months later with consumption , and a horrifying account of working in darkness and filth , sixteen hours a day with no time for rest . ' No doubt , ' said Nicholas . She would have . pursued the topic , for her imagination was caught by that girl , who even younger than herself struggled alone in a strange land to force a living from a country which would be hospitable only if she allowed herself to be exploited . But shouts and screams of laughter assailed them from around a bend in the path . The irrepressible Benton family from Boston flocked into view . The children in pantalettes and round straw sailors swarmed over the rocks like monkeys , snatching at wild flowers and shrieking . The smallest , a five-year-old boy in a pinafore , shrieked as loud as the others , but his scramblingsp217were impeded by a small Spaniel puppy which he hugged to his chest . The parents , in stout boots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as much noise as their offspring . ' Willie ! ' screamed Mrs. Benton to her youngest , ' come away from that tree , there 's poison ivy . ' ' Samantha  --  see the pretty butterfly ! Girls , put your gloves on again at once , you 'll get warts ! Willie , put doggie down ; you 'll hurt him squeezing him like that . ' As Willie reluctantly obeyed , Mrs. Benton discovered the Van Ryns . ' Oh , ' she cried to her husband in the same piercing tone , ' here come the honeymooners . How romantic ! ' Nicholas made an exclamation of annoyance . ' Let 's turn back , ' he said to Miranda , ignoring the fact that they were already surrounded by Bentons . The lady bore down on them beaming , determinednot to miss this excellent opportunity for meeting the unapproachablecouple . She had held out her hand and begun , ' Is n't this a superb day for a stroll  --  Mr. Van  --  ' when everyone was electrified by a blood-curdling yell from Willie . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , what is it , dearie ? ' cried Mrs. Benton , frantically feeling her child for injuries . ' Doggie , gone  --  ' sobbed the little boy , pointing at the cliff beside the path . Everyone peered over the brink . There was a sheer drop of twenty feet and then a ledge . On this ledge lay a small brownish blob , and a faint whimpering noise came from it . All the children began to cry ; Willie buried his face in his mother 's bosom . The puppy 's doom seemed certain . Mr. Benton tugged at his side whiskers and blew his nose . ' Poor creature , ' he said . ' Hush , children . We 'll get another doggie . ' Willie raised his swollen face , his eyes dilated with horror . ' You got to get him , Papa , you ca n't just leave him there . He 's crying . I hear him . ' ' It 's impossible , Willie , ' answered the father , peering down the cliff , and made brusque by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' I 'll get the dog , ' said Nicholas . All the children stopped crying , and stared with their mouths open . It 's very good of you to offer , sir ; said Mr. Benton , ' but I could n't let you risk your life for a puppy . Besides , it 's quite impossible . '  | Nicholas raised his eyebrows . ' I never undertake to do anything that I ca n't carry out . ' He took off his coat . ' Kindly give me your two coats . ' Confused , the two Bentons silently took off their long dust coats . Nicholas knotted them together with his , fastened one end to the root of a sapling . ' Nicholas , do n't  --  please do n't , ' whispered Miranda . He paid not the slightest attention to her . His mouth was set , his black brows drawn together , but his eyes held a glint of excited exultation . She had seen that expression before  --  on her first trip up the Hudson when the boats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted the anti-renters . The combined coats reached far down the cliff , and as Nicholas started down them hand over hand , Mrs. Benton gave a shriek and shut her eyes . ' He 'll be killed  --  ' Miranda 's heart hammered against her ribs as she watched , but she had no real doubt that Nicholas could do it . She knew so intimately the reserves of power that dwelt in that taut body , his ability to control his muscles by the force of his will . She realized , as the terrified Bentons never could , that his apparently miraculous descent of that cliff-side was possible because he had no fear and , unhampered by that , his quick eye and quicker brain could discover and use foot- and hand-holds in the rock 's irregular surface . In sixty seconds he had reached the ledge and tucked the puppy into the bosom of his frilled shirt . In two more minutes he stood again beside them on the path , his breathing scarcely quickened . ' That was m-marvelous , sir , ' stammered Mr. Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The children clustered around , gazing at Nicholas with awed hero-worshiping eyes . He put the puppy on the pine needles , where it gave a little whimper and feebly licked at his hand . ' I daresay it will live ; the bush down there broke its fall . ' He put on his coat . While Willie cradled his puppy , crooning to it and kissing the furry ears , Mrs. Benton joined her husband 's paean of gratitude and admiration , but Nicholas would not stop to listen . He smiled briefly , and taking Miranda 's arm hurried her down the path to the hotel . ' I 'm so proud of you , ' she whispered , when they had rounded ap219corner and the Bentons were left behind . ' Oh , Nicholas darling  --  I did n't think you  --  ' In the aftermath of the excitement she felt sobs rising in her throat . She would not have thought it in his nature to risk his life for a puppy and a small boy 's misery . He was then not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you stop hurrying and let me tell you how brave and wonderful you were , ' she said coaxingly , for Nicholas had not turned his head and continued to stride down the path . He did pause now . Miranda , my dear one , I applaud your wifely flutterings , but let 's not wallow in syrup . ' Her hand dropped from his arm . For a moment she knew doubt , but only for a moment , then her consuming desire to believe in his essential goodness reassured her . Men were always embarrassed by reference to their brave deeds ; to minimize them even with anger was natural . All right , ' she said , smiling up at him , ' I wo n't say another word . But just the same it was a grand thing to do . ' Never had she loved him so much . Her conviction that she had found a secret softness in his charactersustained her through Nicholas ' cold refusal to recognize the Bentons , who had naturally expected that the morning 's episode would establish acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his indifference to the recovery of the puppy he had saved . On the following morning at seven , Nicholas left the hotel by stage for Catskill Landing and the boat to Dragonwyck . After he had gone she moved restlessly around their rooms , unable to settle down to the few activities which Nicholas had permitted her . She might go out for a walk at eleven , but otherwise he expected her to remain in their suite . Young Mrs. Van Ryn must not wander unescorted around the public rooms of a hotel . Well , there were letters to write home , plenty of books to read , and a copy of Godey 's in which to study the latest fashions . There was her embroidery tambour on which she was creating a masterpieceof garden flowers in colored silk . And there was the view to admire . Enough diversions surely for three days . But as the morning passed , she found that none of them appealed to her . Gradually she realized that part of her restlessness camep220from physical discomfort . There were fleeting twinges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the fish last night ? she wondered . She went to the marble-topped washbasin behind the screen in her room and searched amongst the bottles of lotion and toilet water . There were so many that she had forgotten what they all contained , but she had no real hope of finding any medicine . Both she and Nicholas enjoyedsuperb health . I must send out for some of Hutching 's Stomach Bitters , she thought , remembering Abigail 's pet remedy for digestive disturbance . The effort of ringing and giving the order seemed , however , tremendous and she lay down instead . After a two-hours sleep she awoke feeling much better and extremely hungry . She ordered for herself an immense dinner , roast beef , cold tongue , chicken in aspic , cream kisses , and syllabub . When this meal arrived and the waiter had set the round table in the parlor , she found that after a few mouthfuls all her appetite had vanished . The sight of the laden dishes and hot plates revolted her . She pushed back her chair and rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own thinking that he had a clear hour at least before Mrs. Van Ryn could possibly do justice to that meal . So it was Peggy that answered the bell . ' Yes , mum ? ' she said , curtsying . You 'd be wanting something ? ' Miranda nodded , gesturing feebly toward the food . ' Get rid of this stuff please  --  at once ! ' She leaned her swimming head against the antimacassar and shut her eyes . Peggy gave her a puzzled look and obediently limped to the table . She looked at the thick slices of rare beef in the congealing gravy , the mountain of fluffy mashed potatoes down which ran rivulets of butter , the half ox tongue , the jellied chicken garnished with truffles , and she made a queer little sound . Miranda opened her eyes . Whatever is the matter , Peggy ? You ca n't clear away all those dishes yourself . Get the waiter  --  ' Yes , mum . ' The voice was muffled , and surprise pierced through Miranda 's concentration on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks . ' Peggy ! ' cried Miranda starting up . What is the matter ! ' The other girl bit her lips , began . piling the dishes under thep221Britannia metal covers . ' It 's just my foolishness , mum . It came over me all at oncet how just one wee part of all this , would 've  --  ' ' Would have what ? ' persisted Miranda , putting her hand softly on the maid 's shoulder . Peggy raised her head . ' Mither and the baby died of starvation on Saint Patrick 's Day , ' she said dully . ' There 's famine in Ireland , mum . ' Miranda stared at the girl appalled . There had been occasional newspaper mention of food shortage in Ireland , but it had n't impressedMiranda , nor as yet the rest of America , which would not begin to ship cargoes of corn meal to the starving people for anotheryear when the potato blight had reached devastating magnitude . ' But that 's awful , ' she stammered , feeling how inadequate were any words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An abundance of food was an automatic part of life , plain food at the farm , elaborate dishes with Nicholas , but always plenty . She realized how cruel it seemed to Peggy  --  this lavish display of food which had been wantonly ordered to no purpose . ' You 're not hungry now , are you ? ' she cried , looking at the thin arms and cheeks . The other shook her head . ' The pigs feed better here , mum , than does the Earl of Kenmare at home . Only it 's hard to eat when you 've lost the knack and your heart lies heavy as a millstone . ' She looked up at Miranda with her quick sideways glance and smiled sadly . ' For why must I be ever worriting you with me troubles , I would n't be knowing , mum ; it 's the kind , beautiful face that you have . ' ' I wish I could help you , ' said Miranda slowly . Money , she thought , a huge tip , but she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicholas would fee the hotel servants in exact proportion to their efficiency , and he had already remarked that Peggy was careless , and not well trained . Peggy smiled the warm smile that illumined her plain little face . ' I 'm needin ' no help , bless you . I 've got me two hands and soon I 'll have enough to pay back to Father Donovan the passage money he lent me , ' she said sturdily . ' Sit you down , mum ; you look a bit white . Here I 'm blabbering instead of doing what you told me . ' She whisked around the table , vanished for a moment andp212came back with a tray , uttered an exclamation of concern as she saw Miranda , who had suffered a violent attack of nausea and tottered to a chair where she slumped , panting . The maid flung the tray down and rushed to help . Even through the spasms of retching and vomiting Miranda was conscious of the gentleness of the hands that held her head , and of the soothing little murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine now . Put your head on my shoulder ; here 's a wet rag for your poor face . Now to bed with you  --  quick . ' Miranda found herself on the bed , the comforter tucked tight around her exhausted body , and Peggy anxiously leaning over her and stroking her hair . ' Thank you , ' whispered Miranda , trying to smile . ' I 'm so sorry . I guess the fish last night was tainted . ' The little maid 's eyes twinkled . ' I would n't be thinking it was the fish , mum . ' ' It could n't be the cholera starting  --  ' cried Miranda , alarmed . Peggy laughed outright . ' Nor the cholera neither , I 'll be bound . ' She leaned over and whispered a question . ' Why , yes  --  ' answered Miranda , mentally counting days and still puzzled . ' But what would that  --  ? ' She checked herself in astonishment . She had no biological knowledge whatever except that derived from observation of the farm animals , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the months before Charity was born . ' Well , then , mum , ' said Peggy , both amused and touched . The dear , pretty lady , as innocent as a lamb , she was , with her tainted fish and her cholera . Peggy , the eldest of seven children , had been raised without genteel reticences . She had been spared no grimmestdetail of either birth or death , and an unquestioning acceptance of these was as much part of her as the Irish sympathy and humor which had made them endurable . ' I ca n't believe it , ' murmured Miranda , half to herself . There was no gladness , no realization of the inevitable changes , no thought even of Nicholas , nothing but this blank unbelief . ' It 's nature , mum , ' said Peggy briskly . ' First the bed and then the cradle , as me poor mither used to say . I 'll be leaving you to rest now . ' ' No , do n't go , please . ' Miranda held out her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it all right with the housekeeper if you 're worrying about the work ; only stay and talk to me awhile . ' The maid looked at the pale face on the pillow . The forlorn note in Miranda 's voice sped to her heart . As far as Peggy could see the poor lady had naught in the world to trouble her beyond she was a bit queasy in the stomach . And yet she was troubled ; a blindfolded bat could see that . And to be sure the rich were n't always happy , hard as it was to believe . What 'll I talk to you of , mum ? ' she asked gently . ' Tell me about your home in Ireland  --  unless it hurts you to speak of it . ' Miranda cared little what the other girl said ; she wanted companionship while she tried to adjust herself to this startling possibility that she was not ready to face . So Peggy talked , her brogue thickening as she forgot herself and the lady on the bed in memories of home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the banks of Lough Leane at Killarney . Beneath the thatched roof of the sod shanty there had always been poverty , but there had been merriment too . No matter how thin the milk in the wooden bowls , nor how few the potatoes , there would be a crackle of wit from the handsome red-headed mother to make them forget the emptiness of their bellies . And then the little Kerry cow died , and there was no milk at all . Soon there were no potatoes either . One day the red-headed mother quietly lay down on the straw pallet with her month-old baby in her arms . Nor did she get up again . They would all have starved  --  for the neighbors were in like case  --  without the help of the parish priest and the squire . These two men , distracted by the increasing misery in their town , did what they could . They sent Peggy 's father to Belfast , where there was still work and food . They boarded the three surviving O'Malley children in the charity school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district to America , the land of plenty . But it was not on the past dreadful spring that Peggy dwelt , nor on the twenty-one days she had spent jammed into a stinking hold with other immigrants . She told of the beauties of Killarney and its three lakes shimmering like magic jewels in the soft haze beneath the mountains . She told of the roses that grew of their own accord and scarcely needed tending in that warm , moist climate , and of the arbutus wood which she and her brothers had delighted to whittle into fragrant boxes.  | Then crossing herself , and flattered by Miranda 's continuing interest , she lowered her voice and spoke of the ruins of the tower and church at Aghadoe . ' No mortal man has lived there since the time of the Black O'Donohues hunnerds of years a gone , but they do say the little folk dance in the tower at the turn of the moon . ' ' The little folk , ' smiled Miranda . D' you mean the fairies ? ' Hush , mum ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be naming of them ; that makes ' em come . ' She paused , then her eyes danced and she giggled . ' But ' t would be a brash wee one , indeed , would cross that heaving ocean packed in tight like kippers in a basket , and he 'd never survive the poking and peering of the im-i-gration men at journey 's end . Sure and I do n't think we need worry at all , at all . ' Miranda laughed . ' Peggy , you do me good . ' She had ceased thinking of her as an ignorant and handicapped little chambermaid ; somehow during the past hour she had come to think of her as a friend . The sympathy between them cut through the difference in their upbringing and their stations . And yet their stations were not originally so very far apart , thought Miranda , with a shock of surprise . She too had been reared on a potato farm . ' How much do you make a month here , Peggy ? ' she asked suddenly . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the job was so precious . ' Four dollars a month , mum  --  not counting me tips when I get ' em . ' Miranda sat up in bed . Will you leave here and come to me as my maid ? I 'll give you  --  ' she hesitated , knowing well that there would be difficulty with Nicholas . She went on quickly , ' Twenty dollars a month . That 'll help with the younger children and to pay back Father Donovan , wo n't it ? ' Peggy drew away from the bed staring at the lady whose face between the long braids of wheat-colored hair was as pleading as though she begged a favor . ' Holy Mither of God , you 'd not be making game of me , mum ? ' ' Of course not . I want you , Peggy . ' And as she said these wordsthey crystallized her desire . She wanted Peggy desperately , as anally , someone that belonged to her in a world dominated byNicholas . Particularly at Dragonwyck , nor until this second hadMiranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeled down beside the bed and put her rough hand timidly on Miranda 's slim fingers . " T would be the grace of Heaven for me , lady dear , but have you not forgot  --  ' she swallowed , ' me leg that was broke when I fell from the haymow ten years gone and grew back crooked  --  not but that I 'm strong and well able to work despite it , ' she finished fiercely to forestall the pity she dreaded . ' That does n't matter in the least , ' said Miranda . She squeezed the hand which lay on hers . ' Then it 's all settled ? ' The little maid 's face broke into a dazzling smile , then darkened . ' What will he say , mum ? ' she asked soberly . Him , she thought , that 's handsome and fearsome as the Black O'Donohues ever was . Miranda had no need to ask who ' he ' was . It 'll be all right , ' she smiled with a confidence she did n't feel . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting him guess that her desire for Peggy ran deeper than just a need for a maid . For he wanted her to have no intimacies whatsoever . She had been drawn to Miss Gibbes , John Jacob Astor 's betrothed , and had innocently made an engagement for them to drive out together one afternoon before they all left New York . But it turned out that the horses were unavailable , and that Nicholas wished her to walk up Broadwaywith him and call on old Mrs. Stuyvesant . In the same way , without ever saying so outright , he had discouraged her acceptanceof any invitations from the young matrons she had met . At first she had been happy to be thus islanded with Nicholas , it proved his love for her that he wished to share her with no one , but she had been disheartened to find that she seemed to be permanentlycut off from her mother as well . She had expected to have Abigail visit her after they were settled at Dragonwyck . She could send Ephraim money to get a hired girl for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich if one could not make presents to one 's own family ? She had worked out all the details before suggesting the plan to Nicholas . His contemptuous incredulity that she should have had such an unsuitable idea still made her cheeks burn . He would , however , gladly send money to the Wellses if she thought they needed it ; he had reached for his wallet . She had stopped him . Ephraim and Abigail would never accept a casual sum , nonchalantly thrown at them like alms.  | Later , Miranda had told herself , after they were really settled , she would find the courage to broach the visit again , and she had let the subject drop . But , she thought , tightening her lips , I wo n't give in to him about Peggy . I wo n't . Determined that the change should be already made when he came back , she sent at once for Mr. Beach , the manager . There was no difficulty there ; Peggy could be replaced at once , and even if she could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important client . So , by the time Nicholas was expected on the evening stage two days later , Peggy was established as Miranda 's personal maid . Miranda had amused herself by dressing the girl in a new uniform . She had cut down and shortened one of her own dimity morning dresses , had made a coquettish cap and apron and taught Peggy to pin her brown hair into two tidy coils over her ears . The transformationdelighted both girls . Peggy now looked trim and smart , she held herself proudly . In return she nursed Miranda through two bouts of morning sickness and attacked the freshening of her mistress 's wardrobe with an anxious eagerness that made up for her lack of skill . At first she hung the steel hoops inside out , laced the tiny whalebone corsets backward , sewed a gold bodice button onto a glove , and put the best white peau de soie bonnet into the bandbox meant for overshoes . But she learned fast , and her dismay at these mischances was leavened with so much humor that Miranda was amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' return with a subtlety she had n't known she possessed . She ordered a delicate supper of the things he liked best , hot liver pate , a filet of bass in aspic , chilled sauterne . With Peggy 's help she washed her hair and brushed it the requisite hundred strokes . ' He likes it flowing , ' she said thoughtfully . ' I believe he likes my hair better than anything about me  --  ' ' Small wonder , mum , ' replied Peggy , looking at the golden mantle that rippled down to Miranda 's slender hips . ' Can you not leave it loose , then ? ' Both of them had entered into a tacit conspiracy , both knew without ever having mentioned it that the continuanceof this new relationship that meant so much to both lonely girls depended on propitiation , on the use of every possible weapon.  |p227Miranda  shook her head . ' It 's not seemly . ' She compromised by stuffing all the shining mass loosely into a pink chenille net . The net matched her foaming mousseline gown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionably dressed women with unlimited means , Miranda had a special gown for every imaginable function . A walking costume could hardly be worn for midday dinner , still less for tea . A morning negligee , no matter how elaborately beflouncedand beribboned , might never appear after noon even in the privacy of the bedroom . This shell-pink gown had been contrivedby the knowing modiste for one purpose only  --  the gratificationof a husband 's eye at just such an intimate supper party as Miranda was planning . Its graceful skirt belled but slightly over a petticoat stiffened with horsehair , the tight bodice was cut very low into a heart shape to show the swell of the white breasts . The only trimming were tiny rose velvet bows sewn at random with a careless gaiety , as though a swarm of rosy bees had settled on a pink cloud . ' And now your jools , mum ! Slathers of ' em ! ' cried Peggy , clappingher hands and gazing at the vision before her . Miranda smiled and shook her head . ' This gown looks better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , though . ' She paused in the act of pinning on the cameo . There was a jewel which would set the dress off to perfection . She hesitated , frowning . But after all , why not ? She sent Peggy to the hotel safe for the huge leather case , unlockedit and lifted out two trays . On the bottom in a velvet box lay the ruby pendant . She lifted it out and cupping it in her palm stared at it with a fascinated repulsion . Against how many breasts  --  now stilled forever  --  had it already lain , this cold and indifferentjewel ? It seemed to her that the ruby shimmered with a baleful mockery . ' Whatever 's wrong , mum ? ' whispered Peggy . I envied her this thing , thought Miranda , bitter envy . She opened her hand and the pendant fell with a little thud onto the bureau . ' The last woman to wear this jewel is dead , ' she said , half aloud . ' The saints preserve us ! ' cried Peggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put it back ! ' Miranda did not move , she continued to stare at the pendant ;  |p228then  her gaze traveled slowly to the open case . ' All these jewels belonged to the dead . That 's how they came to me . ' The maid shivered . The dear lady was almost fearsome , eyeing those baubles as though they were alive and talking in that farawayvoice . Not much sense she was making neither , come to think of it . ' Well , to be sure , ' said Peggy reasonably . ' Most of the gentry 's gear does pass on to others after death . ' T is but your condition a-giving you dark fancies . Whisht , mum , you should be thinking of the new life that 's in you , not worriting over what 's past . ' The shadow gradually lifted from Miranda 's face . ' Yes , ' she said , ' I guess you 're right . ' She picked up the pendant , slipped the fine gold chain around her neck , and bent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T is fair as a queen you are , mum ! ' cried Peggy , admiring the result . Miranda smiled faintly and looked at the china mantel clock . ' Go now , please ; it 's almost time . ' The maid nodded and hurried out to her cubicle in the attic . She reached under her straw pillow for the rosary , made of arbutus wood it was , Killarney arbutus . She kissed the little crucifix and began to pray for the outcome of the interview downstairs . Miranda saw in one quick , thankful glance that Nicholas had returned in excellent humor . The rent-day had passed quietly with no unpleasantness . Each tenant had brought his proper tribute . The bailiff asserted that the manor was running well . The house too was ready . As he greeted Miranda and complimented her on her gown , his eyes rested a moment on the pendant . She had the impression that he stiffened . She thought in that moment that he stared at the ruby that he was going to tell her to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I see that the pendant has at last found a setting worthy of it . ' And he bent his head and kissed her breast just above the jewel . After the little supper  --  and he complimented her on that too  --  he drew her to the open window . It was a night of stars , and a frail new moon hung high amongst them over the dark valley . The twinkling darkness , so vast that it seemed she stood at thep229edge of space , reached down and enveloped Miranda , bringing peace . She leaned her head on her husband 's shoulder , and a happy confidence came to her . She thought of a verse of poetry that she had read in Graham 's Magazine . And the night shall be filled with music , And the cares that infest the dayShall fold their tents like the Arabs , And as silently steal away . That was so beautiful , and true . Why had she worried about telling Nicholas of Peggy , why did she constantly raise up bogies when there were none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems dwindled to nothingness . Of course he 'll be delighted , because I 'm pleased , she told herself happily . She was soon disillusioned . At her first laughing words , ' Nicholas , I 've something to confess . You see , while you were gone  --  ' his arm dropped from her waist . He shut the window and drew the curtains . ' Well , my pretty one , what is it ? ' he asked lightly enough , but his eyes had hardened to that agate-like blue . The reassuring beauty of the night was shut out , and there was no support in the conventional hotel room or the flaring oil lamps . She forgot her carefully thought-out speech , stammered and floundered . ' You mean  --  ' said Nicholas incredulously , ' that you engaged that untidy little cripple to be your personal maid ! ' Miranda clenched her hands . ' She 's not untidy any more , and she 's not a cripple . She 's had a miserable life , she 's  --  ' ' My dear girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire all the sluts who 've led miserable lives , we 'll have to build a city at Dragonwyck . ' Nicholas sat down on the plush-covered sofa and crossed his legs . ' You twist everything  --  ' she cried desperately . ' Please  --  please try to understand . I want Peggy , she 's bright and willing . You said I could have my own maid  --  ' ' I 've already engaged one . A well-trained Frenchwoman . She will join you at Dragonwyck . ' ' But I do n't want her . I want Peggy . . . ' The childish hopelessnessof her wail echoed in her ears . Despair seized her . He loathed tears , they never moved him to anything but amusement . She controlled herself with agonizing effort . Please , Nicholas , if you love me . It 's so little to ask . ' She moved over to him , her hands outstretched , instinctively in her desperation trying to use woman 's ultimate weapon , the frank lure of her body . He laughed , though he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , you 're quite lovely , my dear . But all the same you 'll dismiss your new acquisition in the morning . ' She drew a harsh breath , looking at him with a helpless fury . There was one last resort . She had not meant to use it nor had she any hope that it would work . She threw her head back and spoke with a roughness foreign to her nature . ' I 've been sick these last days . Vomiting . I think I 'm going to have a baby . ' The change in his face petrified her . He jumped up , grabbing her arms at the elbows , almost shaking her . ' Do you mean it , Miranda ? Are you sure ? ' She nodded . ' Are you glad ? ' she asked angrily . ' Does that at least please you ? ' She saw the exultation in his eyes . She did not need his answer . ' Can I have Peggy , then ? ' she pursued inexorably . He took her hand and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven or hell , Miranda , if you 'll give me a son ! ' Many times during the next months Miranda was to ponder over the extravagance of that statement , the tone of his voice as he made it . At the time she had been too much exhausted by her struggle for Peggy , too much relieved by her unexpected victory to attach any great importance to it . She had always known that Nicholas , like most men , particularly those with large property to pass on , had wanted an heir . It was natural enough . But his attitude , now that there was prospect of one , was not . From that night at the Mountain House , his manner toward her changed entirely . Without exception his every word and action were directed toward safeguarding her health and tranquillity . Whereas before he had taken pleasure in thwarting most of her wishes and bending her will to his , he now humored her in every way . He cherished her , as one cherishes perforce the instrument which will fulfill one 's desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistent to allow room for any other emotion . She had dreaded the return to Dragonwyck , but when the river boat Express churned up to the landing and she saw the familiar towered silhouette against the eastern sky , the manor represented nothing but a place in which to lie down in a darkened room and fight off the ever-recurring nausea . She dimly heard Peggy 's whispered gasp : ' Faith and ' t is a castle ! ' T is grander than the Bishop 's palace at home ! ' But Miranda felt no thrill of gratified pride . Her whole being was concentrated on the effort of getting off the boat and up the marble steps from the dock before the dryness of her mouth and the swimming in her head should lead again to the inevitable conclusion . She pressed a handkerchief against her lips , and with the help of Nicholas ' supportand murmured encouragement she managed to reach the portecochere , then she gave a moan and swayed against him . Nicholas picked her up and carried her into Dragonwyck . ' No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . It 's too humiliating . ' For she saw rows of servants ranged on either side the Great Hall waiting to receive them . ' It 's entirely proper for a husband to carry his bride into her new home , ' said Nicholas lightly . ' Do n't fret , my darling . ' He was always like that now , kind and gentle , ministering to her embarrassing seizures with a tactful patience that continually astonished her , for he despised illness . He carried her upstairs and put her down on a bed . For some time she was too sick to notice her surroundings . Peggy , who had followed close behind them , knew what to do  --  cold cloths soaked in vinegar for the forehead , a warming pan for the chilled feet , a stick of peppermint to hold in the mouth .   2 The nausea ebbed . There would be a weak but blessed peace for a while . Miranda opened her eyes and gazed past Nicholas ' solicitous face . She saw three great windows in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johanna 's room , she thought , and a chill that was not physical crept through her . But I must n't be foolish , she thought , and raising her head a little she forced herself to examine the room and saw with grateful relief that everything had been changed . Green satin replaced the red-plush curtains , a fawn-colored Aubusson covered the floor . Gone was the untidy clutter of furjniture with which Johanna had surrounded herself ; there were now but three fine mahogany pieces , and a couple of small chairs . The spacious room was revealed in its true proportions . All was changed  --  with one exception . Her tired eyes roamed upward and she stiffened . She had not at first realized , because the old brocaded tester had been replaced with green satin to match the draperies . But there was no mistaking the coat-of-arms on the headboard or the four massive columns . Long ago in another life she had entered this room for the first time and stood submissively beside this bed with resentment and envy in her heart . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! she had thought . How had she dared to think that ? And with this memory there came another , sharp as the cut of a hidden knife . A wrinkled brown face from which peered black eyes filled with pitying contempt . Ah , p'tite , you want a thing very much , you make it happen sure . ' Miranda turned her head violently and shut her eyes . Feeling badly again ? ' asked Nicholas . No . It 's not that .  --  Nicholas , I do n't want to sleep in this bed : ! He answered her with unexpected patience , even explaining his reasons . This was the Van Ryn ancestral bed , for generations all those of his blood had been born and died on it . It was here that the Lord and Lady of the Manor always slept ; it was here that his child would be born . Any other request he would be glad to grant , but on this point he was adamant . Let it be , then , thought Miranda wearily . What does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as familiar as it was **25;9189;TOOLONG . She would no longer see that gruesome night when the tapers had stood on either side and it had supported that motionless figure with the little subtle smile on its pale face . She must never look back again  --  never . She was now the mistress of Dragonwyck and a Van Ryn . The past was gone ; she must have no trailing tendrils of guilt , or fear or even of pity . She must cooperate with Nicholas in his tacit elimination of all that might remind them of that previous year she had spent at Dragonwyck . All those servants were gone  --  and Zelie . Much new furniture had been bought , and the old rearranged . Throughout the house everything was freshly painted and plastered and papered . Even this bed , the one continuing association , was after all but a frame . Its mattress and springs were new . There was , however , one legacy from the past which she could not conscientiously deny . There was Katrine . Surely it was time that the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broached this to Nicholas . ' If you would like Katrine here for a visit , I 've no objection , ' he said . ' But I see no reason for it . She 's well cared for by her aunt , to whom I make a handsome allowance . She has besides many little cousins to play with , I believe . ' This was reasonable enough , but she felt beneath his temperate words his aversion to the idea and the indifference he had always shown to Katrine . ' She 's your daughter , Nicholas . Do n't you ever miss her or want to see her ? ' cried Miranda with sudden vehemence . He was silent for several minutes . ' I doubt that she would want to come here , my dear . She has been under other influences . ' At first she did not understand him . ' You mean that Katrine would n't want to see me ? ' He shrugged , thinking of the outraged letters he had received from Johanna 's relatives after the news of his remarriage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudiced , and she does very well where she is . I shall run up to see her someday . ' Miranda was silenced . It had been stupid of her not to realize that Katrine would suffer at being brought back to this scene of her mother 's death , or that she might have been taught to resent Miranda as the supplanter . It was not only the Van Tappens who disapproved of Nicholas ' marriage . All the up-river families were horrified . The topic enlivenedmany a tea-party in the drawing-rooms of Claverack , and Kinderhook and Greenbush . The scheming little upstart ! ' they said . ' No birth or breeding , nothing but youth and a pretty face ; why must men be such fools ! ' Some , like Mrs. Henry Van Rensselaer , balked of an alliance for one of her daughters , were more bitter . ' There was something going on between those two  --  even in poor Johanna 's lifetime . I saw it with my own eyes , ' they whispered . ' The whole matter is disgraceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Nor did they call . Nicholas was profoundly annoyed , but he hid it from Miranda , as he protected her from every unpleasantness , at this time . He surroundedher with an anxious solicitude , constantly ordering dishes which might tempt her precarious stomach , sending her to bed at nine , taking her for short walks or drives from which they always returned before there was a possibility of her tiring . He exerted himself to divert her too . Caught in the lethargy of advancing pregnancy , her intelligence obscured , by a constant malaise , Miranda found all mental effort impossible . Nicholas thereforeconcealed his own boredom and patiently read to her by the hour  --  from the trashy new novels ' The Orange Girl of Venice , ' or ' Nellie the Ragpicker 's Daughter . ' And in the evening he played for her  --  the simple and sentimentalballads that pleased her best . ' Ben Bolt , ' ' The Old Oaken Bucket , ' or ' Nellie Was a Lady . ' And on Sundays they went to church together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of living was more magnificent than that of most couples , the Van Ryns represented the epitome of the domestic felicity of the time . Life was suspended , hushed into a pleasing monotony . There were no violences , no clashes . The past and the future both melted into distance . The outside world had become unreal . She knew vaguely that the progress of the war with Mexico was gratifying . In September there had been a victory at Monterrey , and she had wondered aboutP235Jeff . Still the thought of victory somehow seemed to include safety , and Jeff was as shadowy as everything else . Even her disappointmentthat her mother could not after all come to her soon vanished . Nicholas had reversed his decision about Abigail . If Miranda wanted her mother , she might by all means invite her . The letter had been sent at once . The carefully unalarming reply gave no hint of the misery that had gone into the writing of it . For years Abigail had suffered from periodic attacks of rheumatismwhich she bore with a grim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it swelled her fingers , her knees , and in her right hip there was a constant grinding pain . She could barely creep around the house . She could not have endured the trip to Dragonwyck . Her letter minimized the pain and indicated another reason . Tabitha 's time is coming soon , and I must bide with her . She has n't a houseful of servants to care for her like you , ' wrote Abigail . Later , very likely I can come , take care of yourself my dear child , but do n't coddle overmuch . Be thankful you have such a good husband . ' For Miranda 's letters were full of Nicholas ' care and tenderness . In November , even Nicholas ' desire to protect her from any emotion which might possibly interfere with his child 's developmentwas not proof against a shattering calamity . When the news reached them they sat after supper in the Red Room . No malignant or superstitious influences about that room now ; Miranda sometimes wondered how she had ever been silly enough to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed corner . SometimesMiranda played it , finding its unobtrusive tinkle better suited to the tunes she liked than the grandeur of the piano-forte in the music room . She and Nicholas sat on either side the center table in the warm circle of lamplight . At her request he was reading to her . Miranda absently netted a purse , while she listened . The story filled her with a pleasant melancholy , and it delighted her that Nicholas should read so tolerantly this novel of religious faith and the love of Jesus . How he had changed ! she thought , looking affectionately across the table at his dark head . It was exactly as it said in these 6 books they read . Conversion followed upon the touch of baby fingers . They both looked up at the sound of galloping hoofs on the drive . ' Now , what could that be ? ' wondered Miranda without much interest . She turned startled to look at her husband , who had uttered a sharp exclamation . He threw the book on the table and stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baliff , clattered in . His moon-face glistened , his disordered homespun suit was flecked with horse-sweat . ' It 's bad , sir . Very bad , ' he cried , trying to get his breath . Miranda stared blankly from one to the other . She saw a quiver pass over Nicholas , then he lifted his head . ' Out with it ; do n't stand there blabbering ! ' The bailiff passed a grimy handkerchief over his face . ' Young is in , sir . He 's to pardon ' em all  --  the skunks ! Even Boughton ! The state constitution 's to be changed . It 's the end , sir . The end of the Manor . ' Miranda gasped , her frightened eyes flew to Nicholas , who stood as though carved from the granite on which Dragonwyck rested . Last week he had driven over to Hudson on election day to vote . But he had told her nothing of the election 's importance to them . He had expressed no doubts that Governor Wright might fail of re-election or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What does it mean , Nicholas ? ' she whispered . ' I do n't understand . ' As he did not answer , but continued to stand rigid , his narrowed eyes looking through both of them without seeing them , she turned to the bailiff , who shuffled uneasily , casting a nervous glance at Nicholas whom he had always feared . ' It means , ma'am , that the Manor ca n't hold together no more . The farms must go to whoever wants to buy ' em . The down-renters have won at last . ' ' Never , ' said Nicholas quietly . This calm assertion frightened the bailiff far more than if Mr. Van Ryn had shouted and cursed as any other man would . He moistened his lips . ' You ca n't help it , sir . ' Twill be law . The Van Rensselaers have given in already . They say as how the patroon even said it was a good thing . '   7'Perhaps it is , then , Nicholas , ' put in Miranda timidly , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you refuse to sell , wo n't it mean a great deal more trouble , and after all would it make so much difference ? We 'd still have all these acres around the house . ' He wheeled on her , glaring at her with fury . ' You little fool  --  d'ye think because a prating idiot in Albany says so that I 'll give up  --  ' His eyes fell to the white lace shawl which concealed the slight distortion of her figure . ' I beg your pardon , my dear , ' he said in his normal voice . ' I 'm being exceedinglythoughtless.  --  Dirck  --  ' he turned to the goggling bailiff . You may go . ' The man went out muttering . If the patroon wanted to battle law and the entire country , that was his business . He was pigheadedenough to try . But I 'll have no part of it , thought Dirck ; I 've got my bellyful of threats and bloodshed and shots in the dark . Out West I 'll go . Be my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . She knew that the manor system meant more to him than it did to the others , and that to him any curtailment of power was unthinkable  --  literallyunthinkable , in that he would refuse to recognize the possibility . She partially understood that the manor was to him a symbol . It was his kingdom and his birthright . Had he been the King of Naples or Prussia his attitude would have been no different . But this was not Europe , and America was not a kingdom but a republic . Willingly or not , they were subject to the laws of the democracy in which they lived . The manor was a hang-over from the past , not even the past of this country but an abortive offshoot from medieval Europe . The expanding republic had lopped it off like any other dead branch . Miranda did not realize how much of her ready acceptance of the situation she owed to Jeff . When he had been at the farm he had sometimes talked of the evils of the manor system , and she had closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had heard , nonetheless . After all , she thought with feminine practicality , the breaking up of the Manor would affect neither their wealth nor their home , and it would certainly turn a hostile tenantry into peaceful neighbors .   8 If only Nicholas would accept defeat for once . She looked at him wistfully and knew how futile this hope was . He would never accept a thwarting of his will in any matter , great or small . If he seemed to do so , it was only that a stronger and more hidden purposemight be served . ' I do n't see what you can do , Nicholas , ' she said quietly . ' If it 's the law now that you must give up the farms . ' ' I shall never give them up , ' he returned with equal quiet . ' The Manor will go intact to my son . ' But it 's impossible , she thought . Did he really think that he could fight against the whole country single-handed ? Even Nicholascould not do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had far larger holdings , were already accepting the inevitable . He walked over to her and resting his hand on her shoulder said : ' Miranda , can you doubt that I am always master of circumstance ? Would you be here with me , bearing my child , if I were not ? ' She looked up at him , startled . His words were true enough , and yet it seemed that his voice carried a dark and secret emphasis . It was as though she heard a warning bell from shoals muffled by fog , a faint and sinister tolling from far away . Her eyes widened . ' Why do you look like that , Nicholas ? ' she whispered . He took his hand from her shoulder and smiled quite naturally . ' You must worry about nothing , my love . Nothing . The Manor affairs are my concern . You need n't give them another thought . You must go to bed now ; it 's getting late . ' He bent and kissed her forehead . She obeyed him silently , walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , Peggy awaited her as usual . The peaked little face had filled out in these months , had acquired a pixie-like prettiness . She was happy at Dragonwyck , happy in her service to the lady of the manor . The other servants liked Peggy , for her ready Irish tongue was quick but never wounding and her infirmity touched them . So they forgave her the little important airs that sprang from her position as the mistress 's personal maid , and they forgave her her jealous refusal to let anyone but herself tend Miranda . ' ' T is late ye are tonight , mum , ' the maid said anxiously whenP239she saw her mistress walk in , her blonde head drooping . ' Ye 'll not be too tired ? ' Miranda smiled vague greeting and did not answer . The misty fear which had seized her when Nicholas touched her shoulder had receded , but it had left a clinging wisp of disquiet behind . She dropped wearily into one of the needlepoint chairs , closing her eyes while Peggy brushed the loosened hair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought direct physical peace . The cedar-wood fire crackled cheerily and gave out a faint fragrance . The room was in exquisite order as Peggy had been taught to keep it . The great bed 's sheet had been turned down , and a hot brick wrapped in flannel subdued the iciness of its lavenderscentedlinen . Peggy had forgotten nothing , the hot milk which Miranda must drink , the exact placing of the pillows so that they might best support a body that had grown clumsy and hard to rest . ' Better now ? ' asked Peggy tenderly as she tucked in the blankets and arranged the coverlet . Miranda started to nod , then gave an exclamation of surprise . Her hands flew to her abdomen . ' Peggy , ' she cried , what was that ? ' The little maid paled . ' It was n't a pain ? ' Miranda shook her head . No pain . A queer fluttering like a bird inside there . ' Peggy clasped her hands . ' Oh , the saints be thanked ! I 've been so worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lady dear . Your little baby moving within you . ' Miranda pushed down the covers and gazed at herself in amazement . ' It never seemed real before , ' she said , half laughing , half bewildered . During all these months of illness and lethargy , the baby had been an intellectual concept , nothing more . Even the furnishingof what had used to be her own old room as a nursery had given her no realization of the baby as a new and separate entity . A thrill of awed gladness came to her now , an anticipation so poignant that it erased the last traces of the uneasiness which Nicholas had caused her . ' Why did you say you 'd been worried , Peggy ? ' she asked dreamily . This sensation is wonderful , nothing to worry about . ' The maid hesitated , but it could do no harm to tell now that everything must be fine . " T is late you are in feeling it , mum , withP240you going into your seventh month . I 've been watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that she had fortified her own considerable knowledge of midwifery by anxious consultationswith Mrs. MacNab , the housekeeper . Miranda , protected both by ignorance and this new bliss , laughed placidly . ' Well , perhaps he 's a very plump baby and was too lazy to move sooner . ' Peggy laughed too . But as she pulled the curtains and placed the screen before the dying fire , she thought , The Holy Blessed Mother grant that she 's right , and that it is n't that the poor mite was too feeble to make himself known . A stormy November full of sleet and hail became a cold snowy December . It was after all unnecessary for Nicholas to make overt resistance to change on his manor , for as yet the new laws had not been passed , nor the new Governor taken hold . It was in fact to be eight years before the last of the litigation and state suits against landlords for the trying of titles finally simmered into peace . In the meantime the tenants , having won their point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they had for years . On December sixth , the Manor House was again thrown open for the Saint Nicholas Day feast to the children . This year none of the neighboring river families ' children were invited . Nicholas had no intention of risking refusals . Had it not been for Miranda 's condition , he would before this have concentrated his will on the subduingof these families who dared hold aloof . He would have invited important guests from New York , enlisted the aid of old Martin Van Buren , and given a ball of such dazzling brilliance that the countryside would have come out of curiosity if nothing else . As it was this must wait until spring , when Miranda had recoveredand there would be an heir to Dragonwyck . The children of the tenantry , however , flocked to the party  --  nearly a hundred of them . Their parents were no more averse than the rest of the world to getting something for nothing , and many of them had sadly missed this festivity last year when the Manor had been shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunningly hidden in the gilded sabots there were gifts and candies for each child . There were showers of marzipan bon-bons in theP241muslin sheet suspended from the ceiling which Nicholas ripped open for them with the traditional crook . There were unlimited supplies of gingerbread and olykoeks fried to a succulent crispness , there were flagons of beer and rum punch . After the ceremony , Nicholas moved amongst his people exertinghis magnetism upon each one , flattering them with personal inquiries , expressing his pleasure at seeing them . By not the slightest word or gesture did he indicate knowledge that many of these had been his bitter enemies , and had spent the past two years in violent struggle to escape from his hold . His attitude of benevolent interest was precisely as it had always been during the ten years of his patroonship , precisely that of his father and grandfathers back to the first patroon in 1640 . When the last crowded wagon left , its runners gliding swiftly through the new snow , Hans Gebhard 's fat wife looked down at her three happy children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching the fine gifts they had received  --  a doll , a singing top , even a pair of skates . On their tongues still lingered the reminiscent delights of cake and candy . ' The patroon 's naught so bad , Hans , ' said Mrs. Gebhard to her husband thoughtfully . ' Do n't you dass to call him the patroon , now that we 're quit of him ! ' Hans turned his sour face angrily on his wife . ' Have ye forgotKlaas , woman ? Will a few sweets and baubees wipe Klaas from your noddle and how the Van Ryn used him ? ' He spat morosely in the snow . Aye , thought Mrs. Gebhard , poor Klaas that had cut his wrists and died when the patroon turned him off the farm two years back on rent-day . Hans ' own cousin Klaas had been , and the whole businessmighty bad . ' Still and all ' t is done with now forever , ' she said . The manor rum punch filled her stomach with a pleasing warmth . She was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentdays ; come July they 'd likely own their own farm at last . No more kermiss neither ! The thought struck her like a blow . That had been something to look forward to all spring  --  the Fourth-of-July Kermiss ; the games and the feasting , the rivers of cold , delicious beer . She cast a nervous glance at Hans , afraid he might somehowP242guess her traitorous repining . Once having started she could not stop the disquieting thoughts . You could n't but own the patroon had saved them a good bit of worry . There was the shipping of crops to New York . For that he 'd made all arrangements , sending the stuff from the farms in one lot . They 'd have to manage for themselves now , each farm as best it could . Then there was the mill the patroon had built for them . It stood on a corner of the Manor House land . He 'd never let them use that free now any more , nor spread their nets for shad on his section of the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet without the bitter . She must be more strong-minded like Hans . No price was too high to pay for freedom , for the right to own the bit of land where the Gebhards had borned and labored and died for two hundred years . P243IT WAS ON THIS SAME SAINT NICHOLAS ' DAY THAT a troopship from New Orleans docked in New York . It landed a hundred wounded men , and caskets containing those who could no longer feel their wounds . Jeff Turner was amongst those in the first category and still too much shattered to be thankful that he was not in the second . A Mexican bullet had ripped upward through his left arm and collar bone , laid open his cheek , and plowed a groove through the side of his skull before it vanished into the bright tropical sky . Though all the wounds had promptly begun to fester , Jeff 's sturdy frame could have withstood that and the disablement of his arm and shoulder . He would have directed the cautery and splintinghimself , and then have proceeded enthusiastically with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head wound was another matter . He had been unconscious for days . He had been dumped on a gun carriage in Monterrey and dragged back to General Taylor 's base at Cerralvo . Here he had received hurried treatment in a hospital tent , and as he still declined either to regain consciousness or to die , he had been bundled into an empty supply wagon with a score of others and eventually reached the Texan coast , where a sloop conveyed them to New Orleans . The good Sisters at the Charite cared for him there while the skull fracture healed enough to permit him to travel home . Jeff had intended going up-river to Hudson at once , but as he lurched off the gangplank onto the pier he knew that he must have rest first . It was still a struggle to stand for long . He was subject ' to sharp attacks of dizziness . There were crowds of anxious relativeson the dock but none for him . He grasped his dilapidated carpetbag with his good hand and strode through the press , praying that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sympathetic glances were directed at the scar on his cheek and the dangling left coat sleeve . Though the arm had healed , the collar bone was slower and still needed the support of a sling . One lady in bombazine , seeing the pallor of his face , the gauntnessof his body in the ill-fitting blue uniform , cried , ' Oh , the poor young lieutenant ! ' But otherwise no one noticed him , for which he was grateful . He had the usual masculine horror of being conspicuous . When he reached the sidewalk , the city noises banged on his sensitive nerves like thunder ; houses , drays , and hurrying people merged crazily , swimming around him in slow spirals . Damn , thought Jeff , gritting his teeth . He tumbled into a hack , muttered , ' Hotel  --  cheap one , anywhere , ' and shut his eyes . The driver took him at his word , trotted his horse two blocks along South Street , and decanted Jeff at Schmidt 's Tavern , where he found himself established in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was clean , however , and it had a bed upon which Jeff flung himself after getting rid of Mrs. Schmidt , the landlady , who showed a sentimental German disposition to cluck and yearn over him . He lay for two hours in a semi-stupor , until the throbbing in his collar bone roused him . He sat up and ran his fingers impatiently over a lump on his shoulder . Another pocket of pus had formed on the surface of the partly healed wound . He scowled at it as he screwed his head around trying to see it . There was no mirror in the room . A quick cut of the scalpel it needed , and a wet dressing . His bag of instruments was left behind at Cerralvo amongst the cactus and yuccas . He made a sudden resolution , scribbled a note , and shouting for the landlady told her to have it delivered . Then he tottered back to the bed . It was dusk when he heard heavy footsteps ascending the stairsk and a knock on his door . Doctor John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , my fine young hero , ' he said , chuckling , and extending his hand as casually as though they 'd met yesterday . His wise eyes missed nothing of Jeff 's condition , but he would no more have expressed his sympathy than Jeff would haw welcomed it . Been makin ' love to a cannon ball ? ' he inquired genially , plump-P245ing his black bag on the floor and sitting on the bed . ' Could you not find something warmer and softer to embrace down there ?  --  No , do n't sit up ; do as I tell you , you young squirt . Lie still ; you think you know it all , I 'll be bound , but you 're not as good a medico as I am yet . Yes , yes  --  I see it , d'ye take me for a mole ? ' While he kept up an affectionate grumbling , his gnarled fingers were busy palpating the arm wound , the abscess on the collar bone , the healed scar on the cheek , the depression in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he observed with a twinkle , kicking his bag over to the bed and bending with a grunt to extract a scalpel . ' How 'd it happen ? ' ' Just one bullet , ' confessed Jeff ruefully . He indicated its upwardpath with a quick motion of his thumb . ' Was the greaser in a hole , then , or were you maybe skulking in a tree ? ' inquired the old doctor , and while he spoke he jabbed the scalpel deep . ' Ouch ! ' said Jeff . ' No , I was n't in a tree , but I was on a roof .  --  What are you dousing on that compress , sir ? I never saw stuff like that . Plain water 'll do  --  or maybe you should cauterize again ? ' ' Deliver me  --  ' retorted the old man with a terrible frown , ' from treating another doctor , especially a young know-it-all . Mind your business , my boy , and let me mind mine . You called me in , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' said Jeff , smiling . ' But what 's that brown stuff ? It burns like a red-hot poker . ' ' It 's seaweed and alcohol made for me by an old Chinee on Pell Street . And I do n't know why it ofttimes keeps a wound from festering , so do n't ask me . The Chinamen know a lot about medicineand I 'm not too proud to try their drugs . No more should you be . ' He tied up the sling . ' You 'll do now , my lad . Couple months from now you 'll be good as new , barring that scar on your cheek , though doubtless the ladies 'll consider it highly ro-man-tic . If you rest a lot and act like a sensible human being , the dizzy spells 'll pass too . ' He dumped his scalpel , bandages , and the brown bottle pell-mell into his bag , which he snapped shut . He lit himself a black and foul-smelling cigar , settled his massive body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anticipation on Jeff . ' Now , what in blazes were ye doing on a rooftop in Monterrey ? ' P246At first Jeff searched for words , struggling against the universal reluctance to talk of battle to those who know nothing of it . But gradually the old man 's eager interest had its effect . Jeff forgot the four musty walls about him ; they expanded into desert and dust , into brown adobe and the blinding gleam of white plaster under the Mexican sun . Old Rough and Ready Taylor had made shrewd plans for the capture of Monterrey . He had sent General Worth with eighteen hundred men  --  of whom Jeff was one  --  on a circuitous route to the other side of the city , while Taylor created a diversion on the eastern side to cover their march . On September twentieth , Worth had arrived at his position and the city of Monterrey lay between the pincers which inexorably narrowed down on it . One after another the Mexican forts fell ; Federacion , Independencia , and the Bishop 's Palace on the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of the twenty-third the Americans advanced into the bewildered city from both sides . But instead of risking life in the streets , which were raked by artillery fire and covered by snipers from shuttered windows , the American soldiers were ordered into the houses , where they tunneled their way through the interior walls , progressing through a cloud of plaster and falling rubble toward the grand plaza . Jeff paused , remembering the excitement of that march through the homes . Like a lot of terriers after a rabbit they 'd been . Burrowing , knocking down , jumping from rooftop to rooftop , rushing headlong through lovely flower-filled patios . They were all drunk with the ease of conquest , and the childish joy of destruction . He as drunk as any of them . It was only now that he remembered the terrified faces of blackcladwomen , cowering in corners of their ravished homes watching the shouting , exultant soldiers break their furniture , shatter the statues of the saints , rip rugs and draperies to shreds . By sunset both halves of the army had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican troops were huddled awaitingorders from their leader , Ampudia , whose efficiency did not match his courage . General Worth called for volunteers to plant a small mortar on an exposed rooftop which would command the square . And I suppose ye jumped up like a jack-in-the-box , ' growledP247Doctor Francis , ' when ye should have been back at the base caring for the wounded . ' Jeff reddened , then laughed sheepishly . Well , we hauled up that mortar and stuck it where it did a lot of good . The hot shells 'd mow down a dozen of them at a clip . But they did n't let us enjoy ourselves long . ' Jeff paused again . ' It 's curious , ' he said thoughtfully , ' but I saw my bullet coming . He was a handsome Mexican , had a fine face . I saw him squinting up along the barrel of his gun , down there on the street . For a second we looked right at each other , and I had a crazy feeling of liking him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned . ' That 's all I know first hand of our capture of Monterrey , for I did n't rightly come to from the blacknessand the haze until they dumped me in the Charite in New Orleans . ' ' I kind of like that greaser of yours too , ' remarked Doctor Francis grimly . ' You needed a bullet to knock some sense into you . Now you 're here , you 'll stay this time , my lad . Move into my office tomorrow , start learning the ropes . I 'll not work ye too hard till your brains 've got unaddled . ' Jeff sent the old doctor a look of affection . He perfectly understood the little plan to give him rest at a salary . For a moment he was tempted . If he went in with Doctor Francis , it would mean a big society practice , the idea of which he loathed , but it would also mean money enough for research , and association with a man whom he deeply admired . But that was just the trouble . Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being beholden to anyone , or of slipping easily into a ready-made practice . Besides , he was needed at home . He had been startled and touched at the dismay of his patients when he had enlisted . The old man read his face . ' Yes , there you go , ' he grumbled . ' I see that mule look . Independent as a hog on ice . Go on back to your little jay town , kill yourself for a parcel of flea-bitten yokels . ' He blew his nose stertorously . Jeff 's second refusal was a grievous disappointment . Every man of achievement longs for a disciple , a younger edition of himself with whom to share the accumulated wisdom and experience of the past . That few men ever find this disciple , Doctor Francis well knew . And now having found him it was hard to be balked . Still he understood Jeff 's reasons and honoredhim for them . P248Both men were companionably silent for a while . The old doctor wreathed himself in clouds of tobacco smoke , and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of yours last summer , seemed mighty interested in you , ' offered Francis suddenly . Jeff turned and looked his question . ' Right pretty girl ; married , though  --  so you need n't get all het up . Mrs. Nicholas Van Ryn , wife to that high mucky-muck whatyou-may-call-himup on the Hudson . ' Jeff expelled his breath and sat up . ' Where 'd you meet Miranda ? ' he said sharply . The other raised his bushy eyebrows . ' So , it 's Miranda , is it ! I met her at the Poes ' cottage and she made me a cup of tea with her own lily-white hands . ' ' How was she looking ? ' The old man snorted . ' Far as I remember she 'd a pink satin dress and some darn fool feather in her bonnet ; she 'd a mighty trim ankle and a mighty trim waist  --  all right , all right , ' he said in response to Jeff 's ejaculation . ' She looked healthy enough , if that 's what you want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned . ' Waist 's not so trim now , I 'll be bound ; she must be two months from term . ' ' What ! ' cried Jeff violently . Doctor Francis chuckled at Jeff 's air of stupefaction . ' Anybody ever tell you about the stork , Jeff ? Bird that 's likely to come moseyingalong when a young couple 's married ? Or when they 're not , for that matter . ' Jeff made an impatient gesture . How do you know she 's  --  she 's pregnant ? ' He had managed to forget Miranda quite completely during his months in Mexico , had shut the memory of her away in an air-tight compartment and thought that any sentimental yearnings he had had for her were done with . He was therefore annoyed to discover how much he disliked the thought of her bearinga child to Nicholas . ' I know , ' answered Doctor Francis , ' because the great Mr. Van Ryn wrote me about it . He favored me with a request  --  more like a royal command at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang around for weeks until his lady takes a notion to produce this marvelous infant . ' P249'Are you going ? ' asked Jeff slowly . ' I am not ! I told him most politely that I 'd better use for my time than to fuss over one healthy girl , counting every pulse beat . He can find himself some other tame puppy . Plenty 'd be glad enough to get the fee he offered . Come to think of it , you can do it yourself now ; you 'll be right handy . ' ' No ! ' said Jeff explosively . The old doctor leaned back and contemplated the young man . ' Little bit smitten with the lady 's charms , are n't you ? ' It 's not that . But  --  well , Van Ryn would n't want me . I attended the death of his first wife . ' Doctor Francis nodded . ' What 'd she die of , anyway ? Was n't it kind of sudden ? ' ' Acute indigestion . Very sudden , ' Jeff answered curtly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must have sprung from unrecognized jealousy . His face grew hot when he thought of those bungling little experiments he had made on the tipsy cake . Why n't you get married , Jeff ? ' The old man put down his cigar and laid an affectionate hand on Jeff 's good shoulder . ' Must be some tidy little woman around who pleases you . And if you 're not so fond of her at first , you 'll get to be once she 's yours . ' He chuckled . ' Lots of truth in what old Benjamin Franklin said , " All cats look gray at night . " ' Jeff smiled and thought of Faith Folger . On the day he had sailed down-river to join the army she had stood at the Hudson dock beside her mother . The black eyes had been full of tears . ' I 'll be waiting for thee , Jeff , ' she had whispered , ' until thee comes back . ' He had kissed her quickly while her mother pretended not to see . The kiss had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of Miranda , and in any case he had not really expected to come back . But now the thought of Faith was comforting . ' I think I 'll take your advice , sir , ' he said to Doctor Francis , ' as soon as I have two whole arms and a steady head to offer a woman . ' Hudson welcomed Jeff home with wild enthusiasm . Had he permittedit they would have made a hero of him , but as he refused to be lionized they contented themselves with flocking to his little house on Front Street and bringing gifts ; calves ' - foot jelly , pound cake , ducks and chickens already roasted . The old black Rillah had nothing to do but fuss over Jeff and serve the dainties which were provided . By New Year 's Day , it seemed to Jeff that he had never been away at all . His left arm was stiff but had regained its usefulness , the spells of vertigo diminished in frequency , and he could ignore them enough to take on a restricted practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send her a New Year 's present . ' The Golden Chalice  --  or Mental Draughts from Many Fountains '  --  a popular gift book that year , prettily bound in red leather tooled with gilt . Faith was encouraged . ' The Casket of Love ' or ' The Wedding Guest ' would have been more significant , to be sure , but any gift book was indicative of serious intentions , and she made her plans for a June wedding . Now that he was home again , she must on no account allow their relationship to slip back into the old half-teasing , flirtatious state . She wanted Jeff , and had turned down three flattering proposals for his sake . It was high time that he speak the decisive words . But January passed and Jeff remained unaccountably elusive . He refused invitations , pleading the need for rest . When Faith , growing desperate , invented a persistent headache and trudged through the snowy streets to consult him at his office , he received her warmly , even tenderly , but he did n't ' speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while and take a dose of calomel , then sent her away again baffled but not quite disconsolate . For she knew men , and there had been a special note in his voice , an admission of intimacy in his manner , and besides she knew and he paid no attention to any of them . In fact Jeff intended to propose eventually , but he had a male reluctance to being stampeded or to committing himself irretrievably . He finally decided that on Saint Valentine 's Day he would take the plunge . Send her one of those sugary , sentimental effusions which delight the girlish heart , follow it up by a formal call at her parents ' house . But when the fourteenth of February came , poor Faith received no Valentine from Jeff . He was at Dragonwyck . P251During the first weeks after his return he had heard nothing of the Van Ryns . He had rejoiced to find that the manors were at last to be broken up and that his friend , little Boughton , was to be pardoned , but aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in Kamchatka for all one heard of them in Hudson . The shore road was blocked with snow as the river was blocked with ice . Jeff had again made up his mind to forget Miranda and succeeded quite well . An epidemic of grippe inflicted itself on Hudson , and in consequence he was too busy and too tired to think at all . Then he got a letter from Doctor Francis in New York . Followingthe usual greetings and inquiries it said : Do n't be surprised if you 're called to the Van Ryns ' after all , for I 've taken the liberty to write the Grand Seigneur heartily recommending your skill . He 's got Brown there for his wife  --  Doctor William Brown from Gramercy Park . I know the man and he is able enough , but the trouble seems to be Van Ryn has got him terrified . Brown is in a funk , thinks matters are n't progressing just right and does n't dare tell Van Ryn . He sneaked a letter out to me begging for advice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like a normal pregnancyto me . I wrote back to the poor numbskull  --  ( my private opinion is that the size of his fee has addled his wits )  --  telling him not to worry , delivering babies is simple as rolling off a log . Dame Nature does it for you ( though we ca n't let the laymen guess that ) , but I ended up by telling him to get in touch with you if he needs help . Then I got a letter from Van Ryn himself , complaining about Brown and begging me to go up there after all . So I handed you to him too . All this pother ! The Grand Cham of Tartary would not make half the rumpus about an heir , I 'll be bound . Jeff threw the letter on his desk . Even if they did send for him , he would n't go . Nothing would induce him to involve himself again with Miranda or the dark intricacies of Dragonwyck . Doctor Francis was right and it was all a ridiculous pother . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was doubtless nothing wrong with her anyway . She had always been a healthy farm girl , strong as a horse despite her air of fragility . P252It 's all nonsense , thought Jeff angrily , rolled up his sleeves and went into his surgery to open a boil on little Jimmy Coffin 's neck . Next morning at eight his bell pealed and he opened the door to see Nicholas muffled in a fur coat standing on his doorstep , and behind him a red sleigh and panting horse . The two men looked at each other silently a moment , then Nicholas held out his hand . ' Will you come back with me , Turner ? ' he said almost humbly . ' We need you . ' Jeff frowned and receded from the door . ' You have a doctor up there ; I could do nothing more than he will , ' he answered coldly . ' Doctor Francis wrote me . ' Nicholas shook his head . ' Brown 's a fool . I do n't trust him . I beg of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown says labor is starting . ' He spoke in jerks . His face was haggard . His eyes , devoid now of all condescension or irony , were simply pleading . Jeff had dealt with many an anxious father , but Nicholas ' tensionseemed excessive . ' What reason have you to think that Mrs. Van Ryn is in danger ? ' asked Jeff gravely . Nicholas looked . at him . ' Miranda ? ' he said doubtfully . ' I do n't know that Miranda 's in any danger . Do hurry , Turner  --  I beg of you . ' Jeff was startled . Was this frenzy of apprehension then only for the baby ? Why did this man never seem to be motivated by a normal understandable emotion ? He felt a sudden sharp pity for the girl immured there at Dragonwyck . He sighed and reached for his greatcoat , cramming his stiff arm into the left sleeve with difficulty . ' I do n't know what I can do , but I 'll come with you . ' They were silent on the breakneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong violence and he lashed the horse unmercifully . The runners made a hissing sound on the packed snow , the silver sleigh bells jingled with an effect of hysterical merrimentwhich suited neither of their moods . The cold wind beat on their faces , now and again icicles fell from the overhanging trees , but Nicholas never slackened ; his jaw was set , his narrowed eyes strained on the white road ahead . Jeff sunk deeper in his greatcoat and was unpleasantly remindedP253of the last time on which he had hurried to Dragonwyck through the snow . My so-called skill was of no use then , he thought bitterly ; it 's a marvel Van Ryn still trusts to it . As they whirled up under the porte-cochere and Nicholas yanked the trembling horse to a stop , the door flew open and Peggy stumbled out . Oh , Master , ' she gulped , her mouth working , ' Missis is took bad and they wo n't let me near her . Please let me go to her . ' Nicholas pushed her roughly aside , not troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . Two people hovered over the great bed on which Miranda lay moaning , Doctor Brown and the German wet nurse whom Nicholashad also imported from New York . The doctor was normally a dapper little man with an ingratiating bedside manner which had won him many influential patients . But now his pomaded locks were in disarray , his neat beard glistened with the sweat that had run down his face . What 's the matter ? ' cried Nicholas , turning on him furiously . The little doctor gave his patron a look of concealed terror . ' N-nothing wrong , Mr. Van Ryn , ' he stammered . Labor has started but everything is quite all right , oh quite  --  quite . ' His air of false brightness deceived no one , not even the wet nurse , who muttered , ' Ach himmel ! ' under her breath and stared round-eyed at Nicholas . ' Mr. Van Ryn , would you and the nurse mind going out while I consult with Doctor Brown ? ' interposed Jeff with a calmness designed to quell this atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for alarm . ' As soon as the door closed , Doctor Brown mopped his face and heaved a sigh of relief . ' Thank God you 're here , Turner . I ca n't take the responsibility alone . ' He no longer cared that he might have to share his magnificent fee ; he would gladly have foregone the whole fee if he could have been allowed to return with honor to his safe and placid Gramercy Square practice . ' The man 's a maniac , ' he added somberly . ' I think he 'd kill me if anything went wrong . ' Nonsense ! ' said Jeff , moving to the bed . My dear chap  --  you do n't know , ' whispered Doctor Brown , glancing nervously at the door where Nicholas had gone out . ' I tried to resign from the case and he locked me in my room . He watches me all the time , glaring with those icy blue eyes ; sometimes I think he 's mesmerizing me . ' ' Rubbish , ' said Jeff , concealing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda gave a long shuddering moan and opened her eyes . Doctor Brown had been giving her laudanum ; she had been wandering alone in a dark world of fantasy where from time to time the shadows gathered force and welded themselves into shafts of white-hot pain . Her pupils focused slowly on the face which bent near her . ' Jeff ? ' she whispered on a little questioning note like a surprised child . ' You 're in Mexico , are n't you ? ' ' No , ' he answered , smiling . He smoothed the matted waves of golden hair from her wet temples . ' I 'm here with you . ' From miles and miles away the pain sent again its first tingle of warning ; in that shadow world there was no room for anything but acceptance , and the pain . She groped blindly for Jeff 's hand , derivingfrom its strong comforting grip the first reassurance she had had . The demon flung itself on her quivering body , wrestling , grinding , tossing , until , once more slaked , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I did n't know you knew Mrs. Van Ryn . ' ' Yes , ' answered Jeff briefly . He profited by the interval of peace to make a quick examination . Everything was entirely normal and going well . He saw no reason at all for concern and told his colleague so . The little doctor brightened . ' Glad to hear you think so . Must be the atmosphere of this gloomy place gave me the jim-jams .  --  Do n't know , though . I think there 's been something queer about the foetal heart beat . Awfully hard to catch through the stethoscope . ' ' It often is , ' retorted Jeff . He now thoroughly agreed with Doctor Francis and Nicholas that the man was a fool , and that his nervousnesshad obscured his judgment . At four o'clock of the following morning , Valentine 's Day , Miranda was delivered of a son . The baby was well formed and handsome , as he could hardly help but be , having sprung from exceptionally good-looking parents . He had a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of his mouth appeared a tiny mole like Miranda 's . His arrival was greetedP255with wild rejoicing . The Dragonwyck church bells clanged welcome , as signal to the tenants that there would be rum punch and beer served all day from the kitchens . The servants poured themselvesmug after mug , unchecked by any discipline . Peggy crept away to her room to offer a prayer of thanksgiving to the Blessed Virgin . She had been reinstated in the sick-room for the last hours of labor as soon as Jeff had understood from Miranda that she wanted her little maid . As for Nicholas , he refused to leave the cradle in the nursery where the baby lay nestled in silk and lace , but stood motionless gazing down at its little face . It was Jeff who stayed with Miranda . She was floating in the drowsy peace that follows childbirth . In this state of confused joy no one seemed very real , but she was faintly conscious of hurt that Nicholas had not come to her after her ordeal ; more sharply conscious of gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she clung through it all , his quiet , soothing voice the only comfort . To the passionate gratitude which most women feel toward the physicianswho deliver them , Miranda added something more . Though she was not to suspect it for a long time , it was during those hours after her baby 's birth that Miranda first felt love for Jeff . She knew now only that she was at peace and happy . But for him there was neither happiness or peace . He had known from that moment in which she blindly reached for his hand that there would never again be question of marrying Faith or anyone else . This disquieting revelation he pushed aside to be dealt with later . There was a more important fact to be faced right now , and he sat rigid by Miranda 's bed trying to determine what to do . Doctor Brown 's nervous forebodings had after all had a basis , though the man was too stupid to realize it , and was getting pleasurablydrunk in his room on Nicholas ' best brandy . Jeff had instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clubbing of the tips of the tiny fingers . As soon as he had dared leave Miranda he had placed the wooden tube of his stethoscope on the little chest and found his worst fears confirmed . The heart beat was spasmodic and so feeble that it seemed each sighing breath the infant drew must be its last . I may be wrong , thought Jeff grimly , I 've been wrong before . P2.56 But he knew he was not . The baby 's heart was defective ; it might live an hour , it might live a month , but longer than that was an impossibility . Miranda should n't know until she 's rested , but I 've got to tell Van Ryn , he thought , and I 'd rather be hung , drawn , and quartered . He walked down the hall to the nursery and found Nicholas still standing beside the cradle , while the wet nurse sat and rocked in the corner of the room and suckled her own baby . Jeff took a deep breath . ' Mr. Van Ryn  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The baby 's not well . He has a bad heart condition . ' He waited , but by not so much as the quiver of a muscle did Nicholas indicate that he had heard . What 's the matter with the man ? thought Jeff , angry because this strained immobility made him nervous in spite of himself . He had a quick presentiment and peered into the cradle , but the baby still breathed . So Jeff tried again . ' It sometimes happens like this . I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . At least your wife has come through beautifullyand  --  ' he paused , went on with stony disregard of his own revulsion . ' Someday there can be other babies . ' Nicholas raised his head in a quick darting motion and the young doctor instinctively stepped back . There was menace in that poised body , and Jeff felt a sharp , atavistic fear . ' My son is entirely well , ' said Nicholas softly . ' I appreciate your services and they shall be suitably recompensed . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff , the site of his head wound began to throb . ' You wo n't believe me , will you ! ' he cried roughly . You never believe anything you do n't want to believe , do you ! ' He clamped his mouth shut , struggling for control . The baby gave a weak , gasping cry , pitifully unlike the usual cry of the newborn . Jeff bent quickly over the cradle , sensing as he did so the defensive gesture from the other man as though Nicholas would ward him off . ' Listen , Van Ryn , ' said Jeff , all anger gone , for suddenly he saw pathos in this stubborn guardianship of a hopeless cause , you 've got to face it . This baby wo n't live . It 's a miracle he was n't stillborn . ' And far better if he had been , he added mentally . The heart is malformed , probably a constricted aorta . No amount of care or nursing will help . It 's nobody 's fault , nothing could have prevented it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen his words carefully , P257striving to break through that impenetrable wall which was reared against him . He saw with despair that he had made not the slightest impression . ' You have great confidence in your opinion , Doctor Turner , ' said Nicholas politely enough , ' but in this case I have none . ' He left the cradle and walked to the window . The sleigh is waiting below to take you back . ' Silence fell on the room , broken only by the lusty gurgles of the other healthy baby at the wet nurse 's breast , and the creak of her rocking chair . ' At least , ' Jeff cried , ' let me prepare Miranda . Whatever you may wish to believe , it 's damnable cruelty not to warn her . ' Nicholas turned from the window . ' There 's no reason whatever for you to see Mrs. Van Ryn again . Good day , sir . ' He ushered Jeff to the head of the stairs and stood there , so that there was no possibility of communicating either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nicholas ' will , Jeff descended the stairs . After all , a physician thus summarily dismissed can neither plead nor , argue . Had it not been for Miranda he would have angrily washed his hands of the whole matter . Brown would doubtless accommodate Nicholas with the desired opinion on the baby 's conditionbefore he too was sent away . And then Miranda would be alone . I ca n't leave her like this , he thought , alone to face tragedy , alone with that madman . Even as he thought madman ' his scientific training rejected the term as inaccurate . Nicholas was not conventionallyinsane . He was in fuller control of his faculties than most men ever could hope to be . Not mad but something far more dangerous , a powerful soul obeying nothing but its own desires and moving in a realm outside the normal . But this was no time for analysis ; Jeff could do nothing about Nicholas . He stood irresolutely in the lower hall , until the sight of a servant scuttling past gave him an idea . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff in a low voice . Mrs. Van Ryn 's maid . ' While he waited he glanced uneasily at the stairs , afraid that Nicholas might descend to see why the sleigh had not yet gone . None of the morning sunlight penetrated into this huge hall ; here it was always gloom . It seemed to him that the fading nymphs and satyrs on the wallpaper leered at him through the shadows and that the carved black chairs were pointing at him hostilely . Do n't wonderthis place gave Brown the ' jim-jams , ' he thought ; it 's about as cosy as a mausoleum . He heard the door to the servants ' wing open and a light shuffling step . Peggy limped quickly up to him . ' Yes , sir . Did you be wantingof me ? ' Jeff nodded gravely . ' Yes . There 's no one but you can help . ' He told her , and the brown eyes filled with tears . ' Ah , the poor sweet mistress  --  ' t is cruel hard . I was thinking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' You 'll take care of her , Peggy , and help her to bear it . ' The girl swallowed . ' I love her , ' she said simply , and seeing Jeff 's change of expression , the corners of her mouth lifted . And I 'm thinking you do too , Doctor dear , ' she added softly . ' Now do n't be furrowing your brow at me . I could n't help but be using my eyes in those grim hours of the past night  --  and ' t is little enough of love there is in this strange great house . ' Yes , thought Jeff , chilled , that 's true , perhaps . But Miranda had chosen this strange great house , had fervently desired the man who owned it . So far as Jeff knew she had never regretted her choice . Nicholas was of the type to fascinate a woman ; they were ever attracted by ruthlessness and power , particularly when these were invested in a handsome physical covering . Motivated by his sense of justice and loathing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda was happy , would be happy once the baby 's tragedy was out of the way and Nicholas had accepted the inevitable . Even Nicholas could not deny death . He picked up his bag and smiled at Peggy . ' I 'm glad she has you anyway . If you 're ever in Hudson , come and let me have a look at that leg ; there might possibly be something to be done . ' ' T is kind he is , kind and good , thought Peggy passionately as she hurried through the baize door before anyone spied her in the front hall , not like him upstairs , with his eyes as cold as the winter sky . There was no need for Peggy to prepare Miranda . She knew from the first instant that she held her baby in her arms . She had slept in exhaustion for twelve hours , and then the wet nurse came in to her bearing a tiny bundle . P259I nicht can make him to suck , gnadige tram , ' the woman said sadly and laid the bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted the blankets . She gazed down for a long time , then her head dropped back on the pillow . She shut her eyes . Go away , please , ' she said to the nurse . When Peggy stole in later , she found them like that . Miranda with her eyes closed and slow tears sliding down into the baby 's fuzzy hair where his head nestled against his mother 's cheek . ' Och , darlint , do n't  --  ' cried Peggy , and knelt beside the bed . ' Sure and he 'll be happier in heaven , the precious lambkin . ' T is the Blessed Mother herself will keep him safe for you till you come . ' Miranda stirred and opened her eyes . He must be baptized at once . Get Dominie Huysmann , ' she said faintly . It was over this matter of the hurried christening that Miranda first discovered Nicholas ' refusal to admit that anything was wrong with his son . It was only after she shattered herself with anguished tears that he consented to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later in a month or two it would be done properly in church with the traditional ceremony and all the countryside as witnesses , Nicholas stated , and Miranda said nothing . Her heavy heart was lightened a little when the baby had been duly named ' Adriaen Pieter Van Ryn ' and the horrified pastor had scurried back to his wife , who soon spread the sad news far and wide along the river . The baby lived for six days , and during that time and despite Nicholas ' angry protests , Miranda kept her son with her , allowing no one else to touch him but Peggy . She refused to admit the wet nurse , and it was from her own breasts that he drew a tiny amount of nourishment . But he had not the strength to suckle properly , and on a stormy Friday night he gave a little cry and ceased finding the strength to breathe . While those six sad and dragging days passed , Miranda had thought much of God . She sent Peggy to fetch the Bible her father had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drawer , but now she placed it beneath her pillow and read constantly . What had for years been jumbles of meaningless words resolved themselves now , in the light of her sorrow , into comfort and strength .   She held the baby close to her and whispered the Sixty-First Psalm for herself and him . Hear my cry , 0 God ; attend unto my prayer . From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee , when my heart is overwhelmed : lead me to the rock that is higher than I : And gradually some measure of resignation came to her . For Nicholas there was none . When he walked into the room on that Friday night and saw Miranda 's face , he gave a violent exclamation . She shook her head , looking at him sorrowfully . ' Hush , ' she whispered . ' God has taken him , Nicholas dear . ' He flung back the coverlet , staring at the small , still figure . His face was convulsed ; he wheeled on Peggy , who crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 've done this , you loathsome cripple ! ' he shouted , advancing on her . You 've handled him roughly , you 've let him fall  --  ' ' Mother of God  --  ' Peggy whispered , shrinking . Her hands flew to her throat , she backed inch by inch from that blazing murderous face . Nicholas ! ' Miranda screamed , trying to rise from the bed . For a moment he hesitated , and Peggy drew a rasping , terrified breath . Then the fury drained from his face , leaving it gray , and he strode out of the room . For three days he did not reappear ; he locked himself in the tower room , which had been long unused . Frantic at her helplessness , for she was still too weak to get up , Miranda sent repeated messages and pleas by the butler and Mrs. MacNab . She did n't dare send Peggy . To these messages he answered through the locked door that she might make whatever arrangements she liked , nor would he say more . The tiny white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants and Peggy , who had forcibly prevented her mistress from going . On the morning after the funeral Nicholas came downstairs . He entered Miranda 's room and greeted her with a brief kiss . ' Good morning , my love . You look very well . White always suits you . ' She stared up at him , stupefied . Her eyes turned blankly to her white bed jacket , then back to his face . It was thin and drawn and had a sallow tinge which it had never had before . His suit was , rumpled , as was his cravat , and about him there was a very faint sweetish odor . P261'Nicholas , ' she cried , ' I 've been so terribly worried about you . ' ' That was foolish , ' he answered , and he smiled . Behind the smile there was a warning . He walked to the window and parted the curtains . ' The ice must be three feet deep in the west channel , and deep enough by our pier . We must give a skating party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Party  --  ' she repeated  --  ' Oh , I do n't understand you  --  ' She turned her face from him . She had been sure that when the first violence of his grief had passed then they would comfort each other , be drawn together closer than they had ever been by their mutual sorrow . And now as Nicholas continued to talk lightly of invitations , of the state of the roads and the possibility of more snow , she saw with anguish how it was to be . During the remainder of their life together he never referred to the baby , nor seemed to hear on the few occasions when anyone else did . It was as though it had never been . P262THE RIVER FAMILIES WERE MOLLIFIED BY THE VAN Ryns ' tragedy . One brisk March day the Widow Mary Livingston arrayed herself in the most imposing of her fluted white caps , and having passed the night visiting a friend in Valatie , she drove over to Dragonwyck . After that visit she told everyone that Mrs. Van Ryn was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't blame Nicholas in the least for marrying her , ' the Widow told Mrs. Robert Livingston of Linlithgow , who had come to The Hill ' for tea . And for my part I think he 's lucky . From a child he 's always been difficult , you know . I remember how his poor mother  --  Katrina Brinckerhoff she was , from Rhinebeck  --  used to worry about him . He 'd have gloomy fits , would n't speak to anyone , and pig-headed ! She was the only one could manage him . He 'd never listen to his father . ' She paused to replenish her visitor 's cup , and added reflectively : ' She was a pretty creature , Katrina was . Do n't know as I ever saw such masses of lovely golden hair on anyone . Come to think of it , this new wife of Nicholas ' is something the same type . ' Is she ? ' said the other lady politely , helping herself to a seed cake . ' I wonder , ' said the Widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Johanna was ever really happy with Nicholas . ' ' Oh , but surely ! ' cried Mrs. Robert . She was mad about him , and he was always so devoted . ' The Widow inclined her stately head . ' I know , but Johanna told me once long ago before she got so  --  so corpulent and  --  ' mindful that she was speaking of the dead , she suppressed stupid ' and substituted'slow , ' she told me that he 'd never forgive her for not bearing him a son . Those were her very words , " He 'll never for/give me . " Of course she could n't have another try at it , you know  --  ' The Widow leaned forward and whispered . The old lady had flourished in a franker age and was sometimes indelicately outspoken . Mrs. Robert Livingston blushed . ' Oh , well , ' she said hastily , a disappointment , of course , but it happens to many . ' ' That 's what I told Johanna , but she just sat and stared at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know Nicholas , " she said . The way she said it gave me quite a turn . ' Indeed ? ' said Mrs. Robert , growing bored , for she had never known the Van Ryns very well . ' No doubt he 'll have a healthy son yet . And if you think the new wife is acceptable , I too will call when I 'm in the neighborhood . ' She did call , and the rest of the local gentry followed suit . The young Van Ryns entertained constantly that year . Nicholas seemed possessed of feverish energy . Gone were the quiet domestic days they had enjoyed before the baby came . He invited people for weeks at a time , all kinds of people  --  New York or Albany aristocracy , English noblemen  --  there was always in New York at that period a stray foreigner or two with a portfolio of notes entitled ' My Observations of American Life . ' He invited soldiers too , though no one below the rank of captain . In September Mexico surrendered and the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with voices from the time that guests straggleddown to the huge buffet breakfasts until after midnight , when they straggled up again , exhausted with festivities . Most of them were dazzled by the constant entertainment provided for them  --  the boating parties , the rose fetes in the gardens , the musicals and charades , the dances and elegant picnics on horsebackaccompanied by a cart and four servants to dispense hampers of capon or boned shad . Only a few of the more sensitive ones grew weary of constant regimentation , or sensed despotism in their host 's arrangements . One of the critical ones was Lady Hermione Basset , daughter to an obscure English earl . She was a middle-aged virgin and she was , of course , keeping a journal of her travels . It was called Little Gleanings from Across the Great Atlantic , ' and it was written withP264an eye to publication once she should have finished gleaning and I returned to London . On the twentieth of September , 1847 , Lady Hermione having arrived two days before and having since then danced , boated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in archery contests , excused herself firmly , retired to her room , and vouchsafed to life at Dragonwyck some of her most penetrating observations . ' Situated upon one of the most picturesque of American estuaries , ' began Lady Hermione cautiously , ' there rears itself a noble pile , a veritable castle , not inferior in magnitude or embellishment to some of the smaller seats of the aristocracy in England . The edifice is composed of gray stone upon which a creeping vine whose exact botanical nature I have not yet determined  --  ( memo , must ask )  --  tenderly nestles , and this taken with carved gables and a commanding turret lend an air of antiquity . Imagine my astonishmentto learn that the building was so constructed not ten years ago ! ' In truth there is much to astonish the visitor in this estate . An esthetic taste and unlimited purse have combined with wild primevalnature to produce an effect of luxurious exoticism . How charmingthese bosky dells beneath the hemlocks ! How moving to the responsive heart these marble gazebos by rippling silver streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicoloredblossoms ! ' Within the hall too , all is of a Gothic and tasteful magnificence . And here the feast of reason and the flow of soul mingle around the groaning board with delicately seasoned viands , and the most impeccable of wines ! ' Lady Hermione nibbled the tip of her pen and frowned . Was ' impeccable ' precisely the word ? Well , no matter , she could fix it later . She hastened on to the really interesting subject . ' You will be wondering , dear reader , what type of denizens inhabitthis delightful abode , and I shall hasten to apprise you . Mr. X  --  my host , is a gentleman of singular personal beauty . In stature he is tall and somewhat slender , luxuriant raven locks bestrewhis lofty brow ; his flashing eyes stir and startle the beholder , for they are of the most fiery and cerulean blue . Imagine if you will the prepossessing appearance of Lord Byron allied t ) theP265suavity of a Chesterfield and thus gain a partial impression of this gentleman , but only partial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate repose , the contemplative serenity which are the hall marks of true gentility . ' Alas , it is a flaw which I have frequently observed in this country ! This restlessness of spirit , this headlong pursuit of one activity after another ! Mr. X  --  excels in physical exercise , he rides like a centaur but at a pace which suggests that the Furies are pursuinghim ; he swims like Leander , surpasses all other contestants at archery or bowls , but  --  ' Lady Hermione laid down her pen . The point she intended to make was rather subtle , and was it after all particularly pertinent to philosophical comments on the United States ? She was astute enough to realize that neither Dragonwyck nor Mr. Van Ryn were in the least typical , and perhaps it was not in the best of taste to criticize a hospitality because she found it demanding and excessive ; because she had the uncomfortable feeling that the guests were by Nicholas shuffled and moved like pawns and had for him despite his surface courtesy no personal interest whatever . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very much smitten with Nicholas . It had seemed on her first evening at Dragonwyck that she and her host were entering upon a flirtation  --  oh , quite proper , of course , but exhilarating . He had given her a cluster of artemisia and made allusion to the flower 's name and her own resemblance to the chaste and lovely moon goddess . She had felt feminine and seductive . But it had n't lasted . His interest had disappeared just as suddenly as it started . She had watched with jealous eyes while he transferred all this flattering intensity to a Mrs. Gates  --  a little nonentity from New Jersey . In Miranda , Lady Hermione was not interested . She saw simply a pretty young wife , exquisitely dressed but rather quiet , who expressedno opinions and did as her husband wished . No wonder she seemed tired , thought Lady Hermione , rubbing her wrist , which had been twisted in the last archery contest . This hectic atmosphere would tire anyone . She would leave in the morning , she thought while she shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . There she had been told that she would find earnest thinking . It would be rather amusing to direct one 's trenchant pen to the dissection of cultural pretensions . It would at any rate be restful Lady Hermione could leave , but Miranda could not . Life for her at this time resolved itself into a skimming along on the surface obedient to Nicholas ' will . She was neither happy nor unhappy ; it was as though she had started with him upon a frenzied race toward an unspecified goal . There was neither direction nor purpose , but the ceaseless activities , the pressure of people , and Nicholas ' dominance gave her no time to realize it . It was only in dreams that she sometimes knew a bitter sadness and sense of catastrophic loss . From these she would awaken to find herself crying . She had no time to consult her soul , and no privacy . Outside of her room there were people , and within it there was always Nicholas . She had no friends . Several times one amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here at last was someone who saw her as an individuality apart from Nicholas . But the situation never ripened . Without ever seeming to do so , Nicholas intervened , and soon the guest would depart again , havingseen in Miranda just what Lady Hermione had  --  only a pretty young wife who adored her husband and had nothing much to say for herself . In the same way the visit from Miranda 's mother was repeatedly postponed . Abigail could have come now at any time ; her rheumatismhad improved , Tabitha 's baby was doing well . When Abigailhad received the letter telling of the death of Miranda 's own baby , she had expected to leave for Dragonwyck at once . But the months went by and there was no more talk of her coming . Miranda'sletters became very infrequent and brief . They read like society bulletins . Yesterday we entertained ex-President Van Buren and a host of others who have interest in the election , ' or , ' Tomorrowwe go to a ball at the Astors . I believe it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail hid her hurt under brusqueness of manner . Ephraim , the boys , and even little Charity suffered under the increased sharpness of her tongue . And as for Jeff , until the fall of 1849 Miranda did not see him at all . She had thought for a while after the baby 's death that she would see him often , that Nicholas  --  who must like the young doctor , for had he not twice called him in a crisis ?  --  would invite Jeff to Dragonwyck . P267Nicholas not only would not invite Jeff , but he forbade Miranda to see him for any reason . She might not take Peggy to have the leg looked at . She was to have nothing more to do with Doctor Turner . Miranda had long since ceased trying to find reasons for all her husband 's behavior , but she understood that he wished to see nothingand no one who reminded him of the baby 's death . And she submitted in this too , all the more readily because she had a feeling of guilt about Jeff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were not entirely fitting to a wife . So she did as Nicholas wished . It was Peggy who suffered during this time . She tended her mistressfaithfully , and Miranda was always kind , but the old close relationship was obscured . The missis was always in a hurry , morning , noon , and night . She seemed to think of nothing but her lovely clothes and the occasions for exhibiting them . There were no more little confidences and no more chance for them , because master was always in the way . And Peggy was afraid of Nicholas . He ignored her ; when she was assisting Miranda with some detail of the toilet , he looked through Peggy , and almost never addressed her . She knew that he allowed her to remain because she had becomevery useful to Miranda  --  she had learned to sew and to press , she kept every detail of the elaborate wardrobe in exquisite order  --  but she never forgot the look in his eyes on the night the baby died . She understood that that outburst had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been the temporary and unwitting scapegoat ; she understood even that as much as it was in his nature to regret anything , he probably regretted that loss of control . Nevertheless , she was constantly uneasy in his presence . Besides the master , there was another cause for uneasiness at Dragonwyck . There had been a queer feeling about the house duringthe few days of the poor wee one 's life . Not just sadness , but a nasty creepiness that gave you shivers up and down the backbone . This feeling was worst in the little Red Room , though the other servants did n't feel anything out of the way when they went in to clean . But Peggy did . One evening while the master was shut up in his tower , and the mistress was in bed with her sick little baby , Peggy had gone into the Red Room to hunt for a lace handkerchiefthat was missing . She had n't stayed to search for it , be .   cause there had been someone else in that room . Someone you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As real and as awful as the Black O'Donohue who galloped round Lough Leane on All Souls ' Eve , real as the little folk who danced in the ruins of Aghadoe . Peggy had run wildly from that room and locked herself into her own bedroom in the attic . Her hands had been soaking wet while she told her beads on the arbutus rosary . Weeks later she had mentioned something of this to her mistress , but the poor sweet lady had n't wanted to listen . She 'd spoken quite sharply , while her eyes had held a bit of a strained , frightened look . So Peggy had said no more , and anyway the creepy feeling seemed to be gone . Sometimes Peggy whispered to herself an old Gaelic charm . The red-headed mother had taught it to her long ago in the sod cottage near Killarney . ' Three things are of the Evil One  --  An evil eye ; An evil tongue ; An evil mind . ' Three things are of God , and these three are what Mary told to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The merciful word , The singing word , And the good word . ' May the power of these three holy things be on all the men and women of Erin for evermore . ' This was the sense of the charm , but Peggy said it in the ancient language as her mother had taught her . There was more magic in it that way . There was need for magic  --  good magic and prayers in that house  --  for never a bit of comfort did the poor mistress seem to get out of her own creed , after the baby died . The master laughed at her when she read in the Bible , and once he asked her what good all her superstitions and ' caterwauling to an imaginary image ' had done her or anyone . Had they ever prevented sorrow or disappointment , he asked her in that quiet , sneering way of his . And the Bible had pretty soon gone back to the bottom drawer . Small harm in that , maybe , thought Peggy , who knew little of theP269Bible and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every soul , high or low , needed faith . She lit many a candle to the Blessed Mother and asked Her about it . In New York this was easier , for there was a new church not far from Stuyvesant Street and she could slip out to early Mass . The mistress seldom rang for her any more until nearly noon . It was in New York on May tenth of 1849 that this phase of Miranda 's life came to an abrupt close , and the Astor Place massacrewas the cause of it . The Van Ryns were bidden by the Clement Vandergraves to dine at four and go on afterward to the Astor Place Opera House , where they would witness William Charles Macready 's interpretationof Macbeth . ' All of fashionable New York was going , not only because performances at the Opera House were extremely elegant  --  it had been built in 1847 by a hundred and fifty gentlemenof wealth and social prominence  --  but because Macready 's appearance tonight promised to be interesting . Three days ago on May seventh the ridiculous feud between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor climax when both actors presented themselves in Macbeth ' on the same evening  --  Macready at the Astor and Forrest at the Broadway . There had been disturbance at both performances ; each audience was composed of friends who cheered , and enemies who groaned and catcalled . Society on the whole was amused ; everyone knew and discussedthe rivals ' relative rights to be incensed with each other . Aside from the loss of dignity and lack of ordinary courtesy displayed by two talented actors , this spectacle would have affected nobody except that it got out of bounds and was seized upon by the malcontents in the city . The quarrel became a symbol of class war . Macready was an Englishman and the favorite of New York society . Forrest was favored by the populace not only because he was an American but because he was most persuasive in such roles as Jack Cade and Spartacus which personified the struggle of the underdog against entrenched privilege . All over Europe at that time there were riots and insurrections born of class hatred . The same unrest trickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , but was it really working , that democracy ? That was the ever-recurring doubt of the people . From this fear sprang many manifestations of revolt  --  large and farreachingones like the Abolitionist movement ; smaller and less important ones like the anti-rent wars on the manors , and the Astor Place riot . Nicholas and Miranda  --  in the barouche  --  set out from StuyvesantStreet at four o'clock on their way to the Vandergraves ' in Gramercy Square . Miranda was happy . The May afternoon was fresh and fragrant . Nicholas was in a good humor , and there was the prospect of the theater with congenial companions . Miranda liked the Vandergraves and she adored the theater second only to opera , which had been for her an enchanted discovery . She thought with amusement and a trace of pity of the naive girl who had been so excited over Barnum 's shoddy freaks three years ago  --  and how beautiful she had thought that lurid pantomime at Niblo 's ! Now she was accustomed to the best , could appraise the singing of Truffi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' La Sonnambola . ' She had long since passed her initial embarrassing confusion between Richelieu and Richard the III ; she knew which speeches to appreciate , and when to applaud . She had not attained the blase attitude affected by the society ladies . Her interest in the world of make-believe on the stage was too eager for that , but she had attained knowledge and poise . She was conscious of looking her best tonight . Both she and Nicholas were in the ultra-formal attire which was expected not only from subscribers to the boxes , but from each member of the Astor Place Opera House audience . It was this emphasis upon full dress which particularly infuriated those of the populace who dared aspire to seeing the best opera or drama in the city . Without a black frock coat , white vest , and white kid gloves no gentleman would be admitted . To brighten the severity of his garb , Nicholas wore a very small carnation in his buttonhole and a set of sapphire studs . Miranda looked at him admiringly . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disquiet , she had never come to take her husband for granted . She still saw him consciously , not with the blank eye of habit , but alertly . The firm chiseling of his dark profile above the frilled white stock , the blackness of his hair , and the always startling blueness of his eyes beneath their heavy brows  --  these things still had power to make her heart beat faster . P27IDo you like my new dress , Nicholas ? ' she asked , hungry for the appreciation which he often withheld . But today he was generous . He turned and surveyed her , smiling . Her dress was of midnight blue  --  that color of all others most flattering to blondes , and the low heart-shaped bodice was cut as a basque . Of this Miranda was proud ; it was a new fashion direct from Paris , and would not be adopted in New York for another year . She had daringly avoided all the frills and flounces which were considered essential , and used for ornament only a diamond bow-knot at her breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-puffed hair . Nicholas raised her white-gloved hand to his lips . ' You 're beautiful , my love , you have excellent taste in dress . It 's always pleased me . ' ' Do I please you in all ways , Nicholas ? ' she asked wistfully . It was so seldom that he praised her , so seldom that he was approachablelike this . He was silent a minute and she thought instantly : What a fool I was to ask that ! Neither of them had ever mentioned it , but she knew what he was thinking . She had not yet given him another son . She had gone secretly to consult Doctor Francis on this delicatepoint , and been reassured . There was nothing wrong whatsoever . It was just a matter of time . Nature was unpredictable . ' You would n't be sitting here with me in my carriage if you did n't , ' said Nicholas , and he laughed . Decidedly he was in a very good mood tonight . They drove up Third Avenue so that they might see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again for the two hundredth time its ancient boughs were loaded with blossoms . How strange it was that it could go on renewing itself in exquisite youth , when the hands that had planted it had so long ago fallen to dust ! Nicholas got out of the carriage and plucked her a small flower . As she accepted it smiling , she thought that embodied in that little presentation of the pear blossom were the only three virtues which in Nicholas were invariable : his veneration for the Dutch tradition , his love of beauty , and his gallantry . On these three qualities alone could she always count  --  but it was enough , she told herself hastily , determined not to dim the gala evening . The carriage stopped on the west side of Gramercy Park beforeP272a flight of steps which led to a white-trimmed doorway bright with gleaming brass . The Vandergraves were as trim and shining as their house , and as solid . They were both round and rosy and kind . As do many happily married couples , they had grown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy wings of neat brown hair resembled her husband 's smiling face between equally neat and glossy side whiskers . Upstairs in the attic nurseries , there romped eight little Vandergraves , all topped with neat brown hair and all as round and rosy as their parents . It was a comfortable house , welcoming and cheerful . Miranda never entered it without a touch of envy , which Nicholas did not share . The Vandergraves bored him , but he suffered their acquaintancebecause their ancestors on both sides had landed on Manhattan Island with Cornelius Van Ryn , and they now belonged to that most conservative backbone of New York society , those of whom outsiders never heard . No function of theirs would ever be described in the newspapers ; they would be buried and their daughters would marry in the same inner circle without causing the slightest ripple amongst the populace , who had already begun followingevery mention of Goelets , Lorillards , or Astors with greedy interest . At half-past six when it was time to leave for the Opera House , whose performances began at seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy meal nor the conversation had been brilliant , but she had enjoyed herself . Rebecca 's good-humored chatter , her assumption that everyone was as good and happy as she was , created an atmosphere of ease . Miranda felt that Rebecca did not think her overshadowed by Nicholas as so many people did and that here at least she shone as a distinct personality . Intimate friendship was impossible , even had Nicholas allowed it , for to Miranda 's twenty-four years , Rebecca'sforty-two made an impassable gulf . And then there were all the children . No childless woman could share many interests with the mother of eight . Still , the visit had provided relief from the tension under which Miranda unconsciously lived , unconscious because she had grown so used to it that it had become her normal mental climate . When Rebecca said , nanny , my love , I 've rung for our wraps , I fear we may be late , ' Miranda smiled and rustled reluctantlyto her feet . Rebecca was the only person who ever gaveP273Miranda her childish nickname , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all went together in the Vandergrave carriage , and when they reached Fourteenth Street , Rebecca , who had been speaking with tolerant amusement of ' Commodore ' Vanderbilt 's efforts to bludgeon his way into social acceptance , suddenly checked herself and cast an uneasy look at the street . ' Oh , dear , ' she said ; ' there seem to be a great many rough-looking men about , and they give us such horrid stares . You do n't think there will be any trouble tonight , do you , Mr. Vandergrave ? ' Her husband patted her hand . ' Of course not , my pet . ' At that moment the carriage paused to make way for the crosstownstage and a large poster intruded itself on the startled gaze of the carriage 's four occupants . In fiery red letters the poster exhorted : AMERICANS ! AROUSE ! THE GREAT CRISIS HAS COME ! Decide now whether English ARISTOCRATS ! ! ! shall triumph in this AMERICA 's metropolis . WORKING MEN ! FREEMEN ! Come out ! Dare to own yourselves sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear ! ' cried Rebecca again with increased alarm . ' What are they planning ? Do n't you think we should turn back ? ' ' Why , no , madam , ' said Nicholas in genuine amusement . ' You surely would not let a few hysterical rowdies spoil your evening 's pleasure . This silly actors ' quarrel has nothing to do with us . ' The ladies looked relieved . Clement Vandergrave cleared his throat and swallowed the order he had been about to give the coachman . But a sullen mob filled Astor Place . While carriage after carriagerolled through to discharge its occupants on the red carpet that stretched up the granite steps to the palisaded portico , this mob gave way just enough for the vehicles to pass , but a low growl like distant thunder hovered in the still twilight air . As the Vandergrave party entered the theater , a man in a brown suit pushed past them and brandished his arms at the queue which I had formed before the ticket office . ' You ca n't get in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of pasteboard . ' I paid for this ticket and they would n't let me in because I had n't kid gloves and a white vest on ! They shut the door in my face  --  damn the stinkingnabobs  --  ! ' The thundering growl outside rose higher in pitch , muffled but distinct through the Opera House walls . Miranda looked up at Nicholas . ' It does seem more than just an actors ' quarrel , does n't it ? ' she asked hesitantly . ' I mean it seems to be directed against  --  people like us . ' ' I daresay , ' answered Nicholas , ushering her into their box and settling himself on one of the red-velvet seats . ' The lower classes are always jealous and trying to ape their betters . ' There was a distant crash and the diminishing tinkle of glass . A murmur of consternation ran over the audience . All eyes turned for reassurance to the group of frock-coated policemen who stood together in a far corner under the balcony . Their chief , Mr. Matsell , chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again and consulted their programs . The curtain rose on time and the three weird sisters played to a quiet , waiting house . When Macready , tastefully arrayed in chain mail , strode on in the third scene and announced to Banquo : ' So foul and fair a day I have not seen , ' he was greeted with an ovation marred by a few hisses which the police suppressed , and supporters rushed a placard to the side of the proscenium which stated that ' The Friends of Order wi1F - emain quiet . ' The Friends of Order did remain quiet , but the mob offside did not . It worked itself into a fury . In the seventh scene just as Macready , beating his breast and flashing his eyes , began , ' I have no spurTo prick the sides of ray intent , but only Vaulting ambition  --  ' a handful of stones crashed through the upper windows and bounced harmlessly along the gallery ; then clearly through those broken windows the frightened audience heard a shout . ' Tear it down ! Burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a second and then went on at breakneck , peed to Miss Pope , who made a valiant if pale and trembling Lady Macbeth . Another clatter of stones fell into the theater ; one of them hit the gorgeous chandelier , which shivered and tinkled threateningly . The parquet audience rushed back under the galleries . The play went on through the uproar , though the actors became inaudible nd were reduced to the status of wildly gesticulating puppets . Mr. Vandergrave rose . ' I 'm going to take my wife home , ' he said to Nicholas in a low voice , ' and I presume you will do the same . This is outrageous . ' ' Why , no , ' answered Nicholas , smiling and rising to help Reheccawith her shawl . ' I believe we 'll stay . I 'm fond of " Macbeth , " and find this particular interpretation remarkably interesting . ' He indicated the stage , where the third act was in resolute progress , though the actors had to skip over a stream of water which gushed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vandergrave shook his head and presented his arm to his wife . They quitted the box and hurried with other prudent ones toward the Eighth Street exit , where a squad of policemen escorted them outside . ' Do n't you think we should go too ? ' asked Miranda nervously . There was a constant banging of bricks , paving stones , and pebbles against the facade of the building ; the balconies shouted and stamped to the accompaniment of the pandemonium outside ) n Astor Place . ' Are ' ou afraid ? ' asked Nicholas , laughing . She sa v that he was exhilarated . He , who was so seldom amused y anything , derived from the hostility which surrounded them , rom the mouthing , frightened players , the shrieking audience , a sardonic delight . She twisted her gloved fingers together and tried to reason away ! ier panic . They were safe enough in the covered box , but what would happen later ? Suppose the rioters succeeded in firing the ) pera house , or in breaking in ? And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally ended , what would Nicholas do ? Danger was to him a joy and a challenge . A sharp apprehension seized her , fear that was separate from the ontagion of panic around her.
