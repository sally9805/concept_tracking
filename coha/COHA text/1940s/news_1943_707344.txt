txt Count Sforza 's Status In a statement published in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Oct. 1 Count Sforza declares that he is returning to Italy as " a Senator chosen by the Italian people . " He also tells us that he reminded Secretary Hull " that I was a Senator , which means representative of the people and not in the least one appointed by any royal choice . " It will be recalled that there are no elective Senators in Italy , but only Senators appointed for life by the King and who can not in any way be considered as representatives of the people . Count Sforza was appointed a Senator by royal decree on Aug. 3 , 1919 , on the basis of Article 33 , Paragraph 7 , of the Constitution , which enables the King to appoint Senators from among career diplomats who have been in active service for at least three years .
