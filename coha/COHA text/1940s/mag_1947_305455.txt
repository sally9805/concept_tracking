THERE WAS A TIME ( 471 pp. ) - Taylor Caldwell-Scribner ( $3 ) . <P> " May foamed ... on every street . . . . Spring had tossed her pale green garments on every branch . . . . Long beams of sun fell across Frank Clair 's thin white hands which lay on his coat , still , flaccid . . . . His eyes moved too slowly in their pits of dark shadow . " <P> Pitted , flaccid Frank Clair is the hero of a new novel by Janet Miriam Taylor Caldwell , whose previous novels ( This Side of Innocence , The Eagles Gather , Dynasty of Death , etc. ) have rung up a total sale of almost 2,000,000 copies . This Side of Innocence was the biggest fiction seller of 1946 . Consequently , the appearance of her new novel is an event for her admirers-and , for analytical critics , another ripe opportunity to examine the ingredients and treatment wherewith Author Caldwell has made herself one of the richest novelists in the U.S. <P> There Was a Time has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectations that were written all over earlier Caldwell works . But this time , instead of centering around rapacious industrial tycoons , it is a portrait of an artist as a young man . Frank Clair is born in the grimy English city of Leeds ( Scottish-English Author Caldwell was born in Manchester ) ; when he is still a boy , his parents bring him to the U.S. city of Bison ( Author Caldwell 's parents brought her to Buffalo , in whose outskirts she still lives ) . <P> Bison 's beastliness proves too much for hypersensitive little Frank . At 21 he no longer walks in the forest , where the baton of the " invisible choirmaster " conducts music that used to make Frank 's heart soar " on wings of agonized joy . " When the spring earth becomes " an orb of gold afloat in rainbows , " Frank just counts the orbs of gold that he has in the bank . He turns literary prostitute , and starts writing " poisoned pap " that sells well . He even , like Author Caldwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " international bankers " who " cunningly and sedulously plotted wars for their own profit . This was what the American people wanted ... a scapegoat for their fear . . . . Sound and fury , rage and excess , anger and despair , defeated dreams , filled every page of the novel and Frank was sometimes faintly embarrassed by the wealth of adjectives . . . . " This is an embarrassment that Author Caldwell never seems to feel . <P> Frank is saved from misanthropy and commercial success by a sweet and wealthy girl named Jessica . On the last page he is sitting down to write an honest novel-entitled There Was a Time . <P> Nero at Nine . Forty-six-year-old Author Caldwell 's life story is as extraordinary as Frank 's and much more convincing . At nine , soon after her arrival in the tough world of North America , she wrote her first novel-a story of the persecution of the Christians by the Emperor Nero . By twelve , she had done a novel about the French Revolution . She also attended grade school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , disapproved of pampering and educating women . When his daughter was 15 and had just finished a biography of Christ , he put her to work in a bindery.
