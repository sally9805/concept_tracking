txt ? United States opposition to the formation of a new world relief organization to succeed the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has filled many delegates here with a doubly felt anxiety . They are concerned over the immediate effects on world-wide distribution of food , clothing , and other supplies which will begin to be seriously felt by February , 1947 . They are perhaps even more stirred by what they regard as the ominous implications of the new situation and particularly of United States relation to it . As expressed by more than one delegate during the protracted relief debate in the General Assembly 's Economic and Financial Committee ( Committee No. 2 ) , they are especially concerned that : U. N. Hinges on Decision 1 . If the U. N. fails in such a crucial matter as relief  --  vital to the healing of war 's wounds ? it can not expect to succeed in the longer-term task of establishing and maintaining peace . 2 . If suffering is sacrificed to predatory demands of power politics and economic advantage now , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocs and narrow alignments will have been sacrificed . Delegates from receiving countries have discussed the question of world relief against a background of need which still continues in their own lands . There have been expressions of appreciation as well as of criticism . The effects of the postwar situation have been debated in thousands of words of detail . Alternative plans have been offered . Judged by the applause that greeted him , Czechoslovakia 's Jan Masaryk apparently spoke the thoughts of many when he quoted a Czech proverb that " a man who has eaten well does n't believe the hungry one , " and then added : " I beg of you to take note of that . " No sharper criticism has been directed against the American decision than that voiced by Fiorello H. La Guardia , Director General of UNRRA . Mr. La Guardia 's suggestion of a $400 , - 000,000 relief fund administered by a new U. N. agency was rejected , first , by Assistant Secre tary of State Dean Acheson , and , subsequently , by the United States delegation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record at yesterday 's Economic and Financial Committee meeting by Adlai Stevenson of the American delegation . The result is an apparently sharp controversy between the American State Department and the American Director General of UNRRA . Perhaps the best method of illustrating the two conflicting points of view is to quote from both Mr. Stevenson and Mr. La Guardia . The La Guardia comments are drawn partly from a press conference which the UNRRA chief held following Mr. Stevenson 's delivery of the American position yesterday , and partly from Mr. La Guardia 's own statements to the committee . Mr. Stevenson : " The task ' of UNRRA is now being brought to a successful conclusion . The job of preventing chaos and starvation in the immediate postwar period and of starting the liberated nations on the road to recovery has been well done . " Mr. La Guardia : " If the Assembly takes . . . no action in setting up a new international agency ) , conditions would be such that you 'd hear about them . . . . The situation would be bad by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grain Deficit Perl Mr. Stevenson : " The end of the UNRRA program will find the UNRRA receiving countries with agricultural production within sight of prewar levels , with industrial recovery well under way , and with the prospect of substantially increased exports during the coming year . " Mr. La Guardia ( substantially as follows ) : The large deficit in bread grains foreseen for 1947 makes it the more imperative for an international body to organize relief . Physical limitations , transport problems , strikes , and other factors should be included along with actual war devastation in estimating the degree of recovery in occupied countries . Mr. Stevenson : " The extent of this recovery is well set forth in UNRRA 's report . . . ( which ) states that ' without foreign assistance , imports will not cease altogether ; there will not be ( as there would have been in 1945 or 1946 ) widespread starvation , complete industrial paralysis . . . " Mr. La Guardia : " Mr. Steven- son , being a lawyer , inadvertently failed to quote the ' remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of foreign assistance will have less obvious and less spectacular effects , these effects will , nevertheless , be serious and lasting , ' " Mr. Stevenson : " . . . The International Monetary Fund and the International Bank have been set up to assist these and other countries with their balance of payments difficulties and their requirements for economic reconstruction and development . " World Fund Limits Mr. La Guardia : " I 'm talking about food . " ( The funds of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank are avail able for capital outlay but not for food , he explained . ) Mr. Stevenson : " Valuable mime will be saved by adopting the simple and direct method of consultation among those governments which are prepared to assist in meeting the remaining relief needs and with governments of the countries needing assistance .. . . " Mr. La Guardia : " Under the plan we have submitted ( which envisages the appointment by the Assembly of a committee of nine nations ) there is no need of five minutes ' loss of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done its part in alleviating suffering in the world . We are determined , subject to congressional authorization , to do our part in carrying whatever relief burden is still found to exist . We have never used food or the misery of human beings as a political weapon , and we do not intend to do so now . " Political Favor Jibe Mr. La Guardia : " I know what I 've gone through in the last three months . Mr. Stevenson made one statement that aid would be given all countries . Does that mean Italy , Austria , Greece , Albania , Poland , Yugoslavia , Czechoslavakia , the Ukraine , Byelorussia , China , Hungary , and the Philippine Islands ? " Mr. La Guardia 's sharpest gibe , however , was his comparison of the new State Department role with that of the Tammany boss of old . He recalled a picture of favors dispensed to constituents who were supposed to " remember the boss . "                   @ @
