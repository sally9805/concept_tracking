Like a beaten boxer reeling toward a knockout the German Army had seen the blow coming . It was powerless to parry it . The punch struck hard from the Mediterranean , and the southern coast of France became a new front to be fought by an army already presenting a strange study in military schizophrenia . <P> The Germans had violated almost every cardinal doctrine of their cherished idols-Clausewitz , Schlieffen , Frederick the Great-and they were paying a fearful price . But for the present , as if unaware of their grotesque lurchings , they fought on . <P> Their fighting no longer showed brilliance , resourcefulness , cohesive planning or even much sense . Their resistance now chiefly had the values of stubbornness and desperation . They fought because fighting and obedience to orders were bred in their blood &; bones . <P> In northern France they faced a crushing defeat , tried to stave it off by witless , expensive gambits without hope of success . In Italy , where the battle stood temporarily in stalemate , they had latterly shown no tactic but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Front they fought as if salvation depended only on spending everything they had left . <P> Somewhere close at hand in this strange split-personality career was physical disintegration . The attack from the Mediterranean was another complication thrown in by the Allies to bring it on .
