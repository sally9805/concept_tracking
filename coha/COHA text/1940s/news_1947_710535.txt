txt John L. Lewis reached an agreement in principle today with more than 40 per cent Jf the soft-coal industry , bringing his miners their greatest gains in the history of the United Mine Workers . In terms of cost to the industry , the wage , hour and " fringe " improvements , including a larger contribution to the miners ' welfare fund , add up to a " package " increase of more than $3 per man per day . The miners ' actual earnings will not be raised that much because ' part of the gain is in the form of reduced working time , at least an hour a day and perhaps an hour and a half . Although the agreement was described as " tentative , " there is a strong probability Mr. Lewis will have 75 per cent of the industry signed up by the end of the week . The South may hold out longer , but apparently a major coal strike next week has been averted . Rises in Coal and Steel Prices The new basic daily wage of $13.05 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators was 70 cents a ton . Some put the figure at $1.50 in extreme cases . Industry estimates of the increase in the country 's annual coal bill ranged from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 . The consensus was that steel prices would also go up . Some operators , even among those who are virtually committed to the agreement , were reported gagging on the terms . They " blamed " the United States Steel Corporation for leading the commercial part of the industry into a contract which they regard as eco nomically dargerous . One operator called the deal " a ' conspiracy " and suggested a Congressional investigation of the role of the steel companies ' mines in it . Statement by Negotiators The announcement after , three days of negotiations in the utmost secrecy said : " The negotiators for the Northern commercial coal . operators and the captive mines , together with the representatives of the United Mine Workers , announce that a tentative agreement in principle has been reached , subject to being reduced to the terms of a written contract and subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators are in the Northern Appalachian field , embracing Pennsylvania , Ohio , northern West Virginia and Maryland . The " captives " are the mines which feed steel mills , regardless of location . Illinois and Indiana operators did not immediately meet the reported terms , but they were expected to capitulate soon . Producers farther west were more doubtful , and those in the South were angry . Directors of the Southern Coal Producers Association will meet here Friday , despite the holiday , to determine their course . The policy committe of the United Miners was summoned to meet at 4 P. M. Saturday . The intent is to have the agreement on paper by that time for the committee 's approval . Basic Gain of $1.20 a Day While the terms were not anlounced , Mr. Lewis was reported . o have come closer to getting his entire original demand than ever Before . The basic wage for inside lay laborers , which will become 13.05 a day , is with few exceptions : he minimum rate in the mines . It s $1.20 a day above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced ' rom nine hours to eight and the // luncheon period is reported to be longer . The present levy of 5 cents a ton for the miners ' welfare and ' retirement fund was reported to have been raised to 10 cents , the full demand , but some sources put it at 7 cents . This item was tied in the bargaining to Mr. Lewis ' demand for six paid holidays . Industry representatives also were reported to have yielded substantially on the question of organizing foremen . The operators will not have to bargain for foremen when the new labor law is fully in effect , but such bargaining is not forbidden . It is understood that the agreement will run for nearly two years but contains a provision for reopening on short notice . Although the Taft-Hartley law requires sixty days ' notice , the penalty of nonrecognition by the National Labor Relations Board is unimportant if Mr. Lewis chooses to conduct the union 's affairs without benefit of the board 's procedures . A union may legally do this , labor lawyers say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union to do it . The basic steel industry , which can not operate without coal , and the Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company , largest commercial coal producer in the world , broke the operators ' front last , week with an offer to meet Mr. Lewis ' full basic wage and hour demand . George M. Humphrey , chairman of Pittsburgh Consolidation , also has iron ore and steel interests . The anxiety of this segment of the industry to avoid a coal stoppage which would shut down steel production was evident in the personal intervention of Mr. Humphrey and Benjamin Fairless , president of the United States Steel Corporation . As a rule their negotiations are conducted by agents . They were joined somewhere along the line by Charles , O'Neil of central Pennsylvania , representing the Northern Appalachian commercial operators.1 Before the breakdown of the first round of negotiations on May 31 , Illinois and Indiana operators had participated . Still earlier , ' the Southern operators withdrew and insisted on a separate contract . Average earnings of bituminous miners had been the highest of any industry group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . The new contract will add $6 to $9 to that figure , depending on when overtime rates begin . Much more than that will be reflected in operating costs , because , while the earnings rise , the number of productive hours will decline . Increased payments for welfare fund " royalties " may not be reflected in individual earnings but will be reflected in costs . Some operators in the first flush of anger maintained that the , country 's coal costs would rise ' $1,000,000,000 a year .
