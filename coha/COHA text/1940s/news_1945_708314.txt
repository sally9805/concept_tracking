txt The German offensive should at least serve to sweep away our stubborn illusion of " overwhelming superiority " on the western front . The ease and swiftness of von Rundstedt 's break-through was due to the wholly inadequate number of divisions in Eisenhower 's command . The weak spot in our line was weak because there were no troops to hold it in strength . Even if the enemy 's move had been foreseen , there existed no mass of Allied reserves to hurry into action . The divisions needed for building up a strong reserve are not yet in France . Air power , we learn this late in the day , has not brought victory . On Nov. 27 a dispatch from Allied Headquarters listed the Allied units along the whole western front : forty infantry and thirteen armored divisions , plus four and a half airborne divisions  --  say fifty-seven in all . Most of these had suffered fairly heavily during the past months of battle , On Dec. 1 a dispatch from Montgomery 's headquarters stressed the , rapid recovery of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses in France , the enemy had built up a force of about seventy divisions . As of Dec. 1 , accordingly , our " overwhelming superiority " over the enemy stood in the ratio of fifty-seven to seventy . In the light of events , it seems clear that von Rundstedt 's recovery of new strength was moving at least as fast as the arrivals of Allied reinforcements . These figures , from military intelligence sources overseas , were displayed fairly conspicuously in THE TIMES . They aroused hardly the slightest comment in the press . They did not in any way temper our extravagant ideas of the strength of Eisenhower 's forces or our pleasing fancies of a rapidly disintegrating Wehrmacht . A few days later the New Republic airily announced that the end was in sight : " unseasoned levies are being thrown into line ; * * * the Germans have nothing better to offer . The destruction of two or three German armies , on either front , within this month should open up the entire country to an Allied advance upon Berlin . " Twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction ? with a good chance of gaining a fairly decisive victory . This counter-offensive was the symbol of a far-reaching change . The skillful reconstitution of German combat divisions has practically reversed the balance of forces in the west and along the whole front von Rundstedt has now the prospect of throwing us on the defensive . The surprise in Luxembourg is not the cause of this sudden reversal ; it is the result of a basic change in the situation  --  a change achieved by the enemy 's vigorous efforts during the three months preceding . Von Rundstedt is now out to lick us ? not to postpone defeat . Foch Had More Men As an index of military effort the total of fifty-seven Allied divisions reported on Nov. 27 may have corresponded to last summer 's expectations ? when there were hopes of the Siegfried Line crumbling away for lack of defenders . It bore no relation to the task facing us in November , when the Siegfried Line was securely held and von Rundstedt was able to put up the stiffest resistance on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stretch of about 200 miles ( from Linnich down to the Rhine near Hagenau ) General Eisenhower had to rely on twenty-five infantry divisions , with eight armored divisions in support . Is it surprising that there was a " weak spot " over the long stretch between Dueren and the Saar battle area ? Was it the fault of Allied military intelligence ? Could the gap have been filled by divining the enemy 's intentions ? Along a far shorter western front , late in September , 1918 , Foch had available about 220 divisions , and the battered German Army then had no line of defense comparable to the Siegfried Line . The ninety divisions Foch could hold in reserve far exceeded the total number now under Eisenhower 's orders . In the Dueren sector General Hodges had to carry on a battle as stiff as the Meuse-Argonne , and also to " hold " the forty miles or so of thin front reaching down toward Patton 's army . For this large order his total resources were ten divisions . This leaves no mystery as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a normal operation of war . The clamor for scapegoats can serve no honest purpose . A reorganization of the Allied command will not provide the instrument of victory . The road to Berlin is out of the picture for a long time to come , and the divisions long fighting without rest or relief can not even make the western front secure . Churchill has already issued his order for heavy British reinforcements ; and at this critical stage it is more necessary than ever before to keep far away from the west the strong German forces now held to a losing battle in Italy . The rearming of French divisions has suddenly become an urgent necessity : without strong French armies the Allied order of battle can not achieve the strength needed to take up the offensive  --  much later on . For victory we must build up a vastly stronger army on the western front than was contemplated in any quarter a few months I ago . T. H. THOMAS . Cambridge . Mass. , Dec. 31 , 1944 . Helping Others to Self-Help To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the whole approach to the problem of post-war work and rehabilitation in Europe is wrong . Instead of considering ourselves as the goat , let us go along on the theory that God helps those that help themselves , and really just do that  --  help the poor wanderers and refugees of Europe to help themselves . We have the materials , perhaps , and the willing help to guide and suggest  --  let them actually do the work of it all , because they know better what they need and wantESTHER L. SCHWARTZ .

Allowing System to Continue To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We can all agree with " one prominent theatre manager " that the box offices are inadequate for the distribution of tickets . But why endure , as if it were the only solution to the problem , the burden of a legalized and regulated black market , the ticket brokers ? The theatre can not really afford this luxurious inefficiency . Today , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the theatre will pay . The boom will not last forever , and we shall again read articles headed " What Is Wrong With the Theatre ? " One obvious means of correcting the situation is to set up a single , central , non-profit ticket-distributing agency maintained by the theatres as a whole or by those members of the industry who may be wise enough to sponsor such an agency . The railroads sell tickets on this principle , the airlines do it , why not the theatres ? There is no problem at present solved by the brokers that could not be better solved under a well-planned system like this . For example , the problem of service men and other " visitors here for only three or four days " could be solved very simply by withholding from sale until the day of the performance a mathematically determined percentage of the tickets for each hit show .

Too Few Allied Divisions German Break-Through Viewed as Due to Numerical Superiority Plain Speaking Recommended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Edwin L. James in his Sunday column in THE NEW YORK TIMES very succinctly wrote of the urgency and need for a clarification by our Government on American foreign policy . I am pleased to see such plain talking . It seems to me that not enough Americans have arisen to the gravity of the situation , although many sense it . Either we must stand determined and arouse the national conscience , or be swept down in a tide of forces likely to prove inimical to us because the United States forfeited its right to act when action was demanded . We have now the greatest opportunity to help forge strong links in a - unified body of nations ; but if from fear of offending our allies we fail to exercise our prerogatives , it will be , as Mr. James indicated , another invitation to failure . The brotherhood of man is not to be predicated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made for that vain purpose . And while many Americans may profess to see no cause for alarm nor any desire to become involved in foreign entanglements , our steps have not brought us this far only to drop meekly by the international wayside and let the diplomats of the strong nations dictate the pattern for future alliances in which we will portray the weak . sister .

On New Year 's Eve one of the larger hotels seemed to have no difficulty in obtaining all the metal noise-makers and paper hats it could use . I do not doubt that other hotels did likewise , but I was not there to prove it . None of these gadgets skimped on materials . In fact , some were even more lavish than in pre-war days .

More Time for Blood Donors To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have spoken to several persons about giving blood for plasma and have been told that in many cases the excuse for not donating blood is the lack of time . I have been wondering if it is not possible , in view of the tremendous need , for the blood bank to remain open all day Sunday and possibly one or two evenings a week .
