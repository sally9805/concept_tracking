Not since Edward VIII gave up his throne for Wally Simpson had society anywhere suffered a comparable constitutional crisis . All week long , under giant camelthorn trees at Serowe , thatched-hut capital of the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland in South Africa , the tar-black chieftains of the Bamangwato tribe pondered and palavered . <P> Their lineal chief , strapping , handsome , Oxford-trained Seretse Khama , 27 , sat among them as they weighed his choice for wife &; queen . While studying law in England , Seretse had married Ruth Williams , 24 , a fair-haired London typist . By Bamangwato custom the Chief may wed only with the consent of tribal elders . Seretse had not asked for such consent . He was summoned home to defend his action before the Bamangwato peers . <P> The Accusation . Some 9,000 tribesmen of the 100,000 Bamangwatos traveled hundreds of miles along the dusty trails of their Texaslike land , bringing their own chairs for the kgotla ( parliament ) at Serowe . They listened intently to Seretse 's most formidable accuser , his uncle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nephew 's minority and absence abroad , mission-educated Tshekedi had been the black boss of Bechuanaland and one of Africa 's outstanding native rulers . <P> <P> A British high commissioner once deposed him because he ordered the flogging of a white trader who seduced Bamangwato women ; London quickly restored the regent ( TIME , Oct. 16 , 1933 ) . In 1947 , when George VI &; family visited Bechuanaland , Tshekedi greeted them in the full-dress uniform of the Royal Horse Guards , presented to his father by Queen Victoria . <P> Tshekedi ranged all his authority and prestige against Seretse . " Chiefs pass and are forgotten , but the country goes on , " he said . " Custom has been broken . It was a great wrong marrying this white woman . My nephew has killed us . He has made a precedent that the chief can marry without regard to or consent of the tribe . " He insisted on a divorce : " The white woman is not suitable for Seretse and the tribe . " <P> Other elders echoed the regent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife sets me a task , I would do it . But if a white woman says , ' Chop wood ! ' , I would answer , ' How much ? ' " Another said : " Nobody can cast fire among the people he loves . If you bring this woman , the tribe will scatter and pointing to a cattle stockade you will be chief of these poles . " <P> The Judgment . Seretse fought hard for throne and love . He had support from many who had grown tired of Regent Tshekedi 's high-handed enlightenment ( once the regent burned down the huts of tribesmen who defied tribal rulings ) . On the kgotla 's sixth day young Seretse brought the issue to a head . He leaped up with a challenge : " All those stand up who will not accept my wife ! " Only 40 rose . Seretse shouted : " Who wants me for chief with my white wife , whom I refuse to give up ? " Nearly 6,000 tribesmen responded with a thunderous standing " Yes ! " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn you , my nephew , " he cried . " They are using you as a tool . " Then he announced : " I do n't wish to divide the tribe . This white woman comes , I go .
