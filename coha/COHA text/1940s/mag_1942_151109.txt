Huey Long 's machine fell apart after an assassin 's bullet knocked Huey out of the driver 's seat in 1935 . But the machine has been patched up . This week it rolled as smoothly as ever through the quaint , crooked streets of New Orleans . <P> In the driver 's seat now sits squat , swarthy Robert Sidney Maestri , Mayor of New Orleans . Grandson of an Italian immigrant , Maestri is one of the richest men in Louisiana . His father made a fortune selling furniture to the love-for-sale ladies in the cribs of the Vieux Carr . When the cribs were raided , old man Maestri repossessed the furniture , sold it over &; over . Bob Maestri put his inheritance in real estate . <P> When death cut short the boisterous career of Huey Long , Maestri ( who backed him long before he became the Kingfish ) was his Commissioner of Conservation . New Orleans , the last rampart which held out against Huey 's domination , gave up a few months later . Big-beaked Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burly Governor Richard Webster Leche ( rhymes with flesh ) certified Candidate Bob Maestri to the job . Normally , Maestri would have come up for reelection in 1938 . But Leche talked the Louisiana Legislature into giving Maestri a six-year term . <P> Nobody has ever found anything seriously wrong with Maestri 's administration . Federal investigators have raked over his record without finding a trace of the graft that sent most of Huey Long 's inheritors ( including ex-Governor Leche ) to the penitentiary . Since he took office five years ago , he has pulled New Orleans out of bankruptcy , put its finances on a cash basis , cut $20,000,000 from its debt . Like the Kingfish , Maestri is smart . His friends dabble in rackets to their hearts ' content , but Maestri apparently keeps his hands clean . " Let the other guys have that stuff , " he once told a reporter . " I made mine outside . " <P> The cycle of reform that turned out most of the Long gang , rolled " Sweet-Smellin ' " Sam Houston Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maestri . Instead , it got rid of his rivals for Huey 's power . Most of the disgruntled Longsters who teamed with Sam Jones to lick Huey 's brother Earl are now in Maestri 's camp . It looks as if Reform has about run its brief cycle in Louisiana . <P> There is no real opposition to another term for Bob Maestri . Running against him is a bullnecked , balding lawyer , 38-year-old Herve Racivitch , who has been licked three times before-once for a minor city office , twice for Congress . If Maestri wins the city primary on Jan. 27 , he will be on his way to the Governor 's Mansion , may even start unpacking the rakish toga that Huey wore to the U.S. Senate .
