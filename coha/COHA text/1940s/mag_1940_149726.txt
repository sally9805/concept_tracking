For men 's deepest thrust into the infinitesimal , he can thank a microscope that sees things without the help of light . This is the electron microscope . With it , in Camden , N. J. , Berlin , London , Toronto and Pasadena last week , scientists studied things 50 times smaller than they could see a decade ago . <P> With microscopes using visible or ultraviolet light , magnifications of a sort up to 5,000 diameters have been obtained , but the really useful upper limit has hovered around 2,000 diameters . With microscopes using electron beams , useful magnifications have jumped to 100,000 diameters and more . Light is a train of waves ; to pick some tiny body out of the unseen , the waves must find it big enough to get hold of . If the body is much smaller than the wave length , it will slip through like a mosquito through a fishing net . Electron beams are also wave trains , but their wave lengths are thousands of times shorter than those of light . So , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh . <P> High electronic magnifications ( 105,000 diameters ) of vinylchloride polymer , a rubberlike synthetic , show a mottling of dots which scientists assume to be actual molecules ; 25,000-diameter pictures of soft face-powder granules reveal the jagged projections which make them cling to the skin . Electron photographs of typhoid germs and intestinal bacteria disclose delicate , wavy filaments which may be their means of locomotion . <P> Anthrax bacilli are seen to be joined at the ends by curious disklike couplings . Strings of streptococci are held together by outer membranes which look like sausage casings . <P> Two great pioneers in electron microscopy are the German firm of Siemens &; Halske ( TIME , June 6 , 1938 ) , and , in the U. S. , the R. C. A. laboratories at Camden ( TIME , Jan. 9 , 1939 ) . R. C. A. 's big man in the field is Russian-born , reticent Vladimir Kosma Zworykin , who is also its television ace . His first electron microscope was as big as a hot-water boiler , needed a whole roomful of high-voltage equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller , slimmer , slicker instrument , whose power plant occupies only two cubic feet . R. C. A. says that any bright person can learn to get good results with it in an hour . Last week R. C. A. was ready to market the new model to research institutions . Price : $9,500 an instrument . <P> Some of the high-magnification details of disease germs are too new to be of anything more than academic interest . But eventually , if science follows its historic course , they will be put to use . Probably scientists will soon make visible the viruses , mysterious disease agents small enough to pass through porcelain filters. * They may uncover the genes ( unit heredity carriers ) in their hiding places along the chromosomes of germ cells . By ultra-high magnifications of cancerous cells , they may shed the ultimate light on the cause of malignant tumors . <P> <P> *A recent report from Berlin alleged that the smallpox virus had been seen there for the first time .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
