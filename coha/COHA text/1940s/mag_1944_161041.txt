Winthrop Chemical Co. of Rensselaer , N.Y . was in trouble again last week. * The Pure Food and Drug Administration claimed that the company had distributed some 22,000 packages of improperly distilled water and 73,000 ampoules of dextrose solution ( which is made with distilled water ) containing pyrogens ( fever-producing substances ) , " undissolved particles " and mold . Patients showed " unusual symptoms " when a Boston hospital used some of the dextrose in spinal anesthesia . According to an Assistant U.S. Attorney one patient died , but the doctors think he would have died anyway . Winthrop called in all the offending packages long ago . <P> When Government lawyers told the story to the press last week , company officials cried Unfair ! Hundreds of such cases , they claimed , come up every year without getting into print . It would take several quarts of the improperly distilled water to give a man a fever ; the " undissolved particles " were material which had come off the ampoule glass ; the mold was probably Penicillium notatum . ( Winthrop makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not supposed to contain anything but water , not even gratuitous penicillin . <P> In store for Winthrop Chemical Co. , if the case is proved : maximum fines totaling $120,000 , a lot of bad publicity . <P> <P> *In January 1942 the company was fined $15,800 for " adulterated and misbranded " sulfathiazole ( TIME , April 7 , 1941 ) .
