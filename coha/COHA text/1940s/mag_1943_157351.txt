Last week in Bermuda , three British delegates , three American delegates , and assorted advisers , censors and other assistants held the first of a series of international conferences initiated by President Roosevelt . Subject : refugees , and the plight of oppressed millions who yearn to escape from Nazi Europe . Announced accomplishments : none , as might have been expected of any such conference in wartime . The official explanation ( by Richard Kidston Law , Britain 's Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs ) : <P> " We must not be betrayed by our feelings of humanity and compassion into courses of action which might postpone the day of liberation . " <P> What seemed probable was that Mr. Roosevelt had no real program for this particular conference , but was anxious to encourage public officials of the two nations to engage in preliminary discussions of a difficult and tragic problem .
