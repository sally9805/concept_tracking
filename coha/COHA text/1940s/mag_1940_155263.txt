To the pretty little resort town of Salzburg last week went delegations from three Balkan nations-but they did n't go there for fun . It was not yet known whether Germany or Russia ( or both ) was to be the master of their fate . In case it was Germany they had gone to get their German orders . <P> Rumania was first on the carpet , its delegation led by white-haired , monocled Premier Ion Gigurtu , who made his fortune in gold mining . Accompanying him was black-haired , swarthy Foreign Minister Mihail Manoilesco , who lost a fortune in coal mining . If anything good was coming to Rumania from Germany , Gigurtu was the man to get it . As a youth he studied at the Mining Academy in Freiberg , Germany , has kept his old German friends and made many more . He has long advocated closer economic cooperation between Germany and Rumania in the belief that they are geographically best suited to cooperate . <P> Onetime official in Rumania 's Department of Industry and Commerce , Gigurtu helped form great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country which produced $6,204,961 worth in 1937 ) and a company which occupies in the Rumanian financial picture the same status that U. S. Steel does in the U. S. He is also a power in Rumanian aviation , publishing ( the weekly Libertea ) , and Rightist politics . <P> After preliminary consultations at Castle Fuschl near Salzburg with German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop , Messrs . Gigurtu and Manoilesco motored to Berghof for a talk with Herr Hitler , proceeded to Rome the same afternoon . With heavy rhetoric the Berlin radio summarized the results of the conference : " Germany today , less than ever , had reason to refrain from pointing out that the Reich is in favor of reasonable Bulgarian and Hungarian revision claims . " The result of the Salzburg sales talks will not be made public until Bulgaria and Slovakia have had their turns on the mat . <P> But the Rumanian Government was reported willing to cede a " narrow strip " of Transylvania northwest of the Transylvanian Alps to Hungary ; Germany had reason to believe that it had achieved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last week . <P> More than a narrow strip of Transylvania was already out of Rumanian hands when sorely beset King Carol II acceded to the suggestion of roly-poly Colonel Gerstenberg , Hitler 's capable and very persuasive Balkan bagman , and gave the 740,000 Germans in Transylvania the right to arm , immunity from joining the new Rumanian Party of The Nation and freedom from Army requisitioning . <P> Germany 's biggest triumph of the week occurred when Rumania took over the British and Dutch-controlled vast Astra Romana oil company . Rumania expelled twelve French oil executives . Week earlier Rumania had ordered all tank cars in the possession of oil companies put at the disposal of the State railways . Allied-owned and chartered tankers on the Rumanian Danube were halted , a probable prelude to outright requisitioning . All this indicated that Germany would eventually receive practically all Rumanian oil exports ( 4,177,554 metric tons in 1939 ) except that from U. S.-owned wells .
