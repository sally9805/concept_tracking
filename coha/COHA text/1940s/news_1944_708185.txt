txt WASHINGTON , Nov. 2 ? The President and his advisers now have under consideration , and are discussing with a British delegation here headed by Lord Keynes , a supplemental , " second-phase " lend-lease proposal made by Prime Minister Churchill to Mr. Roosevelt at the last , Quebec conference which , if agreed to , will permit Great Britain to acquire at least $2,500,000,000 of nonmilitary supplies for resale in its export trade . The original British request , it is understood , was for $6,500,000 , - 000 of lend-lease , of which $3,500 , - 000,000 was to be nonmilitary and open for resale . This correspondent is reliably informed that the $3,500,000,000 may come down to $2,500,000,000 before the end of the negotiations . At present a British official policy announcement , made in 1941 , forbids resale of any lend-lease supplies not paid for in cash , and this would have to be . withdrawn because no cash exchange is any part of the Quebec proposal . Also , Congress must appropriate for any " second - phase " lend - lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include authority to the British to resell any of the supplies , including the nonmilitary items . The negotiations began at Quebec with the arrival of the Secretary of the Treasury , Henry Morgenthau Jr. , who took along his postwar plan for an agrarian , nonindustrial Germany after the war . // As reported by this correspondent ' at the time , Mr. Morgenthau 's fa- ' vorable attitude toward the Sottish lend-lease proposal brought from them in return encouragement of his German plan . That vanished from the scene , however , under the spotlight of publicity and because of the bitter opposition of the heads of the State and War Departments , who were not represented in the discussions at Quebec despite the fact that they and not the Treasury are primarily concerned . Secretary Cordell Hull and Secretary Henry L. Stimson became focal points for the opposition , in Washington both to Mr. Morgenthau 's post-war German plan and his selection by the President to take the lead in the Quebec lendlease discussions to which the plan then was linked . No representative of the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was invited to Quebec either , And this agency became a willing ally of State and War with the objective of shelving the Treasury post-war German plan and returning direction of the subsequent negotiations with the Keynes delegation to State , War and FEA . The President is said to have given to the British proposal a " cordial reception , " which may have led some of the Quebec conferees from London to believe that the contract was as good as signed . But it was asserted to this correspondent today that , while the President agreed " in principle , " he intended the detailed commitment and could have given no binding promise because the eventual decision rests with Congress . It was also Contended that nothing yet has been settled in the Washington negotiations except that the British are disposed to reduce their $3,500,000,000 request to $2,500 , - 000,000 , with respect to lend-lease supplies they want to resell for their export trade . In presenting their case at Quebec the British conferees are understood to have pointed out their special necessities : Weakened finances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian housing and industrial plants , and other ravages of our common war which the United States has been spared . It is reliably reported that they asked the President , and he sympathetically received the request , that he take these things in account with respect to fixing the time and conditions of the renewal of competition for post-war export markets . The proposal that Great Britain be given the right to resell nonmilitary lend-lease supplies for export , and thus reverse its Government 's policy against this practice , was explained as compelled by these special necessities . The lend-lease unexpended appropriation at this time is about five billion dollars , or far short of the 61/2 overall which the British are seeking for the second phase , and most of this is already earmarked . Also the existing terms by which the money was appropriated would preclude the resale for export of any supplies thereby purchased , whether or not nonmilitary . Therefore the agreement that is being worked out here with the Keynes delegation must ' go to Congress for approval and for the funds with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lendlease exchequer must be refilled . Congress undoubtedly will inspect the agreement very closely , regardless of the outcome of the elections next Tuesday . The American conferees as well as the President are wholly aware of this prospect , and consequently whatever Mr. Roosevelt sends to Congress will be prepared with care for the domestic political consequences as well as for the effect of Congress ' decision on the war and our future relations with our closest ally .
