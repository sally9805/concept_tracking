How ageless are China 's problems and how bitterly Chinese history repeats itself in cycles of wars , floods and famines , TIME Correspondent Teddy White could tell last week from firsthand knowledge . He was just back from a two-week trip through starving Honan Province . His report : <P> My notes tell me that I am reporting only what I saw or verified ; yet even to me it seems unreal : dogs eating human bodies by the roads , peasants seeking dead human flesh under the cover of darkness , endless deserted villages , beggars swarming at every city gate , babies abandoned to cry and die on every highway . Nothing can transmit the horror of the entire great famine in Honan Province , or the irony of the green spring wheat with a promise of a bumper crop which is not ripe for harvesting for two more months . Most terrible of all is the knowledge that the famine might have been averted . <P> Those Who Run Away . With Harrison Forman of the London Times I arrived in a town called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honan . The refugees are stuffed into boxcars , flatcars , old coaches , layer upon layer deep . They are crowded on the roofs , children , old men &; women clinging to any possible fingergrip as the trains hurtle along . Sometimes their fingers get so numb from the cold they fall off . The trains never halt . <P> In ten minutes we saw the first casualty-a peasant lying bleeding near the roadbed . He had fallen from a refugee train some hours before . The train wheels had cut his foot off . He was all alone , crying , and his flesh was mangled on the rail . The bones of his foot were sticking out like a thin white cornstalk . I broke open my medicine kit and gave Kim some sulfanilamide and we raced on to tell someone to send water and a doctor . But there was no doctor within a day 's journey . <P> Nobody knows or cares how many refugees die on this road . They say two million people have moved out along this route since that there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have died by the time the new harvest is gathered . <P> Those Who Stay and Beg . In Loyang we went to call on Bishop Thomas Megan of Eldora , Iowa , a greathearted Irish padre . When we came out of his relief dispensary , which is supported by American funds , the refugees tried to mob us . Men fell on their knees , surrounded us , folding hands in supplication . <P> The next day we went east , riding in an Army truck accompanied by Father Megan . Trees on the road had been peeled of their bark . Peasants dry and powder the elm bark and then cook it . They also eat leaves , straw roots , cottonseed and water reed . <P> The Army gave us horses to ride on farther east . In the cold first hour after dawn we passed the first corpse-a woman dead on the road . She must have been there at least overnight .
