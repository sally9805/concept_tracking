Dr. Hutchins and the Germans <P> Sirs : <P> As TIME May 21 said , University of Chicago 's President Hutchins has sounded the first note of an argument about which we shall ( unfortunately ) hear more . . . . While the world is still reeling from the full story of the almost incomprehensible savageries perpetrated upon mankind by the German nation , he is the first to blossom out again with the once-fashionable foppery of coddling criminals . . . . <P> <P> WILLIAM WYMAN MALLORY Bartlesville , Okla . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Hats off to Chicago University 's President Hutchins . His logical , reasonable plea for mercy for the war criminals , a term now applied to all enemies , both civil and military , proves him to be not a responsibility-ducking " softie , " but a farsighted , sagacious person . <P> We can not possibly subjugate the people of any nation without instilling in it a resentful hatred and objection that would inevitably break its bounds and result in another , and perhaps more nearly catastrophic , world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the recently unveiled atrocities in Germany . That is to be expected . But in our temporary blind fit of anger let 's not take any pseudo-chauvinistic action for which we will be sorry when we-calm down . After all , why make an entire people suffer because of the actions of only a few of its leaders ? . . . <P> Instead of treating our enemies too kindly or too harshly , let 's hit a medium between these two extremes that is firm enough to let them know who is boss , but not so obdurate that they will eventually rise against their tormentors . Let 's be men , but let 's not try to be supermen . <P> <P> ( Pvt . ) H. J. GALLOWAY Hines , Ill . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> I am tired of reading and hearing Edmund Burke 's famous sentence , " I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against a whole people , " used by German conciliators to justify a soft peace . Dr. Hutchins surely knows he is misinterpreting Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moving his Resolutions for Conciliation with the Colonies , " when he quotes this sentence from it . <P> Burke did not mean that a whole people can not be morally guilty of crime . . . . What he was driving at was that an indictment can only be charged against a definite person or persons , and is a legal device operating under technical legal restrictions , while a people is ... composed of an unspecific number of indefinite persons , whom it is thus impossible legally to indict . <P> Let us have no more nonsense about this . If Dr. Hutchins wants to mull further over Burke 's possible reaction to Germany , let him read his Reflections on the Revolution in France and quote from that . <P> <P> DAVID A. RANDALL New York City <P> Get the Queen Bee <P> Sirs : <P> In your interesting article on the God-Emperor of Japan TIME , May 21 , you refer to Ambassador Grew 's analogy of the Japanese society as a beehive with the Emperor as the queen bee . You say : " The implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . must be retained to save the Japanese nation from disintegration . "
