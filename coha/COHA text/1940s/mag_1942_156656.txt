Manhattan playgoers last week saw Vickie ( by S. M. Herzig ; produced by Frank Mandel ) do a bad job with a good idea . A satire on U.S. women 's war activities , it attacked the funny bone by way of the eardrum , failed as farce because it was never funny . <P> More interesting than anything else in the play was the appearance in a bit part ( an opera-singing cook ) of Margaret Matzenauer-one of opera 's fallen giants . For Contralto Matzenauer , who had been a diva in the days when Caruso and Toscanini were fellow Metropolitan headliners , Vickie might be a comedown . But it was made to order : Vickie 's author , Hollywood Scripter Sid Herzig , got most of his ideas about opera singers at the age of eight when Contralto Matzenauer , newly arrived from Europe , lived in the Herzig family 's Manhattan home . Vickie 's ex-diva was written with Matzenauer in mind . <P> For 19 years ( until 1930 ) Margaret Matzenauer was one of the most experienced and versatile singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( daughter of a Hungarian opera conductor ) , she was able to switch from Carmen to Ortrud or Amneris to Delilah at the drop of a spear . An exception among opera singers ( most of whom have to have their parts drilled into them by coaches and conductors ) , she could sit down at the piano and teach herself the most taxing roles . Always a robust Brnnehilde , Matzenauer became one of the most prodigious ( 203 Ib. ) singers ever to prance the operatic proscenium . She married and divorced three husbands . The last of them ( a California chauffeur named Floyd Glotzbach ) she once fondly described as " 100 per cent a man . " Margaret Matzenauer sternly disapproves of the career of her daughter , Adrienne Matzenauer , who sings blues and torch songs at Rockefeller Center 's Rainbow Room . But of her own Broadway debut last week , Mother Matzenauer was as proud as a debutante soubrette . Said she : " I 'm just branching out . I want to try everything . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
