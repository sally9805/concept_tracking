Though he is the one everyone remembers , Stephen Collins Foster was not the only U.S. songwriter of the 19th Century . This week a lesser , yet gifted writer of old-time songs , dead for 75 years , was honored by having his most famed song broadcast by many a radio station . The songwriter : chin-whiskered Benjamin Russell Hanby of Ohio . The song : Darling Nelly Gray . <P> Songwriter Hanby was just the right age , 23 and a sophomore at small Otterbein College in Westerville , Ohio , when he wrote Darling Nelly Gray , in 1856 . What caused it was a boyhood memory : when he was a child , a fugitive slave stopping at his father 's house had told how his sweetheart , Nelly Gray , had been sold into slavery . Hanby mailed the manuscript to a Boston publisher . The song swept the nation , sold more copies than any previous song except Foster 's Old Folks at Home . <P> But Hanby had failed to copyright his song . First inkling he had that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a Columbus , Ohio music store . He wrote to his publisher . Came the reply : " Nelly Gray is sung on both sides of the Atlantic . We have made the money and you the fame . That balances the account . " Songwriter Hanby hired a lawyer , who settled for $100 , kept half as his commission . <P> After leaving college , Hanby became a preacher , but there was more music in him than preaching . When Benjamin Hanby died at 33 , he had written 75 songs . Two others are still sung today : a children 's Christmas song , Up on the Housetop ( Up on the housetop , click , click , click ; Down through the chimney with good St. Nick ) , and the hymn Who Is He ? , included in the hymnal of the Church of England in Canada .
