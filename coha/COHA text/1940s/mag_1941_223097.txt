The spokesman of the Chinese Arn ies made an unprecedented announcement to Chungking 's foreign correspondents last week . Four days short of four years had gone by since the guns of the Japanese Army had blasted an end to peace in Asia . It was time for the weekly press conference . But the conference , said the spokesman , would be canceled . There was " nothing to report . " <P> As the fourth year of war sputtered out in fitful silence , the four million soldiers stretched from Mongolia to Canton kept their eyes fixed on the silent , inactive , parallel lines of hate . But far back of either side of the lines the painful activities of the struggle dragged along unabated on the weary home fronts . <P> Japan . Glory wears thin against the grindstone of saddened days . It was all glory in Tokyo four years ago as the war for Asia burst . " Without cessation , " wrote an American correspondent , " from 5 a.m. till noon . . . departing troops rode to military barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking traffic along the main highways . The truckloads of cheering soldiers , waving flags and banners and singing war songs , followed each other so closely that they extended in a line as far as the eye could see . . . . Children in the street waved flags and joined in the war songs . " Factories blazed by night , while the forges of Osaka and Nagoya hammered out the iron instruments of destiny . From the islands , the heavy-laden bombers swept away to blast Nanking . <P> As the fourth year of war rolled to a close on July 7 , it found Japan this week still fighting , still strong-but taut , unhappy , sour . Much changed is war-weary Japan . Rice is rationed . Meatless days are a patriotic duty-only blubbery whale meat is on the free list . The production of warming sake ( rice wine ) is discouraged . Sugar has been replaced by long-forbidden saccharin in many commercial foods . Bitterest of all to the nervous , twitching Japanese is the shortage of cigarets . <P> Japanese textile factories operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood fiber-kimonos ( which fall apart after several washings ) , staple-fiber suits ( that curl up in the rain ) , staple-fiber diapers ( that scratch babies ' bottoms ) have replaced the old fabrics ; and even these are rationed . <P> Railways have replaced neither worn-out rails nor worn-out rolling stock . Accidents increase . Matsumoto-san , the Japanese man-in-the-street , shaves in the morning with a dull razor ( blades are scarce ) , rides to work on an overcrowded charcoal-burning bus ( motor fuel is rationed ) , climbs long flights of stairs to his office ( electricity for elevators is no longer available ) , eats his noonday meal , ( after showing his rice ration card ) and goes home to bed without even the comfort of his much-loved steaming hot-water bath ( charcoal is scarce ) ; and wonders about glory . <P> Glory costs blood . Sightless , legless , armless veterans. , fill commandeered seaside and mountain resorts ( one hospital for wounded in Tokyo is so big that doctors use bicycles in making the rounds ) . Trains stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the ashes of a boy who has died at the China Front .
