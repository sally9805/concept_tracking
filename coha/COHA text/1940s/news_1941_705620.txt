txt The Treasury 's excess profits tax program is dead . The House ways and means committee yesterday voted that corporations should continua to have two methods of determining their excess profits taxes  --  the invested capital plan , which the Treasury proposed to make the sole basis of computation , and the average earnings method . As a result , the new corporation excess profits levy will be modeled after the present law , but with stiffer rates under the average earnings method and probably reduced invested capital credit . Reversal by Senate Group Unlikely The committee 's decision clears the air considerably and may hasten completion of the new 53.5 billion tax bill . There would not seem to be a ghost of a chance that the Senate finance committee will reverse this decision , The vote apparently ends a controversy that developed when the Treasury unexpectedly proposed an excess profits tax plan that would tax , altogether on a basis of invested capital , " profits in excess of a necessary normal return . " The Treasury excess profits tax proposal had the backing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dealers , with the President 's approval , had interceded . Surprise was voiced in some quarters that the Administration did not make a more vigorous fight for it than appeared to be the case . Despite the opposition to the proposal in the finance committee , there may be another effort made to eliminate the average earnings method when the tax bill reaches the Senate because of strong Administration support for this point of view . Floor Stock Taxes Favored The ways and means committee yesterday also adopted a motion declaring itUto be committee policy that floor stock taxes be imposed wherever existing excise taxes are increased or new excise taxes are imposed . Committee leaders , anxious to avoid unfairness where stocks of commodities already have been purchased and also to avoid hoarding and a buying spree that might involve a price spiral , asked that this decision be emphasized . Floor stock levies apparently were included in the excise tax yield estimates that have been made . Under the Treasury plan voted down yesterday . corporations would be allowed a credit equal to their average earnings during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitaL But where a corporation earned an average return of less than 4% during the base period , according to the Treasury plan , its profits in excess of its average earnings , up to 4% , would be taxed at a flat 10% rate . The Treasury proposed to tax an amount equal to 15 ' , on invested capital at 33% , the amount between 15% and 30% at 52% and all over 30% at 65% . This would have been made even more severe through the Treasury proposal that amount subject to the first bracket rate be determined without regard to credit . Defeated After Bitter Fight The overwhelming Congressional opposition to this plan grew out of the fact that after a bitt , er fight last year an almost identical Treasury proposal was defeated . Members of the ways and means committee at that time agreed that the optional average earnings method of computing credit was necessary to avoid hardships on small companies and discrimination against many firms of various sizes . They are still of the same opinion . The average earnings method , under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now allowed as credit , was devised by Colin F. Starr , chief of staff of the joint committee on internal revenue taxation He objected strongly to the Treasury 's proposal to discard his plan this year and advanced some general suggestions of his own . These probably will be followed in broad outline in the new excess profits tax . Mr. Stam has in mind , it is said , raising the present rates schedule by about 10% all along the line and higher in the case of the top bracket rate . The joint committee staff , whether it has suggested this to the committee or not , may ask that the invested capital credit be cut from 8% at present to 6% , except for new capital , Congressmen said . Mr. Stam has told the committee that the new excess profits tax should raise $600 million additional revenue . The Treasury originally mentioned $400 million as the amount it thought should be raised , but later said its new excess profits tax plan would raise about $700 million . With the decision to discard the Treasury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means committee members will turn today to the next most controversial section of the revenue program , the individual income taxes . The details of the excess profits tax will be taken up later .
