Samson and Delilah ( Paramount ) bedizens the Biblical story with all that $3,000,000 can buy : Hedy Lamarr , Victor Mature , 600 extras and eye-crashing Technicolor , mixed by the lavish , lily-gilding hand of Cecil B. DeMille . The result may not be quite Old Testament , but it is Bible story shrewdly blended with sex , spectacle , and the merest suggestion of social comment to keep it abreast of current Hollywood trends . It is unlikely to tarnish Producer-Director DeMille 's reputation for consistently making ( as well as spending ) more money on pictures than anybody else. * <P> The movie opens with a long shot of the earth whirling in space , and the voice of Creator DeMille himself intoning a speech that begins : " Before the dawn of history , ever since the first man discovered his soul . . . " To meet the challenge of building from there , DeMille brings on a seven-day saturnalia in the fleshpots of Timnath ; Delilah Lamarr slinking through ten changes of scanty costumes ; Samson Mature strangling a lion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ass , and pulling the temple down about the ears of the whole company . <P> Faced with an original story that seemed , for movie purposes , to be nothing but fragments and figments , DeMille turned four writers loose on the job of working up a convincing script . They telescoped the Biblical account , invented some new sequences , tinkered with motivations , added characters , threw in some dancing girls . Major change : Delilah became the younger sister of the nameless Philistine woman who was the Biblical Samson 's wife . The final adaptation skillfully manages to achieve the most serviceability for the screen with the least violence to Scripture . Its best job is to create conviction in Samson 's feats : e.g. , his slaughter with the jawbone of an ass looks plausible because the script places him tactically in a narrow defile where he can take on the Philistines a few at a time . <P> The dialogue is a lot less convincing , though sometimes a lot more fun . Bits of it hew more or less to lines out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my heifer , you would not have answered my riddle " ) . But most of it is Biblical ersatz with an Edgar Rice Burroughs flavor ( " You will bring death to the village . Samson is our warrior " ) . And sometimes it lapses into pure Hollywood ( Samson to his mother : " Ummm , you 're the best cook in Zorah , little mother " ) . A dialogic highpoint of some kind is reached when Samson , handed a javelin to do battle with the lion , cheerily assures Delilah : " I wo n't need it . He 's a young lion . " <P> The acting in a DeMille picture bears about the same relation to ordinary acting that a DeMille spectacle bears to everyday life . Holding up the florid tradition of black-hearted villainy are George Sanders and Henry Wilcoxon . Mature is suitably curly-haired and big-muscled as Samson . For all her plumage , including a gown of 2,000 peacock feathers ( which DeMille ordered retouched for more color ) , Miss Lamarr 's slitherings suggest a small-town belle making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
