Staring at a crucifix on the courtroom wall , the most hated man in Italy sat apparently unmoved last week while Roman spectators screamed and cursed at him . <P> Herbert Kappler had heard Italians scream before-at the Ardeatine Caves , for instance , where in 1944 he , as 55 chief in Rome , had directed the massacre of 335 Italian hostages as reprisal for the bombing of 32 Nazi police in a Roman street . <P> The memory of the Ardeatine slaughter burns in Italian minds more vividly than any other calamity of the . war . Day after day black-clad men &; women , carrying huge bundles of flowers , trudge up a barren hill six miles south of Rome to the dismal caverns , where candles burn day &; night by rows and rows of plain pine coffins . <P> Many an onlooker at Kappler 's trial ( the first war crimes trial by an Italian court ) had made the Ardeatine pilgrimage to mourn husband or son ; the crowd stiffened with horror as Kappler dryly told how 30 SS men had rounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officer who was to fire first got sick at the scene ; Kappler explained to the court that he had had to fire the first shot to encourage the weakling . <P> Kappler ( who became a Roman Catholic convert just before the trial began ) testified that he had refused his victims religious assistance " because we were pressed for time , and I know that people who are about to be executed always indulge in talking to the minister . " At this the maddened courtroom audience , broke into howls of " Schweinehund ! " , and surged forward towards Kappler 's bench . A muscle danced in his jaw and the saber scar on his left cheek blazed crimson as carabinieri forced the crowd back . <P> After six hours , the head of the five-judge military tribunal gravely pronounced the stiffest sentence he could give under Italian law : * life imprisonment , including four years ' solitary confinement , for " repeated and premeditated murder . " <P> <P> *Kappler 's superiors , Field Marshal " Smiling Albert " Kesselring and Generals Kurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death by a British military court on similar charges , later had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment .
