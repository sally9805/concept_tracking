txt In theory , there was another way to accomplish what has been attempted by devaluing Britain 's pound sterling . That other way would have had to come in two parts . 1 . The British labor government , which since taking office has devoted itself to raising the wages of labor , would have had to lower the wages of labor . 2 . And an American Government , which has inherited from the past a 100-year pattern of protective tariffs , would have had to eliminate practically all protective tariffs . In theory , those two steps would be the direct . honest way to cope with the problem which brought the top experts of Britain 's government to Washington . Of course neither the problem nor the method of solution applies to Britain alone , but to all the non-Communist world . A A A The problem is how to make it possible for the other members of the western community to pay for what they need to buy from America . They ca n't pay in gold because they have n't enough any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two conditions primarily ? there are others but they are much less important ? keep those goods out of American markets . One condition is the high cost of production in the outside world . The other is the American tariff system . ' I British wages and American tariffs could both be cut , then British goods would flow into American markets in sufficient volume to " equalize " that " gap " we have been hearing so much about But obviously it is politically impossible for a British laborgovernment to impose a wage cut on British workers . And it is equally fantastic to think that any American Government could ever , over night , wipe out the statutory result of a century of protectionist philosophy in America . Devaluation is the device which can , for a movent , do an invisible job of ' ? cutting British wages and American tariffs . The great question now is whether the British and American Governments will be able , politically , to hffld this result . If British labor insists on wage increases to compensate for the inevitable jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain from devaluation will be wiped out . And if American business and industry insist on higher tariffs to stop an increasing flow of British goods in Olt American market ; then the other half of the gain will be wiped out . In other words , all that devaluation does is to provide the two governments with an opportunity to equalize the flow of trade between dollar and sterling areas . That opportunity will be used if London Boothe . Globe and Mail Money-Go-Round can hold the British wage line and if Washington can hold the American tariff line . But if either line breaks , then the opportunity is lost . So the " battle of the dollar gap " moves into a phase in which the British Government must stand on the wage line in Britain against its own constituents ; and the American Government must stand on the tariff line against every habit of thinking America has acquired from the day Congress passed the first protective Tariff Act . A A A It really means two revolutions . In Britain , it means revolt against the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it means a revolt against the theory that a surplus of exports is good . Both w1 be revolutions difficult to consolidate , but of the two the American probably will be the less difficult . The idea that imports are just as good as exports is spreading , and in influential places . Fifty years ago American heavy industry was the principal and most powerful pro-motor of high tariffs . Today there is a report before the National Association of Manufacturers , which is the representative of heavy industry , saying that the time is coming when : ' . . . We shall not only have ' to accept imports equal to . our exports ; we shall , in addition , have to develop an import surplus . " Tariff-cutting is no longer the monopoly of " long-haired professors " and " city demagogues . " It is today a most respectable and conservative ' doctrine honored in the inner sanctum of the NAM so Washington 's part of the bargain maybe easier to fulfill than the part Sir Stafford- Cripps and Ernest Bevin undertook .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
