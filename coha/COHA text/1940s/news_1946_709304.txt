' " Important Points " in Pact - " We feel the contract is indicative of improved labor relations . Some of the important points are : - " The union has undertaken to control its membership to ? prevent illegal work stoppages - and ' penalties may be imposed by the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contract provides that any employe found guilty of instigating , ' fomenting or actively supporting , or giving leadership to illegal work stoppages is to ' be - subject to discharge . Such ' cases will not be submitted to regular grievance procedures Unless the local Union , after formal investigation , should substantiate the contention of the affected employe that he was accured unjustly . An entirely new article of the contract Is devoted to management prerogatives and responsibilities , including a provision that ' continued . failure of an employe to produce on the basis of established standards will be cause tor diseipline , . including discharge , unless failure is due to causes beyond his control . Any employe who participates in any plan to control or limit production speed also will be subject to discharge by the company . " The contract also provides for full-time representatives of the union to handle the grievance procedure in all but a few of the company 's smaller plants . The number of union representatives will , as a consequence , be reduced . " The negotiations which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining but they always were maintained with a constant intention and determination to reach agreement ' on all issues . " Gains for . Union Negotiators The signing of the agreement was regarded as a strategic victory for both Mr. Leonard and Mr. Eccles in union politics . Mr. Leonard is " the stand-out candidate to succeed Richard T. Frankensteen , who is withdrawing as vice president of the UAW , while Mr. Eccles has been mentioned frequently as a candidate for membership on the international- executive board of the union , which will hold its international convention in Atlantic City starting March 23 . The two union leaders succeeded in winning a substantial pay increase from the company which was already paying the highest in the industry . The increase was obtained without calling a strike and in its final form the contract has no financial penalties against participants in wildcat strikes . The last ? provision , when agreed upon tentatively last month , caused a revolt within the rank and file . The retroactive wage feature of the contract was an additional victory for Mr. Leonard and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry it has been customary to make increases retroactive for only thirty days .
