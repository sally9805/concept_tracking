From a letter in the Times of London from one William Pringle : " I am a Scotsman approaching 80 years of age and have been accustomed to have a plate of porridge daily for breakfast , and to this I attribute my good health . This morning I visited nearly a dozen shops in quest of some oatmeal , but failed to procure any . <P> ... No wonder the stamina of the nation is deteriorating . "
