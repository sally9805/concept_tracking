txt BIG FARM GROUPS CALL HOUSE CHANGE IN OPA TOO DRASTIC Grange , Federation and Union Urge Decontrol Program but Oppose Sudden Steps DISAGREE ON SUBSIDIES Spokesmen Ask Senators for Middle-of-Road Action , End to Below-Cost Ceilings By JOHN D. MORRIS Special to Tut NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , April 26 ? The nation 's Big . Three farm organizations agreed today that the House had gone too far in amending the price control extension bill , but they split along traditional lines , 2 to 1 , on the issue of continuing consumer subsidies . ? In statements before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , the National Grange , the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers ' Union were also in accord on the necessity of a positive program of price decontrol . The Grange " and the Federation , whose policies frequently are in harmony , advocated elimination of Subsidies while the Union argued I for continuation of the program " as long as may be necessary . " Below Cost Ceilings Attacked Albert S. Goss , Master of the Grange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the kind of job it should do " but that first some of the agency 's " basic policies " should be eliminated . He re ferred to policies which " have been a major factor in causing the inflation we have . " " There must be a general recognition , " he said , " that inflation can be controlled by production and that ceilings ca n't be held below costs and still obtain production . " Mr. Goss favored extension of price control with six " safeguards , " as follows : ceilings that will permit cost of production ; abandonment of ceilings when supply equals demand ; rationing of scarce items ; progressive abandonment of food subsidies by the end of 1946 , beginning thirty days after passage of the bill ; approval by the Secretary of Agriculture of any ceilings on farm products , and formulation by the OPA of plans for its liquidation . He also called for increased in // come taxes and a balanced budget . Edward A. O'Neal , president of the Farm Bureau Federation , expressed the hope that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middle ground which will correct the basic mistakes of the pr , ce control program and at the same time will contain reasonable safeguards against undue price inflation . " Use of Adjustments Urged He criticized the Wolcott **26;1592;TOOLONG amendment as impractical and the Gosset amendment to remove price controls when production reached 1.940-41 levels as " unwise " because he believed it would result in controls being removed too rapidly . Instead of the cost-plus plan , he advocated fuller use of a provision already in the Price Control Act to require adjustments in price ceilings whenever necessary to offset increased costs or to encourage increased production . On the question of decontrol , he said Congress should require price ceilings to be removed " whenever supplies come into reasonable balance with demand . " He endorsed the Wolcott amendment for elimination of subsidies by the end of this year by a program of reducing them 25 per cent every 45 days . " We must take steps to correct the basic causes of inflation through Federal tax , budgetary and credit policies so that in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yielding on Controls Criticized James G. Patton , president of the National Farmers ' Union , urged continuation of the OPA " with sufficient operating funds to insure against black marketing " , and to make possible a return to rationing of scarce commodities . He endorsed the price control stand of the Committee for Economic Development and attacked " the gradual yielding on the principles of price control itself " as shown in price increases to the steel industry and other " bribery . " " I urge the committee to adopt a bill at least as strong as that reported by the House Banking and Currency Committee and to write a report on the bill that will show the unmistakable intent of Congress to hold the line , " he said . The committee also heard Charles W. Holman , secretary of the National Cooperative Milk Producers Federation , reiterate demands tor scrapping dairy price controls and subsidies on June 30 . The " next best plan , " he said , was provided by the Wolcott amendment to lift subsidies progressively . Mr. Holman said the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester Bowles " offers no hope for milk producers . " Between 60 and 80 per cent of the nation 's current butter production is now obtainable only through black markets , he said , Richard A. Colgan Jr. , executive vice president of the National Lumber Manufacturers Association , said the industry could not possibly produce enough lumber to achieve the Government 's housing goals under what he said was OPA 's " unholy " policy of permitting profits on only 75 per cent of lumber production . He recommended that the OPA be re ' quired to permit this on at least 90 per cent . ' Meanwhile , Paul A. Porter , head of the Office of Price Administration , declared that business might jeopardize its position of leadership in American life if it followed the advice of some of its spokesmen in Washington . Porter Warns of Bitter Strife A lifting of price controls at this time would loose unbridled inflation in which labor , the farmers and business interests would be at loggerheads , resulting in " the bitterest kind of economic and social conflicts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American , , Business , which opened a two-day session . Referring to critics of the OPA who have appeared before committees in Congress advocating curtailment of OPA 's powers on the ground that production has suffered as a result of the agency 's policies , he added : " It is , of course , true , that price control is an irritant to many business men . It is true that price control may have impeded production of particular firms or particular products of some industrialists . It is true that delays in pricing actions may have occasionally produced hardships . But the charge that price control has held down the general level of production ? and therefore that production would spurt if price controls were removed  --  can not be supported by any of the indexes of business activities which for the last twenty years informed business men have accepted as guides to their own business plans . " Senator Glen H. Taylor , Democrat , of Idaho , another speaker , attacked the National Association of Manufacturers and its attack : upon the OPA . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
