that way unless you 've already cut a man 's head off with it . " South Boy shrugged . " There may be a devil in it . " What he referred to was no Mojave devil , but a devil called Syphilis that was second only to the Presbyterian devil in his mother 's triology of punishers of evil-doers . Her third demon was Rum . The second devil was so horrible he could only be whispered about . He rotted the flesh of all those of Wanton Life , and his evil could be even transmitted to the innocent . So South Boy cleansed the knife that Come-into-the-Brush had given him with sand and water  --  white man 's way , and with smoke  --  the Mojave way . Still he used his old knife , contaminatedonly by fish guts , to cut up the melons . Suddenly he asked , " How long are we going to be gone ? " Havek shrugged his shoulders . " How can I tell ? " " You wo n't be back in time for school ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , the agency police wo n't travel to the Piute country to find me . If I stay away a year or two years , I 'll be a man grown when I come back . I 'll have a new name . The white people at school will think Havek is dead  --  and this new Indian with a new name , he comes from elsewhere . " I 'm tired of school , anyway , " he continued . " It 's all right when you 're small . Lots of boys to play with . But now I can talk English . I can read and write and figure money . No trader can cheat me . Why should I let them shut me up in a school for half of every day and make me work the other half on the farm ? " " Half a day ! " cried South Boy . " Do you know what they 're going to do to me ? Put me in a school where they shut you up all day , until suppertime . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you study until they turn off the lights ! " Havek shook his head . " That would kill you . Quick . " " I know . The white boy at the Fort  --  you know  --  the superintendent'sson . He told me all about that school . He said ifp51they ever tried to send him back there he was going to run away to Mexico and live with the Cocopah . " Havek nodded . " Even the mud-eating Cocopah lead a better life than that . " Then he added , " If we 're gone long enough people will think you 're dead , too . " It was then , as he sat biting the orange-colored flesh of the little melon down to the white rind that South Boy knew he had run away . He would pass forever out of the world of the white men and thereby rid himself of all its problems . It was a pretty bitter moment . He thought of the tree rolling down the river . He thought of the tears on his mother 's face when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the time she had cried for a day and a night in her darkened room when word came that her father had died . Still , it would be a kinder thing to let her think he was dead , for he knew how bitter she was at the thought of his living in any other world than her own . Once last summer she had seen him talking to an Indian girl out on the road . When he got back to the house he heard her berating his father . " You get him out of here ! You send him to school  --  I do n't care whether you can afford it or not ! I 'd follow him to his grave rather than . . . " And another time the Foreman came home roaring-drunk , a bullet in his leg , another man 's blood on his shirt , and a dirty song on his lips  --  one of the few times South Boy had seen him completely happy . His mother was furious . " There 's your son ten years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . I 'd rather see him dead ... " Well , he would be dead . He got up from the fire and went to roll his fishline so that Havek would n't see his tears . There he sat on the bank , slowly rolling up the cord , not thinking any longer , but just feeling a dumb , dull misery . How long , he did n't know . He was jerked out of the depth of his mood by a sharp whistle . " Quick ! Bring my bow and arrows ! "  |p52HAVEK  stood on the bank two hundred yards away , staring at a group of dead , half-rotted stalks of a milletlike plant about ten feet out in the water . One of the stalks was wiggling spasmodically . South Boy , out of breath , handed him the bow and arrows . Havek laid his poorest hunting arrow across his bow and waited . South Boy immediately pulled the box of crackers out of his shirt and got ready to jump . No word had passed between them , for each knew exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way up that stalk , eating the green algae that clung to it . About ninety seconds later a lump the size of a big man 's fist broke through the gray , semi-opaque water . At the twang of the bowstring , South Boy leaped and lit spread-eagle with a tremendous splash . The fish started to roll over to shake free of the arrow but South Boy was right on top of it , his arm around it . The gyrating tip of the arrow almost knocked out his left eye . He gave a terrific heave , and the fish flew out and landed on the bank . South Boy stood up , waist-deep , washing away slimy fish scales and mud from his hands , face , and shirt . His troubles had suddenly faded , and he felt good again . But he began to feel some concern about the cartridges in his gun , even though he had greased them well . He scrambled out of the water and looked the fish over . It was a native humpback sucker , soft of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Havek was stringing it on a slender willow pole . South Boy picked up Havek 's bow and the arrow that had transfixed the sucker , put the box of crackers back in his shirt and started along the bank.  |p53He  knew the chances were against getting another fish before they reached the Whisperer 's camp , but he was not going to take the chance of soaking those cartridges again . However he had not gone another two hundred yards before he saw a commotion among some water-killed weeds near shore and he loosened an exploratory arrow into the midst of it . The effect was terrific  --  something like an underwater explosion . Havek landed right in the midst of it , and came up in no more than two feet of water with a huge white fish in his arms . " Salmon ! " he gasped , clambering up the bank . " I saved my arrow , too . " The fish was no salmon , although it was popularly so called Al along the river . It was a great chub , first cousin to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Sacramento squawfish . A Yuma Indian once trapped one that weighed eighty pounds . This one weighed about twenty . A soft , poor , bony fish , but regarded as good food by the Mojaves because it had been in the river since the First Times . Promptly strung on the pole and the pole resting on the boys ' shoulders , the fish went swinging towards the Whisperer 's . The Whisperer 's field lay in a horseshoe bend in the Snake lagoon a half-mile farther north  --  six or eight hoe-cultivated acres  --  a crazy quilt of odd patches of corn , beans , squash , pumpkins , a little wheat , and several kinds of melons , all growingfuriously under the burning sun , their roots deep in seepagesoakedsilt . Nowhere in the world was a field more productive . In its midst the Whisperer was vigorously chopping weeds with a modern steel hoe ; the sun glistened on the sweat that poured from his naked body , a bundle of long hair-ropes swinging pendulumlike across his back with each stroke of the hoe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  otherwisehis agricultural methods were those given to the Mojave by Mastamho.  | When he caught sight of the boys , he dropped his hoe , clapped his hands together , grabbed his undershirt and pants from the ground and started on a shambling run for his rancheriawhich was built across the narrow neck of the horseshoe . There was a winter house , which looked like a sand hill with a tunnel mouth , a " modern " house with a chimney , like a Mexican adobe , a large well built ramada , and three granaries that looked like great birds ' nests atop log scaffoldings . Seeing the Whisperer run , Havek looked puzzled . " Why did n't he wait for us ? " South Boy laughed . " On account of Maria . She 'd give him hell if he stayed and talked to strangers with his pants off . " When they came within a few yards of the willow-roof an untidy fat woman with a widow 's half-long hair came running to meet them , jabbering like an excited magpie about the fine large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not the Whisperer'swife , but one of the inevitable poor relations that live in every prosperous camp . She paid little attention to the boys , either , but ran alongside the fish , patting and stroking them . The Whisperer was sitting down , pulling on his undershirt , when they came under the shade , a big man , but not fat . On the far side of the shed sat Maria , cross-legged , a bowl full of little glass beads in her lap , and a bead loom across her knees . Eight or ten feet in front of her was a fat lump of a girl who was a younger duplicate of the widow . Maria said " Hello " with gloomy severity . The fat girl stared at the boys with slack-jawed stupidity . The Whisperer grinned a frank , delightedwelcome while he buttoned his hastily donned pants . The widow petted the fish and yammered . Havek and South Boy swung the pole off their shoulders and dropped the fish in front of the Whisperer . The Whisperer squeaked , " Con-yaipa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said South Boy . Whereupon the widow seized the fish and bore them away , yipping like a coyote , yell/ing for the girl to put the biggest pot in the fire hole . In spite of their fat and appearance of sloppy indolence , both women moved with the swift , surprising energy of Mojaves who have a definite job to do . The girl grabbed a pottery jar of five- or six-gallon capacity , ran to the lagoon , ran back with it dripping , set it in the fire hole , and pushed hot coals and ashes around it with a stick . The widow ripped the fish off the pole , dashed water on them from the olla that hung suspended in the middle of the shed , rubbed them down with her hands , ran with them to the woodpile by the fire , chopped them into convenient chunks , and chucked the pieces , heads , tails , guts and all , into the pot . Still jabbering , she ran to fetch a sack half full of metategroundcorn meal , took a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy seated himself about five feet from the silent Maria and pulled the box of soda crackers out of his shirt and handed them over to her . He was a little ashamed of his gift , for what with sweat , water , and the general wear and tear of t ravel , the outside wrapper was almost obliterated and the box was badly battered . But the inner wrapper of oiled paper , put there by a farseeing manufacturer , had saved the contents . Maria said , " Thank you , " and looked pleased , but she did n't smile like a real Mojave . She gravely opened the box , took t o unbroken crackers from one end and passed the box back to South Boy , who , for reasons of his own , took his crackers from the opposite end and untouched by Maria 's fingers . Then he tossed the box over to the Whisperer who selected two at random . Havek came next . He managed to find two unbroken . I hen the box was seized by the widow and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the others ate %low v and in dignified silence . " ' They 've got no more manners than pigs , " said Maria in I nglish like a white woman 's . " The girl 's never been to school.  | Always lived way out in the brush and do n't know anything . They 're his relatives , not mine . But I 'm going to see she goes to school if I have to break her neck . " All the time she talked she was swiftly stringing the small beads on her needle , or weaving them across the warp-threads of her loom . " Say , I heard your mother died in California . Is that true ? " The bald statement was shockingly un-Mojave . South Boy 's reaction was the same as though the words had been spoken by a white woman . " No , " he snorted . " That 's a story going around . She got well . She 'll be back with cool weather . " " That 's fine , " said Maria . " Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the back of his mind came uncomfortable thoughts . Then for some reason he remembered the gun in his shirt and glanced down quickly to see if the bulge showed . If Maria saw it she would go down to the ranch the moment word came his mother had returned . She would report indignantly , " That boy of yours is wearing a belly-gun like a no-good Needles tinhorn . " He did n't want to cause his mother additional pain . It was n't that Maria enjoyed malicious gossip , but she had a very strong sense of what white women considered wrong or wicked . Having been very wrong and wicked herself , she was ever eager in these later days to uphold white women 's standards . She was an unending puzzle to South Boy and the Mojave .. Maria was half-white . Her father had been one of the dragoonsthat had come to establish the Fort in 1859 . For some unaccountable reason he had been legally married to her mother . The wedding must have been the dragoon 's idea , for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind of marriage ceremony . Mastamho had never taken the trouble to inaugurate weddings . If a man and woman liked each other they went off into the brush for a while , and ifp57they decided they wanted to stay together , one of them moved in with the other 's family until they could establish a camp of their own . Maria was very proud of her legitimate birth , but the moral example of her parents had had little effect in her youth . After her father died  --  he had lived with her mother to the end  --  the railroad came to Needles , and Maria established herself in an adobe shack near the construction camp and made herself a mint of money ( according to the Foreman ) before fading beauty and the arrival of white competition forced her into retirement . Then she went to live with the Whisperer  --  a goodlooking , industrious upstanding young Mojave whose only defectwas the knife wound in his throat that had robbed him of his voice . Among the Mojaves , Maria had much the same standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small town if she married a local boy and settled down to an exemplary life : a rich , industrious , strong-minded woman with an exotic past . Her manners were foreign , and to some extent her dress . She wore her hair parted in the middle and combed down on either side of her head , without the universal bangs of Mojave women . Her dresses were better-fitting , less full , and more nearly in the current American style , than those the Mojave women had been wearing since they had abandoned bark skirts for calico a generation or so earlier . All Mojaves regarded Maria with pcc and respect , but nobody confided in her , because telling t Maria anything was just like telling it to a white person . South Boy 's attitude towards Maria , and that of every other white male  --  except the preacher and one or two like him  --  was very , ' much the same as the Mojaves ' . But the white women . . . To them she was Poisoned Flesh  --  in the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompromising rectitude during these recent years , she was a Soul Half Saved . They made it a point to speak to her kindly , from a distance , and urge her to seek Jesus . South Boy 's mother even offered to take her down to the preacher in Needles in her own surrey , in spite of the fact that she was in perfect panic at the idea of coming so closely in contact with one undoubtedly possessed of the Syphilitic Devil  --  which might fly from the back seat where Maria would sit to the front seat and there attack either herself or South Boy . Still , Maria was a brand worth snatching from the burning  --  with asbestos gloves . Maria always agreed with everything the Good Women said  --  up to the actual step of becoming a confessed Christian . She said it was too late . She had been too sinful . South Boy had a feeling that Maria knew that she would never get the amount of public attention as a Saved Soul that she was getting as a Brand to be Snatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where two or three ladies were gathered together and within five minutes they would be standing around at a safe distance , weeping , begging her to come into the Fold . Maria managed to arrange most of these occasions when there would be three or four Mojaves in the middle distance telling one another that this Maria must certainly be a Person of Importance to have white women cryingover her every time they met her  --  and even though it had been four or five years since her last relative had died . As he sat there watching her swift , dexterous hands , South Boy pondered another possible reason why Maria would n't take the Preacher 's hand . In spite of her foreign ideas , she was probably still too much of a Mojave to hold much store in rewards in Heaven or punishments in Hell . The Mojave 's Heaven was no better than a pale , still land of shadows , and Hell was no worse than a rat 's hole . To be a Mojave  --  to have one God dead and one God on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Hell without horror : there came an emptiness in the pit of South Boy 's stomach as he thought about it . Then he was distracted by a grimace of pain that swiftly crossed Maria 's face . Punishment in this life for transgressionsp59was entirely in accord with Mojave ideas , and it was stoically accepted . Maria had transgressed , by the Mojave code , by havingintercourse with outlanders . Many had transgressed thus and were paying for it by barrenness and by having an invisible coyote gnawing at their bellies . South Boy wondered if that was what Maria thought aboutit . He would have asked her outright if she had been a real Mojave ; but Maria , like a white woman , would have been indignant . She looked up at him sharply . " What 's Havek talking to my than about ? " " A bow , " said South Boy . " I need a good bow . " Maria nodded vigorously . " Yes , you 're a lot better off huntingwith a bow than with that big blunderbuss I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot your head off . " Thus he completed his mission , which was to win Maria 's approval of the bow-making . The Whisperer had already pulled three or four long , seascoredstaves of black willow out of the roof thatch , and he and Havek had selected one . South Boy had his own ideas and wanted to be in on the choosing . When he turned to go Maria said , " We have somebody else here  --  she 's a surprise for you , " hut he thought very little about it and hurried over to the men . Hayek and the Whisperer sat side by side on the cleanswept , hard-packed adobe floor with the bow stave across their knees . It had already been partly worked . Both men examined it closely to determine the course of the grain . South Boy sat clown on the other side of the Whisperer and laid his hand on the stave . It was given to him without a word . He nodded and passed it back . In his eight or nine years of experience in bowmakinghe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand into a small pot in front of him full of broken glass and sharp chips of stone . He fingered around gingerly and brought out a fragment . He began scrapingoff long thin shavings with it , working with great speedp6o and energy , singing to himself in his hoarse , croaking , whisperingvoice . He had been a great Dream-singer . Havek and then South Boy selected sharp bits of glass and sat poised and ready , watching the Whisperer 's flying scraper . Out of breath , the Whisperer rasped , " Take it , " and shoved the bow to South Boy , tapping a long forefinger at the spot to be scraped . His eyes were dancing . South Boy scraped manfully . The sweat ran into his eyes and poured off his body . He scraped double-time to the Whisperer 's muted song . South Boy felt good . Maria was absorbed in her beadwork . The fat woman was talking endlessly to herself or anybody who might be listening , complaining of the heat , saying aloud everything that was passing through her stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribbled a small handful of corn meal into the pot where the fish was cooking . The fat girl spent most of her time half hidden behind her mother , looking at Havek . Her stare was both vapid and impudent . Occasionally she got up and slouched over to the fire , where she took a sip of warm water from a small pot that stood by itself at the edge of the ashes . Her hair was as slovenly as her person . Out of the corner of his eyes , South Boy saw that the tattoo marks on her face were fresh . That fact , and the hot-water drinking , marked her as " a woman in her first forty days " ; but he paid no attention to her . She came quite close to Havek and stared at him with looselippedconcentration . Havek picked up a little stick and threw it at her . The bow rapidly took shape under six swift hands . Sometimesthree scrapers were working at one time . Sometimes the Whisperer took it in his own hands , feeling it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank . At last the bow was notched and strung with a thick sinew string . It was six feet long , almost six inches taller than South Boy . Then it was unstrung , and the Whisperer took it to scrapep61again  --  " to take out the bad bend . " South Boy had thought i hat the draw was already perfect . While this last and most delicate operation was taking place , the Whisperer said , " Look , a friend comes ! " and pointed with his chin . South Boy turned to look and saw coming out of the " modern " house a fine woman in her best clothes . She wore a dress of purple silk that swept the ground as she walked . Around her shoulders was a close-fitting cape of beadwork , blue and white in color . Tied across her chest and flowingdown her back was a tahoma  --  f our large , yellow , figured silk handkerchiefs sewed together to make one large square . Her fine oval face was neither young nor old . Her complexion w as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow , showing she took care of herself , washed regularly , and kept out of the full sun . She walked through the shade like a ship sailing through smooth water , went first to the fire hole , examined the fish mush , added a handful of corn meal , then took four or five tortillas from a covered basket , put them into a pottery bowl , ladled a generous helping of red beans and salt meat from one of the several small pots on the fire , and came straight to South Boy with it , smiling , walking like a grand lady  --  very different she was indeed from either the wasted , exotic Maria , or the lumpy , sloppy , poor relations . Everyone was watching South Boy now and grinning-even Maria . The lady smiled affectionately at South Boy as she handed him the food . She had pleasant little wrinkles around her eyes and mouth . Then she sat down directly in front of him , her hands in her lap , the yellow soles of her bare feet justshowing on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heepa , " called out Maria . " She is my relative . " South Boy said , " Thank you , " to the lady in English , because he was too surprised to say anything else . He had no ideawhy he should be so honored until she called him " son , " and then " little son . " Then he knew she was a clan sister or possibly a blood sister to another Heepa , now dead , who had nursed him when he was a baby . He began to remember . This woman had married a southern Mojave and had gone to live down belowParker when he was still very small . The lady , then , stood in the relation of a deputy foster mother . So she dressed up for him and fed him with her own hands . He was deeply proud to find himself related to a person of her quality . He folded meat and beans into a tortilla and ate hugely to show his appreciation . The lady was telling him how little , puny , and white he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister had cried over him because they thought he would n't live long . Now he was so tall .. . The beans and meat were salty . They tasted good . He had sweat a great deal . He ate and listened to her soft voice . Havek and the Whisperer were being fed by the garrulous fat woman . South Boy was thinking how awful to find yourself related to her . Still , the Whisperer did n't seem to mind . He took what Fate dealt him in the line of relatives and thought little about it . South Boy 's eyes started to roll back in his head . He promptly lay down , there where he was , his head close to the purple silk skirt . He heard the lady say , " Almost a man , now , " and for an instant her fingers touched his face . He was thinkinghe would like to tell her he was a Hawk-dreamer bound for high adventure , going to go into the wild north to harry the Piutes . That would give her great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he saw , when his eyes opened for the last time , that the objectionable fat girl had quit staring at Havek . She was staring at him . South Boy woke up four hours later . The sun was halfway down towards the Nevada mountains . It was still very hot , but the wind came in the usual fitful gusts of the afternoon and made it feel cooler . His first thought was to remember hisp63dream ; but it had been a worthless sort of white man 's dream about being in California at the seashore with the ocean wind in his face , eating ice cream . The lady in the purple dress sat with her back against a post , her eyes closed , her face composed . The fat woman and her daughter sprawled out  --  formless , dingy bumps in dirty calico . Maria in her clean faded gingham was propped against a fartherpost , head bent over her loom , her long hair hiding her shrewd , haggard face . Havek and the Whisperer slept belly down , and the bow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . South Boy got up quietly , went to the olla suspended from t he middle rafters and took a long drink . It was good . Every-t Bing was still . The gusts of wind driving little puffs of sand over and through the low , scattered brush between the camp and the mesa made only small noises . The talk of the distant river was far away . South Boy looked at the sky . It had a cop- eery tinge . There was a big storm in the far north and the wind h , 1 ( 1 sent red silt into the high air . South Boy picked up his bow and tried its strong , even pull . Then he kicked Havek . " Get up , " he whispered in English . " Let 's go . I do n't want to have to eat any of that fish mush . " A moment later the Whisperer rolled over and saw South Boy leaning on his bow , impatient to travel . He jumped up and pulled eight arrows out of the thatch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet. " " hake four , " he whispered . " They are hawk-feathered . " And he grinned . So he knew . South Boy glanced over at Maria and saw that she still slept ; but the lady in purple , his deputy mother , had her eyes open . She smiled at him in great pride . She knew then - - at least something . South Boy leaned over and selected four of the straightest and best arrows . He would find iron some-%% here , and make points . Then his war arrows would be better than Havek's.  | Havek got up , took a long drink , and was ready to go . " Wait , I must give you something , " said the lady , very softly . The three men waited by the edge of the shade . The Whisperer said , " Good dreaming ! " which meant good luck . His black eyes were shining . The lady came hurrying back with a clean salt sack . She had put a quart of parched corn and hulled squash seeds into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans that had lain for a year in a hole in the ground , so that they were very sweet . She said , " Travel lightly , son , " when she gave him the sack . South Boy did not know the way to thank her , so he shook her hand white-fashion and mumbled quickly , " Thank you  --  goodbye . " The two boys started off at a slow trot through the short brush that edged the cultivated land and so to the return bend of the lagoon where big mesquite trees grew along its bank . South Boy had seen the fat girl go hustling across the field towards the mesquite while he was selecting the arrows , but he had thought nothing about it at all . So he was entirely surprised when she stepped out from behind the third or fourth tree directly in front of him and seized him by his shirt , almost jerkinghim off his feet . She did n't look at him . Her tousled hair hung down with the mock modesty a woman from the brush affects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jerking away from her , almost tearing his shirt . " Dirt face , " he shrieked , fanning the air between them with his new bow . " Fat belly ! " He was panic-stricken . The Presbyteriandevil and the devil called Syphilis were snatching at him . To make matters worse , Havek was doubled up with laughter , crying out : " You fat fool ! Did n't you know this little boy is n't grown yet ? " South Boy swished his bow and shrieked more insults at both of them . Everybody from the camp came running to see what the row was about . The Whisperer got there first , squealing and bending over in cracked-voice mirth . Behind him came the fat woman . When she saw her mother , the girl threw back her head ,  |p65|pointed  her finger at South Boy and howled like a wolf . South Boy had not only spurned her foully but said insulting things . The fat woman chattered like an angry monkey and started throwing clods at him . Back of her was the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the boy , but the boy did n't want any such ugly lump of a girl . It was amusing , but her restrained manner was a reproof to these people who were creating an unseemly fuss about it . Back of her came Maria . Maria , ex-denizen of a Needles brothel , showed herself wholly for conventional " white " morality . She told the girl off in sharp bitter words for immodesty and indecency , and said to South Boy in English : " You tell your mother this never happened in my camp . Tell her I 'm goingto teach this girl how to act decent if I have to skin her . " She then spoke bitter words in Mojave . Whereupon the girl 's mother stopped throwing clods at the boy and started throwingthem at Maria . The last South Boy heard as he ran away was the girl howling , and the fat woman and Maria obscenely screaming names of each other 's dead relatives . South Boy ran in a blind panic for fifteen minutes until he was heat-dizzy and gasping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagoon through a break in the mesquite and stumbled towards it , more with the idea of washing away the polluting touch of the fat girl than giving himself relief from the heat . He dropped his equipment and hit the water with a terrific splash , found himself on the soft bottom and stayed there for a full minute , rubbing his hands futilely over the front of his shirt . Then he came up to the surface through t1 particular volition of his own and automatically struck out for the water 's edge . There he sat , splashing water on himself , washing away the bottom mud and the unseen pollution with it until the racing of his heart ceased and his breath came back . The warm air blew cool on his wet clothes and he began to reason away his fears . He had no true facts on which to base his reason , but he remembered a conversation he had had with the Foreman about the possibilities of sterilizing the back seat of the surrey , if and when Maria rode in it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibleattack of the **29;82;TOOLONG . The Foreman just laughed and laughed . When he got his breath back he said , " Son , you do pick up the damnedest notions . " After that he gave a long and complete discourse in plain language about venereal infections and concluded with the statement : " Take it from a man that knows , there is only one way to pick up anything like that , and it ai n't from sitting down in a carriage seat . " So South Boy sat in the mud slowly thinking over what the Foreman had told him . The panic eased out of his mind . It did n't stand to reason he was in any danger because the girl had grabbed his shirt . The Foreman had said : " Keep your nose clean , but do n't take no stock in them wild ideas of your mother . She 's a lady . Naturally , she 's ignorant . " South Boy climbed up the bank , terrifically angry with himself for losing his dignity . He should have just laughed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ignoring Havek . He cut a piece of fishline and tied both ends to his provision sack , slipping the loop over his shoulder . He picked up his bow and arrows . They gave him a thrill of pride , in spite of his shame . He started slowly off through the short brush , his eyes on the ground , his face burning . He had not gone a hundred yards before Havek came runningup , kicking a small , round desert gourd ahead of him . Havek loosened an arrow at it and sent it bounding away with a glancing blow . This was their old game . South Boy could n't resist it . He loosened an arrow and split the gourd , and pride lifted his heart . Soon they were running side by side , kicking gourds andp67shooting at them , yipping like young coyotes , the past far behind them . They cried aloud at the excellence of their bows and bragged up each other 's marksmanship , declaring no two grown men in the valley could shoot so well.  |p68THE  LAST WAR CLUBTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as South Boy was concerned . As he ran along in the hot wind making pride for himself with his arrows to crowd out the indignity he had suffered in the matter of the fat girl , he did n't notice that they were heading northeast instead of northwestuntil he looked up and saw the dun cliff of the mesa right ahead . Up on the rim was a camp , a very poor one . Only a ramada of six posts with a brushy , poorly made roof of mixed brush , and a single bird's-nest granary . So he asked , " What are we doing here ? " " I forgot to tell you , " said Havek , who had already started up the switchback trail to the camp . " We stop for a little while to see my father 's uncle . He 's Yellow Road , called El Capitan . He 'll be dead before we get back ; so I want to see him once more . Besides , he 's a very great captain . He might tell us some-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard many stories about the almost legendary Yellow Road , but he had thought him already dead . The two boys found the old Indian sitting with his back against the northeast corner post of the ramada , farthest from the sun , a tall , gaunt old man , the color of half-dry adobe dusted with ashes , naked except for a loincloth and a wild tangle of long gray hair . There were only two visible pieces of property under the shed . One was a small olla containing pounded mesquite beans steeping in water that stood at the old man 's right hand ; the other , a great war club , shaped likep69a cooper 's maul or a big bung starter , suspended by a rawhide thong from a knot on the post behind him . South Boy knew this was n't ordinary poverty . Yellow Road had been both a great hota and a great war chief ; but now , considering he had long since outlived his usefulness , he had retired into voluntary poverty to wait for the oblivion of death , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish hawk . Such was customary with great men who lived too long . And the war club over his head  --  South Boy had never beforeseen one though every singing and every long tale was full of them  --  that marked Yellow Road as belonging to a time that was long gone . In a little while now , this last war club would be burnt on the same pyre with its owner . Then all clubs and all of the clubbers would belong wholly to legend . As soon as Yellow Road began talking , South Boy realized that he belonged to an older and in many ways much different generation than those now considered " old men "  --  the hota of fast night 's singing , for instance  --  who were the present keepersof tradition . He had said nothing until the boys sat down before him and 1 lavek had laid his bundles of arrows proudly in front of him . The old man took one look at the iron points and said , " So you have learned this shameful , newfangled business of lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! So yourrut is so weak and your bow is so poor you must have points n your arrows ! " I lavek said : " We go name-traveling through Piute country , nil the Piutes are at war . They 've got Winchester rifles . " Yellow Road shook his head , gasped for breath , and to relievehimself took a drink of mesquite-bean gruel from the pot . " Nobody knows how to do anything properly now  --  nobody . Traveling is one thing . War is another . This shoot-inthe-backbusiness that people learned from the Apaches a while ego and call small-men war  --  that 's another thing again . Wait ,  |p7o  I 'll tell you  --  " He took another drink from the olla and waited to get his breath . " Let me tell you the proper way of traveling . It was given me . I know it . " If a man wants to win himself honor by traveling to friendly people , like the Yuma , to the south , or the Yavapai , to the east , or the Zuni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west in the Tehachapi Mountains  --  then he strips himself naked and fasts half the day and runs day and night , not sparing himselfat all . If he carries goods for trading , that is a different matter  --  I'mspeaking of traveling for honor and name-winning . He runs as fast as he can , calculating his strength , so he will just last until he gets to the friendly village . Then he falls . The life is almost out of him . If he dies , he has done a Great Thing . But , being a real man , he usually lives when the women come and pour water over him . Then he takes a little water in his mouth . Then a little gruel . Then he sleeps one or two days , and then his friends feast him and he tells them his new name . " Now if he travels to the country of a suspicious unfriendly people ; like the Indians on the California coast , or the Hopi , or the Havasupai to the north , he runs fast , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he comes to the town of such people , he runs fast so he will appear covered with sweat and the people will think he has run all the way . He carries no weapon , but in this case he has a staff in his hand . He goes boldly to the best house in the town and leans on his staff , shouting : Huh ! Wah ! Bring water and we 'll be friends . Shoot arrows at me , and the clubbers will come ! ' " This is a Mojave , ' the people will say , because only they dare do this . ' Usually they give him water and later food , and something to show he has been there  --  a bow , or a few beads , or something . " If they are foolish and attack him , he jumps inside the house and kills everybody he can with his staff , breaking heads , legs , or arms until they shoot him down or cut him down . Hep71dies singing the songs that he dreamed , knowing the clubbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burning the town . " Now if he travels to an enemy town  --  still he runs naked with only a stick in his hand , or maybe nothing . But he does not exhaust himself . He goes cautiously . He goes at night . At night he enters the town as I in my youth entered the Hopi town of Oraibi when those people were angry with us over a matter of trade . " I climbed the high hill at Oraibi . Houses are piled on top of houses there . I went everywhere cleverly , like the shadow of a ghost . I stole a sack of meal from a house full of people . I went vet- housetops and through streets , through houses , throughtufas where medicine men slept , leaving a yellow trail of meal behind me . I could have killed ten , but I killed no one . I Was not making war . I was name-traveling . So I stole a doll , dressed after the Hopi style , just to show where I 'd been . And took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man drank from the olla again . Both Havek and South Boy murmured in Mojave . " A Great Thing ! Surely , a ( it eat Thing ! " " Rut the Piutes have guns ! " said Havek . " Guns ! " croaked Yellow Road . " I 'll tell you something . The Laniards had guns ! When I was small , my father and a dozen ore went to Santa Barbara by the ocean to trade with the aniards . They had guns , and a fort , and soldiers . The Movesdid n't have even their clubs . They had only a few bows d some hunting arrows , for they had come to trade . But a Laniard tried to cheat a Mojave and then insulted him , so the mojave slapped his face and because the Spaniard was puny , is neck broke . " The Spaniards fired on the naked Mojaves , wounding two . The Mojaves yelled , Clubs ! Clubs ! ' And as they had no clubs cy took sticks of oak firewood and chased the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there for about a week , and then Mission Indians were sent out with presents to pay for the wounded . So the Mojaves took a few horses to carry the presents and went home , laughing . " " The Piutes have Winchester rifles , and six-shooters , too , " Havek pointed out . The old man made no answer , but closed his eyes ; and his laborious breathing became painful to watch , until the wind came and cooled him and stirred his long hair . When he opened his eyes he skipped over the reference to modern firearms . " I have told you of proper traveling . Now I 'll tell you of proper war . One of you hand me down my club . " Both boys sprang up , but South Boy , being lighter and swifter , laid his hand on it first . The club had been carved out of the black heart of a mesquite log so that it was all of a piece , handle and all . To South Boy it had a smooth , greasy feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man took it and held it up before his face . " With this the Mojaves made their name feared from the Pueblos east of the Zuni to the Western Ocean , and from the big Salt Lake in the north to the river of the Yaquis in the south . Everywhere a Mojave could travel naked and alone for honor and experience , or just for trade , because everyone knew that in the Mojave country there were clubs just like this one . We never sent war parties out to loot and run , like Apaches and coyotes . We had everything we wanted at home . When we sent out a party , it was to avenge a brother and thereby keep our honor great . And everyone knew when the Mojaves fought the fight would end in one of three ways : All the enemy would be killed , the enemy would run away , or all the Mojaves would be killed . A war chief never had to account for his lost men when he came home . He reported to his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " By this time Yellow Road had lapsed into the swift , jerky phrases of a formal oration . " In the last good war I was thep73leader . The Cocopah killed a Yuma traveler . Our cousins ( the Yuma ) said , Send us a hundred men . ' I took a hundred real men . Big men with clubs like this . I took twenty-five small men with straight bats to break heads . I took fifty Chemehuevi , too , mounted on horses . They were our scouts . Mojaves ran on foot all the long journey . Being big men , horses ca n't carry them swiftly in hot weather . " So we joined the Yuma at Algadones in Mexico and we ran two days to find the Cocopah . Our scouts found them . They had a trench and an embankment all around their town . They had guns . " We had bows and plain arrows , but we did n't use them . In the last hour of darkness , we charged their fort in a single line of clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fired one volley , killing some of us , and then we were among than . " Now here is the proper way to use a club . You charge . Youseize your enemy by the hair . You thrust the club up , thus ! mash his face ! Then you throw your man over your shoulder for the small men to finish with their straight clubs , or cut off his head with their knives . " In five minutes the Cocopah all ran . Among their dead was 0 short-haired Mexican army captain who had come to show their how to fortify their town against us . Then we called out to the Cocopah , You are our cousins by blood . We wo n't kill $nv more of you , but you must never harm travelers ! ' WeK0Ic all the horses we could find to carry our wounded , andc took six girls for slaves , and we went north to Algadones , rrying the heads of several of the slain . And there we restedd ate big meat , and smoked ourselves clean all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and death backour own country . There the man-who-was-chosen skinned the heads of the enemy -- completely , face , and all , and tied them to a long pole at he carried . He was unclean and they were unclean . No one went near them . He watched the two slave girls , too . The other four we gave to the Yuma , for it was their traveler who had been killed . The slaves were unclean . Nobody touched them , except to keep them from running away . " So far Yellow Road had been telling what actually happened , but at this point , after he had drunk from the olla and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , he began singing from the cycle of Dream-singing called " Nichiva , " which gives the account of the return of the First War Party . But South Boy knew that Mojave ritual was so bound down to the tradition of the First Times , that the actual procedure of Yellow Road 's party would n't have varied greatly from that set down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying overhead that heralded the party 's return . How the people shouted when they saw it . How they sent four alyah ( men who dressed and behaved like women ) to meet the warriors and aid the unclean trophy-bearer on whose pole the long hair of the head-skins waved and danced in the summer wind . How a hota came forth and invited all the warriors to a dance and a feast , and how he likewise offered a small house and a patch of garden to the captive slaves . These girls lived a strange life thereafter . Technically they were the slaves of the host who took charge of them ; but he never made them work , nor did he go near them or have anything to do with them except to see that they did n't run away . They were treated much like animals in a zoo . Mojaves came from long distances to watch these foreign women , often tossingthem bundles of food. if they got tired of being on exhibition , they could ask the hota to take them to the river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tried to run away for a long time , he would do it . Then they would be considered Mojaves and could live with any man who wanted them . But even then , they usually died virgins because all the men were afraid of them.  |p75In  the " Nichiva " singing there were many verses about theatus of slave girls . Then it described the pole with the head skins standing in the ground in the middle of the dancing place . I low the men and women danced around it , their faces painted black and yellow , their hair stiff with white clay and alkali  --  dancing in many groups , each in a different manner according to which cycle of Dream-singing its leader sang . Some clapped hands , some shook rattles , some danced to drumbeats made on a basket or a water jar . All this was in the " Nichiva " singing nr great detail . When the old Indian stopped he was very tired , and it was hard for him to get his breath . When he did he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Now I am weak because I have not eaten for a long time . I need big meat and there is Hume here . " I t occurred to South Boy that the old man might actually be starving . Still grumbling about " big meat , " Yellow Road drank some f the water and chewed a little of the bean fiber with his few limit- teeth and spat it out with a grimace . Then he began the story of the first defeat the Mojaves suffered in tribal history. gain a Yuma traveler had been murdered and again the tilers had been a kindred tribe , this time the Maricopa  --  over the Salt River valley . With the Maricopa lived the remnant f the Colorado River tribes that the Mojave and the Yuma d ruined in war and driven east across the desert . Some of c ' e had killed the lone Yuma . The Yuma , always a small tribe , sent eighty-two clubbers t a punitive expedition , the Mojave sent two hundred , and they were joined by a hundred Yavapai and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I he Maricopa knew they were coming and called on their friends the Pima , who were club fighters like the Mojave , and vcry numerous people . They sent the Maricopa four hundred men who fought in solid phalanx behind big bullhide shields . The Apache horsemen charged first and fought like lions for about five minutes , having several horses killed and many men wounded ; but when they found the Pima-Maricopa line would not break they fled . The Yavapai charged with the Apache . Being half Mojave and half Apache , they fought for a longer time and lost ten men before they ran . The Mojave and the Yuma , being on foot , struck next . They broke the line of Pima shields again and again , killing a hundred men . But the Pima always re-formed . No other alien people had ever done that before in the history of Mojave warfare . " Then , " said Yellow Road , " I called to the Yuma . I said , They are too many , and we are too far from our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . They had thrust themselves into the midst of the Pima and killed until they died . Nobody else fought like that but our people and the Pima . The Mojave lost forty men killed , and there was not a man among them but carried some wound . . . " The defeated Mojave retreated for eight days through Yavapaicountry and through the land of the Walapai . The Walapai stood on their hills and jeered at them , and the Mojaves , too wounded and weary to punish them , went home to sulk and brood . This was in the spring of 1858 . Out of this jeering a greater evil was to befall . In August of that year a large immigrant train , the first contingent of Iowans to migrate to southern California , came down LieutenantBeale 's new trail through north-central Arizona and when they were camped at the river crossing where Fort Mojave now stands , the Walapai came and again taunted the Mojave , and dared them to attack the whites . And the Mojaves , still brooding over their defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred head of cattle , driving the emigrantsback the way they had come  --  and no others ever came down that trail . Thus the Mojaves gained back their prestige  --  for a littlep77while . Then the soldiers came  --  the first hostile invasion of the Mojave valley . Yellow Road said nothing of how the rifle fire of the soldiers mowed down the ranks of the Mojave clubbers . He ended his story cursing the Walapai , naming their dead grandfathers . He closed his eyes . He said : " I am weak . My shadow is weak . I need meat . " By and by he said : " So you are going into the Piute country . You will stay by the trail and kill Apache-fashion and think you are big men . There has been too much Indians killing Indians . That is why we are weak . " Small-men war , " he groaned . " Iron-point arrows . Thus we come to imitate coyotes when the days of our greatness are ended . " There was a weary , wind-driven silence for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war club lying across his legs , its handle resting against his skeleton-thin knees . He said , " Big meat , " twice , without opening his eyes . South Boy stared at the old man . A young person could live on mesquite beans and even get fat , but an old man with few teeth might starve . I le looked around to see two women coming up the trail burdened down with carrying-nets full of long white mesquitebeanpods . They went to the bird's-nest granary , climbed the low scaffolding , and dumped the contents of their nets into it . They were fat enough , but they had teeth . " Bring me my gun , " said the old man suddenly . One of the women pulled an old single-shot Springfield rifle out of the thatch and brought it to him , laying it across his highs . As ancient as the rifle was , it looked outlandishly modern in he lap of the last of the clubbers . Probably it was a relic of the eighties , when the government had armed the now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids to the west . Anyhow , Yellow Road had a rifle and was fum- bling big , finger-length cartridges out of the folds of the rag bound around his waist . He found four . He looked at Havek . " My eyes wo n't see and my legs wo n't carry me , and there is no man here to shoot me that big meat . " South Boy watched Havek out of the corner of his eyes and saw him squirm . One of the best bow-shots in the valley , he had fired a rifle only once in his life and then he had been knocked flat and had missed the target by twenty feet . He looked at South Boy pleadingly , knowing very well that the white boy had been having expert instruction in the use of just such a rifle from the Mormonhater for some two years . " I 'll use my arrows , " said Havek uncomfortably . " Then I 'll starve , " said Yellow Road . " The wild horse stays in the open where he can watch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in memory of his recent laughter , and then said , " Give me the gun . " The old man said nothing . So South Boy took it and picked up one after another of the cartridges , selecting one in which the powder rattled freely . He kept but one because he knew he would never get a second shot with that rifle . With the rifle in his hand , South Boy raised his head and stuck out his chest and spoke in the manner of a war captain giving orders . " Somebody carry my sack and my bow . Somebodyshow me where the wild horse grazes . " And he started off down the trail without looking back . He had good reason to hurry , because the sun was almost down . Before he was halfway down to the flat he began to have an uncomfortable , ashamed feeling . He 'd made a show-off play . He had blackened Havek 's face because Havek had laughed at him in the matter of the fat girl . A big man , like Yellow Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . South Boy felt very small and discontented with himself as his feet struck the soft ground of the flat and the white man 's worries were on him again , full cry . The rifle was old and rusty . It probably would n't shootp79st raight . The barrel might even be so foul that it would blow out its breech . So he stopped , flipped the breechblock up and looked down the barrel . His heart sunk into his belly . He could not see through the bore at all . Well , there was no turning back , for he knew there would be no use trying to explain to an old Indian that a rifle was no good as long as it was possible to crowd a cartridge into the chamber and close the breech . He heard one of the women chirping at him from the trail behind , and he looked back to see her pointing northwest . He went with leaden feet to the first clump of arrowweeds and broke off one . He thrust the butt end down the barrel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the arrowweed came out full of black grease instead of rust ; so he pulled two or three more through the barrel and looked down the muzzle. l'he bore was so clean it looked new . Immediately Yellow Road became an even greater man in South Boy 's eyes . He was not only a great Mojave , but he possessed the white man 's virtue of taking care of his gun . South Boy looked back over his shoulder and saw Havek nd the two women about a hundred and fifty yards behind , raveling silently . One of the women chirped again and raised cr arm , flexing her wrist and throwing her hand forward to how that the horse was straight ahead and not too far away . He signed them all to keep well back and went slowly on ith the wind blowing his face in hot , fitful gusts . That was good . The horse could n't smell him . But the wind blew spiniftsof fine sand that cut down vision , and whenever the wind stopped the heat waves danced up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to his eyes . Just ahead was a spread of gravel that had been brought down from the mesa by past cloudbursts pouring through a wash to his right . South Boy bent low and threaded his wayp8o cautiously among the boulders on the gravel spread . There he caught his first glimpse of the horse . He immediately got down on his belly and crawled from one small , hot boulder to the next , then to a smoketree . Then to a sotol-weed growing on the edge of the soft ground . The horse was grazing around a lone mesquite at the very edge of a small barranca that passed through a salt-grass flat almost a quarter of a mile away . He was a fat young mustang , dark chestnut with a white patch on his rump and another on his nigh shoulder . He browsed around the tree like a wild horse , snatching a mouthful of beans or leaves , then throwing his head up to look around him and sniff for enemies . Being away from the herd , he was extra-shy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto flat ground so hot it burnt his belly , inching along towards another sotol-weed a hundred yards ahead . His eyes stung and his head was swimming . Back of the weed , he shoved the hindsight up one notch with his thumb . There was a bunch of alkali-killed sage fifty or sixty yards farther on . Blindly and rebelliously he crawled towards it . He thought he would die before he thrust the barrel of the rifle through the dead bush so that it rested on the hummock of earth out of which the bush had grown . Through sweat and tears and dancing heat he saw the horse stretch his neck out for a bunch of beans growing high  --  a fine alert horse  --  a good horse for anybody . As he cocked the big , clumsy hammer , he was thinking what a fine thing it would be to have that horse in the corral back home . It would come nickering along the fence to meet him  --  glad to see him . All at once he felt that there could be nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any horse  --  a horse was a friend . Then he saw the face of the old man back under the ramada , thin , gray , starving . A great man . There could be nothing worse than to let that man starve.  |p81Why  was it he was being put between two evils like this ? Twice in the same day . Either he should let them send him away to a world that he dreaded like death , or he must break his mother 's heart  --  leave her lying face down on her bed , sobbinginto her pillow . Either he must shoot this splendid animal , or he must let the old man starve . The mustang jerked his head down . He was going to run . The foresight was on that white spot  --  the heat waves were dancing and wriggling between . The horse jumped . South Boy had already pulled the trigger . He got up rubbing his shoulder , the world spinning around him . He could n't see , but he heard the cry , " Kwee-ee-eeKwi-i-i-va ! " from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " like women at a scalp dance . They ran past him waving big knives , and jumped into the barranca where the horse had fallen . Havek came up and said , " Look , they gave us bullhide sandals . " South Boy was too sick to talk , so he sat down and put on the pair of sandals Havek gave him . By and by he said , " Leave my sack and bow and take the rifle to the women . " Painfully he got up , and slowly he walked away , keeping his eyes on his feet so that he would n't see the women gutting the horse . He was a half-mile along with his misery before Havek caught up with him . They traveled a quarter of a mile farther , then Havek said in great admiration , " You did n't brag or any-thing . " South Boy dropped his equipment and hid his face in his hands . Havek walked on in deference to what he thought was modesty . Some time later they came to a gourd patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow at it . South Boy could n't resist . He shot an arrow , too , and the load of trouble end shame gradually dropped from him as they traveled on , shooting arrows until the sun sank and it was too dark to see.  |p82PAINTED  HORSESTHEY slept that night in the middle of a little playa at the far end of the Snake lagoon . Some time after midnight when the bright moon was in mid-sky , South Boy woke out of a sound sleep , sweating profusely and full of dread . He called out to Havek , and Havek promptly sat up , saying , " Huh ? What did you dream ? " " Nothing , " said South Boy . " But it came to me that here we are traveling to a strange country we know nothing about . " " Shut up and go to sleep , " Havek told him . " I thought you had dreamed something important . " " No , but we ought to ask questions and make plans . This is a silly thing coming into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war up there about ? Just where is it ? Where in the north are we going , and just what are we going to do ? " " What difference ! Our dreams are good . We ca n't go wrong . Shut up and go to sleep . " Havek rolled over on his belly , spread himself out like a starfish , and went to sleep . " There I go worrying like a white man again ! " South Boy told himself . So he lay watching the great low stars awhile , then went to sleep . He awoke again with the first light , feeling good . He went down to the lagoon to drink and wash and replaster his head . Havek got up with a grunt a moment later , shucked off his clothes before his eyes were entirely open and jumped into the lagoon . South Boy untied the mouth of his sack and began ruminating on sweet , brown screw beans , spitting out the fiber and hard seeds with noisy gusto . Here he was on the brink of adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , empty , northern country that stretched for hundreds of miles ahead of them . He began thinking about Nametravelingand small-men war , and how the two had got all mixed up . He remembered Yellow Road 's talk , and he had a painful flood of memory pictures of the horse-killing . " Name-traveling the old way was the best , " he said aloud . " We could do a Great Thing in the Piute country without killing anybody . " But still there were Piutes , war-mad , ready to kill on sight . A bullet would be the best thing he could expect of them . If they caught him while he was still alive , they would put one arrow through his guts and spread-eagle him on a bed of cholla cactus by a red ants ' nest . The women and the children would poke out his eyes with sticks . All the details he knew by heart from the Mojaves . Why , then , would n't it be a good thing to shoot a few Piutes ? Like killing sidewinders , only more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind when Havek came back , dressed , wet and grinning , his own head mud-packed and tied up in a handkerchief . He took a handful of screw beans and said : " The Travelers ' oad starts here . The war trail starts here . It 's a long way to thelute country , but from now on we travel as though a bullet Wright come out of every bush . " In about twenty minutes on a fast trail they came to the outostrancheria and approached it with great caution as though t were the first camp of the enemy . There were two men ando women working in the field of corn and melons  --  vigorousIf-young people . The men were chopping weeds with hoes , c women were gathering beans in a patch on the far side . " My cousin and my father 's first wife 's grandson , " Havek Whispered . " Fast runners and keen-eyed men , both of them . If I get chased , you stay hid . I 'll lose them in the brush and double back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " warned South Boy , viewing the field with an eye of the expert . " The cornstalks and the big weeds grow too scattered in that field . No good cover . " Havek dropped his weapons and stepped out into the field . Cornstalks grew irregularly in bunches of two and three , widely scattered among the watermelon vines . There were small melons and a few big melons , each covered with a little stack of dead weeds to keep off the sun . There was hardly hiding place for a very clever jack rabbit , but Havek faded into that field before he had gone fifty yards . South Boy was lost in admiration . Never had he seen anything so well done . He thought of the heroes in the Great Tales and the Dream-singing that were always disappearing and traveling underground . By golly , that 's what they must have meant , South Boy thought , a good job of belly-sneaking like that ! Havek might be traveling underground for all a keen eye could see . Out in the middle of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hair-ropes swinging across their backs . Five minutes later they both stopped , wiped their faces , looked back at the newly risen sun , leaned on their hoes and exchanged a few words . Then they bent to their tasks again and their hair began to swing . Suddenly South Boy 's heart jumped up into his throat and stuck there . He saw two cornstalks sway in momentary agitation . Right behind the men ! " Well , the damn fool ! " he whispered in infinite admiration . Then nothing . Not a sound , not a movement in the still , hot morning light , except the swaying of the hoers and the slow , hunching progress of the women in the bean patch . A dove cooed far away in the mesquite , and from over beyond the Mojaves ' ramada a rooster crowed . Ten breath-taking minutes , and Havek materialized at almostthe same spot where he had disappeared . He came bent far over , panting , his strained face sweat-drenched , andp85Clutched to his middle was a long green watermelon of some thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mesquitethat hid South Boy and flopped down beside it to get his breath . South Boy was open-mouthed , pop-eyed , dumfounded . He onsidered himself a well schooled hand at the ancient game of slid-the-enemy , but this exhibition of skill was something undreamedof . " Did you see me wiggle the cornstalks ? " Havek panted . South Boy nodded in wordless applaud . He dug out his great lisp knife and split the melon . It was dead-ripe . The heart was intson and still cool from the night . He slashed a chunk out it and handed it to Havek  --  an offering . Havek slowly sucked the sweet juice , thoughtfully watch-g the men in the field . " Those are my kin , " he said . " I know cm . You know them . Smart , wide-awake men . Why , if I n cross such a field as that and snatch a melon from right ttdcr the rumps of such men as those , there is n't a horse or a m Ian in the Piute country that 's safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll burn here , and you 'll burn thereafter . I know . I 've been told , " said South Boy . " Yes  --  well , I know foreign women are bad . Make it a horse a gun , then . They 've got fat , filthy , ugly-looking women , yhow . " They ate the great heart out of the melon , dozed like gorged makes for a half-hour , eased their bellies , slept another hour , d sat in great content , watching the field . A little while laterc men stopped , shouldered their hoes , called to the women , d headed for camp . " Are you empty enough to run ? " asked Havek . South Boy immediately slipped the string of his grub sack rr his shoulder , picked up his bow and arrows , and ducked tt from under the branches . Havek 's intention was only to create a minor confusion and rhaps an interesting chase , wherein they would get valuablep86practice in the art of losing a pursuing enemy . He raised the long yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken half of the melon into the field . He gave the Chemehuevi yell because he thought the men would be more certain to give chase if they thought they had been tricked by semistrangers from across the river . But the result was entirely unexpected . The men did n't drop their hoes and come running , shouting curses , leaping over the low corn . They ran to their camp , directly and silently , bent low , keeping their hoes in their hands . The women , alreadyat the ramada , broke into shrill screams and began pulling weapons out of the thatch . The men kept their hoes in their hands until the women ran to them , giving one a rifle and the other a shotgun . Three of them immediately ran over to the hillock of sand covering the winter house  --  the highest place around there . One woman ran back to the ramada , her tahoma flying straight behind her . From the thatch she snatched bows and a bundle of arrows and joined the others . The other woman came down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men began booming in a great bass voice . " Chemehuevi ! Awahy ! Awh-wa-a-aay ! " That " awahy " meant " foreign . " Foreign Chemehuevi is the Mojave name for all up-river and plateau Piutes . The Mojaves had n't mistaken Havek for a " tame " Chemehuevi . They thought the yell came from an up-river hostile of the same blood and language . Being frontiersmen , they put themselves immediately in the best possible position for defense , and sent a warning booming down the valley . South Boy and Havek faded into the brush , running like cats , picking out each footfall , thanking their dreams that the hard ground left no trail . They heard an answering from far down the valley . " You 're a damn fool ! " said South Boy when they 'd put a mile of open mesquite flat between them and the rancheria . " There will be scouts out in a hour , and the agency police ,  |p87too  , on horse and on foot . By golly , you know there is Piute trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Havek was unconcerned . " It 's a good thing to have everybodyready . We do n't know  --  maybe the Piutes have sent a party down here . If the white people give them a whipping up north , they 'll surely come . The Piutes will have to do something to save their faces . " They were hard put to cover their trail until they came to a very wide and deep lagoon that had once been the main channel of the river . This was called Wild Cow Lagoon . Silently they slipped into the water , and swam with one hand , the other carefully holding their bows high to protect the gut strings . Fortunately the rise in the river had brought the level of the lagoon up so that there was some driftwood floating free . They rounded up three small logs , tied them together with string to make a raft , laid the bows , arrows , and provision sacks across it , and silently pushed it north , swimming as close as possible under the overhanging growth along the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There they shoved the raft across to the farther bank , swimming as rapidly as possible without splashing , playing in dead earnest the same game they had been playing for fun since they were small . At the far side they shoved their raft under the trunk of a cottonwood that had fallen into the water , piled their equipmentoff on a shelf of mud a foot above the water line , untied the logs , and shoved them cautiously out into the lagoon , one at a time , with a long interval between , so they would float away dry side up and not be suspiciously bunched together . Then Havek lay down on the cool , dark mud shelf and promptly went to sleep . South Boy saw one log grounded fifty yards below , one floating off north , and the third west , and he said in great content , " It will take more than a frog 's nose to follow our trail ! " He felt too good to want to sleep , so he laid the bows and arrows up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he found a blistering-hot patch of sand in the full sunlight and set the wet ration bags in it to dry . With his back against the bole of a black willow he sat down , just resting , not even thinking , listening a little for possible sounds of a scouting party  --  hearing nothing but a hundred tiny , harmless noises that drifted through the heat . Beyond the narrow jungle belt , along the bank and immediately in front of him , was an open patch of salt grass , Jimson weeds , and gourd vines , bounded on its other three sides by large , well grown mesquites . South Boy was listening for sounds behind him , but his eyes were watching that patch of salt grass for no reason at all . He had sat there a half-hour when the two painted horses came drifting out of the mesquite and began idly browsing off the beans still hanging on the shady side of a tree . South Boy felt his scalp pull under the half-dry mud pack . He blinked . They were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painted designs were almost invisible under a liberal splattering of mud . There were bits of rags and ribbons tied to their manes and tails . One trailed a broken piece of stake rope that was tied around its neck . South Boy lay down , rolled to the bank 's edge , reached down , and touched Havek 's foot . Hayek opened his eyes . " Untie your war arrows , " whispered South Boy , and inchingalong the bank the length of his own body he put his hand on the bow . Havek , his eyes level with the bank , gave a low chuckle of delight . " Well , did I tell you ? You see now , I did a good thing . " Havek laid his arrows up on the bank , took another look at the ponies , jerked the sandals off his feet , thrust them into his hip pocket , and ran straight for the tallest cottonwood and climbed it like a monkey on a stick . South Boy immediately laid all the arrows in a row , flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpointedp89Arrows and resharpened its fire-hardened tip . Then he glanced up to see if Havek was out of sight , pulled out his belly-gun , wiped off the remaining external grease on his overalls , broke it , wiped each cartridge , tore a strip of cloth from his shirttail , ran it through the barrel two or three times , reloaded and ! , dick the gun back into his belt , leaving his shirttail out for easier access . Then he picked up his own bow and seven arrows in his left hand , and Havek 's bow and eight arrows  --  including those with the iron points  --  in his right hand and ran to the tree . Havek came sliding down , bug-eyed with excitement , the sweat standing out on his face in great drops . But he shook his head as he stretched out his hand to take his weapons . " No war Party close by . " He set out at a slow , cautious trot to circle the horses , cut their back trail , and find out where they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . Then he stopped cad in mid-stride and pointed ahead and to the right with his Chin . There in the soft dust of a gopher 's mound was the single track of a moccasined foot . That track removed any possible doubt about the horses . No Indians of the valley ever wore moccasins . Havek went and squatted over the track , studying it for a Kant minute . South Boy , one arrow across his bow and six clutched in his teeth , stood alert , watching , listening . Hecrouched low and looked around under branches . Havekreed and trotted towards the lagoon , his eyes on the ground . South Boy , satisfied there was nothing bigger than a lizard within two hundred yards , went and looked at the track . A ' flit foot , small and broad . There was a hole worn in the heel of the moccasin . A small-footed , heavy man . From faint tracks in the dust fore and aft , he reckoned the man was short and ruck-legged  --  a horse-Indian , surely . A careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country.  | South Boy turned and trotted after Havek , entering the thicket by an old trail made by the maverick cattle that roamed that part of the valley . There was Havek , standing on the bank looking down at two tracks in the mud at the water 's edge . There the man had knelt down on his right knee to drink . There was a print of the man 's right leg , knee to toe . The leg was short and bare but the moccasin top reached almost halfway to the knee ! " Apache ! " gasped South Boy through his mouthful of arrows . He had never heard of any other kind of Indian wearing that type of moccasin . " No . Some kind of Piute , " said Havek . South Boy lingered long enough to satisfy himself of one other thing . The knee print was half full of water that had seeped out on the mud . It was many hours old . Back in the mesquite , Havek ran his trail like a nosehound , his head down , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his left , arrows ready , eyes everywhere but on the trail , ears harking for sounds . Occasionally he would squat , with his eyes level with the ground , and peer ahead . What was passing through his mind was this : " If we run into the Piutes , they will be asleep under a tree with low branches . If they are all under one tree  --  fine ! We shoot our arrows , very fast . Then we run for the river . " None of this did he attempt to communicate to Havek . Havek would be thinking the same thing . They would leave fifteen arrow wounds to collect screw-fly maggots . They would be in the brush before a rifle was fired . They would run through brush where no horse could follow . No duck-legged Plateau Indian could hope to catch them afoot  --  particularly in this heat . When they dived into the swift current of the river they would be in a refuge especially designed for the safety of fish , beavers , and Mojaves . There wouldp91be nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if indeed Havek 's hoax had n't already aroused the . valley . All together , it promised to be a glorious day . Havek angled left , and South Boy turned with him . Havek turned right , and South Boy turned at the same instant  --  like o fish in the same school . They came to another and smaller salt-grass flat entirely surrounded by mesquite . There in the far side was the remnant of one small fire . Both boys crouched down and spent five minutes looking and listening . Havek got up and went straight across to the ashes . South Boy trotted around the periphery of the clearing . Havek stood spread-legged over the ashes , methodicallyreading sign . South Boy took the arrows from between his aching jaws and thrust them into the back of his belt . He felt angry and cheated . This was no war party . One lone Piute , a hundred and fifty miles south of where he had any right to be . I lavek beckoned peremptorily and pointed , his nose wrinkledwith disgust at the empty shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got down on his knees and smelt the ashes . " Yesterday , " he said . " Last night , " echoed Havek , and started off again on a trail that led north . They ran the trail to the north end of the lagoon . There hey crossed an old , incoming trail made by the two barefoot ponies . Havek turned back . They ran this trail to his first camp , near the bank of the ver . Here the stranger had eaten two big lizards , a water ake  --  to the increasing disgust of Havek and South Boy  --  ml a small rabbit . Then he had watered his horses and tied cm very carelessly to two mesquite trees , selected because cy bore a liberal crop of beans , at least two hundred yards ,  |p92from  where he had comfortably bedded himself down in soft dirt . Why should a " wild " Piute  --  who , though regarded by the Mojaves as infinitely inferior in strength , speed , and all the cultural matters , was always credited with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he do such a foolish thing ? Havek and South Boy stared at each other in silent surprise , and went back to reading trail to find the answer . The Piute 's carelessness had cost him his horses . During the night a mountain lion had twice circled his camp without awakening him , and then stalked the smaller of the horses . It had sprung at her , but she had jumped free , breakingher lead rope . At the same time , the larger horse had jerked out of his rope  --  South Boy found it tied to the neighboring tree , an oversized neck loop still intact . The two horses had run off into the brush , the lion running after them in great bounds for about a hundred yards . The commotion , probably the screams of the mare , had brought the Piute on the run with a firebrand that he threw at the cat . At the place where he threw it he had jumped up and down many times in fruitless rage  --  certainly much out of character for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this was not the last of such childish conduct . During the next two days he had stalked the runaways intermittently . Whenever he came in sight of them , he ran after them furiously , and when they outdistanced him , he threw himself on the ground and beat the earth with his hands and feet . He wasted a great deal of time , too . Much time he squatted in the shade of trees , patting the ground with his hand , evidentlysinging . More time he spent hunting lizards , turtles , dove squabs , and other nestlings  --  for he was a gross feeder.  |p93He  made many trips to water and slept through the heat of the day . As for arms , he carried a short , thick bow and many arrows , whose imprint lay in the dust at several places . He had no rifle . In an hour and a half Havek and South Boy ranged the whole territory the Piute had covered in two days of crisscross meandering . Back at the place where they first crossed his trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exasperated silence . I'hirty seconds later Havek exploded . " No man acts like that  --  ever ! " South Boy said , " All this must have been done to fool somebody . I do n't like it . " They were oozing sweat and were exhausted ; so they returned to the place where they had left their warbags to rest and puzzle over the mystery . The horses were asleep under the tree where they had first seen them . South Boy said : " Let them be . They 'll stay until the wind rises . " Still playing the game of hide-the-gun , South Boy palmed it cleverly when he stripped and hid it under his clothes . Then he dived into the water and floated a bit , then dived again and swam deep , where it was wonderfully cool . After that he drank , climbed out on the mud shelf , and went to sleep . An hour later South Boy woke up with a start , and found himself sitting up , listening , his body running with sweat . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gusty afternoon breeze had begun . He thought , Could that Piute have backtracked ? He raised his eyes to the level of the bank . The ponies were still lying under the mesquite across the clearing . Not likely they 'd lie quiet if they smelt the man who had been chasing them , but South Boy heaved himself up on the bank , took his bow and arrows , and went on a still hunt . No sign of the enemy . So he came back , took a handful of mesquite beans from his bag , let himself down into the water where he lay floating , chewing beans , and puzzling over the Piute . Havek opened his eyes in sleepy inquiry . South Boy shook his head assuringly , then climbed back on the shelf , and went to sleep . Two hours later , and the sun was low , when he woke up the second time . Havek was sitting on the bank looking down at him . There was excitement and alarm in his eyes . " That is a crazy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing he does is proper . " South Boy sat up . " Bad crazy ? " " Surely , surely , " said Havek , switching to Mojave . " Otherwisehis people would not have sent him away with two packponiespainted like war horses . Look at that mare once ! " South Boy looked over the bank and saw that Havek had caught the Piute 's mare , washed her clean of mud and paint , plastered fresh mud over the lion scratch on her ribs and tied her to a willow tree . There she was munching contentedly on some mesquite beans Havek had gathered for her . " A squaw 's pack pony , " said South Boy . " I never noticed that when I saw her across the clearing . A Navajo , too . " Navajos had notoriously poor horses . Piutes were always accredited with having good ones . For fifty years they had raided ranches and missions in California , and they made a practice of keeping the biggest and best of their loot and eatingthe scrubs . Now , fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . The Navajos stole their horses in New Mexico where they were poor to start with . They sold or lost the best of them to the Utes , and let the scrubs breed . This mare was potbellied , ewe-necked , and hardly more than thirteen hands high . The stallion , who was still free , stood half asleep under the cottonwood , a few yards away . He might have been three inches taller , but he was of the same sorry breed.  | " A woman 's horse , used to being caught by naked children . Naked , I walked right up to her and took hold of the broken rope . " " Stolen from the Navajo for camp work , " mused South Boy . " Well  --  I still do n't see why he 'd paint ' em up and ride ' cm way down here . " " Crazy ! " said Havek . " When a man goes crazy his people know that pretty Jon nobody will be safe from him . But they tell each other : He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let strangers do it . ' So they send him away . Do you remember the San Carlos man ? " South Boy remembered . There had been other roving homicidalmaniacs in the recent past , but the San Carlos Apache had left a trail of horror that overshadowed the rest of them . For two weeks every Mojave , every Yavapai , Chemehuevi , Mexican , white man , and hound dog , between the Hassayampa and the Colorado were on the lookout for him . South Boy himself spent almost every daylight hour watching from the top of the tallest tree on the ranch and listening for the cry of alarm to come from up or down the valley . The San Carlos man had killed seven people before he was hunted down , includingtwo wretched women whom he had abducted and then chopped to pieces when they could n't keep up with the pace he traveled . South Boy still got sick when he heard the Mojave women detail those killings . " Rope me that stallion . We better ride , " said Havek . South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake rope he had retrieved at the Piute 's camp , and bent a honda on the stake end . So the trail led him from menace to mystery to menace again . Of course , the menace was different now that he knew he had a crazy man to deal with rather than a war party . Now there was no " lift " to it . No exultation , just a sort of horror underneath and a numb anger brought about by the memory of the San Carlos man . The trail was leading him to a kind of varmint hunt . South Boy had the feeling he would rather be hunting a rattlesnake . The little stallion made a sorry show of snorting and rearing , but there was no real fight in it . Havek came over and took charge of the horse . Havek was obviously nervous and eager to get going , but he was n't going to ride that horse until he had washed off any possible Piute pollution . He led him away to a low place in the bank . South Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string of his war bag , took his bow and arrows , and untied the mare . He did n't bother with any sort of bridle  --  just looped the broken stake rope around her neck to get it out of the way , jumped onto her back , clamped his knees on her barrel , and whacked her rump with his bow . He figured she 'd knee-steer , and she did . Up-river he went , along the edge of the bank brush , whackingthe mare into a lope . The sun was low and the wind was up ; the way lay mostly in the half-shade , and the mare went willinglyenough . When he came to the Piute 's outbound trail , he let her slack down to a running walk . This ought to be a simple business , he thought . That 's a fool 's trail . Then he remembered that the San Carlos man had left a fool 's trail , but when the hunt grew hot he covered it with superhuman cunning and did such daring , unpredictable , unheard-of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in circles , getting nowhere until the cry of alarm brought them to the scene of his next murder . A few minutes later Havek came pounding up . The stallion was still wet . Havek had tied the free end of the rope to its jaw after the manner of a war-bridle . He tried to take the lead , but the stallion would only follow the mare . By and by the trail showed the Piute had broken into a trot . Havek pointed down to the widened span between the moccasin track and howled . " See ! Here he thought of women.  |p97Ile  is hurrying to get around the head of this lagoon and then double back into the valley and steal a woman ! " Thereafter Havek named all the Piute 's relatives that might be dead . South Boy whacked the mare . When they reached the head of the lagoon they knew , whatever the Piute had on his mind , it was n't women . The trail led straight ahead , towards Hardyville . " No , he 's thinking about killing White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one remaining inhabitant of the town that had been , before the railroads were built , a river port and the head of steamboat navigation on the Colorado . South Boy kicked his mare into a run . White Whiskers was an old man , a very tough , crafty , wise , ingenious old man who had made an oasis in the wilderness singlehanded  --  but there was no doubt that age had slowed him up . He could n't run fast or dodge quickly . He would be cold meat for the crazy man 's arrows if he did n't happen to have a gun handy . Ten minutes later the mare ran into the Hardyville clearing at the very head of the Mojave valley , where the river runs out of a cut through the mesa . Up on the mesa rim was a sheetironbuilding  --  an abandoned stamp mill . Down on the flat was a scattering of old adobe walls in various stages of dissolution . Right in the midst of this desolation was White Whiskers ' patch of varied green  --  fig trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neat rows , around a house and corral with a haystack in it . " A real white man 's layout , " the Foreman called it . There was an old barge tied up to the river bank . It had once been a ferry . Now it bore a great rattletrap of a water wheel , made from willow poles and lard cans , that revolved with the current and poured an intermittentstream into the high , rickety flume that filled White Whiskers ' irrigation ditch . For once in his life South Boy did n't stop to marvel at the water wheel . He did n't even see it . There was a man lying stretched out under the biggest fig tree , right by the main ditch . There was a dog beside him . South Boy 's heart jumped . The man had no beard . The man on the ground was his old friend , the Mormonhater.  |p99THE  MORMONHATERThe MORMONHATER lay as still as still , flat on his back , one knee tip and his head close to the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at South Boy with deep , sad , bloodshot eyes , but the Mormonhater did n't move . His weather-beaten , sun-wrinkled face was entirely placid , but its normal mahogany color had faded to the sickly hue of new iron rust . He was dressed in his seldom-worn summer best  --  a soft t hire shirt , spotlessly clean , a pair of white duck pants , clean but wrinkled . One leg was rolled up to the knee that was upright . On the lean bare foreleg there was a white bandage stained with dark blood . Through South Boy 's mind ran the lament the Foreman often sang : As I was walking the streets of La-redoAs I was walking in La-redo one dayI saw a pore cowboy laid out in white linenLaid out in white linen , as cold as the clay . The old hound raised his nose to the sky and bayed dismally , and South Boy buried his head in his hands and sobbed . Then a voice said , " Shut up , you no-good , stone-deef bastard ! " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jumped back , and would have run , but he saw the old hound 's tail was thumping the ground as he gazed adoringly into the Mormonhater 's still face . " He ai n't dead ? " South Boy whispered . " No , but I will be if I do n't get kea-weed to make up the blood I lost , " said the Mormonhater . " Cook me meat and kea.  | If I pass out again , pry my mouth open and make me drink the broth . " South Boy stood shifting his weight from one foot to the other for a few seconds , his mouth full of questions that could hardly wait . " Kea , " croaked the Mormonhater , and South Boy ran to the house for a kettle and meat . He pulled up to a dead stop on the threshold and peered inside , accustoming his eyes to the semidarkness . Where was White Whiskers ? Maybe he lay dead in there . As his eyes dilated he saw a blotch of blood in the middle of the adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling bodies . Against one wall was a broken chair . Near the door was the long-barreled , single-shot , twenty-twocalibertarget pistol that the Mormonhater used to kill trapped animals and small game , likewise broken . In the farther right-hand corner of the room was a bed . The blanket and the one pillow on it were neither bloodstainednor much disturbed ; so the Piute had n't attacked him in bed , even though the deaf hound had failed to give warning . The place reeked with chloroform . Near the foot of the bed stood a quart bottle , all covered with bloody finger marks , as was the torn half of an old white shirt from which the Mormonhater had made his bandages . Near by was the gunny sack that held his spare clothes , its contents partly spilled out on the floor . South Boy stood some thirty seconds , seeing all these things , " reading the story from the sign , " after the manner of an Indian : reading how the Mormonhater had jumped out of bed and fought the crazy Piute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to his hand . Considering the old trapper 's age and size  --  he was no taller than South Boy and certainly no heavier  --  and the probable size of the sturdy , duck-legged Indian who made the surprise attack , the Mormonhaterhad done himself proud.  | " A Great Thing , " muttered South Boy in awe . " A Great l hing ! " Somehow the Piute had been beaten off . The old man then bandaged his wound , soaked the bandage in chloroform against the ever-present danger of screw-fly blow , dressed himself in his best clothes , in case he should die , and crawled out to the fig tree where there was shade and water . But what had happened to White Whiskers ? South Boy ran through the room and into the lean-to kitchen rather expecting to find the old nester 's body there ; tit the kitchen was empty and undisturbed . He snatched a et-tie from a nail behind the stove , seized a handful of jerky rem the meat bin , and ran for the open air , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out among the grapevines he found the kea green-leafed , with fleshy blood-red stems  --  growing rank and knee-high . He ( ordered if it was the red stems that gave the Mormonhater he idea that it was a blood-builder . No one else gave it that irtue , though both Mojaves and whites ate it occasionally . " One thing I do know . White Whiskers ai n't here , and it 's cinch he ai n't been for some time , or these weeds would n't c this big . " White Whiskers was a careful cultivator . The Mormonhater was n't . He cherished the notion , common among orthern Indians but foreign to Mojave thinking , that field ork was women 's work. %South Boy ran back to the fig tree , fetched wood , and built is cook fire by the ditch . The Mormonhater had n't moved . He saw now that there were bruises on his chest . His color k is ghastly. south Boy began feeling alone and afraid again . No leg beyond would make him look that sick , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruises ? Maybe it hides a belly wound that does n't bleed ? He was feeling very much Indian and began to shiver with the panic that besets an Indianhen he finds himself all alone with the dead . He wanted to howl , but wanted a friend to howl with him . Then he wanted to run . Then he saw the hound lying still by the old man , snoringpeacefully , and somehow that quieted him . He knew , though , that he must find something to do while he waited for the pot to boil , or thoughts might come out of the back of his head and drive him wild . Remembering his gun and the numerous wettings it had received , he went around to the tool-shed back of the house and found a can of skunk grease  --  the Mormonhater 's sovereign lubricant . He wiped and greased the gun and each of the cartridges , shook the cartridges dubiously , tried the action of the gun , greased it again and thrust it back into his pants . The kettle was just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without visible or audible signs of life , and the hound snored mightily . The sun had gone down into Nevada . South Boy , eager to keep busy , remembered the lionscratch on the mare 's ribs . He ran to the house , found a box of pine tar in the kitchen and with that and the bloodstained bottle from the foot o the bed he went through the grapevines to the hayfield when the horses were grazing in a good stand of volunteer , second crop oats that was just yellowing . The mare made little objection when he led her to the ditch and washed the mud out the scratch and looked diligently for screw-fly larvae . The screw fly lays her eggs only in fresh , bleeding wounds for her maggots thrive only in sound , living flesh . There we none in the scratch that he could see , but South Boy said himself , " I 'll take no chances in this kind of weather , " an uncorked the bottle of chloroform . He got a whiff of it before he poured it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger yet when he sloshed i over the scratch . After that he had his hands full , for the stin of the medicine suddenly turned the mare into a kicking , biting fury . He hung onto the rope and let her fight it out , little realizing that he had aroused in her the dogged mustang hatep103that was to cause him so much trouble the next day . He just clung to the rope until he could pull her head around and slap a protective gob of tar over the scratch . " Damn ! " he said when he got another overpowering whiff s he corked the bottle . " That 's no one-in-five solution . That 's he pure quill ! " l le walked back to the fire in the last of the short twilight . strong , steady breeze had sprung up from the south , and the Id hound was sitting up exploring it with his nose . South by stopped in his tracks and began swearing to himself , slowly and bitterly , after the manner of the Foreman . " The damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I le went over and shook the Mormonhater none too gently . Hey ! Wake up ! " " Where 's the kea ? " asked the old man . " Wait till it 's ready . Say , why did n't you dilute that chloroform ? You ought a know the pure stuff would make you sick hen you slapped it around so free . " " Look , " said the Mormonhater . " I was bleeding to death . I ever had a leg bleed so bad in my life . I had to get it bandaged ml doctored in a hurry . Anyhow that bottle belongs to White ' hiskers . How in hell was I to know how strong it was ? ' here 's that kea ? I want my blood built back . " South Boy gave a long slow " Ca-a-a-aw ! " expressive ofinfinite disgust , and went slowly towards the house to fetch at ing tools . He had worked himself into a high pitch of pity d horror over the old man , and now he felt badly let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fuss over nothing . " " See if that son of a bitch got away with my new Winchester , " the Mormonhater called after him . " I forgot tolook . " South Boy came back with the Winchester under his armend cups and tin plates in his hands . " It was down on the floorhind the bed , " he said , and handed the rifle to the old man . " Yeh . It was n't in the corner when I reached for it . MustpI04 have slipped down . " He jacked open the chamber , felt to see if it was loaded , then lovingly laid the weapon across his lap . " Seems like you was mighty careless , " said South Boy , morosely picking his sometime hero to pieces . " The Piute got away with the old Springfield and your bullet bag . They ai n't in there any place . " The Mormonhater nodded complacently . " Yeh . They was right by the door . He must have snatched them up when he ran out  --  after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " That 's swell ! Havek 's out there trailing him alone . H wo n't be looking for him to have no rifle , because the sigh back there in the flat did n't read no rifle . He 'll get bush whacked , sure ! " The Mormonhater said : " Ease your mind and get me som kea . The boy 's all right . " South Boy scratched at the rash that heat and sweat ha raised on his back and belly , his brooding eyes on the northe horizon over which played a fitful light . There was a lightning storm up there , below the curve of the world and too f away for the sound of the thunder to carry . " I 'd have be up there with him , but I thought you was real bad hurt . " An he dipped up a cup of broth and kea . The Mormonhater took the cup and sipped eagerly . " Good I can feel my blood building up already . " " It 's Havek 's blood that 's bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plateful of meat and greens and s glowering  --  waiting for it to get cool enough for his finge " I 'd worry worse , but I think small of this Piute . Knifing a m in the leg . That 's a silly business . " " Do n't think he was n't trying to do better ! " said the Mor monhater with some heat . " I just moved too fast for him . " South Boy began eating . The meat and greens tasted goo but they burnt his mouth . The world seemed very black , fo the fire had died down to a bed of ash-covered coals and therep105was no moon yet . The stars were few and pale , giving less light than the flickering glow in the north . The breeze came ti hot , fitful gusts . The creak and groan of the water wheel'as a wail of pain and a cry of warning , and the talk of the big iver was uneasy , quarrelsome , alarming . Even the chatter of he ditchwater was nerve-rasping . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted , his belligerency rising . Instead of answering , the Mormonhater gave vent to a loud of scurrilous invectives against the absent WhiteWhiskers and launched into the tale of how it happened that his hard-working stay-at-home had been gone all summer. with Boy listened in spite of anxiety , impatience , and anger , or the Mormonhater was a skillful story-teller . He told in full detail how he had brought his boat up-river just before the June flood to take White Whiskers on their nnual wild-beef hunt . As soon as the river flooded the bottom land , driving the wild cattle into a limited area of higher ound east of Wild Cow lagoon , the two of them rowed over there and killed enough beef for their year 's supply of jerky. nd while they were drying the meat , White Whiskers remembered that he had n't eaten venison in years . The nearest deer hunting that was accessible by boat was'u hundred miles downstream at Moon Mountain Slough , ml the Mormonhater refused to make any such journey init weather . But in a moment of weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger dogs with the strict understanding that White Whiskers was to come back in July , when the flood subsided and the coming of intermittent south winds would fill the boat 's tarpaulin sail and make uprivernavigation possible . " And here it is two days short of September , and I 'm still muck here , working my fingers to the bone taking care of his damn truck patch , " the old man concluded . P106South Boy said : " Yeh . From the size of the weeds you must have been working yourself to death . And listen to the water wheel ! Did n't you ever try greasing it ? " The Mormonhater paid no heed to him but went on blackguardingWhite Whiskers . " He 's probably laying up with some Mexican squaw in Ehrenburg . " " He 's probably laying up alongside the bank some place waiting for a south wind . There ai n't been a good south win all this summer , and you know it , " said South Boy . The Mormonhater said nothing for a long time . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Damn me for a muttonhead ! I had three chances to kill him and ' did n't ! " " White Whiskers ! " cried South Boy , aghast and furious . " No , you idjit . The Piute . But if I did kill him I 'd have ha to bury him , and it was just too damn hot . " He launched into another story . How , at dusk , three day before , the Piute had appeared at the edge of the clearing ridingone painted pony and leading the other . The Mormonhater was sitting in the doorway of the house , the old Springfiel across his knees , for he 'd heard a coyote in the brush . He sti used the Springfield against such varmints because its reloa cartridges cost much less than store-bought ammunition f o the Winchester . The Piute gazed at the rifle with eager eyes and offered , i passable Spanish , to trade a horse for it . The Mormonhater rejected the offer in the Piute 's o tongue . Whereupon the Piute retreated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chemehuevi wit his medicine horses to lead them in a general massacre of th Mojaves and the whites . " I could have got him easy , but I figgered that the Cheme huevis would knock him on the head and throw him into th river for his crazy talk . " " He never got to the Chemehuevi , " said South Boy , watch-P107mg the flickering lights in the north and worrying about Havek . The old man nodded . " I know . Yesterday I saw him scoutingaround afoot . I had a couple of more chances to down him , but it was still too hot for grave-digging . I figgered the dog and me could keep him off . I did n't know the dog had got so ( led . I did n't know another thing I know now : the smell of t hat Piute , and the words he said when the dog finally did take hold of him . " The Mormonhater looked very solemn , as though what he said was very important ; but he failed to impress South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . He 's easy meat fur a bushwhacker . I ought a high-tail up there and see what 's happened to him . " " Quit worryin ' about the Mojave , " said the Mormonhater . " I le 'll be here . " " He 'll be here ! He 'll be here ! " South Boy mocked savagely . " When ? How soon ? And how in hell do you know , any-way ? " " The sign says it . " South Boy stood up trying to see the old man 's face , but it was nearly pitch-dark under the tree . So he went and moved the kettle to one side and put two sticks on the embers . When they had blazed enough to give considerable light heasked back and again tried to see what was on the upturned face , but the fire cast heavy , restless , uncertain lights and shadows across it . " What sign ? " he asked . " Nothing you can read , " said the Mormonhater . " All right , " said South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havek 's riding back ? Name it , and tell me where I miss seeing it . " The Mormonhater would n't answer , and when South Boy kept insisting he made the buzzing sound down in his throat that an old Indian makes when he does n't want to answer a question .   If the old man had been an Indian , South Boy would have said nothing more ; but the Mormonhater was supposed to he a white man , and so South Boy , peevish from the heat , front worry , and from a long , hard day , insisted on a logical answer Getting none at all , he finally said : " Tell me . Are you a far seer  --  like some Mojave old man ? If you are , I wo n't ask any thing more about it . But if you are reading sign that I shoul see I want to know ! " The Mormonhater just looked up into the fig tree . The hair on the back of South Boy 's neck prickled wi anger . He always makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he hung onto his temper for the time bein and remained silent . Then the Mormonhater said with slow emphasis , " Tha Piute had the smell of a witch about him . " He used the wor " witch " to indicate a sorcerer of either sex , as an Indian do when he speaks English . South Boy pulled his knees up under his chin and waited fo three or four sullen minutes before he said , " Crazy people wo n't wash ; so they smell bad . " " A witch , and the worst kind of a witch , " said the old ma " For a he-witch is worse than a she-witch , and a Piute witc is worse than any other kind , worse even than a Zuni . H spoke a curse and a warning when he ran away last night . H said he had the power of world-blasting . " South Boy said , " Caw ! " derisively . The Mormonhater gave him a hard look . " Go over to th south side of the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been saving for a hoe handle . Fete it . I want to walk about a bit . " South Boy got up and went to get the stick , saying sullenly " You try using a stick on me , and you sure as hell won ' prosper . " The Mormonhater had used a stick on him befor but that was in a good cause and South Boy never resented itWhen he came back the Mormonhater took the stick , hoppep109over to the kettle and drank a dipperful of broth , and hopped back and sat down . " You should listen and learn , because you might need to know . " He leaned back and looked up , as though he might be earnestly contemplating some star shining through a gap in the fig leaves . " Now you , being white-raised and Mojave-raised , do n't know nothing about witches . You probablythink they are something like Mojave doctors . ' That 's not so , at all . " A witch and a doctor , they 're different things . A doctor ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dynamite or whisky . They 're bad only when they 're used bad . Sometimes a doctor goes sour on the world , and he uses his powers to kill people or to make floods instead of curing people or making good rains . But a witch 's powers is bad to start with . They 're for death and destruction , and nothing else . " Them that use them are to be destroyed ! " he emphasized each of those words by a thump on the ground with his stick . South Boy said , " Caw ! " again . " Witches is poor-trash business . " To him witches pertained to inferior people  --  foreign Indians , Mexicans , poor whites , and negroes . People of consequence , either white or Mojave , did n't believe in them or had no truck with them . " That 's right , " said the Mormonhater . " Only the poor , the trod-on , the half-starved , the desperate , and the crazy take to witching . But that do n't make them less dangerous because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The Piutes have so many witches because the other Indians shoved them back into the desert where they had to eat lizards and crickets and bush rats and weed tops or starve . When the Spaniards came to New Mexico living got a little bit easier for t Ite Piutes because they learned to steal each other 's children and trade them to the Spaniards for horses . Then the Spaniards came to California , which was closer , and the Piutes learned to steal horses and lived pretty good . " Then the Americans came and stopped the horse stealing and the slave trading , and they was shoved back some more and trod on some more , and starved some more . " Now you take this man : I can tell by his talk that he comes from the little bunch of Piutes that has always wandered around among the Navajo like gypsies do among white people , pickingup a living the best they can . I tell by his talk he was a lone traveler for some time , visiting many tribes . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the Ghos Dance religion out among the tribes about ten-fifteen yeaback . " Ghost dancing was supposed to bring all the dead India back to life . All it did was to get a lot more Indians killed . ) ( + think when ghost dancing failed , this Piute went crazy ands took up witching . Must have picked up with an old Hopi witch woman sometime , because he used a Hopi witching curse among the rest . " The Mormonhater stopped for breat " What I want to know is , are you a farseer or not ? " said South Boy . " What you need to know is that when the dog took hold of the Piute his liver turned green , and he ran away to mak world's-end medicine . That 's why he 's got to be killed ! " " Will you give me an answer ? Are you a farseer ? " " Well , if I was , would I tell you ! " roared the old man . " I ca n't ease my mind about Havek till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or just guessing . The Mormonhater began cursing in English , loudly a first . Then the strength of his voice diminished until it w no more than a whisper . " But you got to pay heed to me . " I was a plea rather than a command . " The Piute is a witch , an he has world 's end in his heart and he must be destroyed , lilt it says in the Bible . He got away with my Bible , too . It 's i the bullet bag . I want to get it back . There is certain medicin I must make . " South Boy began laughing without mirth . " You 're a grew one to talk about what it says in the Bible . What does it sapIIIin Tom Paine 's book , or Bob Ingersoll 's ? ' You up and tell me . My mother is ruining my mind by filling me full of Bible superstition and you give me Ingersoll to read and now you tell me to believe the most superstitious thing in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was schoolboy slang for a flighty , inconsistent person , and a very bad thing to call a ratan . The Mormonhater barked , " Mind your tongue ! " By this time South Boy 's temper had stewed too long in the heat , and it broke into a boil . " You harp about me being fed on Bible superstition , and t hen last year , when there was that earthquake , what did you do ? You ran your boat up to the head of Mesquite Slough , and there you stayed two weeks , yelling and preaching and Bible-reading . You thought there were n't nobody but your dogs to hear you , but Mojaves lay in the brush and listened and told me about it . " The Mormonhater said nothing and kept his face so hidden in the shadow that South Boy could n't even have the satisfaction of knowing how angry he was . " Cohiva-michiva , " he said again . " One thing one time , another thing another time . " And he picked up his bow and arrows and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many ways in which the Mormonhater had proven himself to be an inconsistent person . The Mormonhater prided himself on telling the truth . He said his word was good from the Yaqui country to the Big Canyons , and his word was good in most matters . But about his own birth and early life he was as full of lies as a melon is full of seeds . He said that he was one of the children who survivedthe Mountain Meadow massacre up by the headwaters of the Virgin River in 18S7 . He also claimed that he had raided the Mission San Luis Obispo with Pegleg Smith on the memorable occasion when Pegleg and his thirty-six Shoshone brothers-in-law stole three thousand horses . As the oldest ofPI I 2 the Mountain Meadow survivors was no more than four or five and the San Luis Obispo raid took place some twenty years before the massacre , the Mormonhater was convicted of lying by his own mouth . Likewise the Mormonhater prided himself on being a reasonable man who would listen to any and all sides of a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this was true enough on any subject on which his prejudices were not aroused . He was the best wolfer and coyote trapper in the Southwest ; yet he would listen to anybody 's theory on the habits of a coyote , no matter how outlandish and full of obvious errors it might be , for he said , " I kin never know so much but what some fool might teach me a little more . " But if a man made an obviously true statement that touched one of his prejudices , such as , " The Mormons are good farmers  --  wherever they settle , they make the desert bloom , " the Mormonhater would fly into a rage and stomp away sputtering obscenities . If he brought up the subject of the Mormons himself , he invariably began making wild , ludicrous statements . One was : " Mormons never go barefoot . They do n't want people to see they got goats ' hoofs . " He said that once to a crowd of idlers in front of Monnehan and Murphy 's store in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , normal feet and said he was a Mormon and the son of a Mormon , and he was going to prove his feet were good , solid , human flesh by kicking a dirty liar 's butt up over his belt . The Mormonhater ran . He ran to the river just two jumps ahead of the stranger 's big feet , leaped into his boat , and shoved off ; and for a year afterward he never appeared in Needles . Strange to say , although he had proven his strength and courage many times and although he swore that his life was devoted to a perpetual feud against all Mormons , he ran awayP113every time one of them confronted him . The man who ran him out of Needles said that this was because the trapper was a Jack-Mormon , an apostate who had come to hate his own kind but could n't make himself raise a hand against one of them . Cohiva-michiva , surely , thought South Boy . He had wanderednorth up the trail until he found a saw-cut cottonwood stump by a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping sweat from his face and scratching himself until his annoyance slowly oozed away . By and by he remembered that the Mormonhater had always been a generous friend and a wise teacher . True , his teaching methods were not exactly in accord with modern pedagogy . He taught South Boy to shoot with the old Springfield , a number of tin cans , and a willow switch . The cans had a large red tomato in the center of each label . I f South Boy shot high , the switch would cut across his legs with a stinging crack and the Mormonhater would shriek : " Notch it ! Notch it , you blind idjit ! You got to see a leetle of that foresight ! " If he shot to the right or the left the old man would slash at his legs with extra fury . " Damn your sunken , coal-black soul ! Hold that gun squa-are ! Are you trying to miss ? " When he did hit the tomato , the stick did n't fall . The Mormonhateronly muttered , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomatoes in a row , the old man fished in his pocket and produced a shiny dime  --  probably the only coin lie had in the world , for he seldom had any money . His business with the traders , in hides , furs , wild honey , and placer gold  --  gleaned color by color from old worn-out diggings  --  was conducted almost entirely on the barter basis . " Buy yourself a short-bit 's worth of toothache the next time you go to the Fort , " he said , in way of reward . The effectiveness of this method was proven by the factpII4that South Boy shot with the grown men at the last Fourth of July matches . The Mormonhater was clean in his personal habits , in spite of the fact that more than half the year he lived in a greasy old flat-bottom rowboat with three dogs , rusty traps , bilge water , stinking hides , bottles and cans of skunk grease and snake oil , and all the bloody refuse of killing and skinning . He was clean in his mind , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessly and unconsciously as the little geysers of the Salton Sink spout mud . It occurred to South Boy that it was the nature of all white men to be inconsistent . He had heard that from the Indians many times . Take the Foreman , for instance . On rare occasions , usually when he was drunk , he was all roaring good humor , the funniest , jolliest man in Arizona . Then for days he 'd either be full of whining , complaining curses or sullen , dangerous silence . When he was in the latter mood , nobody dared to speak to him except South Boy 's father , who was just as big as the Foreman , and just as gloomy , and never feared anybody or anything . There were days when the Foreman would devote hours of his time , patiently and without hope or desire of reward , to teaching South Boy " what 's needed to make a good man . " In fact he was more patient than the Mormonhater , more given to careful , if somewhat long-winded , explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fighting , rope handling , colt breaking , trail driving , or packing , he drilled South Boy until he was letter-perfect in theory and sufficiently able in practice , without losing his temper or raising his voice . Then there were days when he would not speak to the boy at all and glared murderously out of cold gray eyes when spoken to . Again he would start to rave out of all reason , cursing Fate for dealing him " three dirty deuces from the bottom of the deck " : a Mexican hay bag for a wife , a life in exile , and a thirst for hard liquor . P115The moon came up angry and red and paled the flickering in the north until it was hardly visible . His mind still in a ferment , South Boy was thinking that there was one great difference between the Foreman and the Mormonhater . Drunk , sober , laughing or sullen , kind or murderous , the Foreman was Always the Foreman ; but the Mormonhater  --  when he talked Mojave he was Mojave in thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he talked Mexican he was Mexican . When he preached Tom Paine and Bob Ingersoll , he was a freethinker , and when he got one of his religious streaks he was a back-country exhorter full of zeal and the fear of hell fire . " It is he who is cohiva-michiva indeed . He is too many men , " said South Boy . Then the thought came to him : " How many men am I ? How many times have I changed from thinking llojave to thinking white this past day ? What am I but cohivanaichivamyself ? " And he began feeling very scared and humble , for his anger had burnt itself out , leaving him weak , sweat-sodden and very miserable . Just when he had dropped to the very depth of misery there came a far sound , muffled by the hot , thick air . He stood up on the stump to listen . It came louder and louder and his heart began beating fast , for it was a strong , full voice , still far off , singing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight into the shadow by the tree with his bow across his back , his arrows in his belt and a threefootpiece of mesquite wood about as thick as a man 's arm swinging in his hand . He slid off his horse , laid his bow and arrows on the ground , sat down , pulled his big clasp knife our of his pocket , and immediately set to work whittling on the mesquite stick . " So you left him alive ! " said the Mormonhater in disgust . Havek said nothing . South Boy , who ran at the horse 's head , slipped the war bridle off its jaw and bent the rope around its neck . The horse had been a-lather , but it was dry now . So Havek had ridden hard up-river and then come back slowly . " Where is he ? " asked the Mormonhater sharply . Havek raised his head and pointed north with his chin . He went on whittling at the mesquite stick as though his life depended upon it . " God damn this leg ! " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " After that he said nothing , but watched Havek with keen speculation . South Boy led Havek 's horse through the grapevines and then turned him loose and watched him go nickering off to join the mare in the hayfield . He went to the kettle and dished out a plate of meat and greens and set it by Havek , who paid no attention to it . He was whittling with fury and a kind of exultation . South Boy took one look at what he was doing , picked up his bow and arrows , and trotted off across the field to the ruined houses , where he stirred in an old rubbish heap pI17two or three times with his bow to scare out any sidewinder , scorpion , black-widow spider , or other night varmint , then picked up several pieces of bottle glass and trotted back to the tire with them . There he sat opposite Havek and waited , wideeyedwith excitement . Havek had already roughed out a club that was something like a ball bat . South Boy picked out a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three minutes Havek suddenly thrust the club at South Boy . He seized it and immediately scraped off long , thin shavings . Havek 's hand dipped into the plate and shoved a dripping handful of its contents into his mouth . " We wo n't get a word out of him now , " said the Mormonhater . " What 's the need ? " asked South Boy . " You know what happened . If you do n't , I 'll tell you . Havek trailed the Piute fast-like until the trail got hot . Then he trailed him slow and cautious-like . Then he found the place where he stopped . Then he scouted all around . Then he came back slow-like . I lc said to himself : I 'll make me a club . Tomorrow I 'll do a Great Thing when South Boy 's there to see it . ' " South Boy looked at Havek , and Havek gulped and nodded . The old man said : " I could have told you that , and I 'll tell you some more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's driftwood near where a thick crop of this year 's willows covers the whole sand bar from the foot of the cliff to the river . Ai n't it so ? " Havek looked owl-eyed with surprise . " But what I want to know  --  has he laid a small fire on a flat rock , and what does his medicine bag look like ? " Havek shook his head . He picked up a piece of glass and reached for his club . " Yah ! " spat the Mormonhater . " You do n't know . And you lay there on top of the driftwood and looked right at him . Why did n't you shoot him while you had the chance ? That 's Mojave silliness for you . There 's a man that may be the death of us all , but you let him live because you got your mind set on makin ' a show . It 's like a man who sees a great big snake . He 's got a gun on him , but he do n't use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I 'll make a big hero of myself by killin ' you with a little stick . ' " " That 's a white man talking , " said South Boy in Mojave . There was a long spell of stifling silence , punctuated by the scraping of wood , the murmur of the water in the ditch , the talk of the river , and the squeak and splash of the water wheel , all of which were cheerful sounds , now . The Mormonhater said , " Oh , Lord , how can I make these fools listen ? " He began singing to himself in a language South Boy could not understand . Neither South Boy nor Havek paid it much attention , for they were absorbed with the sight and feel of the club that was taking shape under their hands . By and by the old man stopped singing , and Havek began chanting a song of his own : " I 'll strike this wayI 'll strike that way I 'll break his skullI 'll scatter his brains . " South Boy could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of each line , by way of refrain . He felt fine ; his hands were busy , wiping the sweat from his face , or feeling over the club for rough spots , or scraping , or putting wood on the fire to make more light , or dipping water from the ditch to drink or pour over himself or Havek . All the while the Mormonhater sat quietly and said nothing . Then when Havek 's song had about worn itself out , he said , " Listen  --  listen ! " in a high voice and began speaking in Mojave in the style and manner of an old man who recites a Great Telling while young men work . He said : " In the years after the Mojave lost many dead in the Pimap119country , after they had killed the white travelers , after they took the cattle , the soldiers came to the valley and rifle balls ripped up the ranks of the clubbers . The soldiers charged the clubbers with their bayonets , and half of all the big men died . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mojave country . There was peace . The Mojaves said , This is the end of the world for us , ' and they cried four years . The old men said : The old way of fighting that made the Mojaves feared from the Rio Grande to the Ocean is no good any more . Nothing that has been good since the First Times is good now . ' " So it was that a man from Shivwits was able to come downriverand set himself up as a doctor on Cottonwood Island , where the Mojaves had two or three rancherias in those days . And the Mojaves took their sick up-river for him to sing over , for in the bitterness of their defeat they held themselves so cheap that they thought even a despised Piute was better than a doctor of their own . " For two years the Piute did well . Then a woman he sang over died from delayed childbirth . And the woman 's brothers said : We 'd kill a doctor of our own for such a matter . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now in the days before the soldiers came the Piutes would have done nothing . But now they knew that half of the Big Men were dead . So the Shivwits sent to the Kaibab and the Paviosto and one or two more Piute bands and said : We 've got rifles and we 've got horses . We can kill Mojaves just like the soldiers did . ' And they came down-river to Cottonwood Island and they killed some Mojave women . " At this place South Boy asked Havek , " Is this a true telling ? " Havek wiped the sweat out of his eyes and said : " Surely . Surely . I heard it before . No old man of The People ever told it better . " The Mormonhater went on . " In the old days the clubbers would have started north before the woman 's ashes were cold , but now the old men held a council and talked for four days . P120Some wanted to go . Others said , If we go to war the soldiers will be offended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piutes have been trading horses for rifles lately . Every Piute has a good rifle , and we have none . Clubs ca n't defeat these new kinds of guns . We know that . ' " So the old men talked and did nothing . " But while they talked some of the young men  --  boys who would have carried straight clubs , like that one , and fought in the rear rank behind the big men  --  they made their own talk . They said , The big men wo n't fight . We 'll make this a smallmenwar . We 'll fight it our own way . Thick bush will be our friend . Darkness will blind bullets . Rough rocks will stop horses . We will fight after the manner of Apaches . So let 's make Apache arrows and go up-river . ' " So the small-men war began . Four young men , who were at the right age to go name-traveling , set out for the Piute country with Apaches ' arrows and small-men clubs , and when they came back they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf-in-the-Brush . The old men were angry and refused to honor such names . They said : You are no better than Apaches or Diggers or coyotes . Any coward can kill and run . ' " But the women and the young men feasted them through the camp , and after that , instead of running naked , a young man took iron arrows with him when he went name-traveling and went up to harry the Piutes , although the old men said : This kind of business will bring neither honor to us nor fear to the enemy . Any kind of war is useless unless it does those two things . ' " As for the Piutes they said : What have we to fear ? The Mojaves do n't fight like Mojaves any more . They fight like ordinary Indians . Once they were grizzly bears . Now they arc little foxes . Let us go down to Cottonwood Island and kill everybody . ' " When the Piutes came down the river this time , Irataba , PI 2 Ithe Great Traveler , the chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . He was a great man . The year before , he had been all the way to Washington by steamboatand by railroad train . He had lived in the White House with President Lincoln for seven days , and he was wearing the army general 's uniform the President had given him . All the Mojaves had seen it except the people on Cottonwood , who lived so far away from everybody . That 's why he went up there . " A boy came down-river crying , One hundred Piutes are coming ! ' Irataba said : Let the men follow me . I 'll go meet t hem . Let the women stay and burn all the crops and granaries and then go down-river for help . ' " With arrows and a few old shotguns they met the Piutes and fought them from willow thicket to willow thicket , retreatinggradually back to Cottonwood Island . Then Irataba found that the women had run away without destroying all the crops . So he told his men to take to the river while he stayed to finish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were afraid to kill him while he wore the soldier 's uniform , so they set about to strip him . But when they had stripped him , they could n't hold him . He threw them off and jumped into the river . And the Piutes were afraid he 'd bring back the soldiers , so they ran tip-river . " The Mojaves talked again , but nothing was decided and nothing was done . The small-men raids went on , and they accomplishednothing . At last some boy killed a Paviosto chief . So the Piute bands all got together and they sent a real army down-river . That was five years after the stripping of Irataba . " At this point the Mormonhater started beating the ground with his stick to give emphasis to his words . " I was here . I saw them come . I drove my mules in here to 1 lardyville . I looked up the river trail up there . " He turned around and pointed up above the old stamp mill , using his handp122and his chin both , Indian-fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cried out . Every door closed . Every door bar fell . Every window showed a rifle muzzle . But the Piutes only came as far as the edge of the mesa and cried , Peace , peace ! Our war is with the Mojaves ! ' and they ran along the rim of the mesa , their shirttails flapping in the wind , their rifle butts trailing , for they had come by the river and left their horses behind . " I went to my house . I was married then to a Mojave of the Chacha clan . She was gone . I went out into the mesquite looking for her , and there , right over there , I found the tracks of many running women . Every white man 's wife had run to tell her people . " The Mormonhater dropped his stick and began pounding his left hand with his right fist . " South I ran on my woman 's trail . Then I heard the long yell  --  old men yelling from the housetops . " The Piutes came down off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right flank skirted the willows . Out of the willows the Mojaves shot arrows and killed one man . I was there . I saw it . The Piutes lay down on their bellies and shot into the willows . The Mojaves were only twenty , but they yelled like a hundred . They lay close to the ground and screamed and sang their death songs . So the Piutes charged the willows , and the Mojaves ran away to the next thicket . " There the Mojaves had a hundred young men lying in ambushand they killed five Piutes . The rest of the Piutes ran back to the mesa yelling , Where are the Mojaves that used to fight in the open ? ' " I ran down to the Fort , and there was Yellow Road ; and he had a hundred big-men clubbers with him , and he had a hundred small men behind him , and he was telling the major : These people up there , they think the Mojaves have turned into coyotes , otherwise they would n't dare come into this val- 3Icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on the mesa and watch us . Let everybody come and watch us , for you 'll see something you 'll never see again . ' " So I went with the soldiers and the traders and the white women , and we stood on a rise of ground and we watched the Mojaves run slowly across the mesa , the big men , the face smashers , stretched out in a long line , the small men , the skull crackers , running behind them . Thus the Mojaves returned to the First Times that day . " There was a sand hill over on the mesa . On top of the sand hill were the Piutes , waiting . " Now the major had a big gold watch . When the clubbers came to the foot of the hill , he pulled the watch out of his pocket and began counting off the minutes . When he counted One ! ' the feet of the clubbers were already in the sand . The Piutes fired one volley and five in the front ranks of the Mojavesfell down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , running with short steps , big feet making sand fly . The Piutes yelled . They were all shooting . Some had repeating rifles , they shot too fast . Some had muzzle loaders , they shot too slow . " The major called Two ! ' The first dubber reached the top of the hill . His hand reached out for the first Piute . His club smashed up into the Piute 's face . I was there . I saw it . The Piute came sailing over the Mojave 's head . He hit the slope of the sand hill and came sliding down pushing the sand before him . Then he slid down by the second rank of Mojaves and a boy with a straight bat reached out and broke his head as he slid on by . " Then the top of the hill was hidden in flying sand . I could see nothing , but the shots were few and the yells were Mojave yells . Then I saw Yellow Road standing out in a cloud of sand waving a shirt to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The major looked at his watch and called out , Three ! ' P124The Mormonhater stopped his telling . Nobody said anything for a minute . Then Havek suddenly hurled his club into the air , gave a short high scream of triumph , like the squall of a fox . He caught the club as it came down , and , laying it on the ground , he lay down beside it , stretched out like a man who is utterly exhausted , and immediately went to sleep . " Well , damn my liver and lights ! " said the Mormonhater . " I should have knowed that would happen . " And he began cursing in a bitter monotone . " What happened ? " asked South Boy . " What happened ? Why , you blind idjit , he went to sleep on me ! " " I mean , What happened after the battle ? " " Oh , the soldiers give the Mojaves a big feed of government beef and  --  Hey , you lay down there and git to sleep , too ! I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to get the Mojave boy 's attention so 's I could tell him how to deal with the witch  --  and he up and went to sleep on me . Well , let it go till morning . And you  --  you sleep ! If'n I see I ca n't depend a on him , I 'll have to depend on you to keep the world together in the morning . " Damn this leg ! " he went on . " It gripes my guts to have t. trust this business to a couple of boys . " South Boy lay down and went to sleep , not because h wanted to , or because the Mormonhater told him to , but b cause he was so tired that he could not sit up any longer . P125HE AWOKE suddenly . The Mormonhater 's stick was rapping a vigorous tattoo on his backside . South Boy cried out angrily and struck at the stick with his hands . The Mormonhater said , " Here , drink this , " and gave him a cup of hot coffee . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw that the moon was already over Nevada . So four hours had gone by , and morning was coming . He shook the sleep out of his eyes and downed the strong coffee . The sweat broke out all over him . " Fetch them horses , and shake it up , " said the Mormonhater . South Boy heaved himself to his feet , stumbled over Havek 's inert body and headed for the river . The air seemed to press down upon him . It stank , and it had weight . He seemed to move heavily against it . It was jungle air , damp and steaming , that had been slowly coming up the Gulf of California and into the valley . South Boy knew that such air only came with the very worst of crazy weather . The river was so cold the shock of it took his breath . Then lie climbed out and pulled on his clothes . Up by the barge that held the complaining water wheel he found the horses . They had just finished drinking . South Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to tie a war bridle on her jaw . She laid her ears back and rolled the whites of her eyes and lashed at him with her teeth . " Damn you , what do you have to go mean for ? I had to doctor you or the screw worms would eat you alive ! " He let her bridle go and tied one on the stallion , who caused no trouble. pI26 On the way back through the grapevines he saw the Mormonhateroutlined against his cook fire , holding onto his stick with one hand , gesturing with the other . Havek stood by , drinking coffee . Coming closer , South Boy saw he had a strange look on his face . It was blank , yet questioning , and there was a hint of awe in it . As soon as the old man saw South Boy he began thumping the ground with his stick and shouted : " Get going ! Get going ! Mind what I say  --  do n't let the sun see him or anything of his ! " Havek set his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said to South Boy : " I ride first , so I ride the mare . I wo n't need my bow , so you carry it ! " " Like hell I will ! " cried South Boy . " Me , jugglin ' two bows in the middle of trouble ? Like hell I will ! " Havek picked up his bow , hung it across his body , stuck his arrows into the back of his belt , tied the end of the lead rope on the mare 's jaw and , grabbing her by the mane , swung onto her back . " And take it easy , " South Boy called after him . " Her belly 's sagging with water , and if you run her right away , you 'll be catching your Piute afoot . " Havek did n't appear to heed him , but he let the mare take her own pace . " Where in hell did I leave my grub bag ? " South Boy demandedof no one in particular . " Never mind your grub bag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done properly you will be back before noon . If it 's not done , you 'll not need any grub . " " But our trail goes north , " said South Boy . " We wo n't be back here . " " You 'll not go north of the witch 's fire , " said the Mormonhaterearnestly . " I know that much . You 'll come back here . Bring me my old rifle and the bullet bag , and by God  --  if you 've done your job I 'll give ' em to you . "  | " O.K. , O.K. , " said South Boy hastily , for there was frenzy in the old man 's face . He picked up his weapons with one hand , holding onto the lead rope with the other  --  for the little stallion was nickering and stomping , eager to follow the mare . " Look into the bullet bag and be sure the Bible is there . It 'll be wrapped in a blue cloth . But do n't touch it ! There 'll be blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back here and git purified . " " O.K. , " said South Boy . The stallion spread , made water , and gave a shrill , blasting neigh . South Boy laid his hand on the horse 's back and jumped . As they headed out on the mare 's trail he heard the old man cry , " World 's End ! " He must have repeated it over and over because a long drawn-out " Wo-orrld'sE-end ! " came to South Boy 's ears some time later . Havek had pulled up the mare and was waiting for him by the old stamp mill . " Does the old man know something , or is he just crazy ? " he asked as soon as South Boy was alongside . " He knows something , certainly . I do n't know how much . I tried to find out for sure if he has the gift of farseeing , but he would n't tell me . What was he telling you ? " " One thing , and another , " said Havek evasively . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines from many people . " " Well , he lived with the Piutes and the Navajos , and White Whiskers told me when he was young he lived with the Mexicansin Santa Fe and even went to school by the big church there . He lived with the Mormons once , and he lived here in this town in the old days with a Mojave woman , as he told us himself . " " If he learned other things as well as he learned Mojave , hemust know a great deal , " said Havek , and he slapped the mare . They rode silently through a silent , steaming , ghastly worldlit by a low , sickly moon with a ring around it . The trail they followed was old , well worn , and rain-rutted . It had been made by pack trains carrying down ore to the stamp mill a long time ago . It had not been used lately . It was a ghost trail running through a ghost country . Even the little greasewood bushes seemed like shadows , with no substance at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little crazy , too , " was Havek 's final comment . Up-river the northern horizon was still pulsating with reflected light . South Boy began listening for thunder , but heard none . By and by he said : " Whether the old man knows anything or not is not important in this business . We have to kill this crazy Piute , anyway . " Havek did not answer . They came to the first big arroyo . The trail went down its south bank like a running snake . Havek seemed to have lost his urge for haste and let the mare pick her way cautiously . South Boy looked past her and down to the arroyo bed , fifty feet below . It was alive with flittering moon shadows , for graywhitekangaroo rats and little jumping mice were dancing on the sand . " Like something out of a fairybook , " said South Boy , half aloud . When they reached the sandy bed there was only the lacework of a thousand little trails where the dancers had been . There Havek left the ore trail and rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been built at the foot of the cliff since last high water . Under a scattering of loose top sand the surface was hard . Havek broke the silence . " We run now ! " He raised his club high overhead and then brought it forward in a sweeping arc as he heeled the mare into a lope . Well , I hope he knows just where the Piute is , thought South Boy . I sure would n't ride so brash if I was leading . But he said nothing . He was beset by a numbing sense of unreality . All this was happening to someone else . He was only a spectator . They rode through young willows that were at times as high as a man 's head and as thick as the hairs on a dog 's back , and atP129times grew sparsely and not more than a foot high . Great piles of gray driftwood loomed up ahead and then vanished like the hulks of passing ships . The moon had sunk behind the cliff on the Nevada side of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They passed through a long stretch where the willows were very high and whipped South Boy 's face . They passed through a patch where the willows had been cut to a stubble like the stubble in a grain field . Here the beavers had been working . South Boy heard the first bat of the morning squeaking overhead , and he knew that the first light was not far away . A gust of wind , smelling hot and wet , came pushing down the canyon . South Boy , thinking in Mojave , said to himself : " We have many things in our favor . We , being Amok Ave  --  people of the Three Mountains  --  riding in the shadow of the greatest of the three Avequami was not in sight , but South Boy knew it was not far behind the Nevada cliff , riding by the place where Mustavilya made his house , through the canyon Mastamho made to wash away his father 's ashes  --  we are on our own ground . The Piute is a trespasser here . And whatever is his cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a hawk-dreamer . " They came to a place where the ground between the river and the cliff was narrow and almost barren . Havek pulled up the mare and rode as close as possible to the wall of the cliff . Overhead , the sky was turning gray and the stars were fading . Havek held up his left hand to feel the wind . South Boy laid one arrow across his bow ; the others , he gripped in his teeth . His heart went thump-thump-thump , slow and hard . Ahead the cliff fell away to the right . The bar was wide and thickly grown with head-high willows . Close under the cliff was a procession of large trees . Havek 's mare started off at an eager amble , skirting the trees . The light was increasing . South Boy , watching ahead , saw the first visible signs of the Piute  --  moccasin tracks around a torn-up rat 's nest . The gust of wind increased , blowing over the little willows in great waves , such as the wind makes in a wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind and the rush and tumble of the river . Ahead was another great pile of driftwood extending more than halfway across the sand bar . Havek raised his club and motioned for South Boy to keep back . South Boy pulled up , and his horse began to dance , for the mare moved on . The arrows he held in his teeth made his jaw ache . Then he saw the Piute appear suddenly at the cliff end of the pile of driftwood . he was short , heavy , and barrel-chested . He wore only his high moccasins , a long filthy undershirt , and a little round , rimless cap that might have been the crown of an old derby . He was infinitely more primitive and animal-like than any man South Boy had ever seen . The old Springfield rifle was at his shoulder . Its barrel swiveled in a short arc from Havek to South Boy , back to Havek . His face was broad , flat , hollow-cheeked , with a broken nose and a mouth like a gash . It was battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grease and wood ashes . Havek 's high , screaming squall rang out , above the river 's noise . The mare leaped , and the club swung up . The Piute 's rifle roared out , its thundering echoes rolling up and down along the wall of the canyon . Havek went flat on his pony 's neck . His club swung low . The Piute 's feet left the ground , the rifle flew out of his hands . The mare made two jumps that carried her ten yards beyond the Piute , then she planted all four feet and Havek went sailing over her head to hit the sand like a sack of rags . As South Boy remembered it afterwards , the fight on the sand bar had neither sense nor continuity . He let fly an arrow and raised the long wail , for he was certain Havek was dead . He jerked on the rope and threw his horse between the PiuteP131and the rifle . But the Piute was gone  --  he had faded in the faint , treacherous light . South Boy found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrow whistled by his ear . His pony , entirely out of control , cut around the drift pile . South Boy clung desperately with his knees , in spite of the fact that he knew he should be on the ground , for his six-foot Mojave bow was no horseman 's weapon . The Piute was running across a strip of beaver slashing , a short bow and short arrows in his hand , a big Mojave arrow sticking in his back . South Boy 's pony was running after him . 1 lavek had come to life and was yelling , " Head him off ! " in English . The Piute dived into the willows like a blackbird diving into a tule bed . Somehow South Boy managed to get an arrow across his bow and let drive at the spot where the crazy man had disappeared . He felt the willows whipping his face . After that all he could do was clamp his knees on the pony 's barrel and ride . The little stallion was hunting the Piute on his own account , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same instinct that keeps a cutting horse on a cow 's trail . Out of nothing loomed a little pile of drift that was almost hidden by the thicket . The pony rose straight up . His neck slapped South Boy in the face . South Boy 's mouth flew open . When he closed it he realized his arrows were gone . It was in South Boy 's mind to slide down and hunt arrows , but his horse still hunted the Piute , dodging around the drift and hurrying frantically through the whipping willows . As soon as he discovered he had lost his quarry he ran straight ahead and broke out onto the open sand bar . The light was increasing rapidly . South Boy heard the Piute  --  then he saw him , about a hundred and fifty yards away , jumping up and down like an angry monkey , and shrieking , P132not at South Boy , but at Havek , who from somewhere out in the gray gloom , was shooting arrows at him . The pony wheeled in his tracks and made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait ! I got to get arrows ! " But the pony bore down on the crazy man . There was nothing South Boy could do but ride . He was quite close when he realized that the Piute was out of arrows , too . The Indian was facing him now , standing with his feet apart and his knees sprung , ready to jump . Then from out of the sky came a big , unpointed Mojave hunting arrow and plunked into the sand right between the Piute 's feet . The Piute pounced on the arrow . South Boy felt a pain in his left hand . He took his bow in his right , and shook his left , and the arrow that was sticking in the web of flesh between the thumb and the forefinger flopped away . All this was in one pony-jump . South Boy was crying like an angry child . He saw the Piute 's dirty distorted face with little crazy eyes , red-rimmed from trachoma . The face disappeared . The Piute was running and dodging . South Boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it broke in his hand . The next thing he knew the Piute jumped like a big , shortleggedfrog . There was the river , and he was diving into it . And South Boy himself was sailing over his pony 's head . The river closed over him . The water had a cold bite to it . It felt good . He was n't more than a few seconds clambering out onto the bank . He looked out over the river and saw nothing of the Piute . Then an arrow popped up out of swirl in the red water , turned slowly around and went floating downstream . It was one of his own arrows . He recognized the Whisperer 's skillful fletching . " Well , you 're paid for , " he said to the bleeding wound in his left hand . He started out at a trot down-river , looking over the waterP133for the Piute , while his right hand jerked at the front flap of his shirt . He ripped off a piece of it and began to bind his hand to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Piute broke water some distance out , rolled over on his back , filled his lungs , shrieked angrily at South Boy , and sank again . South Boy yelled , " Havek , fetch that rifle ! " His right hand was absently stuffing his shirttail back into his pants . Then it stopped . " Well , damn me for a fool ! " he said bitterly as his hand touched the gun he 'd forgotten . He jerked it out , cocked it , and waited . The Piute came up farther out and farther down the river and began swimming with a strong overhand stroke . It was a long shot , some sixty yards , but the light was better now . South Boy fired and saw the bullet kick the water some five feet downstream from the Piute 's head . The Piute dived like a loon . South Boy ran downstream and pulled the trigger again , directly the Piute reappeared . There was a dead click . The Piute kept on the surface of the water , breasting the current strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current would bear him across . South Boy sat down , rested his gun hand on his knee , and , carefully sighting three feet over the round cap that still clung to the Piute 's head , he fired again and watched the bullet kick the water ten feet short and fifteen feet downstream . " Shoots left , " said South Boy . The range was out of all reasonnow but he held far upstream and far high , and fired , hoping for luck . But this time the bullet carried far to the right and high . South Boy got to his feet , looked at the gun and cried out , in great heat , " Why , the dirty , lying , cheating sons-of-bitches ! " For in his mind 's eye was the glowing account of the gun 's worth and accuracy as he had read it in the Chicago mailordercatalogue . P134From up-river came the roar of the big rifle and there was a big spurt of water far beyond the Piute . " I hope Havek held that rifle loose and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him to fetch it here ! " The Piute climbed slowly up the farther bank . He jerked an arrow out of his back and another out of his thigh and threw them into the river . In one last spasm of anger , South Boy threw the worthless mail-order gun at a high arc over the river . It passed up and out of the cliff 's shadow , and the first rays of the rising sun shone for a flickering instant on its nickel finish . It fell into the river some two hundred feet out . The Piute had already disappeared into the willows . " Well , if this is what they call war , to hell with it , " said South Boy . And he went wearily trudging up-river in search of Havek . " A crazy business ! " he said to himself . " A worthless , crazy business , with everything going wrong . " Havek squatted on the bank a quarter of a mile upstream , rubbing his shoulder . He looked at South Boy and grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid . I did n't know about it at all . " " Do n't ever do business with those Chicago people , " said South Boy , bitterly . " They 're no-good liars . Why did n't you bring me that rifle ? " " I thought I could kill him myself , but the big gun jumps too much . Anyway , why worry about it ? He 'll die , maybe today , maybe tomorrow after the maggots start growing in his wounds . " Unlike South Boy , Havek seemed to be very well satisfied with the whole affair . He yawned widely and began stripping off his clothes . He was sweat-soaked , lazy , and happy , his face and clothes covered with dirt . He pulled the handkerchief from his head and dived into the river . Then he swam back and sat in the shallow water below the bank , washing the mud out of his hair.  |p135He  began singing softly to himself  --  his song growing louder as he started plastering his head with fresh mud , and finally becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head with the big handkerchief . " What in hell is there to sing about ? " muttered South Boy to himself . He was still more disgusted when he saw that Havek had let the rifle drop into the sand . South Boy picked up the old Springfield , and with another piece of cloth from his depleted shirttail he began carefully removing the sand . The worst of it was , the protecting coat of skunk grease came off with the sand and he knew the rifle would rust quickly in the hot , muggy weather . It was his gun , too , as soon as he brought the Bible in the bullet bag back to the Mormonhater . He looked around for the bullet bag . It , too , was lying in the sand where Havek had dropped it , a greasy old canvas coin bag with " $ i 000 " still faintly discernible in black paint  --  probably discarded by some bank robber on the run from California and salvaged by the Mormonhater . The tie string was loose , but none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and looked in . There was a square bundle carefully wrapped in blue cloth nestling among fifty or more greasy , finger-length cartridges of dingy brass with big blunt homemadebullets . " That 's the Bible , all right , " said South Boy . He set the bag down , picked up the rifle and pulled some willow shoots through its bore , grumbling to himself because he lacked proper cleaning equipment . Havek was still singing that part of " The Ravens " that concernswar . South Boy was wondering : Were the fights that were celebrated and described in the Great Tellings as gloriousin the doing as in the telling  --  or were they senseless scrambleswhere men lost their heads and acted like angry children ? " A fine business , " he said , looking at Havek . But sarcasm was lost on the Mojave boy . " Yes . Surely . A Great Thing was done . You saw it . I rode down a man with a rifle and hit him with a club . Like a striking hawk I rode , feeling no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hear it . " " It 's a wonder you did n't get shot , " said South Boy , sourly . " I did ! " Havek turned his face and proudly displayed a raw bullet burn a half-inch wide just under his right cheek bone . " By so much I missed death "  --  and he measured half the tip of his little finger . " And you did a Great Thing ! You rode him down and beat him with your bow . I saw it . Anyone can kill a dangerous man from a distance , but you struck him from close by and without fear . Take a name . Take a good name . " " I ai n't any too proud of myself . The crazy man got away . " South Boy was thinking that there would certainly be no glory in killing the sickening half-beast ; but it was a job to be done , and he had bungled it . " But he 'll die ! " Havek insisted . " And this way the death is n't directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still we do n't have to smoke ourselves , which would be a hot job in this weather . Come , let 's go home and sing about our new names . The old men will brag about us , surely . " He began eagerly pulling on his clothes , his eyes shining . South Boy knew he was thinking about how the old men of his clan , the best singers and the best orators , would lead him from one rancheria to another , crying his new name and glorifyinghis deeds . It was a ceremonial that rarely occurred these days , for few young men ever did anything worthy of it . Suddenly South Boy said to himself : The trouble with me is , I 'm thinking like a white man again . I should be proud like Havek and take a name . But , try as he would , he could n't shake off the white-man thinking nor the feeling of defeat that it brought . Maybe up in the Piute country  --  But he realized then that he would not be going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , now . " " Surely , surely , " said Havek , picking up his bow.  | " Then the Mormonhater is a farseer , all right . He said we 'd go no farther north than the witch 's fire . " " Yes , he certainly knows something . " At that Havek gave a short cry and clapped his hand over his mouth in a gesture of surprise , pointing across the river where the sun shone halfway down on the Nevada cliff , and said , " Hurry  --  we have n't done what must be done ! " He hurriedaway into the willows . South Boy stuffed the bullet bag into his shirt , picked up his rifle , and went trotting after Havek . For a moment he , too , had forgotten what the old man had said . The first thing they found was the Piute 's bow , a curious weapon half as long , twice as broad , and a third as thick as the Mojave bow . There was a layer of sinew strings glued to its back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame we have to burn it . It would be a good thing to show , " said Havek , running this way and that , hunting arrows . Then they came to the place where South Boy had chased the Piute and beat him with his bow . Havek let out a whoop and pointed down at the ground . There was a wavy line of dribbles marking the trail where the Piute ran . " Scared-Piute-Makes-Water ! " said Havek . " Take a name , South Boy . Take that name . " South Boy said : " No ! That sounds all right to a Mojave . In English it 's a dirty-joke name . " So they ran on . Havek began picking up arrows , some his own , some South Boy 's  --  though they were all Havek 's now because South Boy had broken his bow . Then Havek picked up a Piute arrow . It was short and iron-pointed , and its shaft was in two parts , spliced and bound with gut . " A lot of silliness ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ran through the little willows and came out on the beaver-cut stubble beyond .   " Why do n't you take a name ? " asked Havek . " Take a good name . Like Hides-His-Gun or Piute Beater . " " Later . Later , " answered South Boy , looking over his shoulder . The sunshine had reached the top of the willows on the Nevada shore . He said to himself : I do n't understand this businessabout the sunshine , but we 'd best do what the Mormonhatersaid . Together they ran across the stubble to the big driftwood pile and skirted the edge , going east toward the cliff . There , near the end of the tangle of logs , both boys froze like bird dogs . The little willows had been cut to make a clearing about six feet in diameter . In the middle of it was a small rock on which a small fire still smoldered . On one side of the rock was a little pile of prepared fuel . On the other side was a medicine pouch made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying flat on the ground . " Well , there 's the witch 's fire , like he told us , " said South Boy , again pondering the business of farseeing . Maybe the old man had the gift . Maybe he just knew the ways of a Piute witch . He looked over his shoulder and saw the first rays of the sun striking the tips of the tallest trees on the Nevada shore and muttered , " Well , we found it in plenty time , anyway . " Havek stepped gingerly forward , dropped the Piute 's bow and arrows across the rock , and spoke three sharp , jerky , Mojavephrases as he looked quickly away . " Get wood ! Cover everything ! Burn quickly ! " " Uh-huh , " said South Boy . " But I do n't understand about that badger-skin bag . It looks empty . " He took three steps and picked up the bag . He gave a little grunt of surprise , for under it , laid close together and in an orderly pattern , waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the witch 's medicine : little bunches of owl feathers , little bunches of raven feathers , little bundles of dried hideousness that had been the entrails of animals and a contortedmummy that had been a fetus , animal or human.  |p139Foreign  filth , thought South Boy in disgust . The Mojaves had nothing like that . Then it was he heard Havek 's cry of horror . No death howl was more terrible , no ghost 's cry more unexpected . He looked around to see Havek 's knees buckle under him . " Cover ! Cover ! " Havek gasped , and sat down very hard . The badger skin dropped from South Boy 's hand and fell across the objects of evil , hiding most of them . " Sky-breaking ! Sun-breaking ! World 's End ! " shrieked Havek , his once stolid face wild with the fear of doom impendmg . Genuinely alarmed , South Boy grabbed the little pile of fuel , put it across the rock and began blowing the fire furiouslyuntil it sprang into a blaze . He tore at the pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fire . In two or three minutes he had covered the witch 's gear , the altar rock and the entire area around it . The fire burned slowly , for although the wood was bone-dry , it was lifeless from having once been long in the water . He looked back at the river . The sun had touched the water . Then he looked at Havek . Havek was leaning over , his arms wrapped around his middle , vomiting . " For God 's sake ! " South Boy cried . " This is all foreign nonsense . You never heard any Mojave talk about the evil of owl feathers and such . It 's nothing to us ! " Havek rolled up his eyes and gagged . The wind came downstream , and the fire suddenly took off with almost explosive force , the flames licked through the wood over the witch 's gear , up the irregular face of the main drift pile , sending up great clouds of white smoke . The sun had just reached the edge of the sand bar.  |p140OF  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , South Boy remembered very little . He knew he kept assuring himself : " This is foreign nonsense , this business of feathers and such . No Mojave , no white man either , would believe in such . " Yet there was Havek , Mojave of the Mojaves , brave , dependableand able , and intelligent far beyond the ordinary , puking his guts out on the sand . One thing , what evil there was it was burnt in good time . The whole near segment of drift pile was roaring in flames before the line of sunshine came creeping across the sand bar . The heat was awful . Stupefied , uncertain , but driven by a kind of dogged stubbornness against whatever it was that had struck down Havek , South Boy ran back along the cliff to fetch the horses from where they were browsing along the mesquite and big willows . He kept saying to himself , " Now I am He-Who-Stands-Strong . " He said this in Mojave and then added in English , " I 'd better be , or we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was defeated . The mare still hated him for the sting of the chloroform in that lion 's scratch . She fought him , tooth and forefoot , every time he got near her . He could neither mount nor boost the helpless Havek onto her back . He collapsed in gasping , sobbing , sweat-drenched agony , when Havek suddenly got to his feet , cried , " **29;113;TOOLONG , " threw himself on the mare 's back , and rode her through the smoke-filled gap between the flames and cliff , babbling , " Foreign evil , doctor evil , World 's End . "  |p141South  Boy had just enough strength to grab his rifle and hoist himself on the horse 's back before the horse ran nickeringafter the mare . When South Boy caught up with him , Havek was riding with his chin on his chest , his body bent , and his shoulders bowed . He still had his bow and arrows in his hand , but his club was gone . He turned and pointed his bow at South Boy . " Evil-uncovered ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World-blasting ! " South Boy said , " Aw , shut up ! " But the sky was appalling . It was the color of a copper cent that had been scrubbed bright with wet ashes . What was usually called a " copper sky " was mild compared to it . " World 's End , or no World 's End , " he said in English , " I 'm getting this outfit back to Hardyville . The Mormonhater must know something . He described the Piute 's medicine fire from afar . " Behind him he heard thunder for the first time , still far away but loud enough to be heard over the talk of the river . The wound in his hand began throbbing as he rode into a sort of semi-oblivion that was like the worst of nightmares . An endless time of pain and stress , and he rode out of it to find he was among the ruins of Hardyville . Havek and the mare were still ahead , but Havek lay across the mare 's back like a bedroll . South Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Havek 's shirt was around the head of the stallion . South Boy cudgeled his mind to remember how this happened , but nothing came of it . The world was a hot rock , spewing steam . It was hardly midmorning , but the horses walked like pack animals at the end of a long day . Directly South Boy saw the Mormonhater standing under the big fig tree leaning on his stick . The next thing he knew he was lying naked on the north bank of the little ditch under the tree . There was salt meat in his mouth . His sore hand was soaking in a Mojave pot full of hot water . " For God 's sake , have n't I boiled enough ? " he said to a patch of copper sky that glared down at him through a space between the leaves . " Keep that hand in there , " said the Mormonhater . He was squatting over Havek , who lay like a dead man on the other bank of the ditch , smearing tar on the bullet burn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intently , earnestly , anxiously . It was a doctor-singing  --  that much South Boy knew , though the words were foreign and the cadence strange . " There 's no sense to it , " complained South Boy , looking at Havek . " One minute he was all right . The next minute he was sick , and then he was crazy . " He felt all numb inside and empty , as if Havek had already died and left vacant a place where there had been a sense of comfort and companionship . The Mormonhater made no answer until he had finished singing . Then he turned his haggard , sweat-streaked face toward South Boy and said : " The boy is witch-struck . You uncovered the witch medicine before you burnt it . That 's bad . Some of it entered the boy . Some of it escaped to the sky . I am making four kinds of medicine to destroy it . I have made Piute medicine . I 'll make Mojave medicine . Catholic medicine and Protestant medicine  --  Let me take a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his stick , took South Boy 's hand out of the pot , and proceeded to dress it with pine tar and a white rag . " Then will the world be blasted ? " asked South Boy , half earnestly , half ironically . The old man shook his head . " Not likely . The sun never saw the witch 's medicine . " " But the witch got away ! " said South Boy , indignantly . " That 's no great matter to us . His power was burnt with his medicine . When he recovers from his wounds he will becomeP143a mad coyote and kill a lot of people in Nevada before he dies , but with weapons , not witching . " South Boy closed his eyes . The river and the creaking water wheel made ' a background of sound overborne by the ripple of the ditch water , only six inches from his ear . His body , it seemed , was floating in a hot soup of many smells  --  of wet earth , mesquite smoke , and pungent arrowweed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat . He was floating between worlds without purpose or destination . The road he had chosen had closed before him at the place of the witch 's fire . Havek was gone . There was no one to lead him . He kept saying to himself , " Where do I go ? Where do I go ? " He heard the Mormonhater begin singing the Latin hymn " Dies Irae . " His eyes opened . He asked sharply , " What 's that ? " and the Mormonhater said : " The Day of Wrath . It 's part of the medicine I learned in Santa Fe . " And he went on singing . So South Boy said to himself , I 'll remember this day by that singing , forever . He stewed in the soup of smells and dozed , thinking : It 's the Mormonhater who should take a new name this day . We will give him a big feed and call him " Many Medicines . " He has the soul of several men . He had heard of very great doctors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cohiva-michiva . Maybe it 's because he has so many kinds of knowledge . He felt ashamed for last night 's quarrel ; and with a new respect for the old man he began to feel better , and he went to sleep . When he awoke a short time later his respect was increased , for the Mormonhater was chanting a part of the long " Goose " singing , exactly like a Mojave doctor  --  the same kind of voice and the same manner of singing . Like last night when he told us the story of the sand-hill fight  --  he is an old Mojave . So South Boy again slept . The next time he awoke , the Mormonhater was readingP144from the Bible  --  sitting cross-legged , his back against the trunk of the tree ; with the protecting blue cloth in which the Bible had been wrapped lying on his knee . His voice was the voice of a back-country preacher reading from his pulpit . South Boy looked across the ditch and saw Havek lying on his belly sleeping like a child . Many Medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old man and learn his many medicines . If anyone comes to take me away , I 'll hide in the brush . By the time the old man dies , I 'll know everything . I 'll be a great man , all by myself , forever . He thought he had found a new road and destination , and so with his mind at ease he went to sleep again . When he woke up next it was with a feeling of great relief . He felt good , but rather dazed . He rolled over on his back and looked up at the patch of sky between the fig leaves . There was no glare of burnished copper . The patch of sky was covered by slate-gray clouds coming from the south . There on the ground was a hot , wet breeze coming from the north . South Boy lay still for a moment , dreaming that he was up in a balloon carried along by the strong cool wind that was pushing those clouds . Once when he was younger he had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams came only in flashes . The Mormonhater was sitting farther down on the ditch bank , rewrapping the knife wound on his leg . " Nice clean cut , " he said , seeing South Boy was awake . South Boy thought , " He 's different again . This time he is himself , the-man-of-theriver . Maybe he 'll talk about Tom Paine . " " Never had a nicer cut in all my life , " said the Mormonhater . He stood up and tested his strength on his leg . Evidently he decided against walking on it unassisted , for he leaned over and picked up his stick . It was a little disconcerting to South Boy to have to make the usual white man 's talk when he himself was thinking like an Indian ; so he tried to conjure the Mormonhater back intop145another mood by speaking to him in very polite Mojave , such as a respectful young man would use to an old man of great wisdom . He said : " Havek sleeps well . Four medicines cured him , surely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wake up as fresh as a daisy , " said the Mormonhater , half in Mojave , half in English . " The witch got away , three-wounds-carrying , river-swimming . Will he join the war up-river ? " " Oh , that ! " said the Mormonhater in disgust . " That 's no war . Some poor , cheated , half-starved Piutes killed some sheep , got caught at it , and killed a sheepherder . Now they 're all dead or in jail or hiding out in the desert from the sheriff 's posse . I intended to tell you last night that chasing up there to find a war was just foolishness . Them days is over , son . " " War is nothing much , anyway , " said South Boy . " But this matter of farseeing and other knowledge . That 's a good thing . I would travel with you and learn all that . I could help you trap and hunt and gather honey . My help would be a good thing for you , and your knowledge would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply and said , " No ! " " Why ? " South Boy demanded . " Because I 'm the last of my kind . There ai n't going to be any more like me . My day is done . My times is gone . These is the times of steam trains and irrigating ditches . You go find somebody to teach you about steam trains and irrigating ditches . You got no business in a mud boat with me . " The Mormonhaterhobbled to the house . He came back in a moment with the Springfield , the bullet bag and South Boy 's traveler 's rations . " Here 's your gear . I put a bullet mold in the bag with the cartridges . When this bey wakes up , you-all better get going . They 'll be a big rain , by and by . " South Boy pushed himself slowly to his feet . " Does learning about steam trains and irrigating ditches mean I got to go away to some white school ? " " Well , you ca n't learn things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization , and you got to go to a civilized place to learn about them . " " To hell with them ! " said South Boy . He leaned over the ditch and began washing his face to hide his tears . He washed himself all over finally , and climbed into his clothes and sat down with his ration bag between his knees , nervously chewing sweet screw beans without appetite and staring at the old man , who sat with his back against the fig tree , his stick in his hand and his chin sunk down on his chest . Hah ! Cohiva-michiva , South Boy accused , silently . Gratefullyhe remembered the matter of Nebethee . Well , old Four Medicines might know something , but his great-ape theory was certainly crazy . If Nebethee was a gorilla , why had n't anybody ever seen his tracks ? And gorillas , being animals , had to breed and die . Where was the she-ape , and where were the pups ? Who had seen them ? Then he heard a moan from Havek . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . His face was a mask of stupidity . South Boy glanced over at the Mormonhater and saw he was looking at Havek with surprise and concern . " He 's still witched , " said the old man . " You had no business lifting that badger skin . You let too much evil fly up . " " Look , why was n't I witched ? I lifted the skin . I was the closest to the witch medicine . I looked right at it , and I was n't witched . " " That 's because you was ignorant , " said the Mormonhater . " I told this boy about the awful power of owl feathers and raven feathers and the other medicine , and told him what would happen if he looked at them . " South Boy gave a crow of triumph . " So that 's it ! Havek is n't witched . He 's just scared on account of what you toldP147him ! " He got up , tied his ration bag , and slipped the loop of string over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up his rifle . " Come on , Havek . You ai n't hurt . Let 's travel . " Out of South Boy 's mind came the question , Travel where ? and he turned his back so that no one could see the trouble in his face . Havek , finding himself naked , made babbling cries until he found his clothes , then dressed himself clumsily . He saw his bow and arrows , picked them up , and went stumping off through the grapevines toward the hayfield where the horses grazed listlessly . The Mormonhater had loosened the ropes from their jaws and tied them around their necks . Havek caught the mare 's rope and mounted like a fat squaw . The mare whirled around and headed for the house ; the stallion came whimpering after her . " He 's not bad now , " said the Mormonhater . " I got most of the witchin ' out of him . The rest will wear off by night . You better follow him , though , and see he do n't hurt himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Boy . " I do n't know where he 'll lead me . " P148DEATH AND THE DOCTORHAVER. led straight down the old trail to Fort Mojave . He rode badly , without regard for his mount , sometimes flogging her with his bow in an attempt to make her run , sometimes letting her lag or even turn around and start drifting north . South Boy read all this from his trail , but the mare was out of sight before he got the canteen filled . He rode at a steady running walk , holding back the eager little stallion who did n't seem to mind the heat in his anxiety to find the mare . South Boy himself was swimming in sweat before he had gone five hundred yards , canteen strap over one shoulder , grub-bag string over the other , cartridge bag bulging his shirt front , and the heavy rifle across his legs . No matter the burden , he felt an insistent urge to keep all his property right with him . He kept saying to himself : " I wish I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Affliction had the opposite effect on Havek . He left Hardyvillewith only his bow and arrows , and before he had gone a mile he began dropping or throwing away arrows and he had only his bow when South Boy 's horse found his mare at the rancheria where the two boys had played raid-the-enemy two , days ago . The mare stood in the middle of the barren ground between the winter house and the ramada , her head hanging , her legs spread . Havek , his head going around like a Johnny-owl 's , was staring in bewilderment , crying , " Gone ! Gone ! " The rancheria was deserted . South Boy rode up alongside , unscrewed the cover of the canteen and handed it to Havek . " They 're just gone sonic P149place , " he said . Havek looked at South Boy as though he were a stranger , but he took the canteen and drank . When he made a move to throw it away South Boy grabbed it . Havek 's heels struck the mare 's ribs . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my people ? " And he rode away , blindly seeking his kin . After a mile or so South Boy said , " Look , you are a Hawkdreamer . It 's not fitten you act this way . " Havek pointed to the sky and said : " World 's End ! World 's End ! The clouds move against the wind . " " You make me sick , " said South Boy . " The wind 's different up there . I 've seen it that way before , and you have , too . " Havek stared at him , blank-faced , the sweat standing out on his forehead in great greasy drops that did not seem to run down as sweat properly should . Then he muttered : " Old-manof-my-peopleI must find . Or maybe I die  --  or maybe I 'm dead now . I do n't know . " He wiped his face with his sleeve , then hit the mare with his bow . She moved off down-river , unsteadily . South Boy said , bitterly , " If she founders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He added , " If I can get you to YellowRoad 's camp you 'll be all right . He 'll know what to do with you . " Some time later both horses turned off the trail of their own accord , and before South Boy could do anything to stop them they trotted down a wild-horse trail and into Snake lagoon , where they stood belly-deep and buried their heads in the brackish , soup-warm water . They did n't drink much because they had already drunk their fill of sweet river water that day . South Boy said , " That 's lucky , or we 'd both be walking . " " Maybe I die , " said Havek . " I feel the foreign-devil eating my belly . " That 's worse than World 's End , thought South Boy . That 's a Mojave idea . So he slapped the mare on the rump and said : " Come on . Let 's go see Yellow Road . "  | They were no more than a mile or two from Yellow Road 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strange and unaccountable happenings for that day . Yet right there in front of him he saw a tall man wearing a shirt and no pants with a bundle of wet fish nets dangling over one shoulder . The man was running . In that stupefying heat he was running at the shambling , distance-consuming gait of a River Indian . Not another living thing had they seen since they left Hardyville . A moment later he heard the man singing . South Boy could n't understand the words , but he recognized the rhythm as the " Goose " singing dreamed by " doctors . " Then he saw that the big man was real enough . He was Down-River-OldMan , a doctor of great repute . Havek began slapping his mare . He was first to draw up alongside the doctor , but when he opened his mouth to speak no sound came out . He only gasped and rolled his eyes like a spent runner . So South Boy spoke up . " What is the power of owl feathers and raven feathers ? " " Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down-RiverOld-Man . South Boy looked at Havek , and Havek brought his hand to his mouth in a gesture of embarrassment . " They were from a witch 's pouch , " added South Boy . " Surely a great foreign-evil , making World 's End . " " A great foreign nonsense , " said the doctor . " What does it mean when the clouds move so ? " asked Havek , pointing up . " Rain like hell purty quick , " the doctor grunted  --  in English , to show his disdain . Havek 's face suddenly relaxed and sank into heavy , sullen lines . Well , thought South Boy , that 's the end of witchin ' for now . He immediately felt relieved . He knew that Havek wouldp151be sullen and silent for a long time , but he would be entirely out of danger . Then Down-River-Old-Man looked sharply at Havek . " You , boy , are one of Yellow Road 's kin . Why are n't you up at his camp ? The call went out yesterday . Where were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Far . Far . We 've been up the river , traveling  --  name-traveling  --  " " Name-traveling ? Name-traveling on horseback ! " croaked the old man in a fury . All this time he was shambling along at such a rapid pace that the boys had to thump their ponies into a trot every now and then . Still he kept just a little ahead , and he spoke with his head turned and his chin resting on the wet fish net . " Are you a cripple ? Are you a woman ? Are you a Mexican ? Are you a Real Person at all ? Why , when I went name-traveling I ran naked for four days and nights until I came to the Tehachapi Mountains , and there I slept in deep snow . Then I ran four days more and saw the Great Sea . I saw a thousand places , and I knew them all by name . I saw a thousand towns , and I heard ten different languages . All that time I never left off running . Horses ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trail , ' I yelled , and kicked them aside . " Havek could not stand this sort of rebuke . He slid off the mare and went trotting after the old man . The mare stopped where he left her , her head hanging . South Boy let her be . Havek called to the doctor : " What 's my kin gathered for ? Is my uncle dying ? What part have you had in that ? " South Boy fought his horse past the mare , marveling at the way Havek was recovering . " Blame your lazy , horse-riding relatives if Yellow Road dies , " shouted the doctor . " They should have sent for me yesterday . Not till this morning comes a fat slouch of a horserider . I was fishing . I told him he was too late , but I 'd do what I could . I began singing right away , for I knew at once that a spider was spinning her trails around Yellow Road 's heart.  | Being a farseer , I could see even from there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . So I began singing . Yesterday I could have stopped the spider , surely . Today , I do n't know . If she makes three roads , it 's bad . If she finishes the fourth before I can stop her , the old man is dead . Shut up , and let me sing . " He turned his head and began singing " The Goose " again . Havek was crying ; great tears streamed down over the tar-smeared bullet burn across his face . South Boy saw them as he rode up alongside . They were now in sight of the camp perched on the mesa 's rim . The wailing of the assembled kinsmen came plainly through the thick air . It was a sad thing to hear , but in spite of that it was wholesome , and normal , and sane  --  it made South Boy feel he was on solid earth for the first time that day . Suddenly he was hungry . He untied the string on his ration bag and began munching screw beans . At the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already signified that he expected to die . A big black dog lay dead , his mouth gaping . He had gone to scout the trail that Yellow Road 's soul would follow to the cold , misty , topsy-turvy land of shadows . If by mischance the dog had been killed after the man 's death , the dog would have annoyed him the whole journey , yapping and snapping at his heels . A little farther on lay a horse with its throat cut . It was not so often that a horse was killed at a man 's death . South Boy concluded this must have been the animal ridden by the messenger who had gone for the doctor . It had probably foundered , and therefore had been cheap sacrifice . Up the switchback trail strode the tall , untiring old doctor . South Boy thought , There 's one man almost as good as he brags . Behind the doctor trotted Havek , his head down , weeping . The little stallion bearing South Boy and his mass of equipmentcame toiling along a considerable distance behind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of the mesa , the wailing abruptly tapered off and died into a sullen silence that was broken by two sharp outbursts of hysterical accusations from two different women . Men 's voices came in an angry , rumbling undertone . Then Havek appeared . A number of women set up a peculiar mourning cry , " Lil-lil-lil . " South Boy could hear the patter of their feet as they ran to meet the boy and surround him . They would be the old women  --  some of them relatives , some professional mourners  --  who surrounded each of the younger relatives at every cremationand made sure they cry properly . When South Boy reached the top of the mesa he saw Havek kneeling about a hundred feet this side of the ramada , surrounded by a circle of squatting old women  --  each a bundle of dingy calico , each one urging him to wail and weep , for the great man , the old man , the great hota , the great war captain , would be gone , gone , gone ! As for the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took one look at Yellow Road , who now lay on some new cotton blankets , shook his head , and walked over to one of the supporting posts , leaned nonchalantly against it , standing on one leg , with the other knee raised , the other foot braced against the post , making a figure four . He glanced boldly around , folded his arms , and spat defiantly . " Too late , too late , " he said . " Yesterday you quarreled and argued . Some said , We 'll call in this doctor . ' Others said , We 'll call in that doctor . ' Some said , Call in nobody . ' So you wasted a day while the spider went on spinning . Now she 's making the fourth road . It 's too late . " A tall middle-aged woman in a green silk dress trimmed withyellow bands  --  one of Yellow Road 's daughters  --  cried out , " Your mother , your father , your father 's father , all dead ! " " Surely , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Yellow Road has lived too long . Ask him . He willtell you he 's unlucky . A brave man does not wish to live tooP154long , nor does a doctor . I do not wish to live too long . I stand here . Is there a man of your kin who wants to step over here and kill me ? " All this South Boy heard and saw as he rode between the ramada and the mesa edge . He saw there was no one under the bird's-nest granary ; so he was going there to divest himself of his burdens and rest awhile . He was very tired , and he could feel the horse trembling under him . He slipped off with a weary grunt and dropped rifle , grub bag , canteen and then pulled the bullet bag out of his shirt , for the loading tool inside of it had been prodding his belly . " Gim me a saddle after this , " he said . Hardly was he on the ground when the horse , that had seemed so spent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrilly . He went trotting back to the trail and promptly disappearedover the rim to find the mare . South Boy had a sinking , sickly feeling of utter loneliness as he sat down among his possessions and unscrewed the cover from the canteen . Havek had found his kin and the end of his affliction . The horse would find the mare down in the mesquite . South Boy took a sip of tepid water , and it tasted bitter . He had found nothing . He was all alone on a trail that led nowhere . His sense of loneliness was emphasized by the fact that no one paid the least attention to him . If he had been a relative , he would have been met by the wailing women . If he had been a stranger , he would at least have been stared at  --  with curiosity , if not hostility . But he was South Boy , neither kin nor stranger , a vacuum between two worlds . Under the ramada the doctor leaned against the post and glared around him . No one seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three middle-aged men looked angry enough and spoke indignantly among themselves , but none of them made an overt move . The woman in the green dress did come closer and kept up her vindictive name-calling . The rest of the thirty or forty people under the willow-roof went backp155to mourning , each little group wailing its grief in one of several traditional ways . On either side of Yellow Road sat his two wives , their heads bent , their hair over their faces . They moaned , their thick bodies rocking slightly to and fro . At Yellow Road 's head stood one of his cousins , a short-haired man , a hota , a great singer , and a man of consequence who had a good job in the railroad yards at Needles . He sang " The Nichiva " which was the singing that Yellow Road had dreamed , and not his own . This he would sing as long as Yellow Road lived . There were two different groups , men and women , weeping around the old men who were " funeral preaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and the origin of the Mojave customs in the characteristically sharp , jerky phrases . Other groups , standing or sitting , wailed or wept . Everybody was sweating prodigiously , and although this brought them little relief in the steaming , windless atmosphere no one seemed to notice the heat . Outside the ramada were circles of wailing women , each surrounding one or more of Yellow Road 's younger relatives , most of whom were of school age and wore school uniforms . " Ho ! He was brave ! Ho ! He led the fighting ! The Piutes feared him , and the foreign Apaches sang about him . Now he 'll be ashes . Gone forever . . . " So cried the wailing women . Tears began running down South Boy 's cheeks as he sat munching screw beans out of his sack . One of the women moved a little to one side , and he saw Yellow Road 's face as he lay very still on his blanket . It was haggard and emaciated beyond description , but it was calm  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , long-haired man wearing a loincloth and a long white undershirt , new and clean , appeared over the mesa 's rim . He carried a long staff and a bundle wrapped in red and white calico which he dropped on the large pile of combustible goods  --  cloth , weapons , and various wooden articles  --  col- lected at the far corner of the ramada . These articles had been contributed by the relatives to be burnt at the cremation . South Boy gathered his own possessions a little closer to him , vexed and disturbed by the thought of this senseless destruction of property . That the dead man 's own property should be destroyed , he could understand . The Mojaves could tolerate no reminder of the dead , and that which belonged to a man was in a way part of him and must be obliterated at his death or become an offense to the living . But this business of the relatives of a dead person burning their own perfectly good and sometimes brand-new property at the cremation  --  this irked South Boy beyond words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . They just do it to show the neighbors they have the stuff to burn . Yet at the back of his mind he knew there was more to it than that . There was the instinct the people had to divest themselves of their possessions in time of stress , to throw away everything  --  just as Havek had thrown away his arrows . Chuplic , " throw-away , " that was what they called the goods piled up over there to be burned at the cremation . South Boy , being white , gathered his possessions to him in time of stress , as a setting hen gathers her eggs . Meanwhile , the man in the white undershirt shot an angry look at the doctor and went under the ramada to join the group still discussing the doctor 's challenge . White Undershirt had a hooked nose and an angry face . A few words from the others , and he began pounding the earth with the butt of his stick . The woman in the green dress joined the group . She spoke passionately , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground with greater vigor . The doctor , who was close enough to hear everything that was said , did not move . He leaned against his post , fish net still draped over his shoulder , his arms folded , haughty , defiant  --  entirely indifferent to his fate . White Undershirt stalked towards him , his staff smiting theP157ground with each deliberate step . The woman in the green dress walked at his left side , the other men coming a pace or two behind . The singer kept singing , and the preachers kept on preaching ; but several of the mourners stopped their wailing to watch . White Undershirt stepped in front of the doctor and demanded in a high voice that he begin singing at once , and sing properly , for if Yellow Road should die his death would be on the doctor 's head . The doctor looked disgusted . South Boy thought , Why should he sing over a man everybodycounts as dead already ? It made him angry to think that people like Yellow Road 's kin , whom everybody considered more intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter . He knew he was angry because he was thinking like a white man , but he did n't reprove himself for it . White Undershirt gave a cry and raised his staff . There came a shout of warning from one of the rear guard . The staff was lowered before it struck . Over the rim of the mesa appeared a low-crowned , stiffbrimmedCalifornia Stetson . Under it was a thick-bodied Indian in a sweat-darkened blue shirt . He had a gun belted about his middle . He was sitting in a big , well worn stock saddle on a bay horse . As the horse stalked slowly across the mesa the protesters quietly turned their backs on the doctor and drifted away among the mourners . The doctor gave absolutely no sign of relief  --  neither by change of facial expression nor by movement of body . The man on horseback , but for his short hair and dress , was typical Mojave , but he carried himself with the bored , halftruculentair that marks the policeman everywhere . The sight of him gave South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the man in the white undershirt . He was thinking : Either myp158father or my mother came home and has started looking for me . Word must have been sent to the Fort , and this policeman was sent to fetch me ! I guess that means I 'll be sent away to school pronto . He sat still and chewed on the beans . There being nothing else to do , he tried to adopt the stoical , scornful attitude of the doctor . The policeman swung out of the saddle and stopped under the ramada . He glanced at Yellow Road , turned , and came slowly toward the granary , walking with the stiff-legged gait of a horseman rather than the loose-jointed , easy shamble of a River Indian . South Boy began reasoning with himself : My mother certainlywould n't come home in this heat . If my father came home he 'd be too busy to miss me ; or , if he did , he 'd think I was visiting . The policeman glanced back over his shoulder at the ramada . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , stretching his legs out in front of him . South Boy said , " Hi yuh , Joe , " as a white man speaks to a white man . The policeman took off his hat , wiped his forehead with his sleeve , and said : " Christ , it 's hot ! Gim me that canteen , will yuh ? " South Boy handed it over . His heart lifted , in spite of lingeringforeboding as to the man 's purpose . The policeman gulped noisily and handed the canteen back . " If this heat keeps up there 's going to be a lot more people dying , and they wo n't be Mojaves , either . Sure hope it rains . " He looked speculatively up at the hurrying clouds . " Well , it 's the fourth day , " said South Boy . " It might rain . " Both nodded wisely . By and by the policeman said , " The agency doctor 's sick , so they sent me to see they do n't burn the old man too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent from the Fortto prevent a premature cremation  --  an event too frequent inP159the past because of the hysterical haste of the mourners in obliterating their dead . South Boy thought of " Danny the Dancer , " who for a short-bit would gyrate on a withered leg to amuse the saloon crowd down in Needles . Danny 's leg had been burnt to the bone in a cremation fire . " But Yellow Road 's plenty old . When he 's dead , he 'll stay dead . " " Yeh , but I 'm going to make sure , " said the policeman . " Yeh , you got ta make sure , " echoed South Boy . Now he was terrifically glad the policeman was there . He was practical , solid , and understandable in a world that had become confusing , unstable , and illogical . He was somebody you could talk to . South Boy opened his ration bag and handed it over . The policeman took a handful of screw beans and began chewingvigorously . " Looks like we might be having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't he show some sense and clear out ? " " Just stubborn , " said the policeman . " Like a lot of old men . " Then he added , " More people are coming . " People were arriving in little groups both up the trail and over the mesa . They were not of Yellow Road 's clan . They gathered some distance from the ramada , and as yet only the old women joined in the wailing , though occasionally an old man would take to " preaching . " " Do n't see that woman , yet , " said the policeman . " Which'n ? " " She was yonder "  --  the policeman pointed down towards the flat with his chin , the only typical Indian gesture he had yet made  --  " sitting under a mesquite tree having a baby ; but she said she was all right , so I come on . I told her she should n't be running around on a hot day so close to her time , but she told me she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . I suppose I 'll have to go back down and see what 's the matter . Hate to have two things on my mind like this . "   " Uh-huh , " agreed South Boy with considerable feeling . " I know just how it is . If I ai n't had two things on my mind the last three days , it 's been six . Couple of times it just about throwed me . " The policeman looked at him with interest . " You sound like you had growed up all of a sudden . " South Boy said : " Well , something 's happened to me. 1 thought maybe it was just Crazy Weather . " The policeman 's mind had drifted back to his own pressing problems of birth and death . " If she 's in trouble I 'll have to round up some old woman to help . her , and I 'll have a hell of a time . " " Uh-huh , " said South Boy . He looked over the crowd . Every old woman was enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take my horse and herd a couple for me , if we have to  --  " " Huh-uh , " said South Boy in decisive negation . " That 'd be worse than herding weanlings . " " Well , do you know how to take a mirror and test a body for the breath of life ? " " Uh  --  I 've been told , but I 've never done it . " " Never mind . Here she comes ! " And they both leaned back in obvious relief . A stolid heavy woman of early middle age appeared over the rim of the mesa . Her movements were easy and leisurely , except for those of her lower jaw . She was vigorously chewing gum . She sat down on a little rise of ground beyond the ramada , bared a fat breast and to it she held the newborn child , wrapped in her tahoma . Even at that distance South Boy could see the expression of peace and complacency on her broad busy face . It put him somewhat in mind of a ruminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , after the usual manner of an Indian at any public place . Every now and then she would look down at her baby and smile . As she had ceased to be a public responsibility , theP161policeman and South Boy paid no more attention to her . Suddenly South Boy asked , " Say , did you hear any more about the trouble up north ? " " Sure , " said the policeman . " The superintendent got word by telephone yesterday . The damn fools is all jailed . " South Boy thought , The Mormonhater was farseeing in that matter , too . " Sa-ay ! " said the policeman . " There was supposed to be a couple of bronco Piutes at the top of the valley day before yesterday . Somebody raised a long yell , and me and two other fellers went up there , but we did n't cut no sure sign  --  " " One Piute , " South Boy broke in . " Huh ? " " Just one . He was bad crazy . He knifed the Mormonhater up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " South Boy picked up the old Springfield and laid it across his knees , slappingthe butt a couple of times for dramatic emphasis . " Well , me and Havek happened along , and the old man told me if we could get the rifle back he 'd give it to me . He done bought himself a Winchester a while back . " " Sure , I know , " affirmed the policeman . " Did you get the crazy man ? " " Well , we got the rifle . We jumped the Piute up in the canyon , and he shot Havek . Look over there  --  when he raises his head , you can see the bullet burn on his face . Well , Havek knocked the gun out of his hand ; but the crazy man got away , and we had a fight on our hands . All through them little willows  --  likefighting a flea on a dog 's back . But we hit him with three arrows , and he jumped into the river . " Of course we got self-defense all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well schooled by the Foreman in how to present his story to the Law in such a case . " He shot first . " " Sure . Sure . But you ai n't let the crazy man get away ! " " Well , he swam the river all right , but he had three arrows in him . "  | " Why in hell did n't you use that rifle ? " " How in hell could I ? He was all over the sand bar , and me after him  --  Havek brought the gun and took one shot at him , but you know he ai n't hardly ever shot a rifle  --  " " But if a crazy man 's loose I got ta go up there , " wailed the policeman . " That 's a hell of a trip in this weather . " As if I do n't know ! thought South Boy . Aloud he said , " Three arrows , and Havek hit him with a club , and I bust my bow over his head  --  " The policeman went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , I 'll report him dead . You and the Mormonhater can back me up if there 's any doubt about it . I sure do n't want to have to chase up there and cross the river and everything just to find a dead loco  --  anyhow that 's off the reservation and out of my jurisdiction . " " Hey , your report , " said South Boy nervously . " Will Havek and me have to testify to something ? " " Heck , you 'll be heroes ! My God , do n't you remember the trouble that last loco made for us ? If you killed this one , you should get a medal . " " Yeh , but the only thing is that the Mormonhater said this Piute 's a witch , and if he makes that kind of talk before the superintendent , the superintendent will say this here is another case of witch killing , and then he wo n't believe anything we say about anything , because I know he comes from Zuni where there 's been plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The policeman was silent for a moment , and then he said : " Forget it . I wo n't make any report , and there wo n't be any investigations . It all happened off the reservation , anyhow . So what the hell ? " So a sense of comradeship and understanding between South Boy and the policeman grew . " You know , Joe , " said South Boy , " it sure does me good to talk to you . You 're smart . You can figure things out whiteP163way and Indian way both , and by golly , you do n't get caught in the middle , either ! " The policeman looked pleased . " You 're plenty smart yourself , South Boy . I mean , you keep books and everything , or so they tell me  --  " " Yeh , but I ai n't smart about figgering things out like you , Joe . " South Boy looked at him earnestly . " I can think like an Indian sometimes , then I can think like a white man . But like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to bring them two kinds of thinking together . I just get to fighting my hat , and I ca n't figger nothing  --  " The policeman looked puzzled . " Well  --  I do n't know how to help you out . They had my head spinning for a while , but things get straightened around . You know , they sent me away to the big school in Phoenix , and then clear back to Haskell  --  " " They want to send me away to school , and it just scares hell out of me . " The policeman laughed . " You 'll get over it . I was scared , too . " " But , Joe , you was sent to an Indian school . If I could go to an Indian school , I 'd be all right  --  It 's the idea of being shut up with a lot of strange white people . " " Say , " said the policeman . " If you do n't think some of the Indians I ran into back East were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mojaves than anything . White people are n't half so foreign . Hey , look ! The old man must be about gone . Here comes the first of the logs ! " Over the rim of the mesa came four toiling men , each pulling on a lariat that was tied to a huge cottonwood log . They were big , long-haired men in shirts and loincloths . They sang as they came , digging their hard bare feet into the gravel as they dragged the log through the spectators to a spot on the mesa out to the east of the ramada where other men were digging a fire hole seven feet by four . Next came a mesquite log borne on the shoulders of one man who stood up straight under its weight . His lips moved , but the song could not be heard over the noise . It was the Whisperer . South Boy tried to go on with his talk with the policeman , but the air of approaching climax that hung over the assembly was too distracting . The policeman got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and nuzzled hint . Absently he slipped its bridle , reached into the granary , filled his hat with mesquite beans , and dumped them on the ground a few feet away . He said : " You might as well eat them . The rest will be burnt up in a minute . " South Boy was saying , " I wish I could figger out  --  " when a sudden pandemonium broke loose under the willow-roof . A cry of anguish that made the previous wailing seem like silence arose from around the dying man and spread outward to the outermost periphery of the crowd . It was caught up by the log bearers coming up the trail and the late-comers straggling over the mesa . And above the general cry came the high cry of the loon from those who had dreamed the loon-dreaming . The policeman put on his hat , pushed it to the back of his head , adjusted his gun-belt , and said : " Come on , kid . Let 's go . I want you for a witness , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem had been submerged by this climaxin this drama of death . He picked up his rifle , a visible token of his quasi-official capacity , and stalked after the policeman , unconsciously imitating his stiff-legged walk and bored manner . A while back he had wished the rifle was a carbine , less awkwardto manage on a horse , and less heavy . Now he was glad the barrel was long to lend him dignity for the occasion . The crowd gave way a little , although there was no pause in the wailing , neither did anyone appear to see either of them . When they came to the place where Yellow Road lay , the policeman took a hand mirror out of the pocket of his shirt and , bending down , placed it over Yellow Road 's nose andP165mouth . South Boy ground the butt of his rifle and leaned on the long barrel , elbow over the muzzle , waiting . " I do n't know whether this works when it 's so hot , " grumbledthe policeman . The wailing died . One of Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this obscene delay in properly disposing of the body . She was still seated . She seized the barrel of South Boy 's rifle above the lock and pulled herself to her knees . Then she took hold of his arm with a frantic grip and almost pulled him down as she dragged herself to her feet . Dizzy , gasping , she still held on to South Boy to steady herself , whimpering the while . During this time long-haired men  --  old men and middleaged  --  hadbeen filtering through the crowd to form a tightpacked , panting circle around the body . They jostled one another for first-rank position , like a pack of eager runners at a county race , and watched the policeman with expectant , halfhostileeyes , resentful of his interference but realizing that it was something they must put up with . Many of them were sobbing , and tears streaked every face . The air grew so thick that it was almost strangling . It was a distillation of stinks , for the hysterical grief had added somethingnew to the usual complexity of smells from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bore up under the weight of the fat , whimpering widow  --  aware of his dignity and determined to maintain it as long as he could breathe at all . The policeman straightened up , looked at the mirror , and showed it to South Boy . " No breath , " he said . " No breath , " echoed South Boy . " Go ahead , " called the policeman . There was a rush of bodies that would have knocked South Boy to the ground but for the fact that he was firmly anchored to his rifle barrel . That which had been Yellow Road was rolled up in the blanket on which it lay , heaved up over the heads of the men who rushed it to the burning pile  --  now a platform of logs that filled the fire hole and rose three or four feet above the level of the mesa . They rushed through the wailing crowd that scattered to every direction before them  --  for nothing must stand in the way of the speedy obliteration of the dead . The widow cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A puff of wind stirred the air and sweetened it . South Boy gasped gratefully . With his third breath he smelt smoke and ran from under the ramada . Someone had already fired the thatch . South Boy was thinking : If I could be like Joe , now , then I 'd be something . He is n't cohiva-michiva no time , nor he is n't halfway one thing and halfway something else . He 's man all the time . I got to talk to him more and get things figgeredout . " P167AT THE TIME of the burning , the hidden sun had almost gone down into Nevada . The gray of the day had darkened so that the blazing willow-roof and granary cast a yellowish glow over the mesa where people made their circle around the place of cremation as mourners had done since the burning of Mutavilya in the First Times . The body had been promptly covered with logs . The fire tender , an old man with frowzy gray hair , wearing only a blue shirt , added the only modern touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil over the logs , struck a match on his hard bare heel , and leaped away to avoid the sudden burst of flame . The cries of the mourners rose in pitch , and startling loon-cries came from several points in the circle . Those that cried thus publicly proclaimed the expectancy of their own early death . But the most dramatic incident at Yellow Road 's cremation came with awesome suddenness out of the sky . A great ball of fire rose from somewhere in Nevada , arched across the valley and exploded with a scalp-twitching crash against a black mountain in Arizona . There followed a whole series of sharp detonations and long rumbling echoes . No one seemed to give much regard to either the lightning or the thunder . South Boy looked around the circle of mourners and saw each one weeping after his own manner , oblivious to the display overhead . He saw Havek , head down on his folded arms . He saw Maria for the first time that day . She wore shoes and a black dress . Her hair was loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was crying into a lace-bordered handkerchief , like a white woman .   There were two people not in the circle . One was the policemanand the other was the woman with the new baby . They were just outside , to the north , the woman sitting on a little mound nursing her baby , weeping , talking , and chewing gum . The policeman was standing up , looking around the circle of mourners very intently . South Boy , who yesterday would have joined the mourners , ran over to stand with his friend the policeman . The policeman gave his arrival no heed , but the woman started talking to him right away : " I ca n't stand up and cry . The baby pulls on me and my belly walks around a little yet  --  " South Boy said to the policeman , " What are you looking for ? " " The doctor 's left . I told him to go . Now I got to see who 's fixing to take out after him as soon as the burning is over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not if I catch ' em first , " said the policeman . Then he added , " flow come you 're not standing with Havek ? He 's over there . " South Boy hesitated . " Well , he 's a relative . The crying women got him . " He looked down at the woman and said , " Does she understand English ? " " No . Too old . Never went to school . " " Well , " said South Boy in as confidential a tone as the noise would permit , " up there , up-river , we found a witch 's pouch that the Piute left . Havek went kind of loco . I got him down to Hardyville and then down here . I had a hell of a time with him . I think he 's all right , but now that I have got him with his folks I feel like I want to stay shed of him until I 'm sure he 's all over it . " " You did all right , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grown men I know would have left him andrun . Down-River-Old-Man told me about it . He said you didwell . He said he cured the boy of the witchin ' . Is that right ? " " How do I know he was witched ? " asked South Boy sul-P169lenly . " I think maybe the Mormonhater told him something that threw a big scare into him . " " Maybe the Mormonhater witched him . There 's lot of stories being told around about that old man . " " Them 's lies , " denied South Boy hotly . " He may have scared Havek , but he never witched him . Fact is , I saw him pretty near sweating blood trying to unwitch him . " " Maybe , but I say Down-River-Old-Man unwitched Havek , and I 'm going to stick to it . I 'm going to tell Yellow Road 's kin , Down-River-Old-Man was busy curing a young man of your family who had been witched by a Piute . That 's how come he had to let the old man die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mojaves killing Mojaves is no good . Besides , it 's against the law . " South Boy listened to the mourners for some time . Then he said , " Joe , you sure are smart . I want to go to Phoenix to school , or to Haskell , like you did . " The policeman turned and stared at him full-faced . " Hey , you ca n't ! Those schools are for Indians . You ai n't Indian ! " South Boy muttered , " That 's right . " He felt as though anotherdoor had been slammed in his face . The fog of doubt and uncertainty began to creep over him again . It was then that he saw the alyah , which was a bad thing for him , in that state of mind . The fire had burnt out its first eagerness . The wailing and shrieking of the mourners had subsided into a crooning , sobbingmonotone of weeping . A sand devil rose up from the flats , gathered a whirling cascade of sparks from the ashes of the ramada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tahoma of a gaunt old woman . She threw it to the ground and stamped out the fire with big , bare , bony feet . The feet were a man 's feet . South Boy asked sharply , " Is that a woman ? " " Sure , " said the policeman uncomfortably . " Sure . " South Boy said , " She looks like a man . " P170The woman spoke up . " That 's an alyah . Do n't you know anything ? " The policeman said angrily , " I thought you did n't understandEnglish ! " " I understand man ' and woman . ' I think you lied to this boy . " " She 's a woman on the agency rolls , all right , " the policemanreplied hotly . " How the hell am I supposed to know any difference ? " South Boy said : " I never saw an alyah before that I know of . I thought they were entirely of the Old Times . " This last he said in Mojave for the benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the woman . The policeman 's face grew taut with anger . " You 're damn right , they do n't . I 'd like to catch ' em at it ! We ca n't do anything about the old ones , but there ai n't going to be any more of them . " " Who would want to make a woman out of a man ? " asked South Boy . " That 's nonsense  --  like making a burro out of a horse . " " It 's the women , " said the policeman . " What 's he saying about ? " the new mother demanded ; so South Boy repeated his own question in Mojave . " Caw ! This is how it happens . The boy is an alyah since the First Times . When he comes to the age for dreaming , he dreams he wore a skirt in Mutavilya 's house . So his mother called in four alyahs , if there are four among the people at that time . Otherwise they call in enough old women who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night over the boy while his mother and his grandmother make him a skirt . In the morning he puts on the skirt , dances four times around the fire and out of the house , and he is an alyah . I have n't seen it done , but many old people have told me about it . " " Ugh ! " said the policeman , both embarrassed and angry . " Do n't you go telling any white people about this ! They loveP171to dig up dirt about us . But I 'll tell you the truth  --  it was the women who made alyahs . " Take a woman who had an only son , or a youngest son she wanted to keep around her camp  --  keep him from going traveling or going off to live with some girl . She started working on him when he was still young , let him sit like a woman beyond the time when he should have been taught to sit like a man , taught him to think and talk like a woman and to do things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like traveling and war . Then he dreams he is an alyah . Sure ! The women have worked on him until he ca n't dream no different . " South Boy was silent , thinking this over . Suddenly the flaming mass of the cremation fire broke in the middle . It sent up a great shower of sparks as it cascaded into the fire hole . The women began weeping bitterly again , crying , " Gone , gone , gone ! Never-to-be-named . Gone , gone ! " And the wailing of the mourners rose to a sharp , brief crescendoand then rapidly died away . The circle began breaking up . People gathered into little clusters or wandered slowly about , singly or in groups . The great bed of coals in the fire hole still glowed fiercely . Four men stood around it leaning on long-handled shovels , ready to fill the hole and carefully obliterate every evidence of its existence as soon as the coals were ashes . One small group of men that had gathered together in a close huddle suddenly moved off towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There they go ! " said the policeman softly . He jumped from the mound and ran for his horse . " Joe ! " cried South Boy . " Joe ! Let me come too ! " The policeman shook his head and said without turning around , " No , I do n't want no witness on this kind of a deal . " South Boy looked frantically around for someone , but the whole world was moving this way and that on its own business . He looked down at the mother . She was grinning and chuckling at her baby while the tears were still wet on her face . He caught a glimpse of Havek in a group of his younger relatives moving slowly toward the edge of the mesa  --  their heads low , still weeping . He saw the Whisperer and Maria and the poor relations walking away together . They would have welcomed him , but he could not bear the thought of Maria 's sharp questions nor the sickening oglings of the fat girl . I lc looked for Heepa , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely alone . Everyone was going , and he could n't stay in that place of death . Even the ashes of the shed and granary were wandering away , blown this way and that by the occasional purposeless puffs of hot wind . It was growing darker . Panic-stricken by the thought , " They may have burnt my property ! " South Boy ran to the place where the granary had been and there he found a bunch of sweat and tear-stained schoolboys helping themselves to his traveler 's rations and his canteen , for food and water are the property of the hungry and thirsty . But his cartridge bag had been carefully laid out of harm 's way . The boys immediately began shouting all at once . " Hey , South Boy ! Hey , we pulled your stuff out from in under so they would n't burn it . Who gave you all the bullets ? Le 's see the gun ! " One of them hospitably offered him his own grub bag . He put his hand in it and finding no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prudently rolled the bag up and shoved it into his hip pocket . The boys milled around him , shoving one another aside . " Let me carry your gun , South Boy . . . . No , me . . . . We heard you did a Great Thing up-river . . . . Did you shoot the Piute with that gun ? Tell us truly ! " South Boy said , " No , I did n't shoot no Piute with no gun . " He winced because he thought about the gun he 'd forgotten . Then he said , to bolster his self-esteem , " He had this gun . "   " Ah , ah ! " shrieked the admiring chorus . " He took the gun from the Piute . A Great Thing ! " " Where did you hear about this business , anyway ? " The boys looked at one another and asked the source of the news ; but no one seemed to remember who first heard it , nor from whence it came . South Boy was thinking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how does it travel so fast ? In this case Havek would have said nothing about the fight during the course of the morning , and Joe had had no opportunity to tell about it , even if he would . Yet these boys know at least something of it .. . He tried to keep his mind busy with this puzzle as he moved off toward the trail in the midst of the milling mob of admirers who kept shoving one another to get close to him , quarreling over who was going to have the honor of carrying the big gun . South Boy said he would carry his own damn gun , but he gave the bullet bag and the empty canteen to eager hands . On the way down the switchback trail the shoving got so violent that one boy nearly fell over the cliff . " Stop it ! " shouted South Boy . " Do you want somebody killed ? " Silently the boys fell into single file , some before him , some following . Last week they would have told him to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his surprise South Boy found that he was n't any too sure that he liked his new status . " Four days ago I 'd have been skylarkingand carrying on with the rest of than . Now I walk in their midst like an old man , and they look at me out of the corners of their eyes . " It made hint feel the more lonely . To add confusion to this loneliness , there carte again out of the back of his mind the question , Where ? Where to ? Where am I going ? By the time they were down on t he flat t lie boys had forgotten the reproof from the " new ratan " and were shrieking at one another in English and school-jargon Mojave , in competition with the rolling thunder that was now almost incessant . There were no doubts about their destination . They were headed for a swim in the slough  --  down a trail that was only visible when the lightning played . It was black-dark now , and out of the black , stinking stillness came a gust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a hail of sticks , sand , cactus burrs , and gravel . A bunch of mistletoeas big as a bushel basket ripped away from a dying mesquiteand came sailing over his head with a great swo-o-o-osh ! A chain of lightning illuminated a world in motion in which only a line of bent human figures stood still . It dissolved into blackness with a teeth-rattling , earsplitting crash . South Boy felt his face burn with anger against the wind that beat him . He wanted to fight something . The boys were crying out all around him , half in pain , half in glee . Then the wind went as suddenly as it came . More distantlightning began flickering in the sky , and the boys started for the lagoon again . Somebody said the wind had given him a worse beating than he 'd ever got from the school disciplinarian . Another , whose voice South Boy immediately identified as belonging to a well known braggart named Sheridan , said that the wind was nothing . He was tough . He would stand against that wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest . The rest hooted and jeered and called him a liar . Everybody was enjoying himself very much but South Boy , who had begun listening to what came from the back of his mind : Am I headed back home ? Will they put a collar around my neck and laced shoes on my feet , a satchel in one hand and a railroad ticket in the other ? Will I live to come back ? And if I do will I be wearing a black coat and carrying a Bible in my hand ? Again the air was dead and heavy . South Boy pushed throughp175it toward the lagoon . The lightning had ceased for the moment , and out of the limitless darkness he conjured up a picture of a young man in a black suit sitting on a red plush chair in a ranch-house parlor , talking to women about the affairs of women and drinking tea . Who drank tea but women and preachers ? Then the real world flared up before him in a flash of light . He was standing on the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he stood by , leaning on his rifle . His stress of mind goaded him to gather his possessions . The boy who carried the canteen came up . South Boy seized it and dropped it at his feet . The boy carrying the bullet bag came by . He seized it and laid it on the canteen . He stood there while the yelling boys tore off their clothes , or part of their clothes , and one after another jumped into the water . What then is a preacher but a sort of alyah of the mind who is made to live in the world of women ? thought South Boy . Then , he remembered what the policeman had said : this business was the fault of the women  --  they taught him to think and talk like a woman and to like the things that women like and hate the things that men do . And he thought , All this business of Cultural Advancement and Christian Instruction  --  two roads that lead me into the world of women . And was n't I warned plenty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should fortify myself against it ? Slowly he began to strip off his clothes , adding his shirt and overalls to the pile of his possessions . Then he snatched the handkerchief from his mud-caked head and threw it down . Well , nobody will make a tea drinker out of me ! And he leaped into the lagoon , and the soup-warm water closed over his head . For a long time he lay suspended in the water , spread out like a resting frog , slowly rising to the surface . Here I am between two worlds . I have no place . I have set my foot on three roads , and they have been blocked to me . If the fourth road leads to a black coat and a cup of tea , I 'll leave it . I will go down the river to the Cocopah country where the deer are as big as burros and the wild pigs run through the brush like fleas through a dog 's hair  --  where the lion , the spotted tiger , and the spotted cat live as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt worse than ever , for there came to his mind the uprooted cottonwood rollinghelplessly and hopelessly down-river . . . the Cocopa country . . . the land of the outlaw and the exile . In the midst of his depression there came to him a trick by which he might open the road that led to the Phoenix Indian school . He would cross the river and borrow or steal some of the waterproof black dye used by the Chemehuevi basket makers . Then he would ride a log down-river to the Parker reservationand go live with Heepa . He would establish himself an identity as Heepa 's son and later go and claim entrance in the Phoenix school where he would be among Indian strangers and not white strangers , where they turn out a policeman and not a preacher . " So I set my foot on the third road again , " he said , and swam toward the bank feeling much better , his imagination busy with the elaboration of this scheme . As his hands struck the mud another sand devil roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank , making them yell with real pain . The loudest yell was in the rasping , changing voice of Sheridan , the bragger . Someone said : " There 's Sheridan who bragged so loud . Let 's catch him and stake him out of the playa where the next wind will get him good ! We 'll find out if his hide is as tough as he says . " There was a rush of feet , a thud of bodies striking the earth , and an angry , frightened squall from Sheridan . South Boy jumped up on the bank and felt the first big drops of rain strike his face . " Cut it out ! " he ordered . " Get your clothes on . When the rain comes hard , this will be a bad place . " One of the older boys said : " Surely . That 's the truth ! Two big arroyos run right in here . " So the boys let go of SheridanP177and began hopping around like kangaroo rats , snatching at scattered garments whenever they were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If I 'd had my eyes on the outside of my head I 'd never have come down into this rat trap . " He pulled on his shirt and sniffed the air when his nose came out . It was still hot , but there was a new smell to it that overcame the stink of stagnant water and rotting vegetation . " Yes , it 's going to rain like hell . " His mind was easier , but his body was dog-tired . The boys started chattering about who or what had caused the storm , and immediately someone suggested the doctor , Down-River-Old-Man , had brought it on out of spite . Sheridan rasped out , " They should have killed him . " Someone said , " Who ? Why did n't you do it ? " Sheridan said : " Caw ! That 's not my business . Let some old man do it . " Two or three of the boys spoke up , declaring that Yellow Road 's kin should have killed the doctor before dark as they knew he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan said , " Aw , they 're afraid ! " A great and continuous flash of chain lightning arcked back and forth overhead , and there in the dazzling brightness stood Havek with his arrowless bow in his hand . He looked big , angry , and entirely his old self . His voice boomed out , " Who says my people are afraid ? " Nobody spoke up , and the darkness crashed down with the thunder . By the time of the next flash Havek had come closer , and there he saw South Boy for the first time . South Boy saw his eyes dilate and a shadow of the witching terror cross his face . The blackness covered them . As soon as the thunder died down South Boy said , " My friend  --  Hawk Strikes  --  my friend , " as though he were addressing a distinguished man whom he had not seen in some time.  | All around him he heard the boys murmuring , " His no his name  --  he named his name . " When the lightning came again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : " This is a rats ' hole in a What did you let them come here for ? " " That 's what I 'd like to know , " said South Boy . " Let'em out of it . "  | THE STORM AND GODTHEY crossed a naked playa and then a wide fan of sand and gravel that the two arroyos had spewed out across the flat in past storms . The gusts of wind came in increasing frequency . They came crazily from every direction . There was no rhythm in their occurrence . Some passed overhead with a whooping rush and scattered trash on the hurrying line of fugitives . Some pelted their backs or tore the sand from under their feet and threw it into their faces . Havek ran at the head of the line of boys , pushing the end of his bow through the sand before him . The place was called " Side-winders-sleep-here . " Once he stirred one of the thick , vicious little snakes out of its ambush in the sand , broke its back , deftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung it into the darkness . South Boy brought up the end of the line  --  the place of the second-in-command on a dangerous trail . He sent word travelingahead to Havek : " There 's a rincon in the bluff where the mesa bends . That 's a good place . " Word came traveling back , " That 's good , if the wind does n't come out of the west . " As this message passed from mouth to mouth some words would be heard high and clear in a moment of silence , some would come strained and distorted through a rush of wind , and some would be blanked out entirely by the thunder or the rolling echoes that came after the thunder . South Boy did not get the whole of it till it was shouted out by the boy ahead of him , who limped stolidly along  --  a mesquitethorn through his foot . Two or three of the boys began to complain that the blind/o ing flashes and sudden blackouts hurt their eyes . The irrepressibleSheridan raised his voice , insisting that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire play means nothing  --  " South Boy sent word ahead : " Hardyville-old-man said bad rain coming . So shut up ! " Then the wind came out of the west , very suddenly and with devastating force , bringing rain mixed with wind-blown sand . Havek turned directly and ran east along the southern border of the wash , the line following him , running lightly before the wind . The bluff of the mesa rose directly ahead and there was the arroyo 's gap like a V-notch in a rifle sight . South Boy screamed with the wind , " There 'll be all hell pouring through that place in a minute . " The answer came traveling back , " There 's a trail on the bank that 's out of the wind . " Two minutes later South Boy found his feet were on a trail that many feet had cut into the south bank of the arroyo in past times . It was fortunate that the trail was in the lee of the bank , for the rain shot directly off the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over South Boy 's head to strike the opposite bank with the force of a stream from a hydraulic jack , tearing into the hard matrix and dumping a flood of mud and rock into the churning stream that was alreadyfilling the wash below . There on the trail South Boy stood almost dry . A fine mist , sucked into the partial vacuum under that curtain of winddrivenrain , felt like sea-fog on his face . It was cold . He was thinking , This should feel good after such a hot day . But it was too cold . He shivered , miserably , feeling all alone again , shut in by an impenetrable wall of sound . Slowly , heads down , like a file of ghosts , the fugitives from the storm moved up the trail in the eerie , pulsing light . One after another stopped , shouted toP181the one behind , then dropped to the trail and stretched out , , belly down . The boy with the thorn in his foot shouted to South Boy : " Havek says we 're high enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the arroyo when the wind changes . " South Boy lay down . He had a gnawing , sickening , uneasy feeling . At the next bright flash he looked over into the wash .. The stream , boiling along twenty feet below , was already undercuttingthe bank . " Another rats ' hole , " he said . " I got to . tell Havek . " He went forward , dragging his rifle and all his . possessions over protesting bodies . Hardly had he gone ten feet when the wind changed and drove the full , suffocating force of the rain right into his face . There was no prevailing against it . A vivid flash of lightning showed a boulder half the size of a flour barrel set in the bank four or five feet above him . Slowly he climbed up to it , realizing for the first time that he was badly spent . He draped his body over the rock , took out his clasp knife and began digging a hole back of it . When the hole was large enough he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , with one arm over his rifle , he curled his body around the rock . It was still warm from long days in the blazingsun and felt amazingly comfortable to South Boy 's belly . The beginning of terror came during a lull in the wind when the boy called Sheridan suddenly got to his feet and announced that the rest of them could lie there like pregnant women . He was going back to the Fort and sleep under a roof . Several yelled to him that nothing could stand against the wind up on the mesa , but he started up the trail , stumbling over bodies , yelling he was a man who did n't fear the wind . A blast came straight down the wash . Sheridan screamed and went down . It was black for a moment  --  South Boy could see nothing , but he heard the gravel whistling by like bullets . Ap182stone the size of a pigeon 's egg struck him on the shoulder . It hurt . Someone shouted that Sheridan had been hit on the head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havek and another boy holding him down . When the thunder died away South Boy heard someone singing , the words rising over the rush of wind and the wash of rain . It was the ordinary singing  --  about the half-human creatures of the First Times , yet it was a death song . The boy who sang was " throwing away his dream " in expectation of death . The tone and the cadence carried his mood . Ahead someone began cursingthe doctor , naming his dead kin , accusing him of causing the storm . Then , all at once , everybody began singing , a strange discordantjumble of sound that beat against the roar of water and the wail of wind , pulsating as did the light with the crash and fall of the thunder . The boys were throwing away their dreams , for the trail had caved in above and below . So Death was there , and there was no use fighting against it . Final and horrible as is the Mojave conception , it was an understandableand natural thing . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula that controls the forces of nature when God gave out knowledge in the First Times  --  he had released this blind fury . There was nothing to be done but throw away your dreams and curse this bitter , revengeful old man and hope that the living would kill him for his misdeeds . South Boy knew this , the Mojave , way of thinking . It was clear and logical to him . So , fighting his fear , he tried to force this naturalistic fatalism into the back of his mind from whence his terror came . But it was forced out and brushed aside by a torrent of words that came out of that place and raced screaming through his head . " Heathen ! Heathen ! No God to pray to ! " The price of sin !  | " The anger of God ! " Hell ! Hell ! Hell ! Hell-bent are the heathen ! " With these came bits of Bible quotations , snatches from sermons , imprecations of the tent evangelist he had heard in Phoenix , and his mother 's bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the wind lashed his half-long hair about his streaming face . He had let his hair grow long , and he had run away to live in the heathen world . He had doubted the Word . He had comparedthe men of God to the alyah because they drink tea after the manner of women . He had sinned  --  and long hair , the sign and symbol of the heathen world , was whipping his face . Over all the other noise he heard his own voice cry , " 0 God , I 'll cut my hair  --  I 'll cut my hair ! " And the wind died , then , as though it had never been . After that he did n't remember anything , except once , much later , when he found himself down on the trail with two boys sitting on him . There was no rain , no lightning , no thunder . There was noise enough  --  the rush of water that still tore through the arroyo bed and the bumping and grinding of the boulders the water carried with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan'svoice : " How much longer have we got to hold him down ? I 'm tired . " Havek said , " Well , I got tired holding you , too , when you were hit on the head . " " Was South Boy hit on the head ? I thought the stones had quit flying by that time . " " No , it 's something else . Sit still . He 's my friend , and I 'm taking no chances of him falling down there and getting drowned . "  |p184THE  NEW DAYWHEN South Boy awoke the next time he was not sure he was alive , for a warm , heavenly sun beat gently down on his aching back and legs , drawing the pain from them . It was entirely different from the fierce , terrible sun of the desert summer . The heathen lie , he told himself . They say Heaven is a cold , foggy place . So he lay there a long time , for that was the most delightful thing he could imagine doing . Finally he realized his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . It was a painful operation . Every joint was like a gate hinge that needed oiling . He found himself looking up at the crooked , green-brown , up-reaching stem of a greasewood bush . His eyes followed it up to its flat spread of tiny , crinkly green leaves , shining like emeralds in the bright sunlight . And among the emeralds were tiny dots of orange resin , like small gems no man has even seen . Above the sky was the color of turquoise fresh-cut from the mines near Santa Fe . A cloud of fluffed cotton floated across it . This is Heaven as it should be , he thought . Then he heard somebody say in Mojave : " I knew the witchingevil would strike you , too , sooner or later . That is why I came back to find you last night . " He glanced to the left and saw Havek squatting on the gravel , staring anxiously at him . " Do you feel good now ? " " Yes , " said South Boy tentatively , not thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat up and said emphatically , " Fine ! " Then he asked , " How 'd I get up here ? " recognizing that he was up on the floor of the mesa . " The trail started caving in . So we carried you up . "  | " And the rest of them ? " South Boy said this hesitatingly lest he be speaking of the dead , but Havek pointed in the direction of the Fort with his chin and said , " There ! " South Boy got slowly to his feet and stretched his arms high over his head . There at his feet was his rifle , a patch or two of fresh , faint , lightish rust to show for its wetting , the bullet bag , its thick greasy canvas hardly wet at all , and the canteen . He looked at them almost with indifference . " Crazy weather 's gone , " he said . " The world 's all young . " Neither spoke for some time . Then Havek said , " I 'm hun-gry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his hip pocket and pulled out the bag that contained the last remnant of his traveler 's rations . Thereafter he counted each grain of corn and each pumpkin-seed kernel and gave exactly half of them to his friend . They ate , chewing excessively , as though those kernels were the last food in the world . By and by South Boy said : " Once I hit my thumb with a hammer . It hurt terrible . The four days of crazy weather was like that . Then , when my thumb quit hurting , it felt awfully good all at once . Right now I feel all over like my thumb felt then . " Havek said : " Do you feel like traveling ? I have business down at my mother 's camp . " Havek 's face was calm , but his eyes looked eager like the eyes of a hunting dog whose master stands with a gun under his arm wasting time in conversation . South Boy was amazed at the idea that anyone would want to go anywhere or do anything but lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that the pot would be boiling for Havek in his mother 's camp and his clan-uncles would be waiting to sing for him . He said , " It 's sure uncivil of me to delay you , but how am I going to get my legs to travel ? " He pondered this question some time , but the problem kept slipping away from him as he dreamed snatches of daydreamsas pleasant as any he had enjoyed in his childhood.  |p186Finally  the answer came to him . " Get your horses , " he said . Havek looked surprised . " My horses ! " " What you took from the Piute is yours . Look down on the flat , on the V of high ground between the two washes . I bet they 'll be there , by the big mesquite . Get your horses , and let 's ride . " South Boy closed his eyes and drifted off into a sleep that was as soft as the cottony cloud floating over his head . How long he slept , he did n't know ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little stallion and holding the mare 's lead-rope , saying nothing , but with the same eager look in his eyes . South Boy thrust the heel of his left hand against the ground  --  to force himself up . It sank deep into the once-hard mesa . When he was standing , he looked down at the print his hand had made . It was filling with water . For some reason he felt vaguely excited about it . " The mesa 's a sponge , " he said , picking up his equipment and walking over to the mare , who promptly laid her ears back and showed her teeth . For the first time since he was a small child , South Boy felt helpless when confronted by a hostile horse . " I just do n't feel up to fighting her  --  not while I 'm packing all this gear . " Havek rolled off the stallion and stretched forth his hand . South Boy gave him the empty canteen , stuffed the bullet bag inside his shirt , and balancing the woefully heavy rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning as a woman eight months with child " ; and he grunted as he heaved himself on the stallion'sback . Still , he felt good , and he kept thinking about the water oozing into that hand-print as his horse swung over behind the mare and started off at a lope across the mesa . The mare splashed through a pond an acre wide and threep187inches deep . South Boy looked around him . Everywhere , all over the apparently flat expanse were those shallow , waterfilleddepressions  --  little lakes dotted with greasewood bushes like tiny green islands that glistened in the sun . " There never was so much water up here ! " South Boy felt his excitement growing . " Why , the Indian wheat will be up as thick as the hair on a dog 's back inside of two weeks ! " Then the momentous conclusion . " This mesa could feed twenty thousand cows and feed ' em fat , this winter ! " In an ordinary year the rain would have made little difference , for it always strained his father 's credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeder steers for winter fatteningon mesquite browse and alfalfa . But this year there had been a devastating drought in the high country in central Arizona . Word came that a hundred thousand head could be had at panic prices because the steers were too poor and weak to stand the harsh winter up on the plateau . South Boy 's father was there now buying the usual five hundredhead that was all his normal feeding capacity could handle . He would pick and choose , traveling far , taking a few of the strongest and best animals from each ranch .. . " To hell with that ! " cried South Boy . " I got to get word to him about this mesa . Tell him to buy all he can as cheap as he can  --  anything that can walk . And to hell with giving the railroadshipping money . We drive . Every gully 's full of water . . . " The drumming hoofs of his loping horse began to beat out a joyous refrain : We 're gon na get rich ! We 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , clean , wonderful world , with all the gray dust washed away and each mesa pebblebright with its own true color  --  as bright as the vivid red ,  | yellow , purple , and red-brown of the distant mountains ; but he no longer saw it . His mind was working like a ball mill on the problem of getting three or four thousand , or maybe even five thousand starved , frightened , weak , and wobbly longhornedcattle through those same mountains , where the trail was too narrow and too steep . " By grab , we got to hold ' em and feed ' ern up first , " he said . Before he knew it they were off the mesa and down through the wash where the smoke tree grew , down on the flat at the place called Aha-vel-pah , where the swale was now a small lake all around the three cottonwoods , where two killdeers rose on their long wings , screaming . South Boy said aloud : " Well , that 's a job for me . A swell job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a job for you , too , Havek . " Havek turned around on his mare and said , " Khootch ? " politely . " By damn , I 'll make you rich , too . I 'll get you a job that 'll bounce dollars into your war bag . " Havek looked alarmed . " No . I 'm not crazy . I got a deal in mind . There 'll be a holding-ground for you and me to keep , across the mountains . . . " No , " said Havek . " My business is here . " And he pointed down-river , toward his mother 's camp , with his chin . South Boy shut his mouth . Yes , there would be the boiling pot and the singing uncles waiting for him down there . He would sing his dreams every night for four nights , and he would be feasted at every rancheria where he had kin  --  clear down to Parker and below . He was a New Man who had done a Great Thing . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not mean a thing to you now . " Then all at once it came to South Boy that he and Havekp189had come to the fork of their trail . They would go on being friends , of course . But they would shake hands solemnly and awkwardly when they met and not know exactly what to say to each other . Once there had been no difference between them . Last year , at the Great Cry  --  the annual celebration for the year 's distinguisheddead  --  they had sat together with the other boys , holding the feathered wands for the young-men-who-run . Next summer , when the celebration would be in commemorationof the great Yellow Road , with singing and running and " preaching " and a drama of great deeds , Havek would be a young-man-who-runs . South Boy would be sitting on his horse among the white men , just watching . " You know , " he said , thinking aloud , " there might be a halfwaybetween . You might go to Phoenix and when you come back get a government job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy come alongside . " You mean , like Joe the policeman ? " South Boy nodded hopefully . " No . Too much white man ! " There was nothing much to say after that , and in a short space they came across the Yavapai year-around hand , lolling in a saddle on a big blue roan , looking scornfully at the muddy little Piute ponies . South Boy said , " I wo n't take you out of your way no farther , " slid off the horse , handed Havek the rope , and took the canteen . Havek neither spoke nor looked back , but beat the mare into a run and eagerly disappeared among the mesquite . South Boy climbed up behind the Yavapai and said , " Get me home in a hurry . " Though it was midmorning , smoke was rising from the rusty stovepipe that thrust itself through the roof of the summerp190kitchen . The Foreman 's best horse , mud-caked to the belly , wearing the Foreman 's go-to-town saddle , stood by the door with drooping head and hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked South Boy , sliding off the roan . " To Needles for telegraphing , " said the Yavapai . South Boy said , " Good  --  he got the idea , too , " and he dropped his gear by the doorstep and ran inside . The Foreman was sitting at the far end of the table , a lank forelock drooping over his grim face and his mouth open to receive the thick chunk of bacon impaled on his fork . he looked up when he heard the door slam , his eyes widening . " Where in hell have you been ! You got my woman scared pie-eyed . " " To Hardyville , visiting , " said South Boy , and added eagerly , " Didya get a telegram through ? Didya tell him the mesa was just sopping ? Didya tell him to buy anything that can walk and to figger on driving and saving shipping money ? And what did the Old Man say ? " At this point the fat cook , who had covered her face with her hands and sunk silently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a shrill howl of relief . " He lives ! Santa Maria-JesusJose , the Baby lives ! Merciful Mother , what would I have said to the Nina if he had been lost ! Oh , the stinking hand of Judas that made me throw that pot . . . " She went on like that for some time , calling South Boy " the Baby " and his mother " the Virgin , " very much contrary to fact , but according to the usual custom of Mexican servants . South Boy paid no heed to her whatever but anxiously watched the Foreman 's face . The Foreman had the look of one of those captive eagles often seen tied to a stump in an Indian camp  --  sullenly , bitterly resigned to defeat . " You could n't get through to Needles ? " The Foreman grumbled a sullen negative . " Could n't get across the river ? "  | " Could n't get to the damn river ! The whole lower bottom is a bog . " South Boy saw that the Foreman was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They usually came on when he had tried very hard to do something important and had failed . South Boy said to himself , Well , I reckon it 's up to me . He reached for the coffee pot and poured himself a cupful of coffeewithout taking the trouble to sit down . The cook , making setting-hen noises , filled a plate full of bacon and grits and shoved it over in front of him . " I bet you could get through to Topock Station , or maybe Goldroads . They got telegraphs at both places . Telephones , even . " No answer from the Foreman , who still chewed on the same piece of bacon . " Hell , we got to get word to him , " South Boy insisted . " You can live a lifetime and never get a chance like this again . " " Sure ! Sure ! And when the chance comes , the cards is all stacked against you . I start out at daybreak all full of vinegar , and then , about the third time my horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use ! Suppose I do get to Needles ? The line 's down , sure . And how do I know I can get through to the Boss anyway ? All I can do is to wire him care of the stationmasterat Ash Fork . How 'd I know he 'd ever get it ? Maybe he 's in Prescott by this time . Maybe a hundred miles down the Sandy  --  " South Boy turned to the cook almost in panic . " Time um botte pa'ya ? " The cook had n't understood a word of the foregoing conversation , but she knew her man 's condition and its usual cure . " Uhn  --  quisa  --  media botte , " she whispered , looking apprehensivelyat the rigid , deep-lined face and glassy , far-staring eyes . " Traernelo pronto , " urged South Boy , and he drank more coffee to warm his hope.  | She stole away like a fat , frightened cat and came back with a quart bottle of whisky , dust-covered and more than half full  --  evidence that the Foreman had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four fingers in a water glass and set it in front of him . There were minutes of almost stifling silence and immobility like paralysis . The Foreman sat like a statue of pale-eyed doom in a red-stitched black shirt and handlebar mustaches . Then his hand reached out for the glass , and he drank with one great gulp . South Boy 's sigh was like a small explosion . He began wolfinghis neglected bacon and grits . The Foreman 's pale eyes slowly grew brighter and milder , and the little sun-wrinkles around them relaxed and the granite contours of his face softened . Finally he reached for the bottle and poured himself another drink . " What 's the matter with me ? " he demanded . " We can ride over to Goldroads , and if the wire 's down , we can go on to Kingman and just keep pestering the operator until we do get the Old Man . " " Why , sure ! " agreed South Boy . " And I know another good reason why he can pick up a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big operators have decided they got to go in for better and fewer cows . Goingto clean out all the longhorns on them high ranges . Going to stock whiteface in the spring . . . . Say , how much I got coming to me on the books ? " " Two hundred sixty-six dollars , " said South Boy promptly . " By grab , that ought to buy me a hundred head of starvedoutdogies , and I 'll have a hundred fat yearlings to sell in the spring ! " South Boy knew that the time had come for him to present the great plan he had thought out on the way home ; so he drew up a chair and leaned across the table . " Look ! We ca n't shove that weak stuff across the mountainsp193all at once . We 'd lose a lot of them , and , anyway , we 'd have to lay out a lot of cash money to hire a big drive crew . What we ought to do is to have a holding ground over in the breaks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ai n't been grazed lately on account of no water near . Of course , all the holes will be full now  --  " " There ! " exclaimed the Foreman , his face turning red with sudden enthusiasm . " There ! What have I been telling everybody ? You 're smart ! You 're turning out to be worth all the trouble I 've took in raising you ! " " And I 'm the feller to keep that holding ground ! " " And I know just the place ! A trap valley that ai n't seen a cow in ten years ! " " Listen to the rest of this idea ! The Old Man operates the buying end , and maybe with one extra hand shoves the stuff along to the holding ground as fast as he can . Then you and the Yavapai operate from here to the holding ground . I 'll keep busy cutting out the strongest stuff and you-all can come over every four or five days and snake a bunch of ' em over the pass  --  " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome job  --  " " Yes , I figger up into November , anyhow . Way past the time when a feller 's got to go away to school . " " Oh , so that 's it ! " The Foreman thumped his fist on the table and roared . " Well , you got to have a man who can take responsibility on that feeding ground , or you 're going to lose a lot of do-gies- " Sure , sure . Ai n't no question about it . " " And here 's another thing . There 's six hundred dollars carried on the books marked school money . ' So long as I 'm going to be busy over on the holding ground , why , the Old Man can just as well spend that on panic cows . This ai n't no time to have money idling . " " Son , it wo n't take much talk to make the Old Man see thatpI94kind of a proposition . I reckon he 'll see to it you have a herd of your own to peddle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached across the table and solemnly shook South Boy by the hand . All this time the cook was fussing around making clucking noises . She filled South Boy 's plate again , and he heard her saying : " Eat ! Eat ! For the love of God . You are a disgrace to me . You look like a half-starved son of the poor with that hair hanging around your face . " So South Boy 's hand went up to his half-long hair and his face went blank , for he remembered then that he had made a bargain and had not yet fulfilled his part of it . It was dark in his mother 's room , and the thick curtains over the window , the adobe walls , and the door that had not been opened all summer held in yesterday 's heat . The dead air smelt of dust and lavender scent . South Boy tiptoed in , found a pair of scissors in the sewing basket on the table and tiptoed out and down the bare hall to his own room . Here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood in front of the mirror over the bowl and pitcher stand . He seized a lock of hair between the woundstiffenedthumb and forefinger of his left hand and whacked it off as close as he could . The effect was not pleasing , but he went on , whacking away as best he might , all around his head . Then he addressed the ceiling . " That 's a sorry wreck of a haircut , but I reckon it 'll hold up my end of the deal until I can get to Kingman . I 'll keep my hair short and keep heathen ideas out of my head from now on . And if you remember , I did n't make no promises about not getting out of being sent away to school , so I 'll take it kindly if you do n't jim up that holding-ground job . " Then his eyes fell on the bullhide sandals still on his feet . These , too , were part of the heathen world . He kicked them off and shoved them under the washstand with as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . He sat down on his bed  --  disturbing a thick covering of dust that had collected since he had last slept there in the early spring  --  fished a pair of worn half-boots with high , runover heels from beneath it , pulled them on his feet and went clumping back to his mother 's room to replace the scissors . The scent of lavender sachet brought tears to his eyes . She would be coming back soon , and he would n't be there . She would be bitterly disappointed , and she would be worried half sick because he was out in the breaks alone , with a bedroll , a stock saddle and a fire hole for a home . " Well , I 'm a man , and there ai n't nothing she can do but get used to it , " he said as he wiped his eyes on his sleeve and softly closed the door . " And it wo n't be near as tough on her as if she found I was dead , or turned Indian  --  or something halfway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was past he and the Foreman were riding east on the trail to Goldroads and Kingman . The sun warmed South Boy 's back , and he was thinking of nothing excepthow comfortable it was to be riding in a saddle like a white man . He heard the quail calling back and forth ; and through the mesquite from the direction of Havek 's mother 's camp came the distant sound of Mojave singing . Both were pleasant  --  neither registered strongly on his mind . By and by the Foreman started singing in a booming voice , " Green grows the grass in the valley , oh . " South Boy did n't join him . He could n't sing , and he did n't care . The mention of green grass started hint thinking  --  We 're gon na get rich , we 're gon na get rich  --  in cadence with the easy gait of his horse , and , swaying gently to its motion , he dropped off into a sound sleep  --  like a baby in its cradle.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
