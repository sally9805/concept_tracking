their social interests . Cateau was still under the Count 's roof , officially still the mistress of his house ; but in their daily lives the separation seemed to be absolute . By the time that Magdelon and Madame de la Louppe had arrived , the yellow cabinet was already quite full . The ladies made their way through the crowd to the alcove where Cateau was receiving , with the Prince de Marsillac on one side of the great golden couch and the young Comte de Guiche on the other . At her feet lay her latest acquisition , a small lemon-coloured spaniel named Mouche ( the gift of Guiche , who declared it exactly matched his mistress 's hair ) ; curled up in a tranquil crescent , like a dog carved in stone on a tomb , it watched the guests with limpid , unresentful eyes . Cateau herself was looking beautiful in a new dress of stiff white brocade sewn all over with brilliants ; she was wearing her diamonds and carried a small spangled fan , with which she beat the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and flirted impartiallywith her two gallants . She bestowed a languishing smile apiece on her mother and sister  --  exactly as if she had never seen them before  --  and greeted them in the high drawling mew she was accustomed to employ in public . ' Ah , my dears , you 've come just in time ! ' she exclaimed . ' The Chevalier is about to read us the famous " portrait "  --  or no , I forget : he calls his creation a " character . " Is not that appallingly affected ? I tell him , too , it strikes fear to my heart  --  for I 've no character to lose ! ' ' It may be , madam , you 'll gain one instead , ' suggested Guiche consolingly ; while the Chevalier added in his quiet voice  --  which , nevertheless , always seemed to Magdelon to be making fun of them all  --  : ' My dear child , one must at least strive for originality when attempting to describe the " great original " of our century . ' Cateau laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did Magdelon , though she was not sure why she was laughing . There were so many people in the room that it was not easy for the newcomers to find seats . Magdelon and Madame de la Louppe glanced inquiringly this way and that , and were still uncertain whither to turn when Monsieur de Beuvron appeared , bowing gravely before them , and suggested that he had some chairs to offer them next the window . Magdelon smiled at the dark , dignified young man , and gave him her hand ; she had always liked Beuvron best of all Cateau 's friends : it was a pleasure to see him again . No sooner had the ladies seated themselves with a rustle of silk and a flutter of ribbons than Cateau rapped smartly on the bedpost to silence the expectant hum of conversation , and the Chevalier rose to begin the reading . He held his manuscript quite close to his eyes ,  |p301because  , though it was rather dark in the yellow cabinet , his hostess had refused to have candles brought ( preferring the subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering gown , while cleverly leaving her feminine guests in semi-obscurity ) . " I doubt if I shall be more fortunate in drawing your character than our artists in painting your portrait , in which task I may say that the best of them have lost their reputation , " ' read Saint-Evremondsmoothly . " ' Up to now we have not beheld beauties so perfectas not to be forced to seek to acquire certain graces on canvas or to rid themselves of certain defects . You alone , madam , are above the arts that have power to flatter and embellish ; they have never worked upon you save unhappily , nor without injuring you and robbinga faultless person of as many advantages as they are wont to bestow on those who are not without flaw . " If you are scarcely indebted to painters , you are even less so to the splendour of your attire . You owe nothing there either to other people 's skill or to your own industry , and may tranquilly resign yourself to Nature for the pains she has taken in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counsel others to trust in that sort of providence . In fact , most women are agreeable only on account of the charms they manufacture ; whatever they don to adorn themselves hides a defect ; whatever you discard of your finery gives you back some grace , and it is as much your interest to return to the natural self as it is theirs to escape from it . " ' The Chevalier paused for an instant to clear his throat , and as he did so there were subdued murmurs of ' Charming ! Charming ! ' from the feminine part of his audience ; while Cateau , whose habitual restlessnessremained in abeyance for as long as she felt that people were admiring her , fell into an exquisitely classic attitude of reverie  --  chin in hand , eyes dreamy and deliberately faraway . Saint-Evremond , well pleased by the effect of the introduction , proceeded with his string of complimentary phrases .... The Countess'seyes outshone the sun , her complexion was fairer than flowerpetals ... the delicacy of her features . . . the marble purity of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these portraitsand characters , and you will eclipse every possible likeness of your beauty .... " ' Magdelon , her attention wavering slightly , let her eyes wander round the circle of faces in the yellow cabinet , to see how Cateau 's friends were reacting to this complaisant recital of her perfections . Magdelon herself thought it very pretty , but she had a depressed feeling , which frequently assailed her when people were being clever , that she had not a notion how clever they were . ( Maman , too , althoughswooning in ecstasies , had probably stopped listening long ago , and was merely inhaling incense with vicarious pride . ) The Abbe de Boisrobert liked it , of course  --  but then , he was a writer by trade and could appreciate Saint-Evremond 's wit . So did the Chevalierde Gramont and Madame de Fiesque , who had come to the party together . ( Poor Gilette ! Her husband had died in Spain the preceding November , but though she had dutifully gone into mourning for him , her little face under the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she still could not bring herself to believe that this had happened to her . ) ... Margot Cornuel , also , exhibited a tolerant simper for once instead of her usual sarcasticair ; but her lover Vimeuil , whose portrait of Madame d'Olonne had been last week 's sensation in society , was quite naturally seethingwith professional jealousy . Jealousy of another kind was betrayedon the candid , clumsy features of the young Prince de Marsillac ( now a bridegroom of four months ' standing ) , who was glowering at Cateau and the Comte de Guiche , in spite of his uncle Sillery 's warning eyebrows . And Little Manicamp 's unwinking green gaze , fixed steadily on the same spectacular couple , assuredly boded no good to his hostess . However , it was that inseparable pair of companions Cecile de Montglas and Isabelle de Montmorency whose demeanour most disturbed Magdelon 's peace of mind . They were seated together directly in front of Madame de la Louppe , and from where she was sitting Magdelon had an unobstructed view of the series of acidulatedsmiles they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to be expected that the ladies should find it hard to relish Monsieur de Saint-Evremond 's gallant tribute to their friend , since it was well known that Cecile 's portrait , by the illustrioushand of Mademoiselle de Montpensier herself , had contained as many unpalatable truths as the Princess 's pen-pictures of others invariablydid  --  while no one as yet had been found bold enough to be willing to venture on Isabelle 's ! . . . But as the minutes passed Magdelonrealized there was more than passive displeasure here ; a suggestion of sulphurous malevolence pervaded their looks and their whispered asides . Even Maman had begun to notice that something was wrong . She leaned forward , frankly eavesdropping , while Isabellein a hoarse but audible undertone poured into Cecile 's ear a shocking little story concerning one of Cateau 's rendezvous with the Comte de Guiche . Cecile rolled her eyes in return , and both young women clucked and cackled and made scurrilous references to a ' modern Messalina ' and ' **29;7656;TOOLONG ' and ' **44;7687;TOOLONG ... ' that were too pointed to be ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up and said ' Ahem ! ' very loudly , which producedthe desired effect of silencing the scandalmongers . But even after the whispering had stopped , Magdelon could notp303help worrying about what they said . It prevented her from concentrating on Saint-Evremond 's delicate analysis of her sister 's moral qualities , though Maman went on nodding her head triumphantly and glancing with intention towards Cecile and Isabelle while the Chevalier continued : ' " As for your conduct , it is both blameless and agreeable , but since you may slight the small formalities that are real trials in life , you must fear the opinion of fools and the anger of those whom your merit has made hostile to you . ' " Women , who are your declared enemies , arc constrained to admita thousand advantages you have received from Nature . But there are times when we men are obliged to confess that you could take better care of them than you do , and that you do n't make of them what others might . I shall conclude with your caprices , of which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who suffer from them , of course . But , for my part , I find something piquant there , and I see that the more men complain of your temper , the more they are engaged by your person .... People annoy you easily without meaning to , and the hope of pleasing you has even ended more than once in the misfortune of displeasing . " Believe me , a man must be very lucky to find you in a favourablemoment , and very clever if he can contrive to seize it . This much I can truly say after having examined you , that naught is so sad as loving you , but naught so difficult as to keep from doing so .... , , , ' Ahem ! ' said Maman again . ' Ahem ! ' But Magdelon was not listening any more . She felt sick and frightened ; her thoughts revolved endlessly on a new and sinister theme . . . . Had Cateau really three lovers at once ? It seemed hardly credible . . . and yet Magdelon had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately to the Olonnes . She could sec , of course , what the world saw , that the Count and his wife were separatedin everything but name , and that Cateau appeared to have cast prudence to the winds and to take a defiant pleasure in receiving her throng of gallants under her husband 's very nose . She had come back from Forges with Fouquet her acknowledged lover ( which had temporarily restored her social prestige ) ; but she had not therefore broken with Marsillac , as one might have expected her to do : on the contrary , that bemused young man paid court to her more assiduouslythan ever , and during the carnival season just past he had been her constant escort on the wildest of masquerade parties . ( That much Magdelon was sure of , since the maskers had several times dressed at the Hotel de Senneterre , to avoid Brother Louis ' disapprovingeye . ) Guiche , too , had been madly devoted all winter . There had been tales enough current about that affair .... People said that the hand- some stripling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Comtesse d'Olonne  --  that the Duc d'Anjou and Little Manicampwere in despair . And everyone had heard how the dashing young Count had suddenly left the court at Lyon last autumn and rushed back to Paris to keep an engagement to attend a certain lady to Mass at the Church of the Minims in the Place Royale . Ugly rumours started circulating in the alcoves , and the rhymesters of the Pont Neuf  --  who , after all , only echoed their betters  --  had become so libellous that the Marechal had forbidden his wife to read them . Even here , in Cateau 's own drawing-room , hostile female elementshad contrived to creep in that were no less to be feared becausesimple jealousy was their motive power . And Magdelon felt an obscure difference in the attitude of the male guests towards their hostess : Cateau might be admired as much as ever , but she was no longer respected . Though she bore herself as proudly as before , and held her golden head high with all the old nonchalant serenity , it seemed to Magdelon 's excited imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cateau menaced all the more surely because Cateau insisted on remaining unconscious of danger . The reading was at length drawing to a close . Magdelon , who had heard scarcely a word of it , glanced up with a startled blush as the Chevalier embarked on what was obviously his concluding para-graph : " It remains only for me to speak of my boldness in picking out your faults ; I have not been able to restrain myself from doing so , as otherwise I should have been sinning against the rules of the composition of a character , whose success consists in distinguishing good from bad qualities . In any case , I am far more to be pitied than you . You have merely to suffer their recital for a quarter of an hour , whilst I have been forced to pass whole nights discovering them . It was the first difficulty of that nature I ever encountered , and in token of your extraordinary merit , dear madam , I beg you to inscribe in capital letters the following legend : He found my praises natural and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' The Chevalier laid down the sheets of his manuscript with a satisfiedhalf-smile : he knew he was brilliant and that there was no one else who could have composed so witty and penetrating a trifle as this Character of Madame the Comtesse d'Olonne .... Cateau smiled , also , a little vaingloriously , as she had every right to do ; for if it was clever of Saint-Evremond to have written the piece , it was still cleverer of her to have coaxed him into doing what he would not have done for any other woman in Paris . This sketch from the hand of an acknowledged master had quite eclipsed the scores of insipid amateur portraits ' with which the salons had been flooded sincep305Mademoiselle made them the fashion . As a matter of fact , she honestly preferred Vineuil 's less deft but more fulsome flatteries ; the Chevalier had really been rather cruel to her ; but it would not do to take him to task for it , because he was a genius . Everyone thought so . Had not Guiche told her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French prose , the only modern worthy of being ranked with Rabelais and Montaigne ? And Guiche should know what he was talking about , if anybody did , for he had his nose buried in books all day long : worse still , he thought that Cateau ought to read , too ! ... Cateau had done her amiable best to please him , and had actually gone so far as to buy a volume of translations of the Greek philosophers ; but it was uphill work . She would perhaps not have persisted if she had not still smarted when she recalled her lover 's shout of laughter at her confusing Don Quixote with the new Spanish ambassador ... . But never mind that now : her literary party was being a huge success . Servants brought lighted candelabra into the room to add to the gaiety of the scene , and were beginning to pass liqueurs and sweetmeats about on trays . Meanwhile Cateau had only to go on laughing and tossing her head as she accepted the stream of complimentslavished alike on author and subject , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Magdelon pressed forward to join the vociferous group round the Chevalier and his model . ' Matchless , my love , simply matchless ! A veritable gem of the first water ! ' declared Madame de la Louppe , who had dozed during the first half of the reading and made faces at Cecile and Isabelle during the second . ' Dear Chevalier , Raphael could not have done better . But if you 're not careful , this little flaxen head will become sadly turned , I fear ! ' ' Why , Maman , ' said Cateau , ' you ca n't have been listening ! He 's been abusing me like a thief ! I vow , I ought to be dreadfully angry with him  --  ought I not , Chevalier ? ' ' Madam , ' said Saint-Evremond , ' you know what I 've written of you  --  and I stand firmly by what I have written : " People annoy you easily without meaning to , and the hope of pleasing you has even ended more than once in the misfortune of displeasing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cateau ; and Maman tapped him reprovinglyon the shoulder with her folded fan . ' Naughty man ! ' said Maman . ' Do n't you dare make a character of me ! ' Saint-Evremond bowed . ' Impossible , madam  --  I should lose my own vainly in the at-tempt ! ' Madame de Fiesque came skipping up with Gramont in tow.  | ' Delicious , darling ! ' she fluted , batting her eyelashes madly . ' Never was anything more furiously successful ! Poor Mademoiselle will not dare try her hand again , I 'll be bound ! Sir , my most humble compliments .... I 've some verses at home  --  oh , the merest dilettantescribblings , I assure you !  --  on which I 've half a mind to imploreyou to cast a critical eye , when you 've some leisure to give me . Is it asking too great a favour , I wonder ? Perhaps a little afternoon during Lent  --  with only a tiny gathering of truly sympathetic souls  --  and if we begged our prettiest , would you be kind enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( How like Gilette , to rush in and try to make social capital out of someone else 's bright idea ! ) ' And here 's Monsieur de Gramont , who 's positively pining to expresshis enthusiasm to you , himself . " The new Voiture , " he calls you already ! But come , sirs , we women must leave you to savour the pleasures of pure intellect ; our poor conversational powers are no match , alas , we know only too well , for such sparkling repartee as yours ! ' Under cover of the slight flurry caused by the approach of the Abbe de Boisrobert and Little Manicamp , Gilette managed to lean forward and whisper in Cateau 's ear  --  but not so low that Magdelonfailed to catch it  --  : ' My dear , I must speak to you privately , at once ! Something dreadful has happened ! ' Cateau nodded , without changing colour or showing the least sign of surprise or dismay  --  and went on chatting with Maman and the Abbe de Boisrobert . It was Magdelon who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of apprehension that had oppressedher all afternoon suddenly sharpened : she was convinced now it had been only too well justified . ' Something dreadful has happened '  --  yes ; but what could it be ? Gilette 's staring eyes under her black widow 's bandeau gave no clue to the mystery , for her face remainedas null from innate lack of character as Cateau 's did from an obstinately cultivated indolence . There was nothing to do except wait until everybody else had gone home . This seemed to Magdelon to take a very long time , though it was actually not more than half an hour . Madame de la Suze , the poetess , was receiving that same afternoon at her house in the Marais , quite at the other end of town ; and although her party would be a tepid contrast to Cateau 's gay little gathering , most people felt they ought to look in for a moment , because Madame de la Suze was ' one of the Chatillons ' and a granddaughter of old Admiral de Coligny . Besides , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time the epicures of the company  --  which included , first and foremost , Saint-Evremond himself  --  had been distracted by the knowledge that divers subtly extravagant dishes were being pre/pared for their approval below . One by one , therefore , they pressed their hostess 's hand to their lips ( soon to be consecrated to pleasures of a different nature ) and made their adieux , till presently there was nobody left in the yellow cabinet except Madame de la Louppe and her daughters , Gilette de Fiesque , and her cousin Beuvron . ( Magdelonsaw that Guiche and Marsillac had wanted to be allowed to stay , too ; neither would give ground to the other ; but Cateau ended the matter by smilingly dismissing them both . The two rivals exchanged scowls at the door , and then stamped through it simultaneously , leaving Magdelon with an odd feeling , based on nothing at all , that they would never come back .... ) Maman , after surveying the scene through her lorgnette , bestowed a gracious glance of secret complicity upon the pair she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten that the Beuvron affair was ancient history ! ) , and was about to draw Magdelon with her out of the room ; but Cateau raised a detaining hand and said placidly : ' Do n't go , Maman , ' while Gilette burst out : ' Madam , for Heaven 's sake , stop , and give us the benefit of your advice ! Your daughter is in a terrible situation ! ' Surprised , and not a little flattered ( it was so long since anyone had asked her advice about anything ) , Madame de la Louppe made a gesture of acquiescence , seated herself in a high-backed carved walnutchair by the fire , and looked up with an air of intelligent expectancythat would have deceived anybody who knew her less well than her children . Magdelon , shivering , drew unconsciously nearer her sister , as if to protect her from the threatening blow . She could not think what to say . Cateau , who had not moved from her place on the golden couch , remained silent likewise , but not , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouche into her lap , and began caressing its lemon-yellow curls , perhaps as a means of soothingher nerves ( she was not naturally fond of animals ) . But at the same time she lifted her eyebrows and smiled her eternal unmeaning smile , as if everything were exactly as usual in the small world she ruled as queen . It was Beuvron who , turning away from the window whither he had withdrawn with his customary tact , now approached the mother of his former mistress and said , very gently : ' My dear lady , we must all do what we can to help Madame d'Olonne . She will have need , I fear , of our combined good offices in her present dilemma . It may be we can avert the consequences of her imprudence , and the whole affair blow over and prove nothing serious . ' ' Nothing serious ! ' exclaimed Gilette , who had begun to run back and forth on the hearth , like a fowl trying to find its way out of a pen , and to wring her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You know what the Abbe Fouquet has done ! '  | Cateau 's idol-like impassivity did not desert her ; she went on stroking Mouche , as though nothing else mattered ; but Magdelon turned pale at mention of that dread name , and even Maman said : ' Oh , Catherine-Henriette , have n't you broken with him yet ? ' ' And what , ' said Cateau quietly , has the Abbe Fouquet to do with me ? ' ' Ah , my dear , my dear , do n't tell me you have n't heard he 's betrayedyou to the Cardinal and the Queen ! ( I had it direct from my cousin here , who 's just come from court . ) It seems that the wretch has accused you of all kinds of horrors . He 's told the Queen everything  --  everything !  --  about your affairs with Marsillac and Guiche  --  and shown them letters to prove it ! ' Letters ! ' said Cateau . ' I do n't know what you mean . I 've writtenletters to nobody . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spirit . Why , the poor darling scarcely knows how to put pen to paper ! They must be forgeries . Speak up , Cateau , and defend yourself . Tell Madame de Fiesque she does n't know what she 's talking about ! ' ' Oh , ' wailed Gilette , I only wish I did n't ! I did n't say the letters were yours . As a matter of fact , they were n't written by you , but to you , by those two wretched boys . ' Letters to me from Guiche and Marsillac ! How absurd ! How could they have got into the hands of the Abbe Fouquet ? ' I have n't the least idea , ' replied Gilette . Do n't look at me like that : I 've nothing to do with it all . Oh , I do n't know what was in them  --  I do n't even want to know  --  Thank Heaven , this is one mess I 've kept clear of ! All I can tell you is that the Queen and the Cardinal have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least of our worries , is n't it , cousin ? ' She turned to Beuvron . ' Tell them the rest  --  what you heard at the Louvre this morning  --  how the Abbe has exposed his own relations with Catherine-Henriette  --  every detail !  --  and worse  --  how she threw herself at his head last summer at Forges , and went after not only Fouquet , but Monsieur , the Duc d'Anjou , too ! Yes , and how  --  but go on , cousin  --  it 's your story , not mine  --  they 'll believe you if they wo n't believe me , for all the world knows you 've never lied in your life . Oh , CatherineHenriette , I told you Fouquet was dangerous ! I warned you in the very beginning to have nothing to do with a man like that . And now see what 's happened because you would n't take my advice ! ' ' Cousin de Fiesque , calm yourself , I pray ! ' said Beuvron , as Gilette , looking more than ever like a distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack of hysteria . Maman shook an admonishingfinger at the Marquis and murmured , not particularly helpfully : ' Young man , young man , be careful what you say : remember a lady 's reputation is at stake ! ' Beuvron had spoken in his habitual calm , well-bred voice . Magde/lon thought no one could have told he was labouring under an unusualstrain if it had not been that somehow he could not bring himself to look at Cateau . Though he addressed her , his dark , deep-set eyes remained fixed on Maman 's vacuous face . Dear madam , ' he said , forgive me if I speak of matters that must be even more painful to you than they are to me . It is long , too long , since I have been privileged to call you friend ; yet I have never forgotten my early attachment to you , which will last , I dare say , as long as my life . For the sake of that attachment and what it has meant to me all through the years , I feel I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dreadful pass you have come to , whether you know it or not . ' What truth lies in Fouquet 's charges , I neither know nor care to know . But it is my duty to tell you that , as my Cousin de Fiesque has said , he has shown Her Majesty letters addressed to you by various young men , and in so doing has attempted to blacken your character generally . How these letters came into his possession  --  whether through your carelessness or the writers '  --  I can not say . They may even , as your mother suggests , have been forged by his spies for his own base purposes . But that is the least of his treachery . He has declared that last summer , with Madame de Choisy and others , you entered into a conspiracy against the throne , whose objectwas to place you at court in the role of mistress to Monsieur , the King 's brother . When Monsieur appeared at Forges you even contrived , in pursuit of your design , to meet him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts you were both in disguise  --  you , in particular , in the garb of a Bernardine nun , having filched the habit of Madame the Abbess of Jouarre  --  and that when you were discovered by him , you bought his silence at a price I dare not mention . ' Madam , these are grave accusations indeed . For your own sake , let us hope that the Abbe is lying  --  he has done so often enough before ; there is nothing , I fancy , he would not stoop to in order to gain his vile ends . Monsieur Fouquet and I have never been friends . I owe my information solely to the fact that I was at the Louvre today just after his interview with Her Majesty and heard a full account of it from old Beauvais , the Queen 's waiting-woman . ' What steps , if any , are to be taken against you , I am unable to say . We must pray that Her Majesty may rest content with her assurancethat your schemes came to naught and that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my poor friend , do be carefulin future , I entreat you ! By all you hold sacred  --  by your faith in Heaven above  --  by your affection for the family who cherish you  --  even , perhaps , by the fondness once felt for a man who will never cease loving you while there 's breath in his body  --  let me implore ..  | Beuvron 's voice broke ; he turned away for a moment , to hide the pain in his eyes . Cateau deposited Mouche on a cushion ( where the spaniel at once resumed its carved-stone attitude ) and rose slowly to face the Marquiswithout flinching . She had succeeded marvellously , Magdelon thought , in keeping her temper during this trying scene , evidently realizing that cool serenity was the only weapon that could avail her now . I tell you , there 's not a word of truth in all this , ' Cateau said steadily . Do n't believe me if you had rather not . It 's all one to me . But I burned my letters from Guiche and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story is a barefaced invention of the Abbe Fouquet 's  --  no more and no less . ' She spoke with a simple nobility of manner that convinced her sisterthat she must be lying . . . . Alas ! And five years ago Magdelon would have thought just the opposite . Oh , the things one learns about life ! ' said Magdelon to herself . She moved still closer to Gateau ; she felt ill and horribly frightened .... But Beuvron had not finished yet . He went on speaking , in a queer , dead voice as if against his will , as if the words were dragged out of him by his conscience . Ah , madam , do you know what the truth is ? Have you ever known ? Woe that I should have to speak thus ! Yet your actions for years could have led me to no other conclusion . Ever since I first loved you I 've had to watch you coquetting with this man and that , unable to let a single prize slip through your fingers because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  and because you felt each of us might be put to some purpose . What you wanted me for , God alone knows ! Fouquet 's uses were plainer . And I suppose even young calves like Guiche and Marsillac ... Ah , madam , madam , to think that all your beauty , all your talents , should have come to this ! I pity you from the bottom of my heart for what may well lie before you  --  and I pity myself , too , for having been such a fool . Shame , madam , shame on us both ! On you for sinning so ignobly  --  on me for loving so unworthy an object ! I 'd give my right hand if I could save you from the consequences of your recklessness and folly . Yet I can do nothing . That must be my worst punishmentin time to come  --  to remember to my dying day that my love was useless when disaster came ! ' Cateau stood unshaken and immovable before the blast , a faint chilling smile on her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room without another word . Maman and Gilette burst into tears on general principles , because they really could not think what else to do . But it was Magdelon who brought the painful scene to an end by crumpling up on the floor in a scarlet satin heap , having fainted dead away.  |p311FOR  SOME MINUTES THEREAFTER ALL WAS CONFUSION IN THE YELLOWcabinet . Mouche abandoned his tomb-like torpor and rushed about in circles barking loudly , until forcibly ejected from the room . Cateau sank with a cry to her knees , expressing all the emotion over her sister 's plight that her own had failed to call forth . Burnt feathers and brandy were sent for ; servants ran uselessly to and fro ; the sufferer was placed on Cateau 's own couch , with her head in Cateau 's gleaming white brocade lap ; while Cateau herself , pale and anxious , bathed her temples with thousand-flowers-water , Gilette called constantly for cold applications to the feet , and Maman as constantly kept exclaiming : ' Oh , hot , dear  --  hot , by all means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach ! Though really , with the poor lamb in her present condition , I 'm not sure where the pit ... ' It was Monsieur de Beuvron who saved the situation  --  Beuvron , whom everyone had forgotten , as everyone always did , but who proved to be still in the house ; when the footmen carried Magdelon downstairs there were his lackeys waiting in the hall , his coach-andfourstationed in the street , and the Marquis himself solicitously inquiring if he might be granted the favour of taking the Marechale home . ' Sir , you are our saviour ! ' cried Maman hysterically ; and indeed that was not overstating the case ; for not only did this kindest of men convey both ladies to their house as speedily as possible , but as soon as Magdelon had been handed over to the care of her own servants , he sent his carriage to fetch Doctor Patin and the midwife , and insisted on remaining on call for several hours in a freezing cold marble antechamber at Great Senneterre , until he received word that Madame de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear any imminent danger . He called , too , in person every day for more than a week , to inquirehow the patient was doing ; sent hampers of fruit and flowers , with most polite notes ; and was altogether thoughtfulness itself , though it was several days before Magdelon was well enough to appreciate how much he had done for her . She fell exceedingly ill of a fever , which was succeeded by a period of great prostration . However , by exercising extreme care and keep/ing her absolutely quiet in bed for as long as there was any possibility of an accident , Doctor Patin was able to prevent a miscarriage ; and by Magdelon 's own wish no word of her illness was dispatched to the ducal palace in Nancy . ( The Marechal had written to his wife that unlooked-for developments in the political situation would keep him away from Paris for some months to come . ) In the end , youth and a naturally strong constitution being on her side , it was not long before she was sitting up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-velvet canopy of her monumental bed amid the vast gilded wilderness of the state drawing-room at Great Senneterre . Then at last Monsieur de Beuvron was permitted to see her . He tiptoed into the room , his face solemn and sympathetic over an armfulof posies from his own garden ; and Magdelon , who was sipping beef-tea with a pensive air , smiled when she saw him and leaned forward , so that her black curls tumbled across the front of her rose satin gown edged with sable , and looked so charming that Beuvron wondered why he had been stupid enough to let a lapse occur in his friendly relations with Madame d'Olonne 's little sister . He could stay that day only a very few minutes , during which he found they had not a great deal to say to each other . The remembrance of his former connection with Cateau , which could not help being uppermost in his own mind , was , he supposed , uppermost in hers , also : neither of them cared to recall , though they could scarcely forget , the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the pauses in their conversation were comfortably ones , filled with a kind of unspoken harmony ; when Beuvron took his leave he said : Madam , may I come again ? '  --  and Magdelon replied : ' Soon , I hope , sir '  --  and both were left with a cheering glow round their hearts and smiles that persisted , even when there was nobody to see them . After that , the Marquis called every day , as before ; only now his visits , instead of being restricted to a conventional quarter-of-anhourin the marble antechamber with the obliquely coy Madame de la Louppe , were sometimes lengthened to include the whole afternoon . As Magdelon regained her strength she was allowed to walk in the garden , to take advantage of the pleasant warmth of the sun during this mildest of Marches ; and Beuvron was often her companionthere . Together they strolled along the maze of neatly gravelled paths , watched the sparrows splash in the fountain with the spoutingtritons and dolphins , and counted the colonies of tulips , scarlet and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budding elms . ( Most of these were rarities of fabulous price brought back by the Marechal from his Flemish campaigns : Magdelonrecited their names with shy seriousness to her friend , proud ofp313her horticultural knowledge : Beautiful Dawn , King 's Favourite , Pride of Haarlem .... ) Soft grey clouds drifted high in a melting blue sky ; a gentle breeze dissipated the clinging mists left over from winter , ruffled the curls of the strollers , brought a touch of rose to Magdelon 's ivory cheeks ; and every day the green curtain above them spread wider and deeper and grew more murmurous with the songs of birds . It was the earliest spring , and the loveliest , Magdelon could remember . Sometimes , of course , it rained ; and then their meetings took place in the Gallery of Aminta , where a fire was laid beneath the huge hooded chimney-piece with its sculptured stone coat-of-arms of the Senneterres . On such afternoons Beuvron was apt to read aloud selections from a volume of Voiture 's poems or perhaps a chapter out of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature had remained curiously childlike ) ; while the ladies , stitching at their equally endless tapestrywork , would glance up from time to time to marvel at the ingenious adventures of the hapless Clelie or Mandane , and little Henri played about amongst the rushes on the hearth with his father 's spaniels , which were friendlier , if less aristocratic , than the exquisite Mouche . These days passed as quickly as any the Marquis and Magdelon spent together ; it was always a surprise to the latter when the footmenappeared to draw the curtains and light the candles , and she saw that it had grown dark outside while all was so cheerful within . So the agreeably innocent idyll continued till April brought the trees to full leaf in clouds of misty green and turned the walled gardenat Great Senneterre into a blaze of colour . Then , one day , Beuvron did not come . Magdelon , pacing the flower-bordered paths expectantly in the full sunshine of early afternoon , was handed , instead , a letter that told her his wife was ill . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a second letter came saying that Madame de Beuvron was dead . The news was a tremendous shock . At first Magdelon could hardly believe it . It seemed impossible that anyone so young could die . She had known the dead woman very slightly . During the whole of the time the Marquis had been devoted to Cateau , Magdelonrecalled having seen his wife twice only : once , at her own weddingto La Ferte ; and again , at the Fair of Saint-Germain with her two little sons . ( They had been standing in front of the booth where the wonderful golden bird was singing , each little fellow clinging to one of his mother 's hands .... Magdelon had had a dim impression of china-blue eyes , elaborately frizzed dun hair , and a total effect of colourless commonplace good looks ; but she remembered quite clearly the lady 's impatience when the children begged to be allowed to listen a little longer , the petulant determination with which she had said : ' No , no ; there 's no time left , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beuvron seldom spoke of his wife to his friends ; people thought of her as dull and rather devout , and as caring as little for general society as society in general cared for her . Now , with terrifying suddenness , she was gone , blotted out as though she had never been : nothing was left of her , nothing even to show she had lived save the two little boys , who were still so young that they would soon forget her  --  and Magdelon 's memory of the querulous voice crying : No , no ; there 's no time ... , ' which would endure , she felt , as long as she lived , since time indeed had stopped for her who 'd said it . It was dreadful to think of  --  dreadful ! . . . Magdelon shed a few vaguely frightened tears , and prayed God to forgive her for having been so neglectful of Madame de Beuvron . She had a special Mass said in the oratory of the Hotel de Senneterre by the priests of Saint-Eustache for the repose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send word first to her miserly father-in-law that she intended to pay for the candles herself ) . She called , also , promptly on the various members of the Le Tellier family ( Madame de Beuvron had been born a Le Tellier ) ; but she did not happen to encounter Beuvronin any of the black-draped drawing-rooms she visited . And her note of condolence to the widower  --  couched in the politely empty phrases custom prescribed in these cases  --  was acknowledged in no less formal a manner . Magdelon 's walks in the garden were lonelier now than they had been before her new friendship began . But the first wet afternoon became a sort of slow torture , for Maman 's high , breathless gabbling was a poor substitute for Monsieur de Beuvron 's mellifluous tones ( which had seemed to bring the characters of the novel to life as he read ) ; and when the book was laid aside Madame de Senneterre came to see them , and sat toasting her toes in front of the fire and retailing musty bits of gossip until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Her idea of being amusing consisted in cataloguing ladies of her acquaintance who had come to untimely ends . Madame de Beuvron had been thirty-one at the time of her death  --  just six years older than Magdelon was now  --  but Madamede Mercoeur , Mazarin 's niece , and the poor little Duchesse de Roquelaure ( who had faded out of life a year ago out of sheer inability to maintain an interest in it ) had been much younger .... Of course , they 'd been expecting babies .... Magdelon , feeling her unbornson move , looked at Maman , whose childbearing days were long past , and at Mother Anne , who had never been able to have a baby at all , and wondered how long she could stand it . After Mother Anne left them Magdelon mounted to her chamberp315and sat down at the inlaid writing-table that stood in the central window , from which there was a view of the feathered green elms in the garden below . It was early evening ; the rain had stopped , and the sun was just setting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raindrop that clung to the leaves of the trees caught a tiny reflection of its mellow last " rays . The air blowing softly through the open window was fresh with the smell of wet earth and growing things ; it was filled , too , with bird songs and with the chorus of bells ringing for Vespers in the numerous churches of the neighbourhood . There was the big slow boom of Saint-Eustache , the busy tinkle of the monastery bell at the Little Fathers , near at hand ; and , more in the distance , the varied notes of the Chapel of Saint Mary of Egypt , Saint Oportune , **26;7733;TOOLONG , **26;7761;TOOLONG , Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs .... Farthest of all , very faintly and sweetly came the chimes of Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre and **25;7789;TOOLONG , over by the river . Magdelon knew and loved each one . She listened , leaning her elbows on the table and cupping her chin in her hands , while the bells went on pealing and the sun slowly sank ; when it had quite disappeared  --  as if that were some signal agreed upon  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quill-pen with a brave scarlet feather , and wrote very fast , without stopping even once , the only letter of her life that did not cost her a pang : Sir  --  Will you come to see me tomorrow ? Or , if not tomorrow , as soon thereafter as may be convenient to you ? I must apologize for intruding upon your privacy at this time , when sad cares oppress you and you are doubtless in heavy affliction and distress of mind ; but there is something I must say to you . Hoping that God may keep you in His holy care , and that He may bring you the consolation none on earth can offer , I beg you to believe me , sir , Your very humble and affectionate friend , The Marechale de la FerteThe next day the sun was shining again and Magdelon was walkingin the garden , as usual , when Monsieur de Beuvron was announced . He came towards her , bareheaded under the elms ; his face was pale , and graver even than its wont ; his dress all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine phrases she had intended to speak took wing from her mind , like the flock of sparrows fluttering over the garden wall . She gave a little cry , and stretched out both hands without a word .... It was Beuvron who murmured , as he stooped to kiss them : Madam , I have been lonely , too . '  | After he had gone , at the end of the afternoon , Magdelon remembered that she had never told him any of the things she had meant to tell him . Nor  --  come to think of it  --  had he asked her what it was she had wanted to say . But did that matter  --  since there were all the other days ahead when they could be together ? During these weeks the sisters had seen almost nothing of each other . Cateau , haunted by the vision of Magdelon 's bloodless face with its staring , horrified eyes on the floor of the yellow cabinet , called at the house every day while the latter was really ill ; and later , when the invalid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one long and affecting interview . Cateau cried copiously  --  a luxury she rarely permitted herself  --  and made a clean breast of her chain of misdeeds of the last six months , omitting nothing from the first interview with Little Manicampand Madame de Choisy to the masquerade in the Capuchins ' garden .... ' But indeed , indeed , darling , I meant no harm ! Things just seemed to happen one after another , without my knowing how to prevent them . I ca n't think now how I ever . .. Oh , that loathsomeAbbe ! Gilette was right about him from the first . Why would n't I listen ? Men are all alike , Magdelon ; there 's no trusting the best of ' em ! ' Magdelon cried , too ; kissed her sister many times ; dried her tears on a corner of Cateau 's handkerchief ( her own having mysteriously disappeared , as always ) ; and said that she understood perfectly  --  though she was far from sure that she did  --  ; the fuss would undoubtedlyblow over soon ; Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cateau went away somewhat comforted , feeling that very likely Magdelon was right and it would blow over . She then drove to the Palais and ordered a set of extremely expensive Flemish lace dresses for the new baby . What she had said was precisely the truth : she could not see where she had been so glaringly at fault . Granted that a woman had a right to engage in a career of gallantry  --  and nine tenths of the women she knew did so , without half so much justification for it as herself  --  what had she done that others had not ? Of course , there was that wretched affair of the Bernardine 's dress ... Magdelon , Cateau could see , had been more shocked by that than by everything else put together  --  and Cateau herself was shocked sometimeswhen she remembered . . . But , after all , it had been only an accident , an unlucky accident . Was she to blame if ... ? And ruling that out , what else was she guilty of ? Why , almost nothing ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And certainly the gossips who attributed three simultaneous love affairs to Madame d'Olonne had accused her of sins she had not dreamed of committing .... Well , naturally , she had been forced to accept Fouquet 's attentions whilep317Marsillac was still with the army in Flanders . She had not felt it fair to the poor boy to break the bad news to him while he was doing his duty so bravely . But directly he came home she had told him quite plainly that everything would have to be over between them . Was it her fault if the Prince had refused to recognize his dismissal , and had hung round the house forlornly all winter , looking so dejected ( in spite of his poor little abandoned bride ) that , in the end , Cateau had not had the heart to refuse him a few smiles and stolen kisses ? ... But nothing more ! The business had gone no further than that , no matter what horrors people might assert she was guilty of . As for the Abbe Fouquet , she had not , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been in love with her . There had not been even the pretence of a sentimental attachment between them . They had embarked on the liaison clear-eyed and disillusioned , impelled by the least romantic of motives : Fouquet , to attempt to cure himself of his unhappy passion for Madame de Chatillon ; and Cateau , at first because she had thought it the best means of saving an awkward situation , and , later , because she had hoped the connection might serve to bolster up her crumbling social position . It seemed to her that both had got what they wanted out of the prosaic compact . The Abbe , an ambitious commoner , had very much enjoyed boasting that the most beautiful titled woman in France was his mistress ; and Cateau had found , on returning from Forges , that her enemies were not nearly so nasty about her as they had been the preceding spring . She had stumbled upon a most efficacious , if rather unusual , means of recovering her lost respectability . The affair with Guiche , she admitted , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clearly , now that it was too late to undo what was done . Probably she would never have encouraged his advances if Fouquet had not been sent by Cardinal Mazarin after the holidays to England , where he had stayed for more than two months . Gateau had been painfully bored with no man to squire her about  --  and then , there was no use in denying that Fouquet was at best an awkward lover , harsh and impetuous , boorish and self-seeking . Whereas the Comte de Guiche , whatever one might think of his morals , was perhaps the most charming young man at court . There was not a woman of her acquaintance who would not gladly have yielded to him ; of all the Countess 's conquests none was more generally envied . ( And was it not delicious to be able to snap one 's fingers at the epicene cabal ?  --  in particular , to pay Monsieur back , in the only way he 'd understand , for his flouting of her last summer at Forges ? ) Oh , yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even there . Where she had been blind was in supposing that the Abbe would overlook what she had done in his absence . She still was convincedshe was right , theoretically . Since there had been no semblanceof love between them , why need there be any jealousy either ? Why were they not both free as air at all times when they were not actually occupied with each other ? Cateau was sure she would not have minded if Fouquet had had a dozen mistresses in London ... . Unfortunately , she had miscalculated the strength of the masculinesense of ownership that follows physical possession . When Fouquet came back from his trip their relations were resumedas if nothing had happened to interrupt them . He was far too clever to betray his knowledge of his mistress 's infidelity . On the contrary , smiling and dissembling , he had set to work in secret , like the despicable spy he was , to destroy his young rivals and Cateau as well .... The stratagem of the letters had been subtle indeed  --  too subtle by half for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , into the snare that had been laid for them . Cateau could not understand , for the life of her , why there had been so much talk about those few silly scrawls . She wished now , with all her heart , that she really had burned them as she pretended she had . She had kept them simply because it was the custom to keep billets-doux ; they had seemed of so little importance that she had been just as willing to give Guiche 's notes to Marsillac as to give Marsillac 's notes to Guiche . It seemed a trifling concession to settle a jealous dispute and place both her gallants on the same footing . How could she have guessed that Fouquet had put them up to it , planned the whole thing from the start , in order to get them all into his power ? ... Naturally , if she had had the least suspicion of his slimy schemes , she would never . . . But really , really there was nothing in either correspondenceto have churned up such a sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , else he would never have proceeded to further , more fatal exposures , even risking his standing with the Queen by revealing his own share in the scene in the Capuchins ' garden ... . Cateau felt she could never forgive him for that . In the midst of her fright for the future , which was extreme , she realized that what angered her most was the fact that it was the one man she had favoured for interested reasons who had compassed her downfall . As the spring days lengthened , it became unpleasantly obvious that the Comtesse d'Olonne was ruined . True , in spite of her fears , no official steps were taken against her at court . But the uproar caused by her misconduct grew louder and louder till its reverberations were audible from one end of the kingdomto the other.  |p319The  pamphleteers of the Pont Neuf waxed busier than ever , with such quantities of fascinating new material at their disposition ; scarcely a day passed that some unmentionable infamy in the way of a scurrilous verse or scrap of imaginary dialogue was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of being helpful in this crisis was limited to rushing to show her friend each fresh evidence of disaster . Cateau 's name was pointedly excluded from the lists of guests for the various festivities that occupied the court after Easter . She was not asked to the King 's hunting-party at Vincennes , nor to **30;7816;TOOLONG at Saint-Cloud . And Monsieur de Lyonne , her old friend , the new Secretary of State , left her out of his magnificent fete at Berny ( an exact duplicate of the famous one he had given two years ago , where Candale and she had been undisputedking and queen ) . Cateau felt particularly badly at being ignoredby Monsieur de Lyonne , because his party had a kind of official character , being given for Pimentel , the Spanish envoy , and intended as a celebration of the armistice that had just been declaredbetween Paris and Madrid . This was in the first week in May . Several days later Madame d'Olonne was hissed by some rowdies in the pit as she entered her box at the Hotel de Bourgogne . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmed ; but she was so much shaken that she left the playhouse at once and drove home in tears , striving in vain to control her twitchingfingers and tremulous lips . Oh , what was going to happen ? Who would save her ? She had no one left but Gilette  --  and even Gilette 's friendship had lately shown signs of the increasing strain to which it had long been subjected . Why , it was only yesterday that the transparent fool had pretended to have a cold , as an excuse not to drive in the Cours  --  and not an hour later Cateau had spied her , looking perfectly well and very pretty in a brand-new gown , on the back bench of the Comtesse de Soissons ' coach ! So it would not do to count too much on Gilette .... What was worse , Cateau had not one man friend in the world . Neither Guiche nor Marsillac had come near her in weeks ( the toads ! ) ; and when Fouquet called ( oh , the impudence of the creature ! ) she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not at home to Monsieur the Abbe , then or on any future occasion . So there was no one  --  no one at all ! She had never in her life felt so hopelessly alone . Even that debatable solace , the company of her husband , was denied her ; for a number of weeks now Olonne had been closeted in his own apartments with Maitre Prideau , his steward , and his lawyers , and refused to emerge to dine with his wife.  | ( Some tiresome business to do with the seneschalate of Poitou , without doubt . ) Cateau was at her wits ' end what to do . She could not sit at home in the yellow cabinet , her hands folded in philosophical resignation , waiting for the callers who never came . She had lived in a crowd for so long that she was almost literally unable to support life without it . To console herself , therefore , for her cruel isolation , she launched into an orgy of spending  --  ordered two new carriages and a sedan-chair , elaborately gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Flemish tapestries of fabulous value ; some solid silverfurniture for her dressing-room ; and commissioned Monsieur Mignard to paint her six panels for her bedchamber , a series of lifesizedscenes illustrating the story of Rinaldo and Armida . She laid out , also , vast sums on her personal adornment , buying dress upon dress for parties to which she had not been invited ; hats , gloves , feathers , laces , and jewels in incredible profusion . For she had come to the conclusion that she must have been falling off lately in her looks .... Yes , of course , that was it ; that would explain everything . She was no longer so young as she had been ; twenty-six was a dangerousage . Anxiously she consulted her mirror , begged Quentine not to spare her the truth , squandered a small fortune on ointments and powders and elixirs of youth that were sold in the booths of the Palais and the Temple ... . She went on spending right and left , until there was no money left in her purse  --  and when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's steward , in order to have the golden hoard renewed . This occurred , however , so often that spring that the old man , who looked like a grudging owl ( only he slept all night and was wise in the daytime ! ) , blinked disapprovingly at his mistress , and grumbled at length that , really , he could n't imagine what the Countess had done with the last twenty thousand francs .... Cateau had been obliged to scream and stamp her foot more than once , and threaten to report him to the Count , before he could be induced to comply with her wishes . In June the Peace of the Pyrenees was announced between France and Spain , amidst wild rejoicings of the populace . At the same time it became known that King Louis was to wed his cousin , the Infanta Maria Teresa , and would soon start south with his court on a triumphaltour of the country , which was to end at the Spanish border , where he would receive his bride from the hands of her father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , society was thrown into a turmoil , like a hive of bees at swarming time . Only in this case it was a new queen 's coming , not an old queen 's going , that caused the excitement . The arrival of Maria Teresa would create scores of new postsp321to be intrigued for . Gentlemen-in-waiting would have to be appointed , and ladies-in-waiting ; equerries and grooms ; bailiffs and stewards ; chaplains and almoners ; secretaries and women-of-thebedchamber . Not since the marriage of Anne of Austria and the late King Louis XIII , five-and-forty years ago , had it been necessary to form a complete royal household almost , as it were , overnight . The whole court suffered an attack of the strange fever , Ambition . Every cabinet minister and officer of the crown  --  indeed , every servant , from butlers and cooks down to lackeys and scullions  --  anybody , in short , no matter how humble , who was supposed to have an avenue of approach to the King and the Cardinal  --  was begged or bribed to use his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into two camps : those fortunate ones who were going south with the King , and those others who might as well considerthemselves dead and buried because they were not able to go . The former group bustled about self-importantly , making preparations for the journey . Coaches were relined and regilded , lackeys tricked out in new liveries , while their masters commanded whole trousseaux , as though they , too , were going off to get married on the Spanish frontier . Cateau 's young lovers had been amongst the first to depart . Marsillac , whose favour with the King had suddenly become strongly apparent ( he was said to be His Majesty 's preferred partner at cards every day at the Comtesse de Soissons ' ) , was sure of a place in the new household ; and the Comte de Guiche , as the son of the Marechalde Gramont , governor of the border province of Beam , had been chosen to accompany his father to Madrid with the official embassyto demand the hand of the Infanta . The whole world  --  or , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the vortex ; the undignified scramble for preferment was on ; and in its passionate preoccupation with the young monarch and his future bride Cateau felt dimly that a new era was beginning for society , in which , alas ! there would be no room for her . Towards the end of June Cardinal Mazarin left for Saint-Jean-deLuz , to meet the Spanish Minister , Don Luis Haro ; while the King and the Queen Mother were at Fontainebleau , which became the rallying-point for the courtiers who were planning to accompany their sovereigns . For the first time in years France was at peace  --  but Paris was as empty as ever it had been during war ... . Magdelon 's baby was born the first week in July , one very warm night in the midst of a terrific thunderstorm . Strange to say , she had an unusually hard labour , much more painful and protracted than it had been with young Henri . Cateau and Maman were up the whole night with Doctor Patin and the midwives , fearful to leave her bedsidefor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through cracks between the drawn curtains , and sparrows were starting to twitter in the drenched ivy outside the windows , before a faint cry was heard in the huge canopied bed at Great Senneterre , and the head midwife lifted a red , anxious face beaded with sweat to ejaculate : God be praised , ladies  --  a fine healthy boy ! ' The word was passed quickly to the hall , where the long train of the La Fertes ' servants had been standing for hours in the stifling semi-darkness , whispering , praying , sometimes giggling hysterically without meaning to , as they listened to their young mistress 's screams ; and before the sun was up a courier on horseback trotted out of the Porte de Vincennes , to carry the Marechal in Nancy the joyful news that his second son Louis was born . ( It was very odd  --  but as Cateau stood chatting with her brother-in-law 's chief equerry she fancied that a figure in a dark cloak at the very end of the line , who had been waiting apparently for news with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , was familiar to her . If she had not known that such a suspicion was ridiculous , she would have sworn she had recognized Monsieur de Beuvron . ) The summer dragged on , growing warmer and duller . Everyone had left town except the Olonnes  --  and , of course , Magdelon , who was slow to recover her forces after her difficult confinement , though Doctor Patin had urged an early removal to La Ferte-Saint-Aubin , where the fresh country air would be sure to prove beneficial after the sticky uncomfortable heat of Paris .... It was the hottest August people could remember in years , and one of the most disagreeable . Almost every day brief torrential thundershowers poured over the city , drowning the gardens and parks and transforming the unpaved streets into a noisome mass of well-nigh impassable mud , without relieving the temperature . The river had never fallen so low before ; the fountains in the Tuileries and the Luxembourg had ceased playing , while their basins , half-filled with stagnant rain-water , began to be covered with thick green scum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poorer parts of Paris the suffering was acute . No one went abroad who could possibly manage to remain within doors , but the sun beat down so relentlessly that the houses were nearly as warm as the streets ; even at night the baked stones retained much of their heat ; and only an occasional whiff of cooler air , scented with garlic and cheese and the strong red wine affected by concierges and Swiss porters , lingered in the little passageways leading from the front doors of some of the great hotels to their inner courts . Flowers stopped blooming , birds stopped singing  --  and Maman , for once tired of Paris , drove home to La Louppe , her shabby carriage piled highp323with the bargains she had secured in the aftermath of the recent shopping stampede . But Magdelon still refused to stir , protesting that she was very well where she was , really , and would infinitely rather await at Great Senneterre the Marechal 's return ( which could not now be much longer delayed ) . As for the Olonnes , they stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Count spent more and more time shut up in his rooms with Maitre Prideau and the lawyers ; he was hardly ever visible , even at mealtimes ; with the departure of the court his circle had dwindled so sadly that the afternoon receptions and even the dinners of the Gourmets ' Club had been discontinued temporarily . Cateau would have gone away if she could have thought of a place to go . But she could not  --  and in any case , she might well have been incapable of giving the necessary orders to pack up her clothes and make ready to leave . She felt like an automaton , moving as if in a dream . She felt , also , that some disaster was impending , some avalanchethat must sweep her away to instant perdition , but whose implacable course she was powerless to avoid , since she knew not where the danger lay . These forebodings were peculiarly liable to overtake her at night , when she tossed sleeplessly on her bed of gold in her lonely and airless chamber , or sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccessible stars that mocked her desolation . In the morning she awoke from uneasy slumbers , expecting the worst to have happened ; when the day passed without untoward incidentshe was relieved and mildly surprised . But , of course , things could not go on like this much longer . Today ... or tomorrow , maybe ... or , if not then , the day after that , the axe would fall.  |p324CATEAU  CAME IN RATHER LATE FROM A SHOPPING EXCURSION , ONEparticularly hot and humid afternoon , to find Quentine in tears . It was the climax to a thoroughly tiresome day . The streets had been scorching under a pitiless August sun ; Francois , the coachman , who was beginning to grow a little deaf , had twice misunderstood his mistress 's orders and taken wrong turnings ; and the Maison Gautier , Madame d'Olonne 's favourite purveyors of dress materials , had stupidly sold the Princess Palatine a piece of special gold-andsilverbrocade they had promised to save for her ( a shabby trick unredeemed by their candid avowal that the Princess had needed it for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's wedding ) . This last mishap had put Cateau in a petulant mood . She entered her dressing-room frowning , quite prepared to give both her women an uncomfortable quarter-of-an-hour . But the sight of the sobbing Quentine at once altered her plans . Quentine was a good little creature . She 'd served Cateau faithfully for years , without making a single indiscreet or impertinent remark . ( No doubt she 'd been paid to be wise .... Still , by whatever means they 'd been achieved , the results were the same . And there was , it was generally admitted , not a cleverer hairdresser in all Paris . ) Cateau , therefore , stroked the girl 's shoulder and questioned her kindly . It appeared that Quentine had had a quarrel with Crispin , the Count 's valet , which had ended in her declaring she would report his insolence to her mistress ; whereupon Crispin had laughed in her face and observed that that could do her small good , since the Countess would not be there very much longer .... She 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repent of her sins ... . Yes ! By God ! And if Master 's got his wits about him , he 'll pack you off , too  --  as precious a pair of trollops as ever I hope to lay eyes on ! ' Thus , in tear-choked accents , Quentine reported the sentiments of Crispin , valet-in-chief to Monsieur the Comte d'Olonne . And oh , madam , ' cried Quentine , I 'm afraid he knows only too well what he 's talking about ! Naturally , I would n't give him the satisfaction of thinking I believed what he said . But the lawyersp325have been closeted with the master since early this morning  --  all four of ' em !  --  and Malet , the secretary , told me at dinner he 'd had orders to write the bailiff at the castle of Olonne to make everythingready for our arrival . ' A small involuntary shiver ran over Cateau as she listened to Quentine . She knew quite as much as she wanted to about the castle of Olonne , having once passed a fortnight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had it been the winter of ' 53 or ' 54 ? At all events , not long after the close of the civil war . ) Olonne had gone there on a reluctant tour of inspection of his various estates , to estimate the amount of damage done to them during the Fronde ; and even now Cateau retained a nightmarememory of the angular , forbidding , more-than-half-ruined old house set among the desolate sand-dunes of the Poitevin coast . Miles of salt marshes and bare open heath , here and there a grove of scrubby dwarf pines  --  but not a hill in sight to relieve the monotony of the landscape or to break the force of the wind sweeping constantly in from the sea .... How could she ever forget the dreariest two weeks of her life spent in that gloomy setting , with no one for company save the crude fisher-folk of the almost uninhabitedregion and the grey gulls crying plaintively in the mist ? .. . The castle of Olonne ! Why , that would be terrible ! That would be the end of everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments she had already consigned herself ; for in a convent there would at least have been the sisters to talk to . At Olonne there would be nobody  --  nobody !  --  not even Quentine , Cateau thought : it was really too much to expect the girl to leave Paris and all her friends to follow her mistress into an exile that would certainly last for weeks  --  probably for months  --  possibly even for years . Who could tell ? ... This much , however , Cateau knew : a husband 's power over his wife 's person was unlimited . If he chose to murder her , no one would object . Ah , but there was no time now for weakness or vain lamentation ! She must be stronger than ever before . It would not do to let Quentinesuspect what she was feeling . Hastily she comforted the tearful girl as best she was able . There ! There ! You goose ! Why , what a fuss over nothing ! Where 's your handkerchief ? Here  --  take mine , if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what Crispin told you . I dare say he was lying on purpose to tease you . But even if he were not lying , why should we cry ? What 's a month in the country to us . And anyhow , if you 'd rather stop here , you know I could always arrange it for you . It 's not at all necessary for you to come with me . ' Quentine dried her tears , and kissed the Countess 's hand , and affirmed that she would rather die than desert so noble an em- ployer , even if it meant spending the rest of her life in prison  --  which , if sincere , was undeniably handsome , since Cateau knew for a fact that half a dozen of her friends would be overjoyed to engage the skilful Quentine any day at the latter 's own figure . The maid also offered to fetch Crispin at once , so that her mistress might interrogate him ; but Cateau refused , saying she preferred to go straight to her husband . If the worst had indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate from servants . The Count she found in his bedroom unpacking a box of ornamentshe had just received from the Orient . He was sitting in his shirtsleeves cross-legged on the floor , squinting anxiously as he lifted each delicate bit of china or crystal out of the bales of damp brown spicy-smelling cloth in which they had made the long and hazardous journey , dusted it with a fine linen handkerchief , and handed it ( scarcely breathing the while ) to Crispin , who placed each treasure gingerly on the top shelf of the best walnut cabinet . Take care of the mutton-fat snuffbox , ' he was saying as Cateau came in . It 's an exquisite piece , worth five times its weight in gold , I wager . Old Vanel knew what he was about when he sent me that . On the whole , Crispin , an excellent shipment in excellent condition , should you not say , my good fellow ? ' Excellent , indeed , sir , ' replied Crispin , who was standing behind his master , between the latter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive Madame d'Olonne . But here is the Countess , sir  --  begging your pardon -- Begging my pardon , eh ? That would be a novelty ! ' remarked Olonne dryly . He did not get up from the floor , but moved his head sideways  --  stiffly , as if it were worked by machinery  --  and pursed up his lips . ( Could he be about to whistle ? ) Good afternoon , madam . Will you forgive my not rising ? I am , as you may observe , in a somewhat perilous situation . I beg you , also , to overlook the informality of my attire ; the unusual heat of the day is my excuse . Great Heavens ! What a summer we are having ! But you , my love , would appear to be impervious to the ravages caused by our climate , since I infer , from your bonnet and the parasol you are carrying , that you have either just returned from a promenade in the Cours or are on your way thither . If the latter should be the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that I may not have the pleasure of offering you my company as escort  --  but the heat , dear friend , the heat has quite overset me ! I am capable of nothing . I did not touch a morsel of solid food at dinner  --  did I , Crispin ? In fact , all I 've eaten since morning has been a slice of chilled melon and a very few peaches from the gardenp327of the Temple , which the Commander de Souvre was good enough to send over with his compliments . They were admirable , I assure you  --  far better , alas ! than any we 've been able to raise on our own premises . I can not understand it ! The soil of Paris is said to be everywhere of a similar consistency  --  and Heaven knows , we spare no pains in its cultivation ! But every year it 's the same story . Why , would you believe  --  ah , madam , please pardon my running on like this , without asking you what I may do for you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The temperature must have affected my brain . Crispin , a chair at once for the Countess ! ' Cateau , who had been standing poised as if for flight in the doorway , eying her husband dubiously , now entered the room with a rustle of silk , but refused the stool Crispin placed before her . ' I will not sit , ' said Cateau , in her clear , composed voice , ' but I should like to speak with you alone . ' ' Madam , I am entirely at your service , ' replied Olonne . ' Leave us , Crispin . You may return , if you will , in a quarter of an hour  --  or shall we say , twenty minutes ? Yes : at half after five , exactly , I shall have need of your good offices once more . ' The valet bowed and left the room  --  not without a backward glance that seemed to Cateau just to skirt the edge of a malicious smile : Crispin , she knew , had always hated her  --  and the Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guileless that it could not possibly have been spontaneous . ' Well , madam , you wished ... ? ' Cateau surveyed the little man at her feet  --  who did not appear so far , it had to be confessed , a very formidable adversary  --  with dispassionate attention ; then , changing her mind suddenly , she trailed across the shining , slippery parquet and seated herself on a chair in the middle of the room , just where a slanting ray of sunshinefrom the court touched the golden crown of her curls . ' Sir , ' said Cateau gravely , ' it has come to my ears  --  never mind how  --  that I am to be exiled to Olonne . Can this be true ? I could hardly believe -- 'Madam , what nonsense is this ! " Exile " is an ugly word , one which I have never used , nor shall permit others to use in my presence . I fear , my love , that you have been listening to idle tales from the servants ' hall . No  --  no , dear child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some business affairs will require my presence in Poitou for a number of months to come . Annoying , is it not ?  --  but unluckily necessary in my position of Seneschal of the province . Ah , why did I ever covet such a paltry distinction  --  but there ! It 's too late to speak of it now .... Well , then , I must be off to Poitiers next week , and I can not feel I should be doing my duty by my wife , were I to leave you behind . Paris is a tropical furnace this year  --  the heat has been cruel  --  cruel ! ... Besides , I can not bear to deprive myself on this journey of your company , a charm I 've been privileged to savour all too rarely of late . So we 'll be off on Monday for the country , if it suits your convenience to make ready so soon ? .. . ' This thought , too , has occurred to me : Poitiers itself will be hideously dry and dusty in mid-August , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , you have never seen ?  --  would be a dreary hole in which to ensconse a lady of fashion from Paris . I must linger in the town to transact the King 's business , but there is no reason why you should be penalized because your poor husband happens to be a petty government official . Therefore , I have decided to open our house at Olonne for the season ; I have already given orders to that effect . I know the place is old and rather run-down  --  but the country is delightfully wild thereabouts , and the clean , cool sea air will soon bring the roses back into those pale cheeks . There you may rest in perfect peace and solitude , after the crowded and feverish diversions of the court .... Our nearest neighbour , if I remember correctly , is not less than eight or nine leagues away ... and of course I shall join you as often as my duties as Seneschal will allow me . I fancy , madam , that as soon as you 've settled down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your present activities of living the life of a country gentlewoman . ' The Count picked up a small saucer of deep emerald-green jade , and blew on it lightly ( it was too fragile , apparently , to support contact with so gross an object as the linen handkerchief ) before smiling benevolently at his wife . Cateau drew a long breath ; her mouth felt dry with misery  --  and she moistened her lips before trusting herself to speak .... It had come , then , at last . This was the punishment , long overdue , for the sin of breaking the marriage bond ; this was the score she had known all along she would sooner or later have to settle for the follies of her youth ; this  --  whether Olonne were willing to say so or not  --  was Exile , the end of everything . She stared , without really seeing it , at the bright white court in the bright white sunshine , and at the leaves , brown and withered before their time , drifting aimlessly down from the tall branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were , and how softly they fell ! No one cared ... no one knew .... ) At length she said quietly : ' I understand , sir . I am willing to go with you , of course . But " for a while , " you say ? Have you any idea how long that while is likely to last ? I 've business of my own to attend to here  --  certain measures to take'My dear , I only wish I knew , ' replied Olonne , in his cheerful , fussy way . ' That 's the worst of getting mixed up with the govern/ment  --  one never can be sure how long anything will take . All that stupid red tape ! . . . However , this much I can promise you : should my duties demand my continued presence in Poitiers throughoutthe coming winter , I shall make every effort to have the Seneschal'spalace put in order , so that I may welcome you there as its mistress . I think I shall be able to manage it  --  I am almost sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill afford  --  but perhaps we could make shift with some of the furniture at Olonne  --  I do n't like to think of your spending the cold months all alone in that draughty owl 's nest . ' But why should I stop there at all , without you ? ' asked Cateau . ' Why should I not return to Paris in the autumn and live here in this house as I have lived since our marriage ? ' She turned her blue eyes on him with an unspoken question in their translucent depths . If she were to be condemned without hope of appeal , at least she was determined to have the fruitless satisfaction of hearing why from her husband 's own lips . Olonne met her challenge with persistent good-humour . ' Dear friend , I shrink from telling you  --  but you force me to face the issue squarely . I have had serious losses lately in my estates : Prideau tells me that my income this year , and for some years to come , will be sadly diminished . You can imagine how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's no help for it now . And , my dear , I must add  --  though it pains me even worse to refer to it  --  that your personal expenditures have been no inconsiderable item in the total sum of our liabilities . You know  --  or perhaps you do not : why should you bother about such prosaic details ?  --  that I generally count on your revenues to take care of the taxes on your properties in Normandy and the house in Paris as well . Now Prideau informs me you 've already spent your income for the current year  --  worse , that a considerable portion of next year 's supply has been pledged in advance . I have never sought to control the handling of your own fortune in any respect . It has been a point of honour with me to leave your purse-strings at your own disposal , feeling sure , as I did , that you would deem it equally a point of honour to employ them only in ways I could whole-heartedly approve . I have rejoiced in your well-deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at court . I have always admired your beautiful and tasteful toilets , as well as the matchlessly gallant air with which you have worn them  --  but my dear ! my dear ! It is time now to call a halt . Nay , it must be done , and immediately , else ruin stares us blankly in the face . And that I am assured you desire as little as I. I have prepared , with Prideau 's help , a detailed account of your disbursementsfor the year 1658 alone  --  you will find it there on my desk  --  with the bills for your purchases duly attached . I do not ask you , my love , to examine it too closely  --  the follies committedfor last year 's frocks make sorry reading  --  but if you will glance just once at the total figure they represent , I am certain you will realize , without further discussion , why I am being driven to this extremely unpleasant course . It is not of my own choosing , madam  --  but our alternatives are plain to see : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or the Poor House . ' Cateau bowed her head , less in silent submission to her husband 's will than because she simply could not think at the moment of anythingdisagreeable enough to say . She wanted , naturally , to be as disagreeable as possible , to give in with the least imaginable grace ; for it went without saying that she would have to obey Olonne . All wives had to obey their husbands when husbands chose to exert their authority . It was Cateau 's misfortune , rather than her fault , that she had been let do as she pleased for so long that she had almostforgotten her husband existed . She had never questioned his right to command . Even now , when the end of all things that made life pleasant appeared to have come , it was not so much her defeat she resented as the fact that Olonne had preferred to conquer her without battle . She longed to fight , to defend herself wildly , to answer accusations and fling out counter-accusations of her own , to scream and stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew  --  even if it meant confessing all her sins into the bargain . And here was Olonne purposely evading the issue , feinting , retreating , determined to cover up the danger-spots as though they simply were n't there ! ... Coward ! Coward ! ... She saw now that he would never tax her with infidelity , never name her lovers openly to her face , so that she might toss them back into his teeth and cry brazenly : Yes  --  yes  --  it 's true ! And I 'm glad I did it  --  glad , I tell you ! ' ... He had not the manhood for that , though he must know what she 'd done as well as she did . ( Did n't all Paris know now , thanks to the rhymesters of the Pont Neuf ? ) ... Coward ! : Coward ! Unspeakable coward ! Cateau was trembling with fury she had no means to express .. It seemed to her she had never hated her husband so violently as now ; she would die unless she could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( But what , after all , was the use in screaming and making a scene ? They 'd done that too often before . ) She gave her enemy a level look , calm as a summer sky , her face only a little paler than usual , as she said : ' Very well , sir ; it shall be as you wish . I 'll give orders to my women at once . We 'll be ready to start for Poitou on Monday . ' Then she rose and walked without haste towards the door , her taffeta skirts swishing softly behind her . Halfway she paused for ap331moment by the walnut cabinet , and with extreme deliberation stretched out her parasol and overturned the whole row of pretty fragile ornaments , bringing them down on the bare shiny floor in a welter of cracked china and splintering glass . When Cateau got back to her room , still pale but otherwise quite composed , she found Magdelon waiting to see her  --  a fresh-faced , bright-eyed Magdelon , now completely restored to health and bubbling over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive to Vincennes together to take supper , the cool of the evening being the only time when it was pleasant to be abroad in the streets . ' Darling ! ' cried Magdelon , kissing her sister fondly . ' How are you ? And how do you like my dress ? It 's brand-new ; I fetched it from Maitre Thomas only yesterday . ' ' Very nice ; very pretty , ' answered Cateau absently , narrowing her eyes almost without being conscious of what she was doing . ' The waistband 's a trifle high , though , do n't you think ?  --  and I hear lace on sleeves is going out . ' She dropped wearily into the chair before the looking-glass , and was about to ring for Quentine to arrange her hair when she was stopped by Magdelon , who begged for the privilege herself . ' It needs scarcely anything , dear ; it 's as smooth as silk , truly  --  only the ribbon wants retying , and that I can do as well as she . Besides , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Yes ? ' said Cateau . ' What is it , dear ? ' But Magdelon only laughed in reply and stooped over her sister 's chair , so that the two lovely heads were reflected side by side in the mirror 's crystal depths . ( What did that make one remember ? .. . a winter 's night long ago , when they had been so happy because they had just found each other , after two years ' separation  --  and now they were once more to be parted ! But it would not do to think of that yet : Cateau felt only a passing wonder as she saw that their faces in the glass were still as young and as pretty as they had been then . How could they be  --  when so much had happened to them both ? ) Magdelon went on laughing without saying why , and fiddling with the ribbon in Cateau 's hair ; but her efforts to fasten it in place were so clumsy that at length Cateau protested she would really rather tie it herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're different .... There 's something about you I do n't quite ... Magdelon , tell me ... ' Magdelon 's image blushed a rosy red ; she hung her head for a minute . Then , lifting it again , she grasped the back of the chair to give herself courage , and whispered : ' I meant you to know before , dear  --  but after all , it happened only yesterday ! Oh , Cateau , I've told nobody  --  nobody at all ! What will you say when you hear ? I hardly dare Cateau stopped patting and poking her golden curls  --  which in spite of her melancholy preoccupation she had been moulding swiftly into shape with practised fingers  --  stopped staring at the reflection of Magdelon before her , and wheeled about to face the real Magdelonbehind : the real Magdelon , whose breathless laughter and telltale blushes made the whole story plain without need of words . Child , ' said Cateau quickly , ' I want the truth at once . It 's not . . . you have n't ... ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover , too . ' ' Not ... not ... ' Magdelon nodded vigorously . Yes ! It 's Monsieur de Beuvron . Oh , I hope you do n't mind !  --  because of course I know that once you and he  --  but that was long ago , was n't it ? And since then .. . But I would n't have thought of him for a moment if I had n't been sure it was over between you  --  had been over for years . And then , his poor wife 's being dead made everything different , too . Oh , I know it 's wicked of me  --  but I could n't help it ! Poor La Ferte ! What will he say if he  --  I never , never meant  --  But he 's been away so dreadfully long , and I  --  Oh , Catcau , Cateau , why did n't you tell me ? ' Tell you what ? ' said Cateau , in a very small , spent voice . Magdelon clapped her hands together and began to dance excitedlyabout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said what fun it was to be in love !

She opened her eyes very wide because , as always , she ww once completely awake . But since it was still too soon to get I this she could tell from the position of the square patch of sunlight that fell on the floor through the rose brocade curtail she lay quietly staring at the ceiling , which was painted all with very plump clouds and cupids almost as pink as the As she lay she listened to the fountain and the sound of the dener 's rake on the gravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of the house  --  some noises from front street : there was a chairmender 's cry , and the rumb wheels and clip-clop of horses ' feet as a coach lumbered over cobbles of the rue Villedo . That was because the house was si much smaller than the Hotel d'Olonne . There were only tw ( ception rooms , one of them insignificant , and the dining-hall scarcely more than a cupboard . However , the place waslarge enough for one person ; Cateau had not hesitated when agent had offered it to her . She liked the quarter , the big , sr gay parish of Saint-Eustache where she had spent her whole ma life ; the rue Villedo , quiet and exclusive , was an excellent add best of all , her new home was only a few steps from Magdelon the rue des Petits-Champs . So she had signed the lease directly , and moved in the week . she received the final papers confirming her separation from 01 ,  --  and there she had been ever since . Four ... five ... why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to live in the rue Vii ( How time flew , once one stopped being very young ! ) The dE from the court of the Chatelet , which its owner kept care locked in the secret drawer of the desk in her library , bore the of the sixth of September , 1665  --  and this morning was the teenth of March , 1671 .... Cateau was sure of that because she had made an appointment with her lawyer , Maitre Le Caron , to look over some papers connected with her properties in Normandy . He was coming at eleven , and she intended to be dressed and ready to receive him on the stroke of the clock  --  but it could not be anywherenear that ... . No , it was early yet ; the patch of pink sunlight had barely moved . Cateau relaxed once more on her pillows , and stretched with a cat 's deliberate grace , as she thought how comfortable she was , and what a pretty room she had , and how delightful she found it to live alone and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house was hers , and all that was in it . ( Most of its contents were priceless , too ; she had had to buy everything on leaving her husband 's bed and board , and she had spared no expense from the fine Flemish tapestries on the walls of the Grand Saloon to the smallest , most exquisite trifles in crystal and embossed silver adorning her dressingroomtable . ) She could get up when she liked , go to bed when she liked , see the people she wanted to ( and none of those she did n't want to ! )  --  and she was subject to no one 's authority , exposed to no criticism save her own  --  in short , absolutely independent for the first time in her life . Independence , thought Cateau , was an admirable thing . It made up for the storms and mistakes of her youth ; for the dismal months of exile in Poitou ; for the precarious years that followed her return to Paris , after eating her heart out by herself in the country as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , of course , from the very beginning , to go back to her husband 's house , and had fled instead to her mother , who was a boarder at the Carmelites ' convent  --  not the Great Carmelites outside the gates , but the new branch house in the rue Bouloi . That had not been amusing , either , but it was a thousand times better than living with Olonne ; and besides , everyone told her it was the only thing to do . Women who had trouble with their husbands were invariably expected to retire to convents , sometimes  --  if the trouble could not be settled satisfactorily  --  for life , alas ! For a time , indeed , it had looked as though Cateau might have to go on to the end of her days confined to her dove-like retreat , attending Mass with the nuns , conning the sermonsof Nicole and Bourdaloue , and , by way of the wildest diversion , washing beggars ' feet in the charity hospitals . ( Repentant sinners had always to wash beggars ' feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the beggars wished to have their feet washed . Cateau would not soon forget , one day at the Hotel-Dieu , looking up , sponge in hand , over the cot of one particularly loathsome specimen to find her old rival , Madame de Saint-Loup , holding the basin of water in readiness. )  |p337Olonne  had insisted , in the first place , on getting a separation of property from his wife ; that is , he had himself made legally not responsible for her debts . But her personal freedom was another matter . Cateau had had to write letter after letter to the judges at the Chatelet , imploring , cajoling , even threatening by turns ; she had used up reams of paper and quarts of ink and hours of her secretary'sand the notary 's time . It had been terribly trying and fearfullyexpensive . Cateau did not know what she would have done to cover the costs of the case if Aunt de Marville had not died , rather suddenly , in the midst of it , which caused Uncle de Marville 's very considerable estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , she had got her way , as she had been certain she would . But because Olonne had been ugly and chosen to fight back , retreating step by step only as he was forced , it had taken her four years to get it . Four precious , irreplaceable years of her youth ! ... Whenever she thought of what her husband had done to her , Cateau 's eyes darkened with anger under implacable brows . When he was no longer able to withhold her liberty by law he gave way with very bad grace . A divorce she could n't have , merely a judicial separation ; but that was nearly as good , since she was free to do anything she wanted except marry again  --  and catch her wanting that , after all she 'd been through ! . . . Cateau left the convent , hired the house in the rue Villedo , and said to herself : ' Now at last I am going to be happy .... ' The chimes of Saint-Eustache  --  much nearer now than when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cateau stretched out her hand and shook the little silver bell that stood on the table by her bed , whereupon the door to the hall opened and Quentine , whose days of tripping were definitely over , came bustling in to greet her mistress . ' Good morning , Quentine , ' said Cateau , with the smile she never failed to bestow on her faithful maid . ' Good morning , madam , ' replied Quentine , sketching the curtsy she was now somewhat too stout to drop with ease . ' How did madam sleep ? ' ' Oh , well enough , thank you , ' said Cateau , who had not opened an eye in nearly nine hours , but deemed it inelegant to confess it . ' What do you think of the weather ? ' ( This bit of dialogue had been repeated daily between them for twenty years . ) Quentine , having drawn back the curtains of the Countess 's bed , proceeded to do the same to the heavier draperies screening thewindow ; she then screwed up her eyes and inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the court . ' The sun 's very bright , madam , ' she reported at length . ' Butthere 's frost in the air still . And I do n't trust that bank of clouds coming up from the south . You 'd best wear your fur cape and take the winter coach to church . ' ' Bother ! ' said Cateau amiably . ' What have I to do today ? ' ' Maitre Le Caron is coming at eleven , ' said Quentine . ' Bother ! ' said Cateau again . ' More tiresome business ! Is there anything else ? ' ' The new gardener 's to be interviewed , madam . I told him he might perhaps have five minutes as soon as madam had finished her breakfast . And La Martin will be here at ten sharp , to do madam 's hair a la hurluberlu  --  it 's the style all the ladies at court are wearing  --  you remember , you asked me yesterday to make an appointment for you . ' ' Oh , yes , so I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most untruly ; for she never got her engagements muddled except by design . ' What a bore ! Dear , dear .... Is that all ? ' ' Yes , madam . ' Cateau smiled brilliantly , as if she were delighted to hear it . She sat on the edge of the bed , holding out her small white feet while Quentine , kneeling , pulled on her slippers . Then she stood up and held out her arms so that Quentine could draw round her body the long shining folds of the pink satin dressing-gown trimmed . +r with Flanders lace . This was the hour she liked best in the day , the only one of the twenty-four when she was able to create the illusion that she was still a busy woman . Cateau began to act . She had lived so long in the public eye that , no matter how small her audience was , or even if there were none , she could not keep from playing an appropriate part : it had been years , really , since she had made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present with a good deal of skill , partly for her own amusement and partly because she could not help it , a series of living pictures , a whole row of miniature comedies of which she herself was the heroine . There was , first of all , the Beauty at Breakfast . This play took place in the dressing-room , a charming oval apartment panelled and painted in the latest shade known as ' swooning blue . ' The table was set in front of the fire , which was laid in the grate of one of the new and fashionable small marble mantelpieces ( replacing the hooded monstrosities of the last reign ) . There was a gilt mechanicalclock on the mantelpiece , a dainty shepherdess who struck the hours on the sun with her crook ; but Cateau paid no heed to the clock : the first scene of the series was evidently meant to be played adagio motto . Slowly and languidly she nibbled a roll , and sipped her coffee without enthusiasm , making a face as she did so ( a stage face ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it hadp339recently become the rage at court ; all the ladies at Saint-Germain , from Queen Marie-Therese down , were beginning to drink it , so that there was no question of its ultimate triumph in the polite world of Paris . As she imbibed the draught in minute installments she wondered how long it would be before she commenced to enjoy it : chocolate had taken her nearly six weeks  --  and then her pains had proved to be vain , for its vogue had collapsed overnight , owing to the alleged injurious effect on the female complexion . ( There were some , indeed , who asserted that it might be infinitely more dangerous still : it was rumoured that the Marquise de Coetlogon , of the well-known Breton family , had consumed so much of the sable beverage during her pregnancy that she had been broughtto bed of a coal-black child ! ... ) Coffee , say what one would , was safer . Halfway through the Beauty at Breakfast the Beauty 's Companion , Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis , rustled genteelly into the room , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the fireplace , and started to read bits of the weekly Gazette aloud to her mistress . She read in a high , mild monotone that sounded as if she were strangely surprised .... As a matter of fact , Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis had a right to sound surprised , for she had still not got over her astonishment at having achieved a post in the house of a lady of fashion . She was a recent acquisition and , in Cateau 's opinion , an unnecessary one . Cateau had never had a duenna ; she could see no reason why , at this time of her life ... It was Maman who had managed the whole thing ; Maman who had insisted rather tiresomely that the position of a woman alone in Paris was distinctly perilous .... ' Consider , my love , ' she had murmured , times without number , ' what people might say of you ! ' Cateau knew that what Maman really meant was ' what people have said ' ... But she remained unreceptive to the idea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companion , she might wake one day to find Maman herself installed as a far more troublesome substitute , had induced her finally to comply with the request . Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis had been a boarder at the Carmelites in the rue Bouloi , an orphan of twenty-seven , well born but poor , and touchingly grateful to the benefactress but for whose offer she might have found herself , like many another of her kind , obliged to adopt the religious life , though devoid of a vocation for it . She was docile , childlike , unimaginative , with doe-brown. eyes as mild as her voice . Cateau found her useful , if occasionally exasperating through an invincible determination not to exasperate ; and she had never been able to make up her mind whether Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis ' inability to secure a husband was due to her lack of a dowry or of a chin.  | There was little of interest in this week 's Gazette .... Monsieur Cambert 's new opera , Pomona , was to have its premiere on the nineteenth of March at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorandum to engage a box for that night . ) ... Mademoisellede Montpensier had dismissed her secretary Segrais , who had been with her over twenty years . ( Poor old maid ! Since the King had forbidden her to marry that little rat of a Lauzun last January , her temper had become so uncertain that none of her staff felt secure . ) . . . Four of the Queen 's maids-of-honour had been bitten by a dog in the park at Saint-Germain , and were being sent to Dieppe for a course of sea-baths by way of treatment .... The Marechale de la Mothe-Houdancourt , governess to the royal children , was marrying her second daughter , Charlotte , to the young Duc de Ventadour . ( That would make two tabourets in the family ; it was only a year or so ago that the eldest girl , Francoise , had become the Duchesse d'Aumont . Some people were born lucky ... though Ventadour , to be sure , was as ugly and misshapen as a gnome , and Aumont so infirm that it took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a duke was a duke ! ) .. . After breakfast was cleared away Cateau looked over her correspondence . This did not take long , as there was only one letter . She read it twice , half smiling , half frowning ; made as if to tear it in two  --  and then suddenly slipped it into her pocket . There would be ample time to consider its contents later .... After that , she saw the new gardener for a moment , and as soon as he had been disposed of  --  Cateau had few ideas about flowers outside of a deep-seated conviction that roses were dear and violets did n't show enough for the money , so that It Had Better Be Bulbs  --  the curtain was rung up on the second comedy of the day , the Beauty at Her Looking-Glass . Quentine and Lucie , the assistant maid ( who was Quentine 's cousin ) , rubbed their mistress 's arms with almond paste , anointed her face with virginal milk , and combed out the still luxuriant golden tresses in preparation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencilled the delicate arches of her eyebrows , brushed her lashes conscientiously till they curled ( a trick learned years ago from Gilette de Fiesque ) , and touched her cheeks with an almost imperceptiblespot of rouge ( which she rubbed off again a minute later ) . During these momentous operations she peered with awful anxiety at the gracious image in the glass , pursuing her daily  --  sometimes hourly  --  search for crow's-feet and incipient wrinkles . So far , there were none to be found . At thirty-eight  --  an age at which most of her contemporaries were grandmothers  --  the Comtesse d'Olonne was still a beautiful young woman . Her outline was as slender and graceful as ever ; her eyes were as blue , her curlsp34Iquite as yellow  --  or very nearly : Cateau had lately fancied that they were losing something of their new-minted glitter and had experimented , in spite of La Martin 's vigorous protests , with various blond powders , none of which , fortunately , had done any lasting damage . Her complexion , too , had retained its pure ivory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vantage as her own dressingtablemirror Madame d'Olonne appeared to be the same white-andgoldidol that had been the admiration of Paris for two decades . Time had no power to harm her : it had stopped moving when she had stopped feeling . Her beauty , it seemed , had received the final glaze in the furnace of the emotions on the day she had learned of Candale 's death . Thenceforth she was doomed to remain as she was unless chipped by some careless hand  --  a museum piece as authentic as any in her own collection of treasures . At this point a lackey scratched on the door to announce that La Martin was below , thereby precipitating the second act of the Beauty at Her Looking-Glass . The hairdresser , a brisk old woman with snow-white ringlets and a face like a large withered apple , made a lively entrance , bag in hand , out of which she produced several curling-tongs and an ominous pair of shears , prepared immediately to turn the Countess 's head into the round curly cabbage that was sweeping court circles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer of the court , merely of the town ; but she had no mind to relinquish her reputation as a leader of fashion . Moreover , La Martin 's first words to her client settled any lingering doubts concerning the wisdom of taking so revolutionarya step . Madam , I 've come straight from the Hotel de Sully . The Duchess has had her hair cut this morning , likewise her sister-inlaw , Madame de Guiche . And I 've a rendezvous with Madame de Nevers at one o'clock , directly Mass is over . ' ' Very well , then , ' said Cateau grimly . You may proceed at once . ' It would never do not to be the first to be seen in the Cours with the new coiffure . As it was , it was risking a good deal to wait till after church : she definitely discarded the idea she had been toying with of hearing Father Bourdaloue 's sermon at Saint Paul 's in the Marais ; the rue Saint-Antoine was much too far away ; Mass at the Carmelites ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her half an hour 's start on the ladies from the Hotel de Sully . There was one dreadful moment before La Martin 's shears made their first decisive stroke , but after that Cateau steeled herself not to mind what was done to her ; and the old lady 's cries of rapture at the success of her handiwork were most reassuring  --  even more so , the frank admiration to be read in the eyes of the watching Quentine and Lucie . ' Madam is altogether ravishing , ' declared La Martin enthusiastically , as soon as the last tendril in the bouquet of short curls had been crimped into shape at the correct angle ; ' and , if I may say so , madam has a natural equipment that 's a joy to work with . Now , the Comtesse de Guiche 's hair is so fine and stringy that it simply wo n't stay in curl  --  and the Duchess 's has n't the least bit of life in it . Good hair enough in its way , madam , of course  --  but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was agreeable to hear ; and a close scrutiny in the glass of the final effect convinced Cateau that , once again , luck was on her side : the new coiffure might have been made for her . The so-called bouquet of tight short ringlets all over her head , which might have transformed a less fortunate woman into a Medusa , took five years off her age : she could wear it secure in the knowledge that it was immensely becoming  --  and if , as time passed , she grew tired of it , it would always be possible to let it grow out again later on , when she went to the country . Sustained , therefore , by the comforting consciousness that she was looking her best  --  so early in the day , too !  --  Cateau dismissedLa Martin and turned her attention single-mindedly to her next role of the Beauty as a Businesswoman . La Martin had no sooner been shown out the door than Maitre Le Caron was shown in  --  a hatchet-faced little old man , whose twinkling black eyes appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assistance to see any better than in the hope of concealing how much they already had seen . Maitre Le Caron was dressed in snuffy black serge trimmed with a number of jet beads and buckles no sharper than his eyes ; he carried an immense bundle of papers under his arm ; and blew his nose and said ' Hem ! ' and ' Haw ! ' and looked altogether so alarmingly intelligent that the average fine lady of fashion would have been at a loss how to match her wits with his . Cateau , however , was not the average fine lady . Although she lamented frequently to her mother and sister how hard it was for a woman alone to manage her affairs , she betrayed no sign of incapacityto do so to her entire satisfaction . For this , oddly enough , she had her husband to thank . She had never got over the shock she received the day he told her her spending would have to stop . Before that , it had not occurred to her that one could come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for every franc , it seemed that the flow of gold ought to keep pac with her requirements . But during those long empty months in the country , when there was nothing to do but think , it had been borne in on her byp343degrees that money was very important , next to beauty itself ; and that , like beauty , it could not be too well taken care of . Slowly , patiently , therefore , she had set to work to grow wise where she had been ignorant , convinced that if she herself did not husband her resources , no one else would do it for her . ( Look at poor , silly Maman , robbed right and left by her rascally stewards , and condemned to pass her old age in a convent because she no longer had the means to keep up a suitable establishment ! . . . And there was Magdelon , making ducks and drakes as fast as she was able of the noble inheritance of the La Ferte-Senneterres .... ) Now , after nearly six years of financial independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palais that no man was keener in matters of business than the Comtesse d'Olonne . By skilful handling she had substantially increased the size of her principal , already enlarged through her legacy from the Marvilles . Her properties in Normandy were extensive and flourishing ; she ran them herself , making a journey every summer to Caen , where she had taken a big , comfortable house on a lease for life , the better to attend to her affairs . While there she made it a point to get to know the various local dignitaries , such as President Foucault , the town overseer , whom she entertained at a series of smart little dinners ; and , when free , night after night she buried her lovely blond head in the huge dry-as-dust volumes of Bereult 's Norman Laws till there was no detail of legal procedure involved in the management of her estates she had not at her fingertips . It was dull , perhaps  --  but it was exceedingly rewarding . Cateau was no miser . She still spent as much as she wanted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eye caught a great deal  --  but there was no waste . And for every crown laid out two at least were stored in the bank . This morning there was not much to be done : some farm-leases in the parish of Han had expired , and required renewing ; a small sum of money realized on the sale of a wood in the parish of Cantelouphad to be invested ... that was all . But , great or small , Cateau gave the questions her entire attention , knitting her beautiful brows as she examined the long parchment scrolls submitted to her inspection , and signing her name with a flourish at the bottom of each scroll only after she had made sure she knew what she was doing and that it was the best thing she could possibly do . Maitre Le Caron watched her appreciatively through his spectacleswith his little twinkling eyes . When she had finished and handed the bundle of papers back to him with a smile , he leaped to his feet , clicked his heels together , and bowed profoundly , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined her head affably in return , and made two separate social remarks  --  one about the weather , the other a polite inquiry concerning his health and that of his family  --  and then inclined her head again , as a signal that her caller might depart . After that , she embarked on a whole new chain of picture-plays . There was the Beauty in Her Sedan-Chair ( since the rue Bouloi was too close for it to be necessary to order the horses put to the coach ) , and the Beauty at Prayer . Both of these were slightly spoiled by the mute , inoffensive presence of Mademoiselle de SaintDenis , but only slightly : in the Carmelites ' chapel Cateau kneeled a little apart , a soft grey veil masking the audacity of the new coiffure quite as effectually as her devotional pose concealed the fact that while the nuns prayed she was reciting her shopping-list . A gusty spring shower having beaten up from the south ( just as Quentine had predicted ) while the ladies were in church , the drive in the Cours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Louppe back with them to the house in the rue Villedo ... . The Beauty at Dinner with Her Maternal Parent was a rather dull play , and took a deal longer to act than the protagonist felt the lines were worth . Maman , who had grown somewhat gaunter with the years and whose pale eyes were even more bulging , but who had otherwise changed remarkably little , ate an enormous meal , talking throughoutit with her mouth full . Like most elderly ladies , she was uninterestedin everything except herself and her own repertory of anecdotes . She had cried : Darling child , how well you look ! ' upon seeing Cateau , and embraced her emotionally ; but she had not even noticed the new coiffure ; nor did she ply her daughter with the conventional questions concerning the latter 's health and pursuits . Cateau supposed this omission was partly due to her mother 's unexpressed but chronic irritation at not having been asked to join forces with her eldest child . Cateau knew that it would have been nice ' of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost her duty to insist on it  --  but really they had not got on together any too well in the days when they had been fellow-boarders at the Carmelites ' .... It was much better , Cateau told Magdelon , when the matter was first brought up for discussion between them , for their mother to feel independent . As long as she would n't live at La Louppe any more and could n't afford a house of her own in town , the Carmelites ' in the rue Bouloi provided a nearly ideal solution of the problem of What to Do About Maman . It was smaller than the great parent-house outside the gates of Paris , and much cosier ; it was also Queen Marie-Therese 's favourite convent ; she drove in from the country with her retinue of ladies to attendp345Mass there at least twice a week ; and the nuns were in consequence a lively set , well up in court gossip . This gossip Maman recounted at length during dinner , being full of fascinating tidbits about Her Majesty 's new Spanish dwarf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in a bird-cage ; and the endless subterranean struggles between the King 's two official mistresses , Mademoiselle de la Valliere and the Marquise de Montespan . Although Catcau had not been to court for ten years , and Maman not for twenty , they were both deeply interested in everything connected with it . The court was the world , as it had never been in the old days : what happened outside it seemed scarcely somehow to have happened at all . They discussed , alst , the various items in this week 's Gazette , turning them upside down and inside out till there was not a morsel of meat left clinging to the not-too-abundant bones . But unluckily the one matter about which they were most passionately concerned could not even be mentioned between them , owing to the unconsciousrestraint imposed on their tongues by Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis . The lady companion sat at the end of the table between Madame de la Louppe and her daughter , chewing her food into very small fragments and bending her sleek , meek head politely first this way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear me ! ' and ' Fancy that ! ' and ' Who 'd have thought it , madam ! ' It was difficult to imagine what she would have done had Maman and Cateau broached the subject of Magdelon 's affair with the young Duc de Longueville ... . The rain stopped after dinner and the sun came out , so that it was possible to go driving , after all . And Mademoiselle de SaintDenis , it was really most fortunate , felt an attack of the vapours coming on .... Cateau , accordingly unaccompanied , took Maman back to the convent .... There was then , alas ! an awful moment of indecision to be faced . Had she come prematurely to the end of her picture-plays  --  with the day but half over ? . . . What to do ? What to do ? That was the question Cateau had to answer all too often since she had begun to live by herself : as she could do whatevershe liked , there was frequently nothing she felt like doing . Being still in the neighbourhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Senneterre , on the off chance that Magdelon might be at home . But it was no surprise to be told by the Swiss at the door that Madame the Marechale had gone out in the carriage half an hour ago . ( Cateau , smiling wryly , found it easy enough to guess where . ) Monsieur the Marechal , however , was at home as usual , the man added , if madam cared to wait while he sent up to see if his master could receive her ? ... ' No , no ; please do n't bother , ' said Cateau hastily . She and her brother-in-law had never been on especially cordial terms , and since gout had descended on La Ferte six years ago , cutting short his military career and confining him , off and on , to his bed , his temper had become something to shudder at . Not even the long looked-for dukedom , which had descended simultaneously with the gout , was able to sweeten the pill of idleness . He had , in fact , turned into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abusing his doctors , his callers , the members of his family , anyone who dared approach him ; liable , at an instant 's notice , to hurl at their heads whatever lay nearest to hand . It was only the week before that Cateau had successfully dodged an inkstand and a footstool upholstered in petit-point ; she had no intention of repeating the experiment . On second thoughts , nevertheless , she decided to run in for a minute to look at the children . The Beauty as an Aunt might not be so convincing a role as the Beauty as a Sister ... still , anything to help pass the time ... . There were four young La Fertes : three boys : Henri , heir to the dukedom , at fourteen just out of school and madly impatient to join the army ; Louis , aged twelve , still at the College de Clermont , the Jesuit Academy ; and Jules , who was only six . There was also Cateau 's goddaughter , nine-year-old Catherine-Henriette ( known as Tinette for short ) . Cateau was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two elder boys , who were handsome and looked much alike , with dark curly hair , snapping black eyes , and rosy cheeks . Jules and Tinette were blond , plainer and quieter , but good little things in their way . They came trooping into the Gallery of Aminta together , shepherdedby Bonneville , the boys ' tutor , and Madame Poussard , the smaller children 's governess . Tinette dropped a painstaking curtsy : she was sniffing a little , Cateau noticed ( being the sort of child who usually has a slight nose-cold ) . The elder lads kissed the Countess 's hand and murmured : ' Good-day , my aunt , ' in cheerful , confident voices that duplicated each other exactly . And little Jules , after some urging and a recurring tendency to retire behind Madame Poussard 's brown taffeta skirts , recited a sonnet of Benserade'sand two of La Fontaine 's fables in a quick toneless treble . Cateau smiled benevolently at the young people , though her eyes looked distrait , and distributed packets of dragees amongst then . Like all childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought that the little La Fertes were outrageouslyspoiled by their mother : Magdelon 's idea of being a parentp347consisted in loving her babies with blind partiality and popping a sweetmeat into their mouths whenever they opened them to roar . Naturally they roared a great deal ; and although when their father heard them he was apt to roar back and demand that the young devils be whipped immediately , no one ever saw to it that his orders were carried out . Today was a holiday  --  Mid-Lent  --  which explained why Louis was at home with his brothers and sister instead of at school . After putting them throtPh the usual kindly elder relative 's catechism , which took Cateau in imagination back to Cousin de Rambouillet 's Blue Room in the days of her own childhood , their aunt felt that the boys seemed rather restive . On inquiry it developedthat they had been on their way to the courtyard to play at racquets with their tutor , so they were excused from the drawingroomand made their adieux , kissing Cateau 's hand once more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword , a gift from Papa on his fourteenth birthday . ) Cateau kept Madame Poussard and Tinette with her a few minutes longer . She discovered by dint of oblique methods of questioning that ' Maman ' had gone driving in the Cours la Reine with His Highness the Duc de Longueville , and therefore resolved to drive there herself . After all , she had not yet displayed her new coiffure in public . As she was not minded to go alone , Madame Poussard and her charge were pressed to accompany her . The little girl , pale with delight , clapped her hands and cried out : ' Then may I wear my hat with the cherry ribbons ? ' As soon as she had trotted away , hand-in-hand with her governess , to make ready for her treat , Cateau began acting the strangest of all her picture-plays . It was hard to hit upon just the name for it : an unsympathetic audience might have felt that the Beauty as a Busybody ... Madame d'Olonne made a comprehensive tour of- the piano nobile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new music-room , which Magdelon was having repanelledin lacquer in the Chinese manner  --  monkeys dressed as mandarins in red , white , and gold  --  that was beginning to be the vogue . She felt the stuff in the thick brocade curtains of the windows of the Gallery of Aminta between an appraising thumb and finger . She poked about in odd corners to her heart 's content and , finally , rang for the butler and interviewed most of her sister 's servants , on the pretext that she had lost a paste bracelet the last time she had dined at the Hotel de Senneterre . Cateau was unendingly curious  --  she would have been the first to confess it  --  about the La Fertes ' domestic arrangements . They kept a larger staff than anybody in Paris ; in fact , it sometimes appeared that neither the Marechal nor his wife had a clear idea of how many people were working for them or of what each one 's duties were supposed to consist . At the same time they were incrediblybadly served , and were no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs to Cateau , though when the Marechal 's father , the old Marquis de Senneterre , died a few years ago , at the age of eighty-nine , she had been the first to maintainthat the whole household would have to be reorganized . Magdelonbeing laid up just then ( it was a week or two before Tinette 's birth ) , it had devolved on her sister  --  who , to be sure , had asked nothing better  --  to lead the exploring party that set out armed with mops , pails , scrubbing-brushes , bunches of keys , and even a small but efficient hatchet , to discover what really was on the premises of their new domain . It was surprising to find that , with the exception of the wing alreadyoccupied by the La Fertes , Great Senneterre was very nearly empty . The old Marquis , whose avarice had increased with age , had sold a good part of his furniture , broken up more to avoid buyingfirewood , and discharged three fourths of his staff : a few furtive lackeys and scullions lurked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies of mice that squeaked and scampered in the mouldy walls . Heigh-ho ! We 'll change all that  --  we 'll change everything ! ' cried the Marechal cheerfully , undismayed by the mould and the mice . Cateau had heard him say this , often enough , in the days of the old Marquis 's lifetime . But then it had been in a jovial aside ; whereas now it was trumpeted merrily forth in a voice loud enough to rouse the dead .... Mother Anne , the Marquis 's widow , moistened her lips and glanced nervously over her shoulder , wondering whether her late spouse , laid away behind a stone slab in the wall of the Minims ' Chapel at Chaillot , might not manage somehow to rise into life again to rebuke his bumptious successor . But nothing happened to La Ferte  --  and a great deal happened to his house . Mother Anne 's own apartments were left as they were , at that lady 's timid request . ( She retired to a convent in the provinces a year or two later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But the rest of Great Senneterre was invaded by an army of painters and sculptors and masons and upholsterers , who did not stop work till the grand old pile had blossomed afresh in a riot of silk and velvet , marble and gold-leaf , and frescoes in the Italian style . Staircases were let into the walls ; new receptionroomsplanned on an elaborate scale ; rare oriental carpets spread on the cold stone floors ; and when the army retreated at last thep349Hotel de la Ferte-Senneterre , always the biggest , was now also the finest private house in Paris . A second army then advanced on the scene , consisting of lackeys and valets and cooks and maidservants , pages and footmen and coachmen and ostlers ; this army , unlike the first , did not retreat , but remained in possession , not only of the immense steamy nether regions , but , Cateau frequently feared , of t e whole building . Magdelon could not hold them in hand . She did not even try ; nor did she pay much attention to Cateau 's perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women would have considered gratuitous interference . Magdelon was far too busy being a fine lady to be able to keep house . The position of the Marechale-Duchesse de la Ferte-Senneterre was as solidly brilliant as her sister 's was the reverse ; and what time the former was not nursing her husband in his bedchamber , or playing with her children in the garden , or flirting with her numerous gallants in the Gallery of Aminta , she spent trundling to and from SaintGermainor Versailles , to attend some spectacular rout of His Most Christian Majesty Louis XIV . It must be a horrid nuisance having to rush out to the country so often , ' Cateau would observe , with an acidulous smile . Thank Fortune , I do n't have to budge from town any more ! Now , what did you say the Montespan wore at the water-fete ? ' But here Magdelon was apt to give her sister satisfaction as small as in domestic matters ; it was more than likely that the MarechaleDuchessede la Ferte-Senneterre had passed the whole evening in the Grotto of Thetis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the rain had stopped and the sun was shining , it was cold in the Cours la Reine . The unbudding elms stood in stiff grey rows , and the wind whistled in bad-tempered gusts through the bare branches , ruffling the ordered waves of Martin the coachman 's periwig and setting each small metallic curl in the Countess 's coiffure to bobbing gaily . Deliberately Cateau arranged her pose for the last of her pictureplays , the Beauty on Parade . She sat perfectly straight in the middle of the back bench of the coach , her head high , her smile fixed and ambiguous . She wore no mask : masks , thought Cateau , were beginning to be rather old-fashioned . . . . Tinette , at her side , holding fast to her hat with the cherry-coloured ribbons , wondered whom Aunt d'Olonne was smiling at ... . There were very few carriages in the Cours this afternoon , and of those few not more than half belonged to people one knew . That , of course , was only to be expected , since the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was said that he bore an unalter- able grudge against his capital for the turbulent part it had played in the wars of rebellion in his youth . Whatever the reason , it was certain that he was seldom there any more ; the Louvre was shut up and deserted at least eleven months of the year , and most of the nobles had grown accustomed to shuttling back and forth between their town houses and their master 's various castles in the Ile de France . Oh , there was Gilette de Fiesque , taking the air with Mademoiselle de Montpensier ! ... Cateau almost leaned forward to call out a greeting to her old friend before she remembered they were not on speaking terms . Since Gilette had made up her quarrel , some years ago , with her royal patroness and been reinstated in her post at the little court of the Luxembourg , she had become strangely staid . True to her role of echo , she faithfully followed Mademoiselle in all that lady 's likes and dislikes  --  and Mademoiselle had by this time got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain she looked , in that unbecoming shade of velvet ! Had no one the courage to tell her she was too old to wear green ? . . . As for Gilette , who was even older , she was simply absurd , with that topknot of feathers , for all the world like those worn in former days by Madame de Choisy  --  dead and gone now , like the rest of the dowagers of the late Queen Mother 's time . ) Cousin Julie de Montausier was passing in a brightly painted chariot on the other side of the road  --  but there was even less point in attempting to speak to her .... Poor Julie ! She was leaning back against her cushions , too exhausted to look at anyone , even at the little pug-dog curled up in her lap ; and her face was as green as Mademoiselle 's dress . . . . Poor Julie ! Of what use were her wit and her tact and her grand connections now ? What good did it do her for folk who saw her driving by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchesse de Montausier , the Queen 's lady-in-waiting ! '  --  when she was obviously dying ? Cousin Julie was not so old , either  --  not much more than sixty : her mother had lived until five years ago  --  but then Cousin de Rambouillet had spent her last days in dignified seclusion . Julie , on the contrary , after pretending most of her life that the court meant nothing to her , had unexpectedly picked up the best , post in it .... Yes , and she 'd had her cranky antique of a husband made a duke and the Dauphin 's governor , and had run her own rheumaticold legs off in a series of shameful intrigues that did not bear mentioning . Hateful old hypocrite ! Everybody knew she had been the King 's go-between in the first stages of his affair with Madame de Montespan  --  so why did she take the trouble to purse up her lips and avert her eyes , while her coach and Cateau 's rolled past each other , and act as if she and the Comtesse d'Olonne inhabitedp351separate planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marquis de Montespan , having discovered his wife 's guilt , had told Julie plainly what he thought of her share in the business , since when she had gone into a rapid decline , fainting and shivering and seeing ghosts in broad daylight . ) And I 'm glad , I 'm glad you 're dying , you wicked Ad weasel ! ' exclaimed Cateau , under her breath ; while Tinette , sniffing more than ever on account of the cold , marvelled that her aunt should look suddenly so cross at the old woman with the green face and the pug-dog lying in her lap . The next minute Cateau was smiling once more , as the Sullys ' carriage came into view with the Duchesse de Sully inside , and her sister-in-law , the Comtesse de Guiche . She was anxious to see how the coiffures La Martin had made them had turned out , and bowed pleasantly as the coaches drew abreast ; for there was no denying that her own head was the most successful of the three . She was rewarded , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing happened again , just before reaching the great circle , when she encountered Madame de Nouveau and the Marechalede Castelnau ; and yet again , beyond the circle , with the Duchesse de Nevers and the Comtesse de Soissons . The third cut was the most humiliating of all , as a basketful of ladies headed by the Presidente de Tambonneau ( an ordinary upstart little bourgeoise ) sailed by with their plebeian noses in the air . Gateau 's face flushed , but she kept her chin valiantly up . Even Madame Poussard , shortsighted as she was , could not help noticing that something was wrong ; and Tinette tried to guess how Aunt d'Olonne managed to keep on smiling when there was nobody , really , who smiled back at her ... . She had little better luck with men than with women . The cavaliers riding in twos and threes in the space between the lines of coaches sometimes saluted the Countess , but none of them halted to speak to her , much less asked her permission to post beside her carriage , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelly complete . Cateau asked herself , as she had often enough before , whether she would ever get used to it . It was silly to say she did not mind being sent to Coventry . Social position might be something to laugh at as long as one had it , but directly it was lost it had an unpleasant way of assuming its true proportions . It would have been vain , too , to pretend she did not know why she was being ignored . She was neither old , nor ugly , nor less amusing than she had always been . She had a smart house and a good cook and plenty of money to entertain with and dress herself better than any other woman in Paris . Even the damaging fact of her separation from her husband need not necessarily have proved fatal .... No : Cateau was only too sure what the matter was : it was not that her sins were worse than her friends ' , but the fact that they 'd been printed that caused her downfall . The pamphleteers had piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vulgar verses to the public taste . And then , just as she was beginning to live down their virulent attacks , BussyRabutin'sbook , The Amorous History of the Gauls , was published in Holland  --  and everyone knew ( if they had n't known , the key would have told them ) that its chief heroine was the Comtesse d'Olonne .... What a libel it was ! What a caustic compilation of truth and fiction , all the more harmful because it was so cleverly written ! Bussy was no hack pamphleteer ; though venom dripped from his pen , his style remained sprightly and charming . He had sworn , years ago , to get even with Cateau ; silently he had bided his time , only to pillory her the more surely at last . He knew just enough of her life to make his novel horribly plausible ; her adventureswith Beuvron , with Candale , with Fouquet and Guiche and Marsillac and the rest , were narrated convincingly , but with their motives left out or so perverted that a pretty , giddy , amiable woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption . It was small comfort to hear that the author of The Amorous History had been sent to the Bastille for his pains , and then exiled for life to his estates in Burgundy . The mischief was done : henceforth , for Parisians , Madame d'Olonne and the infamous Ardelise were one . Her disgrace had been public ; so must her penance be . But was it never to come to an end ? It was on the way back from the farther gate of the Cours that they finally found Magdelon . Look , dear ! ' cried Cateau encouragingly to Tinette , there 's Maman ! ' It would have been difficult to avoid seeing her , for the processionapproaching them was a pompous one . The La Fertes ' coach , like their house , was the largest in Paris : it had been newly gilded and upholstered in scarlet velvet embroidered in gold , and the plumed stallions that drew it were the Marechal 's best jet-black sextet . The coachman and footman were likewise stiff with gold tassels and trimming ; four lackeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with the horses ; and a pair of minute Moorish pages in turbans ( Madame de Montespan had only one ) stood guard on the steps , waiting to give their hands to their mistress , should she desire to alight . Slowly the carriage bowled forward with stately mien . Cateau could see now the four comely maids  --  Magdelon had always the prettiest ones she could find  --  and Magdelon herself , swathed inp353scarlet velvet and sables with a bonnet of nodding feathers , seated on the back bench , like a winter version of Venus attended by an unusual number of graces . She was heavier than she had been twelve years ago  --  in fact , she would have seemed too stout save for her exceptional height , which enabled her to carry the surplus pounds gracefully . But her lovely face was as youthful as ever , round and fresh and singularly unlined : there were times indeed when she looked scarcely a day older than Tinette . This was assuredly one of the times . Beneath the feathered bonnet Magdelon 's brown eyes shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring herself to believe that all this grandeur was really hers , and that it might not vanish on the stroke of a bell , like Cinderella 's . It was her childish delight in her own good fortune that kept people from being jealous of Madame de la Ferte  --  that , and her patent inability to concentrate overlong on herself , which was at once her chief charm and her greatest weakness . There was no trouble today in determining the current centre of her universe , for the limpid gaze was riveted adoringly , abjectly , and all the more shamefully because Magdelon was unconscious of shame , on the young man riding a lively white horse beside the coach . The young man was short , but his lack of inches was only slightly apparent on horseback . He had blond hair , a good deal of it , a big aquiline nose  --  the badge of his family !  --  and an air of **28;7875;TOOLONG . He , too , appeared fully as regardless of the crowd as his mistress  --  with this difference , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Indeed , there was not a soul in the Cours la Reine who did not know that the young man was Charles-Paris d'Orleans , lately Conte de SaintPaul , now Duc de Longueville ; nephew to Monsieur the Prince de Conde ; cousin to His Majesty Louis XIV ; and the most important young noble in France . When Cateau caught sight of this magnificent couple her face turned lead-white under the bobbing curls ; all her pretty posing came to an end . For it was too late now for her to put up a pretence of being happy ; it was painfully evident what was lacking in each of the picture-plays she 'd been bravely presenting , one after another , ever since she had opened her eyes that morning in the room with the pink-painted ceiling : they needed a hero . And although Cateau did not envy her sister her sable cloak , nor the coach-and-six , nor the prancing postilions , nor the four pretty maids  --  no , not even the two little black boys in their glittering turbans  --  she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man  --  any young man at all  --  to ride beside her carriage in the Cours.  |p354AS  SOON AS MAGDELON SAW CATEAU AND TINETTE SHE STOPPEDlooking at Monsieur de Longueville . Long before they were within hailing distance she began nodding and waving ; when the carriages came abreast of one another she cried out to her coachman to halt , exclaimed with delight over the coiffure A. la hurluberlu , and insisted on having her small daughter lifted up in a lackey 's arms , so that she might kiss her . This made a pretty tableau of maternal devotion for the edificationof the young man on the lively white horse , though it might have been more to the point , Cateau thought , if Magdelon had wiped the little girl 's nose ! At the same time one had to give credit where it was due : it was highly probable that she would have acted the same , had there been nobody to observe her . Cateau 's changeless smile stiffened slightly as she made light conversation with her sister and the Duke . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them be sorry for her ! She would infinitely have preferred it if they had passed her by superciliously , like everyone else in the Cours . But Magdelon would be kind . She wanted Cateau to go to the play with them . We 're on our way now to the Marais to see The Amorous Dupe . Do come , dear ; they say Rosimond is delicious ! and it 's quite .. . you know ... ' But Cateau shook her bouquet of curls resolutely . No , thanks just the same , love  --  another time , perhaps . ' It was impossible not to see that Longueville was relieved by her refusal , although he added his protestations politely to those of his mistress . Cateau made no objection when Tinette begged to be allowed to drive home with her mother . She went on smiling to the end , till she felt her face must crack from the strain  --  but directly the big golden coach had rolled away she collapsed against the cushions of her own smart little carriage , looking as limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great tears gathered on her lashes and rolled unbidden down her cheeks . She wanted to scream aloud in her misery . As that was obviously impossible , she tore her handkerchief to pieces instead , and thenp355stuffed the pieces into the pocket of her dress ( for the lace on the edge might be worth saving ) . In her pocket she found the letter she had placed there early that morning , and which she had not thought of once since . As her fingers closed on it a wave of new life seemed to flow through her body ; she straightened up , tapped on the window to attract Martin 's attention , and when he turned round called out in a sharp , shrill voice : ' Take me to the Hotel de Bullion ! ' There ! She had done it , after all , the thing she had meant not to do if she could possibly help it . Desperation had driven her to fall back on the one anodyne she could always trust to assuage her pain . All the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over , as if it were a kind of charm to ward off evil influences : ' I 'll be good , I 'll be good , I swear to be good ! ... Oh , today you will see how good I can be ! ' The Hotel de Bullion was the only important house in Paris where the Comtesse d'Olonne was still welcome . Perhaps important was not the right word : although everyone went to the Bonnelles ' , no one was particularly proud to be seen there . It was a cheerful circle rather than a distinguished one ; its hosts had been noted for years for their lavish , undiscriminating hospitality . After all , if you insist on running a permanent gambling resort , you can not afford to be too critical of your guests . Provided one had ordinary good manners and reasonable powers of amusing , and were willing besides to pay one 's own way , it was easy to secure the entree to the Hotel de Bullion . Charlotte de Bonnelle had been fond of Cateau for twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stood by her friend through the whole of that wretched affair with Candale . They had somewhat lost sight of each other during the next few hectic , years of the latter 's gallant career and her subsequent exile in Poitou , but when at last Madame d'Olonne came back to Paris to live at the Carmelites ' , Charlotte 's carriage was the first to stop at the door of the convent in the rue Bouloi , and Charlotte herself , in velvet and sables , had rushed into the cold little whitewashed parlour to embrace the penitent and exclaim in her unmodulated peahen tones : ' Poor darling ! I 'm so glad you 're here ! Now when are you coming to dinner ? ' Cateau was touched , and tremendously grateful . It was not long before she had slipped back into her old habit of looking in at the Bonnelles ' receptions three or four times a week ; and if at first some of the older women guests shrugged their shoulders and stared blankly at that dreadful Madame d'Olonne , none of them quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councillor de Bonnelle 's . If he and his wife chose to vouch for her socially , why , then .. .  | Besides , as time went on , a whole new generation began to grow up that knew little and cared less about those old scandals of Regency days . There were Noel 's and Charlotte 's three boys and their first cousins , the three La Mothe-Houdancourt girls . The six young people and their numerous friends fluttered and chattered about the dark old house in the rue Platriere , forming a gay group in which Cateau felt more at ease than with her own contemporaries . These lusty youths and pretty , laughing maidens were too deeply engrossed by their own affairs to remember that there had been queer stories about one of their mothers ' friends : they accepted Cateau as they found her , a charming companion , with manners a trifle more studied than they were used to at court , but sustained by so definite an intention to please that it was impossible to resist her . They had heard that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of all , that in spite of her looks she was said to be nearly forty years old . ( Poor thing ! Who 'd have believed it ? So her life must be as good as over .... ) Aside from that , they thought nothing at all about Madame d'Olonne . And Cateau , after her many misfortunes , was only too pleased to escape into an agreeable anonymity . She continued to be grateful to Charlotte and to yearn for an opportunity to show her gratitude . She was grateful to Noel , too , as long as she could be : he had died in December , some four months before this particular chilly March day , since when his widow had entertained , if possible , more energetically than ever , on the principle that , if her late spouse could return to earth , it would be the first thing he 'd command her to do . Today Cateau paused in the doorway of the Gallery of Ulysses before going in . It was earlier than usual ; the card-tables were set up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appeared , into the midst of a purely family party . Madame de Bonnelle and her sister , the Marechale de la Mothe , and their children made up the whole company . No doubt the approachingwedding of the latter 's daughter Charlotte to the Duc de Ventadour accounted for the little reunion , for Madame de la Mothe , as governess to the royal children , and her daughter Gabrielle , who was maid-of-honour to Queen Marie-Therese , were generallykept by their duties at Saint-Germain . The two widows sat together in the window , engaged on an elaborate piece of tapestrywork destined , Cateau knew , to adorn the drawing-room of the future Duchesse de Ventadour . Claude , Marquis de Gallardon , the eldest of the Bonnelles , and Denis , the youngest , were playing tric-trac ; Noel , Marquis de Fervaques , the middle boy , turned the pages for his cousin Charlotte , the bride , who was at the clavichord strumming a minuet of Baptiste.  |p357Charlotte  was the beauty of the La Mothes , though the three girls bore a certain resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big , bovine young woman , so blond that her hair was all but white , and with features that had thickened to the point of inexpressiveness shortly after her marriage . She was sitting sewing in a corner by the fire , looking more massive than ever , for she expected an heir to the dukedom almost hourly . Charlotte , known as Doudou , was a good deal less big and less blond . Her proportions were graceful , although Cateau had decided long ago that her head , like the heads of her sisters , was a shade too large for her body . Her hair was a lively yellow , touched by flecks of auburn ; her eyes were round and grey and rather mournful ; her chin , too , was round , and she had a sweet smile and a gentle disposition and was said to be so stupid that , at court , her mother wound her up every morning and set her in motion like a piece of clockwork . Gabrielle , Mademoiselle de Toucy , the youngest of the sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat pointed edition of the family profile . She was the smallest and plainest ; it looked as though Nature  --  or could it have been her father , the late Marechal ?  --  had got tired when it came to her turn and run out of material ; so that there was not quite enough of her to go round . However , she made what she had go a very long way : there was no doubt that she was the dominating member of the trio . As Cateau prepared to make her entrance Gabrielle was pirouettingabout the room , preening herself and tossing her curls to show off her coiffure a la hurluberlu , which she declared , in a penetrating soprano , to be the latest thing at court .... But I expect you 've not seen it yet in town . Paris is always weeks behind Saint-Germain in the styles . Take a good look at it , dears , just the same  --  for mark my words , you 'll be copying me sooner or later . Of course , it 's not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Cateau , rustling forward in her best blue taffeta afternoon gown . Now I wonder what you 'll say when you see that I , too , have succumbed to the mode ! ' She stood for a moment in the middle of the room , her head to one side , tall and slim , her long , elegant lines and exquisite composurea perfect contrast to the little maid-of-honour 's stumpy figure and restless self-assertiveness . She said nothing more ; nothing remained to be said ; but jerk her head and flounce as she would , Mademoiselle de Toucy was made to look suddenly very common and strangely thick through . She knew it , too . There was undisguised fury in the sidelong glance of her little olive-green rogue 's eyes ; for Gabrielle was the only one of the family who was not fond of Madame d'Olonne.  |p358She  alone held aloof from the flurry of welcome occasioned by the Countess 's appearance . Madame de Bonnelle and the Marechale dropped their tapestry with cries of delight . Gallardon brought a chair for the new arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-screen to shield her from the warmth of the blaze ; Doudou stopped playing and ran to kiss her dearest Cateau ; and even Francoise d'Aumont relaxed her wooden immobility long enough to smile with a touch of malice and say : ' Truly , madam , SaintGermain'squite cast into the shade by the rue Villedo . I 'll warrant my sister is sorry she boasted too soon of her charms . ' Cateau had the wit to conceal her pleasure in her triumph . She turned the flow of compliments aside with a deprecating remark and offered a string of her own instead to the bride and her mother on the morrow 's wedding . ' There 'll not be a fairer duchess , I vow , in all Her Majesty 's train , ' said Cateau , pinching Doudou 's soft cheek . ' I only wish I might peep through the palace windows the day she takes possession of her tabouret ! ' ' A tabouret 's no such great wonder , ' said Francoise d'Aumont , who had had one of her own for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! I 'd not dream of daring to sit on mine in my present condition of health . ' She bit off the end of the thread she 'd been sewing and chewed it slowly , thus enhancing her likeness to a meditative cow . ' Nay , then , cousin , let poor Doudou get what amusement she can out of the honours of her new position ! ' cried Gallardon , who had a laughing way with him and more self-assurance than his brothers . ' For from what I 've seen of her bridegroom ' t is all the joy she 's likely to have in the bargain . ' ' Well , if Villeroy had n't been married already , ' said Gabrielle , ' I suppose she 'd have got Maman to give her to him , though he 's no duke , nor likely to be one for years to come . There , now , Doudou ! Have we surprised your secret ? Only look how she 's blushing ! ' Doudou hung her head and glanced appealingly at her sisters , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Marechale frowned and shook her finger disapprovingly , but she stood too much in awe of Gabrielle 's tongue to dare try to curl ) it . It was Madame de Bonnelle who remarked in her brusque , decided way : ' For my part , I find Ventadour perfectly delightful . Of course , he 's not handsome  --  but why should you want a man to be handsome ? He 's rich and well born and utterly devoted to our Doudou , and I think she 's an exceedingly lucky girl ! ' Cateau then tactfully diverted the conversation by asking Doudou'smother a question concerning the cut of the wedding-dress made at staggering expense by Maitre Thomas ; and Gabrielle oncep359more discovered that the wind had been taken out of her sails . She returned to the charge unabashed , however , as soon as she perceiveda new opening ; and presently was in command of the room again as she related the anecdote , slightly stale now to most of her audience , of the dog that had attacked her comrades , the Queen 's maids-of-honour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone had escaped being bitten . She had seen from the first how it was with the animal ; she had warned Rouvroy and that poor , silly Ludre to beware , and had told Theobon , the dog 's owner , to summon a gardener to deal with the vicious brute . But would one of them listen to her ? Not they ! And look what had happened to them ! .. . From these sage reflections the Toucy passed on to a scathing summary of the various intrigues that were momentarily absorbing the scandalmongers at court .... Monsieur X had left his wife for a buxom milkmaid from Montmorency .... Madame Y had been surprised after sunset in the shrubberies with one of her footmen ... . The Z 's were said to be on the point of seeking a divorce , the sole consideration still deterring them being that both had so many sins to account for that neither quite dared to bring suit against the other .... Madame de la Mothe clucked and simpered , wagging her head as if to say : ' Dear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? '  --  while Charlotte de Bonnelle , in spite of her widow 's weeds not four months old , laughed her loud , cheery laugh at the most outrageous of her niece 's tales . Life , thought Charlotte , is still too amusing for words .... '  --  and then , oh , yes , my loves , I 'd nearly forgotten the best of all  --  about the poor , dear Duc de Longueville and that old woman who 's so madly in love with him . They say she 's three months gone with child already and is in a pother how she 'll be able to explain it to her husband the Marechal , since everyone knows they 've not lain together these last five years . Is n't that killing ? But I 'd hate to stand in her shoes  --  for did n't La Ferte murder his first wife for much less ? Aunt Charlotte , you told meHere , for a wonder , Gabrielle became conscious that her whole family was staring at her in open-mouthed horror . She checked herself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awkward apology to Cateau . ' Forgive me , madam  --  I do assure you I 'd entirely forgotten ... ' ' Very well , child , ' said Cateau , in a matter-of-fact tone . She had sat still during the other 's spiteful monologue , only a slight narrowing of the eyes showing her inner agitation . Now she got up without haste , just as a lackey appeared at the door to announcethe first of the afternoon 's guests , and gave her hand top36o young Fervaques , who had been fidgetting beside her chair for some minutes , as if he were longing to intervene in her behalf , if only he had known how . ' I think , ' Cateau continued quietly , ' I promised Monsieur de Fervaques , the last time I was here , that I would let him show me the garden . The trouble I 've had with my planting , dear Charlotte , this year ... ! And your bosquets are always delicious . Perhaps I may gather some hints from your good men below . Till later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirs ! ' She swept the company a curtsy and left the room with her hand , which only the Marquis knew was trembling , lying lightly on her escort 's arm . In the hall the young man turned to face her , flushing hotly , and blurted out : ' Madam , I know not what to say to obtain your forgiveness ! I  --  I could strangle that minx of a Toucy ! Yes  --  and I 'll do it , one of these days , if she continues so unruly of tongue ! Those are fine manners she 's picked up at the court of His Most Christian Majesty ! ' Cateau smiled . ' Do n't take it so hard , my friend  --  for you see that I do n't , ' she said . ' I admit Mademoiselle Gabrielle is not so ingratiating as her sisters  --  but then , consider her age ! How young she is ! Not more than seventeen , I fancy . And for all I know , it may be she spoke the truth about my poor Magdelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Whether it be true or not makes not the slightest difference , ' declared Fervaques . ' It 's her abominable rudeness in bringing the story up in your presence I ca n't overlook .... Pretending she 'd forgotten that you and the Marechale were sisters ! Ah , I wish now I 'd boxed her ears before the whole room ! ' ' Yes , I suppose she knew well enough of the relationship . But why talk any longer of so disagreeable a matter ? See , I 've forgotten it already ! Now you must promise me that you will do so , too . There are other affairs to be discussed between us .... But , my dear , where on earth are you taking me ? ' ' Why , ' stammered the young man , at the top of the grand staircaseleading down to the entrance hall , ' to  --  to the garden ! I thought you said ... ' Cateau burst out laughing : a musical peal of silver bells , carefully rehearsed , it had lately replaced the unrestrained mirth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing I meant you to do ! You may take it as axiomatic , child , that I never under any circumstanceswish to go outdoors . No , no ... I said that merely as an excuse to leave the room , partly on account of the Toucy , for my palm was itching to slap her pert little face  --  and partly because ... Well , I 'll tell you presently . Here : can we not have our chat in this corner quite by ourselves ? ' She had suddenly stumbled upon the small antechamber behind the great gallery ; it was the room where , years ago , she and Beuvron had had their first serious quarrel . Cateau had forgotten the details of the scene , though she retained a vague impression that somethingunpleasant had happened to her there , once upon a time ... . However , the place might have been made for confidential interviews : dim and low-ceilinged , the walls hung with dark Gothic tapestries , a fire burning cosily on the hearth . Cateau seated herself on the long couch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sardonic stare of the late finance minister , Claude de Bullion  --  tough old rascal !  --  fixed upon her and his grandson from the excellentportrait by Philippe de Champaigne adorning the over-mantel . Then she beckoned smilingly to her companion . After a moment 's hesitation the young man sat beside her , blushingfuriously . Noel de Bullion was the handsomest of the three Bonnelle brothers . Like his cousin Doudou , he possessed the family 's good traits in the highest degree : where Claude 's features were a thought coarse and Denis 's too small and waxy-neat , his own were bold enough to be manly and sufficiently well chiselled to attain distinction . He had a rather long , narrow face , with a mouth as soft and red as a girl 's , and large grey-green eyes , appealing and melancholy in expression ( there , again , like Doudou ) ; he was tall , but stooped a little when he walked . Under the huge frizzed periwig fashion had clapped upon his unfortunate head Cateau knew that his own hair curled a crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elaborately correct court costume , and the solemn efforts he made to live up to the dignity they imposedon their wearer , he looked a good deal younger than his twenty-six years . Now he was gazing at her as a child might at his mother who had promised him a sweetmeat , but who he was not sure meant to keep her promise . Cateau was touched by the look , more than she had known she could be ; it was so long since anyone had looked at her like that , from a completely personal angle , that she felt her crushed self-esteem rising magically under the steady pleading of those gentle grey-green eyes . At the same time she felt confused by the message she read in their depths , and uncertain how best to respond to it . ( ' I 'll be good , I swear to be good ! . . . ' ) You got my letter ? ' Fervaques began , in an eager whisper . Yes , ' said Cateau ; this morning . See , I have it here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew  --  the very minute the King had settled that Sourches might make the sale . Nobody knows yet except you  --  not even my mother ! I  --  I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news , because it was all your doing , you know . But for you I 'd never have thought of daring so much . But for you I 'd still be nothing but the younger son of an obscure councillor of parliament . ' Instead of Governor and Lieutenant-General of His Majesty 's provinces of Maine and Perche and the County of Laval , ' said Cateau , smiling . How fine that sounds , to be sure ! My dear , do you know , I believe I 'm your vassal : all the barons of La Louppe were born in the Perche ! ' ' It was a job , I can tell you , to get the King to consent to it , ' Fervaques went on , with kindling eyes . I do n't believe he 'd have ever said yes if Monsieur Le Tellier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he persuaded him it would be the best thing for all concerned that the sale should go through . You see , my birth is against me . No one thinks anything of parliament any more . And the King 's never seen me or my brothers : we have n't the luck of my Aunt de la Mothe and my cousins , who are attached to the court . In the end , His Majesty was most influenced by the fact that I 'd already bought the charge of captain in the Queen 's Light Horse Troop . There again , madam , my good fortune is due to you  --  for who else told me as long ago as last Christmas that the King was planning a war against the Low Countries , and that I 'd better make sure in advance of a post in the royal forces ? ' Well , but you would have thought of it by yourself , surely , sooner or later . There 's no chance for a man nowadays outside the army . As you say , parliament 's finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich father , if you ca n't spend a fair share of your heritage to launch yourself in the world ? After all , your grandfather was finance minister under Richelieu : why should n't you be as good as he some day  --  or even better ? My dear , I believe in your future . ' I know you do ! ' cried the young man  --  there were tears of gratitude in his eyes . You 're the only person in the world who does . My mother 's kind enough to us all , but her heart is set on my brother Gallardon 's career . She 's treating with the government now to buy him the charge of first equerry of the Petty Stable . It 's always been so : as long as Claude had what he wanted , the rest of us might whistle in vain for our supper . ' And I tell you , my friend , that she 's made a mistake , ' said Cateau calmly . Madame de Bonnelle has been one of my best friends for more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more than I do  --  but the judgement of even the finest woman may sometimes be led astray . I am sure she will live to realize that she was wrong about her children . Gallardon 's all very well  --  a pleasant young fellow  --  but it 's you who can bring the Bullions back to the high position they had under the late King Louis XIII . Mark my words , Fervaques  --  I mean what I say ! '  | Madam , how can I thank you ? How can I ever hope to repay ... ? Why should you be so good to me ? ' Fervaques seized her hands ardently and covered them with kisses ; while Cateau , leaning back on the couch and shutting her eyes , told herself firmly she must not forget for an instant that he was young enough to be her son .... Well , not quite , for was she not barely twelve years his senior ? Still , they were divided by much more than their difference in ages : the unbridgeable gulf of what seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was old , old .... Naturally , therefore , her feelings were purely maternal . Every woman had a certain amount of the mother instinct ; in her , who was childless , it had been thwarted too long . That was all there was to it , of course ! There was no need for her to feel guilty . . . . Then why had her cheeks grown suddenlypink ? Why did her breath , perfectly even a moment before , start to come short and sharp in a series of gasps ? And could that be her heart beating under the lace ruffles of her bodice , hammering at the walls of its prison like an animal striving to escape ? ( ' I 'll be good  --  I 'll be good ! ' ) Gently she drew away her hands and laid one of them on the shoulder of the young man beside her . My dear child , ' said Cateau , in what she trusted was a convincinglyparental tone , there 's no need for such extravagant thanks . ' Ah , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Madam  --  dear madam !  --  my life belongs to you . Take it , I beg of you ! It 's a mean thing , I know  --  dull and insignificant  --  but maybe in your keeping it will become something to be proud of . Oh , if I thought that you cared as I do'No  --  please  --  you know you must not ! These are things I have forbidden you to say . ' ' And why ? Why ? Am I a child , that may not be suffered to speak ? Or am I a man like other men , with feelings that must out , if they are not to choke me ? I love you , madam  --  nay , you must hear me ! I have loved you for months . All that I am , all that I have , is yours for the taking . Here let me kneel and implore you ... . Cateau rose and stamped her foot smartly  --  for the door to the hall was half open , and who knew who might be listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  d' you hear me ? It 's not right . I 'll not have it ! I am unworthy of such homage . ' Who should be worthy , if you are not ? ' cried Fervaques , half sobbing , his cheeks red as fire . ( Would anyone have guessed so bashful a creature ... ?  --  But that was the way with timid people , once they found courage to break through the barriers that pent in their feelings . ) There was no stopping the lad ! He was babbling on now : I know there have been bad things in your life  --  sad things  --  that people have been cruel  --  have misunderstood and maligned you . But I can see further than they . I can appraise your true worth . Madam , let me make amends for others ' lack of wisdom and charity . Let me atone for the sins of my sex by caring for you and cherishing you always . Only so can I be happy , myself  --  only so can I live at peace ! I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll sink back into the void from which you saved me ! ' His face plainly showed , in its mixture of ardour and boyish desperation , that he meant what he said  --  that he was speaking the simple truth . Cateau had still sufficient detachment of mind to reflect that none of the Bullions was clever enough to invent anything else . However , she , too , was caught in a flurry of emotions , none the less agitating because they rested on the surface . She felt fear , confusion , gratitude , but , most of all , amazement that , after so many barren years , she could have come alive again . It was as though a spring , long dry , had suddenly begun to flow  --  or as though a tree , leafless through many seasons , had put forth young green leaves once more . . . . But alas ! If she herself were astonished at what had happened to her , what would others say when they knew ? How the gossips would laugh when they learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unfold a new and unexpected chapter ! She could imagine only too well the kind of bawdy remarks they would make .... No ! It was impossible ! How could she have thought for a moment ... ? That side of her life was ended forever . She ought not to have called at the Hotel de Bullion today . She should have been wise long ago , foreseen what was surely on its way , and prevented the affair from coming to a head . ( Best to stifle , if she could , the voice of her conscience , which went on droning insistently that she had foreseen the whole business and had deliberately sat back and waited .... ) These thoughts flashed through Cateau 's mind in less time than it takes to tell them , while she stood by the couch , her bosom rapidly rising and falling , her colour ebbing and flowing as she had not deemed it possible in a woman of eight-and-thirty .... To conceal her dismay she averted her head ; Fervaques , interpreting this as a sign of displeasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folds of her gown . Nay  --  now you are angry  --  now I 've made you hate me ! ... ' What a baby he was ! She would have patted his head , to console him  --  but there was no point in patting a periwig ! ( Cateau had a poignant fleeting memory of Candale 's golden mane , dust in the tomb these many years . ) As it was , she turned a laughing face towards the disconsolate young man . Nonsense , child , I 'm not angry  --  only amused to see what ap365position the governor of Maine , Perche , and the County of Laval has got himself into ! Come , now , no more of this foolishness ! Get up from the floor like a sensible man , dust yourself off  --  and then let us go back to the drawing-room and tell the good news of your appointment to your mother and her guests . If I mistake not , it will quite eclipse the excitement of Doudou 's wedding . Nay , even the little Toucy 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' must , I fear , retire to the background for a few minutes at least . ' Fervaques rose as he was bidden and stood meekly before her . His arms hung limp at his sides ; the light in his eyes had been quenched . ' Ah , what do I care for the governorship now , ' he muttered sulkily , ' since you wo n't have me ? It 's but a parcel of petty official cares , scarce worth the fourteen thousand francs a year they 'll bring me ! ' ' Nonsense ! ' said Cateau , a second time . ' It 's an immense sum of money , and you are an extremely fortunate boy . Think of the hundreds of families at court who have n't a penny to spare for the heir to the title , much less for his younger brothers ! Why , there 's no limit to what you can do ! ' ' I could have done anything , madam  --  anything ! But with your help only . Alone , I 'll be nobody , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , who said you 'd be alone ? ' ' But I thought of course'You had no business to think anything of the kind . We 'll be friends , just as we 've always been . ' ' And I may write to you as I 've been used to do  --  and tell you all I think and hope and plan for  --  oh , madam ... ! ' ' You may write , of course , ' said Cateau , ' whatever you like  --  except one thing . ' Fervaques ' face fell once more . ' Ah  --  but I 've only one thing to say ! ' Cateau frowned . ' Too many men have told me that , ' she said , with a sigh . ' And I thought it was agreed you were not to be like other men . But come , come ! It 's high time for us to find your mother . ' With this inconclusive answer Fervaques was forced to rest content . As he held the door open for her to pass through he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she gave him her hand in the hall ; and though he raised it to his lips , her frown did not return . In the Gallery of Ulysses no one apparently had noticed their absence . The room was by now quite full , and gambling had begun . Madame de Bonnelle never delayed an unnecessary momentp366once the proper complement of players had arrived . She was tensely involved in a game of lansquenet , deaf and blind to all else in the world , her eyes opaque and expressionless . It was droll to observe the preoccupied stare that was the best she had to offer , when the exigencies of the hostess obliged her to greet an advancing or speed a retiring guest . Not everyone in the company , however , was so wholly absorbed by the business in hand . Cateau perceived that the Duc de Caderousse , an ugly young man with a bony nose and legs as awkwardly long as a grasshopper 's , had established himself on a stool by the fireplace next to the chair occupied by Madame d'Aumont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as if to keep them from flying off at a tangent  --  devouring her with his eyes . Cateau could not hear what he was saying , but whatever it was , it had caused the wooden statue to come to life : Fran wise actually laughed once or twice , and as she listened her paste-white face coloured high up to her straight thick light eyebrows . . . . And in another corner the Marquis de Villeroy , that accomplished young courtier known as Charming , ' was pursuing  --  there was no other word for his peculiarlyimpudent brand of attentions  --  Doudou de la Mothe , who by this time tomorrow would be the Duchesse de Ventadour . Doudou , it was true , took care to repulse her admirer  --  but so feebly that he seemed to be almost as much emboldened thereby as if she were actually encouraging him . ( Poor Doudou ! How pretty she was in her simple white gown , with a rose in her hair no pinker than her cheeks , and a troubled look in the brooding grey eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that she ought not to thrust her forefinger into her mouth , like a bashful young peasant . ) Cateau shrugged her shoulders : what were young people coming to , she 'd like to know ? In her day the most audacious girls thought it prudent to wait until they were properly married before permittingthemselves the luxury of a lover . She could still recall how shocked she had been , the year she came out , by the flirtatious proposals of that horrid old lecher , the Cardinal de Retz . And he , she supposed , had not meant anything serious .... Whereas now .. . But what could one expect at a court whose rightful queen was ignominiously cast into the shade by the King 's two brazen mistresses , one of whom was another man 's legal wife  --  while the other , though already the mother of two children , had never been married to anybody ? .. . Cateau pursed up her lips in unconscious imitation of Cousin Julie and began waving her fan to disguise her disapproval .... Gallardon approached her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Gabrielle de Toucy and the young Comtep367de Fiesque ( Gilette 's son , who looked almost comically as his mother had done at his age ) . She stayed at the Hotel de Bullion for another hour , laughing and talking and playing cards the whole of that time and exchanging scarcely another word with Fervaques . She joined in the exclamations of surprise and delight that greeted the halting announcement of his new appointment , precisely as if it were news to her as well as to everyone else . But Charlotte was not deceived by the careful assumption of innocence ; she flashed her friend a glance of affectionate comprehension over the heads of the crowd ; and when at length Cateau took her leave Madame de Bonnelle actually stopped playing long enough to plant two smackingkisses on each cheek and breathe ecstatically : My dear  --  my dear  --  you 're the good angel of our house ! Ah , do n't deny it  --  I know ! ' Cateau drove home that evening enveloped in a warm glow of self-satisfaction . She felt sincerely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation better . And it had not been easy to handle .... Perhaps it was not too much to say , as Charlotte had told her , that she was the Bullions ' good angel . The role was a novel one : Cateau found it delightful to play ; she was resolved to continue it until she had succeeded in making something creditable of her pupil . Poor young thing ! He seemed to be the one human being who needed her  --  and surely her influence over him was as , admirable as it was complete . How fortunate for a young man like Fervaques , on the threshold of his career , to have for his confidante a woman with sufficient experience of life to help him steer clear of its pitfalls ! How much better a devotion like this than a vulgar liaison with some horrible actress , such as most youthful courtiers indulged in  --  or than an affair with one of the present generation of impudent , ill-bred girls of good family , like the Toucy , for instance , or even her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ... Cateau wondered how long she would be able to save her friend from some such unsavoury entanglement . Fervaques was a lad of high principles , she knew ; but the examples he saw about him in camp , at court , even , alas ! in his mother 's own house , were not calculated to strengthen an attitude of uncompromising morality . And he was a man , and , like other men , could not be expected to live like a saint ... . Cateau had treasures of indulgence in reserve for masculine frailty , though , oddly enough , she was the first to condemn similar lapses of members of her own sex . That was because she herself was not subject to this particular weakness of the senses . True , she had had several lovers , but , save for Candale , none of them had been able to fire her emotions . It was enough that she had been able to fire theirs : what she had lived for had been the feeling of power over men . As for the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was as cold temperamentally as Magdelon the reverse ; she had known that always about herself since her girlhood , and she had been glad that it was so , deeming it gave her an advantage in the game at which a woman was so often forced to play the losing hand . That is , she had been glad till she found , to her cost , that not the least of her troubles were caused by her fatal ability to kindle flames she could neither share nor quench . But now that time had ripened her judgement she could view the problems of sex in their true proportions . She understood now , as never before , the really useful part passion might play in the relations between a man and a woman . Wisely controlled  --  of course , by the woman , who must be old enough to know what she was doing  --  it could add a comforting flavour of reality to the most exalted kind of friendship , keep it from becoming bloodless and desiccated , and lead in the end to the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment . If she did not take Fervaques , it was obvious that someone else very soon would  --  probably someone much less well fitted than herself to lead him towards the summits she was determined he should reach . Perhaps , therefore , strange as it might seem , it was really her duty , as Charlotte 's good angel .. . To give Cateau credit , she came to no hasty decision in this matter . She thought the thing over thoroughly for nearly a week  --  there again clearly demonstrating the superior claims of maturity over raw , impulsive youth . She reviewed the pros and cons with a practised and disillusioned eye , balancing the almost inevitable loss of Charlotte 's friendship ( for it would be too much to expect Madame de Bonnelle to appreciate , at least for some time , the disinterestedness of her motives ) against the solid merits and undoubtedattractions of beginning life anew as guide , philosopher , and friend  --  and something more , as well  --  to the new governor of the provinces of Maine and Perche and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to her desk to write the note in which she intended to convey , delicately yet unmistakably , that Fervaques ' future good fortune depended on his will , not hers , the aspect of the affair that most struck her was that not once , in the long series of deliberations leading to what she prayed might prove an auspicious result for them both , had she considered the fact that her lover was now master of an income of some eighty thousand francs a year.  |p369THE  DAY AFTER DOUDOU 'S WEDDING TO THE DUC DE VENTADOUR , Maman- who had attended the ceremony and the subsequent festivitiesat the Hotel de la Mothe in fine fettle , fell ill with rheumatism . The poor woman really suffered a great deal : she had a series of chills , and her arms and legs were so swollen that she could not bear the least movement without groaning , even so much as was necessary to turn her over in bed . The next night her fever ran so high that her mind wandered a little and she reverted to her old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her confessor and the nuns  --  of holding conversations with departed relatives . Her husband , a favourite younger brother , and Aunt and Uncle de Marville were invoked in turn , while the Superior of the Carmelites , who was a rather silly creature , easily alarmed and useless in an emergency , sent the conventporter to fetch the Comtesse d'Olonne , convinced that Madame de la Louppe could not last until morning . Maman herself was of this opinion . In her more lucid intervals she started bestowing sundry scraps of jewelry as keepsakes on the frightened sisters who attended her , regardless of the vows that prohibitedthem from accepting anything in the way of worldly goods . But she waved away the grumpy priest , who had been hastily roused to confess her , with a magnificent gesture and a graciously confident ' My good man , I 've nothing to tell you . If everybody I know had as little to trouble ' em on their consciences in this dread hour as I .. Cateau arrived about an hour after midnight , in a towering rage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a stop to the serio-comic business immediately . Nonsense , Maman , you 're not going to die ! ' she said sourly to her prostrate parent . ' All you need is some good hot herb tea and another pair of blankets . I told you not to kneel in the draught at church while that chit was getting married yesterday  --  but you would n't pay any attention to me ! Now you see who was right about that ! ' She dismissed the grumpy priest and the flurried Superior ( who was only too glad to relinquish the responsibility ) ; brewed the herb tea herself in the convent refectory ; and by the time she was ready to leave Madame de la Louppe was rid of her fever and had fallen asleep . In the morning the patient was distinctly more comfortable , and a day or two later she was pronounced almost well . However , the swelling in her limbs persisted painfully , and Doctor Pecquet , who had become the family 's physician since Doctor Patin was grown too old to continue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , you want to kill me ! ' cried Maman , sitting up in bed swathed in shawls and imbibing a cup of beef bouillon . ' How could I venture so far from home in my precarious state of health ? ' Nay , madam , ' objected Doctor Pecquet , it 's precisely to remedy that state that I 'm thinking of sending you ... ' And Cateau clapped her hands and said : ' Splendid ! The very thing , Maman ! You remember how hard I tried to get you to go there with me last spring . If only you 'd sometimes allow yourself to be guided by me .... But tell me , sir , would not the waters of Bareges be even more efficacious ? Surely a warm southern climate , like that of the Pyrenees .. Maman rolled a reproachful eye towards her daughter . ' Bareges ! ' she exclaimed . Worse and worse ! I see what it is , dear  --  it 's a conspiracy got up between you . I suppose you 've grown tired of waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us learn , sooner or later , what it means to outstay our welcome in this life ! Do n't worry , Cateau : I 'll not be here to trouble you much longer ... Maman ! How absurd ! You know perfectly well ' I know one thing , child , and that is , what my income amounts to and what I can afford and what I ca n't , though you 're always accusingme of having no system in my business affairs . System , indeed ! I should like you to tell me who protected your property singlehanded , when you and Magdelon were scarcely more than babes at the breast ! God only knows the problems I faced , a young widow , alone in the world , not much more than a child myself , and beset by every temptation of the Devil  --  for I was considered a pretty woman in my day , a very pretty woman indeed , though I dare say you would n't remember that ! But never once  --  no , not once : I can say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , nor forget what I promised your poor dear Papa on his death-bed . And so these are my thanks .... I 'm to be turned out of doors to die in the streets ! ' Maman , ' said Cateau quietly , as soon as she could manage to get a word in edgewise , ' you know , of course , I mean to pay for your trip . ' ' Oh , well , love , in that case perhaps'You may have the old winter coach and the chestnut pair I usuallytake to Caen . ( You 'll be back , I imagine , long before it 's timep371for me to go to Normandy . And if you 're not , it does n't make any difference , for I 've ordered some new carriage-horses from Ireland . ) Pierre can drive you , and Jean be your footman . Yes , Maman , and besides  --  so that you sha n't want for any comfort on your journey  --  I 'll give you Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis for your companion ! ' Afterwards , Cateau congratulated herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wondering all week what to do with Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis . The idea of beginning her liaison with Fervaques while living under the same roof as that blameless virgin was somehow repugnant to her . What would the girl say when she knew ... ? And she would know at once , naturally . Cateau feared that those mild doe-brown eyes had already seen a good deal more than they were intended to see . Like all passive onlookersat life , Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis was a matchless observer  --  and doubtless recorder as well  --  of the actions of others . It was more than likely that she could furnish , at a moment 's notice , a complete catalogue of her mistress 's deeds during the twelvemonth they had spent together . And now that there were to be misdeeds , also , Cateau had no mind to endure the patient vigilance a single unnecessary day . Yet was it really a sin ? Once Maman and her new attendant had been dispatched to Vichy Cateau gave herself to her young lover readily , almost gaily , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuring by their behaviour ? Although technically still a marriedwoman , she was no longer a wife ; Fervaques , too , was as free as air . He had not even an old attachment to relinquish before entering the bonds of the new , like most young men of his age and class ... . With amused surprise Cateau found that she was actually his first real mistress ( barring a few tentative adolescent experiments that could scarcely be said to count ) . His first ! And he was six-andtwenty . It seemed incredible . But he had whispered his secret shyly to her that night , as he lay sobbing with rapture in her arms  --  and it had only added to her feeling of almost maternal affection .... Cateaulay awake , long after her lover had fallen asleep , with his dark head pillowed on her breast . ( Thank Heavens , it was not the fashion to wear one 's periwig to bed ! ) His breath rose and fell as evenly as a child 's ; she felt his heart-beats , no longer pulsing wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms closed protectively around him . She felt old . . . but still grateful to the bottom of her heart for what he had given her . A strange tenderness , something none of the lovers of her youth had inspired , moved her almost to tears , and she vowed to do her best to cherish this young creature who trusted in her , and never to fail him in sympathy and devotion , whatever might befall . Hour after hour her thoughts moved round in circles ; she shifted her position again and again , for it was so many years since she had shared her couch with anyone that she had grown used to lie alone ; and she heard the bells of Saint-Eustache chime two o'clock  --  then three  --  then four  --  before she , too , lost consciousness at last . In the morning , when she woke to find him gone , she could not at first believe that he had really been there , and this though it was she herself who 'd given him strict orders to depart before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ? She yawned and stretched ; the delicious fatigue invading her senses reassured her ; and when at length she rallied sufficiently to shake the silver bell to summon Quentine , for once her matutinal languor was not assumed . Quentine , it need hardly be said , was in high feather over the turn things had taken . She poked her head in the door this morning positivelyradiant ; her manner was as discreetly merry as that of a soubrettein one of Moliere 's comedies . ' Now at last affairs are back on a proper footing , ' it seemed to say , without the clumsy medium of words . ' My mistress is as good still as she ever was . No need any longer to hang our heads when we go driving in the Cours  --  we 've got ' a gallant to post beside our carriage , too ! ' From the width of her waiting-maid 's smile Cateau deduced that Fervaques ' tip had been twice as generous as it need have been . ( Poor child ! That was merely owing to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him on the subject later . There was no use in throwing money away  --  and besides , it would only spoil Quentine . As it was , the girl had far too good an opinion of herself . ) ' Good morning , madam . I did n't know ... I thought perhaps His Excellency the Governor .. At this pompous phrase Cateau had a sudden vision of the sobbing boy with tumbled curls who had lain in her arms a few hours before , and suppressed a smile . Then she said severely : ' Quentine , I should like you to understand this , once and for all . As far as you know , no one 's been here . No one whatever  --  d' you see ? ' ' Yes , madam , of course , ' replied Quentine , slightly crestfallen , but still smiling . ' Naturally . I only thought -- 'You may think what you choose as long as you keep your mouth shut , ' said Cateau , compressing her lips and looking unaccountably prim . ' I dare say Monsieur de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a matter I do n't care to discuss with you or with anyone . Later , I do n't say what may or may not happen  --  but for the present things are to continue exactly as they were before . Do you understand me ? ' ' Yes , madam . ' Quentine looked rather frightened and dropped a curtsy in her confusion . ' Of course , madam . '  | ' Very well , then . I hope I sha n't have to refer to this again . Nowtell me , what do you think of the weather ? ' Cateau could not tell why it was , but she felt that it was extremely important to keep her new relations with Fervaques a secret . It was very odd : she had not felt so in her younger days , with other lovers , when so much more had been at stake . Now she had nothing left to lose except Charlotte de Bonnelle 's good graces and the impersonal friendship of the sisters at the convent in the rue Bouloi , yet the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldmaidishduring the long years she had lived by herself ? Or was it perhaps that she was unwilling to have people know she had taken so young a lover ? ( But then , look at Magdelon with her little Duke , scarce older than Henri , her eldest son ! ) Whatever the reason , her reluctance to confess the liaison grew even stronger with time . She imposed rigorous rules of conduct upon Fervaques : he was not to call on her publicly more than twice a week , nor to ride beside her coach in the Cours oftener than every other afternoon . Moreover , when she was at his mother 's house , he was to take care not to approach her too intimately , not to smile at her in the presence of others , and especially not to seek a private conversation , unless she should give him express leave to do so . ' Yes , madam , of course  --  whatever you wish  --  but why ? Why ? Are you ashamed of me ? ' Fervaques would demand of her when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a meaning look and tap of her folded fan on his knuckles , to impress their consequenceon his youthful mind . ' You know that 's not it , ' Cateau was wont to make answer at such times , bending over to drop a kiss on his forehead , there where he lay at her feet . ( She was generous enough with her endearments when there were no witnesses . ) ' You know I am so proud of you there are no words to say what I feel . But do n't you agree with me that our love seems twice as precious because it is hidden from everyone else ? ' And Fervaques , clasping her slim white hand in his , kissed her fingers in ecstasy and assented passionately : what else , after all , was there for a gentleman to do ? So the weeks passed , and spring came , and the secret remained a secret . Cateau confided in no one save Magdelon  --  and even that was an accident . The latter came to see her sister one afternoon when Fervaqueswas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marechale to the dressing-room without warning her mistress . Magdelon , naturally , was enchanted by her discovery . ' Darling , ' she cried , dewy-eyed , directly she and Cateau were alone  --  Fervaques ' awkward and precipitate leavetaking would have told an even stupider woman the truth , had there been nothing else to reveal it  --  ' how happy I am ! This is what I have prayed might happen  --  now you wo n't be lonely any more ! ' ' Oh  --  lonely , ' said Cateau , with a deprecating smile . ' There are worse fates , perhaps . ' ' Not for you or me , ' said Magdelon , with conviction . ' We need people . Oh , but it will all be too perfect ! You must promise to visit me at La Ferte this summer . It 's so heavenly there in June when the roses are in bloom , and we 'll be quite undisturbed , just you and I and the children  --  and of course Longueville and Monsieur de Fervaques , also  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forges for the cure . There 's nothing so satisfactory , is there , as a well-balanced quartet ? ' ' A quartet ? But surely the Marechal ... ' ' Oh , well , of course he will be there , too . But he goes first to Bourbonto take the waters for his gout  --  that uses up nearly a month  --  and then , when he is at home , he 's almost always in bed , poor dear ! or else being carried in his sedan-chair to the farmyard or out into the fields , so that he can abuse the men and tell them they 're doing everything wrong . Poor La Ferte ! I only wish ... Oh , Cateau '  --  with a sudden look of fear  --  ' it 's so horrible to grow old ! ' ' I do n't ever mean to , myself , ' said Cateau , with a new complacency . ' Age , my dear , is entirely a question of will-power . ' ' But you 'll come , wo n't you , dear ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted . Cateau kissed her sister . ' Yes , with pleasure . ' ' And you 'll get Fervaques to come , too ? ' Here Cateau hesitated . It was all very well for Magdelon , who was the mistress of a royal duke , to be sympathetic about her sister 's affair with a young son of the late Councillor de Bonnelle ; but Cateauwas not sure she cared to risk a comparison of their respective gallants at close quarters . It was more than likely that the contrast between them would serve only to crush the rising flower of her hardly regained self-esteem . She could not , of course , admit this without appearing in too petty and egotistical a light . Accordingly she smiled instead and shook her head lightly as she murmured that she thought it quite possible His Highness the Duc de Longueville might object to meeting a junior cavalry officer in one of the regimentsof his cousin the Queen on such an intimate footing ... . ' Oh , my dear , he wo n't care in the least ! He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm there , nothing else really matters to him . And you forget  --  Fervaques is a governor now . ' ' Well , so he is , ' said Cateau tolerantly , ' though I confess he does n't yet look the part . I do want to bring him to see you somep375day , for , come to think of it , you 're to inherit La Louppe after Maman 's death , and that 's a part of the Perche , is n't it ? It 's just as well to be on good terms with officials . One never knows when they may be useful ... Then you 'll both come ! ' exclaimed Magdelon , radiant . But Cateau only smiled and shook her head again and said she 'd see about it . As a matter of fact , she was exceedingly anxious this year to get out of Paris . It seemed to her that every wall in her house had eyes and ears ; she longed to leave the too familiar background behind her and hug her secret to her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the country was just what she needed , though she had not forgotten the similar urge that had swept over her , two years ago , when she was recovering from a sharp attack of tertian fever . Perhapsher love for Fervaques was only another form of illness  --  and it , too , was passing ... . But privately she did not think so . She stayed in town until the first week in May , when her lover left for Le Mans , the seat of his principal government . In spite of his urgent entreaties she refused to accompany him . However , in their farewell interview she promised , in order to soften his disappointment , to write to him every day : that was no longer a task , now that Quentine had learned to counterfeit her mistress 's hand so cleverly . Cateau said nothing about Magdelon 's invitation to the castle of La Ferte , deeming it best to wait and let future events shape themselves . So the new governor of Maine and Perche and the County of Laval rode away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postilions , while his mistress prepared to take her departure for Normandy a full month earlier than usual , much to her servingwomen'sdisgust . Cateau was precise in the performance of her business errands . Love might come , or love might go  --  but taxes went on falling due just the same , rents had to be collected and leases signed , even if a young man in Le Mans chewed his nails in despair and vowed that the skies would fall if his beloved stopped in Caen another twentyfourhours . The Countess opened her pretty house in the suburbs as she always did , and gave her customary series of dinners to the local gentry , ending up with a very successful garden-party , whose attractions included a performance of Tartuffe by a troop of comedians from Rouen ( they were only too glad to come for half-price in the dull summer season ) and some beautiful fireworks imported from Paris . The polite world of Caen was enchanted by Madame d'Olonne ... . When she finally left , after a stay of six weeks , she was several thou- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailiffs agreed that the prospects for the harvest were most encouraging and that her affairs had never been in a more prosperous condition . The journey to La Ferte was as long and dull as journeys in the country invariably were . The roads were exceedingly bad , and Cateauhad no company save that of the dejected Quentine and Lucie , who were in a state of smouldering rebellion over the length of their absence from Paris . If this were what having a lover had done to their mistress ! ... And even granting that an exile might be temporarilynecessary , why exchange Caen , which at least was a city of sorts , for the unrelieved rural seclusion of La Ferte , where there was no society worth mentioning ? ( that provided by the IIarechal 's half-civilized grooms and farmers being beneath contempt from the viewpoint of supercilious town-bred damsels ! ) Gateau remained markedly unconscious of the ill-temper of Quentineand Lucie . For once in her life , greatly to her own surprise , she seemed to be in a cheerful mood away from home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smooth and sweet and green . Let those silly sluts on the opposite bench frown as much as they liked , as long as the warm June sun went on smiling on the fruitful grain fields and flower-strewn hills ! Even in the dense woods of oak and beech that occasionally varied their way , it managed to filter through the branches , making a cool lime-gold aisle for the coach to pass through . Cateau found herself smiling , too , now and then , she did not know why , and humming casual scraps of tunes she had not thought of in years . She made it a point of honour not to stop at Le Mans , although it was so little out of her path that she could easily have done so without appearing to force the matter . But for the present she did not need to see Fervaques  --  she did not even want to see him , especially . It was enough to be comfortably sure that he was there .... In her tranquil high spirits the days passed quickly , and the nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of better accommodation , in small rustic inns by the wayside , where the hosts shared a smoky **25;7905;TOOLONG with their guests , and the solitary bedchamber above it that was put at the disposal of the Countess and her women was a dusty , airless garret the lowest scullionat the house in the rue Villedo would have scorned . But Cateau continued to smile at everything and to make no objections , though it was her wont ( Quentine told Lucie privately ) to carp ceaselessly on a trip if the lodgings fell short of her exacting requirements . They had not brought their beds with them from Caen , as they ordinarily did when travelling , for the guest-suites at La Ferte were fully furnished ; but there were clean sheets to spare iii the Countess 's trunk and a blanket or two , and , if necessary , ' We canp 377 make our beds in the hay ! ' Madame d'Olonne declared , clapping her hands and throwing back her head to laugh like a child . ( HereQuentine and Lucie exchanged a look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They reached their destination late in the afternoon of the third clay after leaving Caen . The castle of La Ferte-Saint-Aubin was a huge pile of rose-red brick with stone trimmings , situated in a wood on the flat , marshy plain of the Sologne about two leagues south of Orleans . Like most such seats , it had been built at a good many different periods : the main part of the house dated from the time of the Valois and had the high peaked roofs and stately charm of the sixteenth century . Some thirty years ago , however , the Marechal had begun reconstructing his residence according to the plans of the famous architect Francois1ansart , who had modernized the original wherever he could and added sundry outbuildings in the early Louis XIV style . Cateau had always secretly thought it a dreary place . The neighbourhoodseemed to her ugly ; its flatness depressed her , bred as she had been amongst verdant Norman hills ; and the house itself was undeniablydamp , standing beside the sluggish little river Cosson , which crawled round it to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes . Moreover , society in the Orleannais was scarce and what there was , was dull . She therefore took care not to visit Magdelon in the country morethan was absolutely necessary for the maintenance of amicable sisterlyrelations , preferring , if possible , to meet her at Forges or Vichyin the season instead . Magdelon asked her , of course , to come every year , and Cateau always said she would  --  and then , nine times outof ten , wrote later to apologize  --  would her darling ever forgive her ? but there was some stupid mix-up in her schedule .. . They rolled over the drawbridge this evening past the two squat red-brick lodges and the long green front lawn that was , as usual , somewhat overgrown and weedy , and drew up at the handsome stone entrance . Several flunkeys in untidy half-buttoned uniforms hurried to meet them , colliding clumsily in their haste to open the carriage door ; and presently a sad-eyed butler , with soiled white gloves and his wig on crooked , appeared , yawning  --  no need to inquirewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcethat the Marechale was , he believed , in the park with the children . Cateau jumped out of the coach and nodded brightly . Good-day , Hippolyte , ' she said . I 'll go join my sister . No , don'ttrouble to come with me ; I know the way well . If you will be so good as to take charge of my women ... ' It took her longer to find Magdelon than she had thought . The ood was damp and full of insects , and the path she followed was rather tentative and twiggy . She was guided , however , by the sound of children 's voices ; and at length she emerged from the trees onto slightly higher ground , where there was a little field full of sunshine and singing larks . At the far end of the field some peasants were cutting hay , bending rhythmically with the precision of balletdancersas their scythes swished through the grass . But near at hand it still stood long and lush , starred with white daisies and blue cornflowersand scarlet poppies in profusion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers , the sun and the lark-songs , sat Magdelon , surrounded by her family . The Marechale de la Ferte-Senneterre was wearing an old brown dress of some homespun material , put on anyhow ; and she was hatless  --  her beautiful dark curls tumbling over her shoulders quite as loosely as her young sons ' . She appeared to be very busy weaving a chain of field-flowers and nursing a chubby white puppy with one black ear , at the same time laughing and chatting with her children as merrily , Cateau thought , as if she were one of them . The late afternoon sun fell full on the rosy cheeks  --  but she did not care ; little Jules and Tinette , repulsively grubby after their romp , clung to her skirts unchidden . Henri and Louis , who were playing tag with loud shrieks of delight about a small apple tree , ran into each other just as their aunt appeared , tripping over their mother 's feet  --  and Magdelon only laughed , pushed the hair out of her eyes , and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Cateau took in her sister 's appearance with horror , mingled with an unwilling admiration . It was like Magdelon to go to extremes : she was either the model fine lady at court , stiff with brocades and laden with jewels , painted and scented to the ultimate degree of perfection  --  or she simply let herself go , dressed like one of her own farmer 's wives , and paid no heed to her hair and complexion . What was irritating was that she looked equally lovely either way ; neglect did not seem to injure her beauty . As she sat there , windblown and sunburnt and laughing , in the midst of her babies and flowers , she might have posed for a picture of Ceres , the Goddess of Plenty herself . Beside her , Cateau felt pallidly artificial in her pretty green travelling-dressand the feathered bonnet that allowed each yellow curl to escape so far  --  and no farther  --  over the graceful shoulders . True , she too was dressed for the country , but for a very different kind of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Caen had no more in common with this sweet-scented , untidy meadow than the Parisian belle with the blooming mistress of La Ferte-SaintAubin . For a moment Cateau stood on the edge of the wood , while the larks went on singing , the peasants mowing , and Magdelon and her children laughed and called out to one another . Then she started top379pick her way gingerly through the long grass , taking care to poke with the point of her parasol well in advance of each step , for fear of snakes . Magdelon heard the rustle of silken skirts and looked up with a cry of delight . Darling ! It 's you ! ' she said . How glad I am ! Now our party is quite complete . Longueville got here last night , and it was only this morning that Monsieur de Fervaques arrived from Le Mans . ' As she sprang to her feet , still holding the white puppy with the black ear , but scattering the flowers in her lap far and wide , Cateau could not help seeing , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last detail was not missing in the picture of the Goddess of Plenty : so the Toucy 's scandalous story was true , after all !  |p380MAGDELON  , WEARING A LOOSE LACY DRESSING-GOWN AND WITH HER I ' black hair hanging in two long plaits down her back , came to Cateau'sroom that night as the latter was making ready for bed . It was very late : they had sat at table till well past midnight ; the candleswere guttering low in their sconces and the footmen , who were waiting to put them out , had begun to yawn prodigiously behind their hands , long before the quartet showed signs of breaking up . But whatever the hour , Cateau 's coucher was an elaborate process . Fervaques must restrain his impatience as best he could : she composedherself for twenty minutes by the clock , while Quentine brushed her curls and Lucie patted divers creams and powders and lotions on her arms and hands and face . She sat still , staring straight ahead , thinking even as little as possible ; for one of her maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active exercise of the brain before retiring . Magdelon drifted restlessly about the big room , smoothing a cushion here , straightening a vase of flowers there , and obviously waiting until Cateau had sent her women away to unburden her mind . So at length , with a sigh , the latter murmured : ' That will do , Lucie ; good night . Good night , Quentine . I 'll ring if I need you again '  --  and then turned to Magdelon with an arranged expression of bright interest . Magdelon was seated on the edge of the bed , twirling a rose she had plucked from one of the jars on the mantelpiecebetween her fingers ; she was regarding the flower so intently that she seemed unable to look up to meet Cateau 's questioning glance ; but Cateau did not need to see her sister 's face to know it was almost as red as the rose . Magdelon was embarrassed . That was strange  --  for up to now she had sailed through the intricacies of the evening with far more serenity than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the whole thing , which was , of course , the only sensible way to behave . One could not help envying her her ease of manner , the innocence with which she appeared to maintain that there was nothing odd or improper in the fact of the four of them being there together  --  two middle-aged women ( for one might asp381well face it : that was what they were ! ) with their young lovers , holdingillicit rendezvous in the house of the husband of one of the women . However one chose to look at it , it was not a savoury situation . The men , each in his way , proved that they realized that  --  Fervaques , by his frequent sober silences , in spite of an inner radiance that shone through them persistently ; and the Duke , by an unaccustomed , well-nigh feverish loquacity . Cateau herself had felt less socially competent than usual , though she chatted gaily away with Monsieur de Longueville , discussing his trip to Flanders with the King to view the new fortifications , from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speedy and unequivocal victory in the forthcomingwar with the Dutch . But while her tongue was delivering infalliblejudgements concerning the rival merits of commanders she had never seen and the impregnability of citadels she had never even heard of , she remained acutely conscious of what three at least of the company were trying to forget .... It was only their hostess whose eyes were guileless , Magdelon 's laugh that rang out again and again over trifling jests , as clear and uncalculated as a child 's . Cateau had glanced at her sister admiringly , until her admiration faded as she perceived that Magdelon was acting naturally because she felt natural  --  she was as incapable of reflection as the child whose laughter her own evoked . This was followed by the inescapablecomparison between their respective motives for taking such immaturelovers : Cateau , quite frankly , preferring a young man who would be subservient to her and whom she could hope to mould . ( Having failed to find a ready-made gallant to suit her tastes , she intended to make one to measure . ) But Magdelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally adolescent . This being so , why , then , had her happy aplomb deserted her ? Why was she now half-crouched on the bed , with downcast looks and trembling lips , and a colour that ebbed and flowed while one watched it ? Why did the hand that held the rose shake so pathetically when Cateau gave it a little pat ? And why , at this modest sign of affection , did Magdelon suddenly cast pretences aside and fling herself sobbing into her sister 's arms ? .. . It was some minutes before calm was fully restored . When she had finally checked her tears and put herself to rights once more , Magdelon looked up to say with a rueful smile : ' My dear , forgive me  --  this sha n't happen again . I 'm tired and overwrought tonight . And ever since dinner-time I 've been feeling so horribly ill .... Oh , no , it 's nothing serious . You know how it is in the first few months . ... But you do n't know , do you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So at last the secret was out ! Cateau , in order to test her , pre- tended on purpose to misunderstand and said , moistening her lips : Then you and La Ferte have hopes again ? ... I thought when I saw you that it must be so  --  and yet it seemed hard to believe  --  in his state of health .... Dear , I 'm happy for you if you 're happy about it ... but really , with four young ones already , and three of them sons , perhaps it 's not an unmixed blessing . Still , I suppose ... ' Magdelon looked at Cateau steadily , though her cheeks burned redder than ever . ' You need n't pretent to me , ' she said . ' You know the baby 's not my husband 's . It 's Longueville 's son I am carrying now .... It will ' ' be a son .... I feel it will ... ' Oh , but , my dear , how can you ? ' said Cateau . ' I mean  --  what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care ! Let them say what they like ! They 'll have no proof . I am going to bear Longueville a son in December . ' This was terrible . Defiance Cateau had been prepared for , and even a touch of hysterical bravado  --  but not this bright-eyed , tranquilobstinacy .... It was like a foolish hen-pheasant protecting her nest , though the hunter 's gun was already aimed at her head . Cateaualmost wrung her hands in despair as she exclaimed : ' But your husband , then ! Have you thought of him ? He 'll know the truth , whomever else you may trick . What will he do when he learns ... ? My dear , be warned in time . There are ways of avoiding this . Do , do consider ... ' ' I have considered , ' said Magdelon . ' But it 's no use . Charles wants his son , and he 's a right to have him . And I want him , too , just as much as he does . No , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awful air of judicious decision , as though she had reasoned the problem out by herself and come by a series of carefully considered steps to its one possible solution . Cateau , who knew Magdelon as well as Magdelon knew herself  --  if not better !  --  was convinced that she had done nothing of the kind . Poor silly girl ! She was Maman all over again  --  her innate lack of wisdom and incapacity for reflection masked by a gay glaze of trustful assurance that could deceive no one who loved her as Cateau did . Once that small emotional outburst was over  --  which , after all , had been due to purely physical causes  --  she would drift unerringly to perdition , without a single backward glance of misgiving . Cateau could not bear to see it happen . She could not bear to let the frail , crazy craft spin past her , headed straight for the dangerous rapids below , and not at least stretch out a rescuing hand . Was it already too late to save her ? At any rate , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the patience she could muster , ' I do n't believe you realize what you 're saying . Your husband will repudiateyou . If he chooses to cast you off into the street , there 'll notp383be a hand raised to stop him . And what can you do by yourself  --  alone , against the whole world , you , who have nothing except what he 's given you ? ' ' But why need he know ? ' Magdelon 's eyes had not lost their annoying placidity . Cateau could have shaken her . ' Child  --  use your head ! What else can he think ... ? ' ' I mean  --  why need he know it 's even been born ? He 's too old and too ill now to watch over me as he used to do . I can stay here in the country as long as I have to  --  and there 's not a servant in the house I ca n't trust to be on my side .... Even Robert ... now .... La Ferte 's been hard on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , Charles and I  --  there 's no reason on earth why we ca n't go through with it ! Of course , I ca n't keep the baby with me afterwards , which is a great pity . But Charles has thought of that  --  he 's thought of everything , really , dear fellow ! He 's arranged for Clement to take care of me  --  you know , the accoucheur who goes to the Montespan when she and the King ... It will cost two thousand francs , I 'm afraid , but it 's worth it . Then he 's got a house ready in the Faubourg Saint-Germain , and Porlier , his secretary , who was his tutor when he was a boy , has promised to take charge of little Charles , too , when the time comes . Oh , you 'll see  --  you 'll see ! It will be all right , deartruly , I promise you ! I ca n't refuse Longueville the one thing he 's ever asked of me  --  what none of his other mistresses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! ' snapped Cateau . ' Naturally , they had more common sense . If he really considered you , he 'd never suggestit . Oh , I 'll say no more , since I see you 've resolved to stake your whole future for the sake of a whim . Very well , then  --  go ahead , if there 's no stopping you ! Have your baby , if you must . Fool the world , if you will  --  and your husband into the bargain , if you 're able to . God knows , I 've no love for my brother-in-law ! But do n't forget , Magdelon , it 's more than likely the whole story will come out , in the end . And then , what 's to become of you ? Have you and your precious Duke thought of that ? What will you say to La Ferte if he finds out what you 've done ?  --  what you are ? ... ' ' But , Cateau , dear , ' said Magdelon , interrupting her sister in defianceof her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , he 's always known . ' ' Then why ... ? How ... ? ' Cateau gave up the puzzle and shook her head in utter bewilderment . She had wondered for years how much the Marechal guessed of his wife 's way of living . It seemed incredible that he should not have had strong suspicions , to say the least , with Great Senneterre thronged from morning till night with the gayest , most gallant youngI courtiers in Paris . For alas ! once Magdelon had broken her marriage vows she behaved very much worse than Cateau had ever done . She fell in love regularly every month , with the inevitable results , given her beauty and excitable temperament . Beuvron had been merely the vanguard of a long line of successful candidates for the affections of Madame de la Ferte . The naughty Comte de Gramont  --  the haughty Marquis d'Effiat  --  sly , unscrupulous Villarceaux ( who had quarrelled with his mistress after a fortnight and shown her letters all round the court )  --  these were but a few of the names that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . But what was really extraordinary was that whilst Magdelonwas parcelling out her favours breathlessly right and left with an almost ludicrous lack of calculation , she had gone on living with her husband on the best of terms , as far as anyone , even her sister , was able to tell . The old Marechal , who shouted and stamped at all the rest of the world , still adored his wife  --  or appeared to adore her . But he was no fool . Must he not at times have doubted ... ? Magdelon , ' said Cateau brusquely , facing her , ' just what do you mean ? Have you confessed to your husband ? ' ' No . Oh , no . ' Still , you say that he knows ... ' ' Yes , ' said Magdelon , very low ; ' he knows . ' Tears rose to her eyes , as they often did ; she had not lost her childish habit of crying on the smallest pretext . ' Then why ... ? How ... ? ' said Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' My dear , ' said Magdelon , brushing the drops away with the lace of her sleeve ( another habit of childhood ! ) , ' it 's so simple , really . He knows about me  --  but he 's so fond of me that he pretends he does n't know . That 's all . I found it out years ago when Gramont and I .. . Oh , I can recall it now as though it were yesterday ! La Ferte had gone to court to a meeting at the war minister 's , and Gramont was with me in the green cabinet . . . when suddenly my page rushed into the room  --  you remember Jacquinot , that horrid little boy with pimples I had to keep so long because his mother was the chef 's mistress , and La Ferte said we 'd never find another cook so good ? . . . His sauces were marvellous , I must say , though I never could fancy his way with roast game .... But where was I , dear ? ' ' With Gramont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet . ' ' Oh , yes , of course ! ... How silly of me ! . . . Well , there we were , when Jacquinot burst in upon us , crying that the Marechal 's carriage was at the door , and the Marechal himself was halfway upstairs at that very moment . Poor Gramont ! You know what a coward he was . Off he dashed in his nightshirt with Jacquinot , leaving his clothes scattered all over the floor . My dear , I was nearly dead withp385fright ! I managed somehow to pick up his things , with my legs trembling so I could scarcely stand .... It was n't till after I 'd got back into bed that I saw I 'd forgotten his wig  --  but it was too late then to do anything about it  --  and there it lay on the table , as Main as the nose on your face , when La Ferte marched in to see me . I was so terrified I had n't a word to say  --  but he kissed me just as if nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it seemed centuries !  --  telling me about the meeting . I do n't know now what I said ; naturally , I could n't think of anything but that horrible wig !  --  and finally La Ferte noticed it , too . How could he have helped it ? He shouted to his valet : " Take my peruque away directly ! You damned fool , to leave such an object in the Marechale 's room ! " And the valet said  --  he was a nasty new creature who 'd taken a dislike to me from the moment he came  --  I got rid of him the very next day  --  : " My Lord , it is n't your peruque . " But I sha n't forget till my dying hour the look the Marechal gave him and the way he roared out : " Damme ! It is mine , I tell you ! Take it away this instant , or I 'll flog you till you wo n't be able to stand for a week ! " .. . So after that , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceiving him , but he could n't bear to give me up . Oh , my dear , you need n't think I was n't touched !  --  that I did n't try to do better . I cried and cried for days and days  --  and prayed , too .... But it was n't any use .... Oh , Cateau , you do n't know how hard it 's been sometimes ! You see , La Ferte 's so old  --  so old  --  all that side of life was finished for him before it even began for me . You married a young man ... . Oh , I know he was n't a good husband  --  not half so kind as mine  --  but at least he was young when you were young : you must have wanted the same things at the same time , in the beginning , anyhow . It was different for me . All La Ferte asked for was a home and heirs to inherit his fortune . Ah , I 've tried to give him what he wanted , too  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him happy . Yes , I 'm sure I have . He 's always better and more cheerful when we 're together  --  though of course there 've been times ... But it 's no good going into that , is it ? He loves me just as if I were one of his children  --  and I  --  well , I 've come to feel now that he 's almost like a father to me . You know I 'm too young to remember Papa  --  I suppose you can just do it  --  but I 've always felt we 'd have got on so well together . Maman says I 'm like him in so many ways  --  sleeping late in the morning , for instance , and liking my meat done to a turn , but eggs almost raw . . . . Oh , darling , I 'm wandering from the point again : please forgive me  --  I hardly know what I 'm saying tonight . What I 'm trying to tell you is this : I was twenty years old when I married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop living because your husbandhas stopped . You know that 's true . Oh , I 'm a wicked woman ! But I ca n't help myself . And no one else can help me , either . I've tried prayer . That did n't do any good . Nor confession . The priests give you absolution , and impose their penances  --  and you tell them you 're sorry , you promise not to sin any more  --  and you mean it at the time , of course .... But all the while you know perfectly well inside that you 'll do the same thing over again  --  maybe not with the same man ! ... Oh , Cateau , Gateau ! What can I do ? I love Charles so much  --  more than anyone I 've ever loved before ! I ca n't give him up  --  and I ca n't deny him the child he wants as the pledge of our love . Darling , do try to understand .... It 's not as if you had n't been tempted , too ... No , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , there , child ! Do n't cry any more , for pity 's sake ! ' But it was already too late : Magdelon had brought her flurried monologue to a close with a renewed burst of weeping , which relieved her overcharged feelings . At least so it seemed to Cateau , who began stroking her sister 's shoulder in a businesslike manner , but desisted as it was gradually borne in upon her that she herself was the more shaken of the two . To give herself time to recover her poise she rose from her seat on the bed beside Magdelon and walked across to the window , drawing the stiff brocade curtains aside and flinging open the casement on the warm June night .... It was very still in the park of the castle : a faint breeze sweet with the scent of new-mown hay just stirred the tops of the beeches , and the frogs below in the moat were loudly croaking . ( There was no doubt about it , La Ferte-SaintAubinwas damp ! ) Cateau felt perplexed by Magdelon 's unforced display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never  --  not even in the recklessdays of her youth  --  had she cared for anyone as Magdelon cared for her little Duke . Never  --  not even for Candale , whom she had loved as much as she could love any man  --  would she have risked such security as she had by bearing a child out of wedlock . For that matter , she had not wanted especially to bear one in it ; it had been no great disappointment to her to find that her union with Olonne was sterile .... Olonne , on the other hand , had minded very much indeed . . . . She recalled the little man 's petulant grievance over his growing conviction that he was not to have an heir . One spring , some four or five years after their marriage , he had imported from the Orientsome Japanese flowering cherry trees : exquisite , graceful little things , they had been set out with due care against a wall in the sunniestcorner of the garden , where they had done remarkably well , becoming covered , as the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the blossoms were not succeeded by fruit ; and Olonne , after his first fit of natural irritation had subsided , had amused the Gourmets ' Club by comparing the falsely promising cherry trees to the deceptive bloom of his Countess.  |p387This  long-forgotten incident returned now to Cateau 's mind ; she could not help thinking that her life might have been very different if she had not been barren . But it was useless to speculate .... Her own problems seemed remote in the face of her sister 's present need of succour and warm human comfort . For all the splendour of her outward existence , poor Magdelon was tragically alone ... . So Cateau hugged Magdelon affectionately and patted her back , as she always did , and promised to help her in any way she could . ( That , too , went without saying . ) Then the sisters kissed each other  --  their eyes solemn and staring in the wavering candlelight , despite the punctuality of their conventionalsmiles  --  and parted for the night , each to await the visit of her lover.  |p388NEXT  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was round and rested , her smile brightly infectious , her temper , as ever , serene and accommodating . Nor did she vary by so much as a hairsbreadth from this agreeable ideal during the rest of the time her guests remained at La Ferte-Saint-Aubin . If she were feeling ill , she gave no sign of it . Cateau remembered that most of Magdelon 's pregnancies had been easy ; it was only Louis ' birth that had cost her dear , for which unreasonable reason she loved her second son , if possible , even more passionately than her other children . In the end , their hostess 's persistent good-humour succeeded in galvanizing the whole party into something approaching her own refulgent high spirits . Cateau never would have believed it possible , but that stolen fortnight turned out to be one of the pleasantest experiences of her life . In the first place , the weather was really perfect , fine and warm , but not too warm ; so that they were able to be outdoors a great deal of the time . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragonflies quivered and darted in the sunshine and willows bent to trail their branches in the slow-moving amber waters . There were drives through the deep bird-haunted beech woods surrounding the castle , and al fresco meals at various local points of interest , engineered by the Marechale with so much artless enthusiasm that the most confirmed city-dweller could not have resisted its appeal .... We 're just like the shepherds and shepherdessesin Astree , are n't we ? ' said Magdelon happily . Cateau , who had always supposed she detested the country , found herself , much to her own surprise , in a mood of mellow acquiescence . She slept well and ate well , laughed more than she had done in years , and hardly made up her face at all . She smelled the roses , watched the dragonflies , listened to the birds in the beeches ; she kilted up her trailing silk skirts and strolled through the blossoming fields with Fervaques ; she even asked herself more than once if it might not be a good idea , when she went back to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town  --  say at Saint-Germain or Vincennes  --  for an occasional refuge.  |p389Of  course , a good part of her enjoyment was due to its being shared . Fervaques was constantly with her ; she found his companionshipmore satisfying than ever . His devotion was touching ; apparently he had but one desire in the world , and that was to grant all her desires , if possible , even before she expressed them . This gratified her extremely  --  what woman would it not have gratified ?  --  and the more he spoilt her , the more charming she was in return . Their eyes met scores of times a day in rapturous communion over many a small shared delight ; they were forever asking each other the superfluous question , ' Are you happy ? But tell me , my dear , are you truly happy ? ' just for the pleasure of exacting the inevitable answer . Moreover , the rare harmony of their relations was enhanced by their temporary removal from ordinary spheres of activity . No one knew where they were ; no one could follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Cateau looked back on the fortnight at La Ferte , it assumed in her eyes something of the quality of a belated honeymoon . Once in her life , she told herself then , she had known what it was to love and be loved in peace . Nor was her contentment shadowed , as she had if not quite dispassionately , at least with the perspicacity born of long experience of the breed , Cateau honestly felt that the advantage lay entirely with Fervaques . True , he was neither strikingly handsome nor alarmingly intelligent : with all his innate courtesy , he lacked , too , the pretty wit that enabled the other to turn a compliment on his mistress 's eyes or her smile with an air of ease denoting assiduous imitation of the best available models . But he was a good young man , a kind young man ; modest , yet manly , he bore himself in the company of his superior with exactly the right tone of self-confidence without fatuousness and deference without servility . ( Behold what Cateau had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago he would surely have stammered and blushed and fallen over his feet directly the Duke entered the room . ) As for Longueville , although as the days passed Cateau observed herself liking him better than she had at first supposed she could ever do , he by no means approximated her ideal of what a nobleman of his power and position ought to be . To begin with , while he had a handsome head , with the aquiline nose of the Bourbons and the keen blue eyes and ash-blond curls that recalled his mother , the Duchess Dowager ( who had been the acknowledged beauty of her day ) , his figure was both short and puny . It appeared sometimes as though , if one were to strip him suddenly of his ribbons and laces , of his fine satin coat and his high Russia-leather boots , there would be little left of His Highness the Duc de Longueville save a small , peculiarly persistent draught . His character , too , was contradictory and variable . At times he sat sullen for hours without speaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdain for and total disagreementwith the opinions of all other people in the room . Then again , he seemed bent on asserting his personality at any cost in whatever company he found himself : he laughed a great deal  --  a loud , ugly bray with no mirth in it  --  and contradicted everything that was said . When in this mood he ordered his servants about unmercifully  --  he had a great many servants , who , strangely enough , all adored him . He would also boast continually of his family , particularly of his uncle Conde , who was evidently his hero ; make ill-timed references , in the worst possible taste , to his amorous exploits ; and spin windily self-complacent monologues concerning various magnificent projects for the future . On one day , he was going to buy the charge of Colonel of the Swiss Guards for four hundred thousand francs from the Comte de Soissons ; on another , it was as good as settled that he was to be Grand Master of the Artillery instead . Still later , it appeared that fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become his bride and settle her huge estates on the Longuevilles  --  or the Queen of Poland had decided to divorce her husband and raise the Duke to the post of Prince Consort .... It was impossible to tell how much truth lay in these unguarded statements . The King , one had heard , was rumourednot to like his young relative  --  it was , alas ! easy enough to see why  --  and therefore , in spite of the latter 's bravery , which he had amply demonstrated in the Franche-Comte campaign and , later , in the unfortunate expedition to Candia , he had not yet found a place suited to his birth and undoubted ability as a soldier . Cateau could not help being reminded sometimes of Longueville 's cousin , her dear , dead lover Candale , who had been even more prominent and equally unlucky . Candale , she recalled , had had a similar preoccupation with his rank  --  only in his case it had taken the form of a regal splendour and serenity . He had not , at bottom , been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be so , because what was best in him showed most ; while the reverse was true of young Longueville , who would often , one felt , have liked to be pleasant if he had known how to set about it . He was the unwillingprisoner of his ill-humour , as Candale had been of his good one . Not unnaturally , this captious young man was at his best with women and children . The presence of another full-grown male , even so unassuming a specimen as Fervaques , was apt to put him on his dignity , ruffled up in quite uncalled-for battle array like an under/sized gamecock . But he was generally courteous , not to say complimentary , to Cateau and Magdelon ; and with the latter 's children he showed himself a delightful playfellow . He would recite verses or tell fairy-tales by the hour to little Jules and Tinette ; fence with the older boys , and allow them to handle unchided his rare collection of arms  --  muskets and rapiers and the cruel shining scimitars he had brought back with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dressing-room in the morning while his valet was shaving him , and sat side by side on the couch , wide-eyed in wonder at the marvellous accounts of His Highness 's adventures in such fantastic corners of the world as Amsterdam and Vienna and the Grecian Isles . This pleasing state of affairs was brought to an end very suddenly , one day a little over two weeks after Cateau 's arrival at La FerteSaint-Aubin . It was an unusually warm afternoon ; the ladies were seated at their tapestry work in the shade of a clump of tall beeches on the lawn in front of the castle . Fervaques , lying on the grass at their feet , read aloud to them the new play by Racine that had been sent to the Marecha.le from Barbin 's Library in Paris . In spite of the breathless heat , however , Longueville was not able to sit still . He had only that morning bought a string of ponies to replenish his stables in Normandy ; two of the gentlest and best-mannered beasts had been selected for the momentous task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughing and hatless , his long yellow curls streaming over his shoulders , the young Duke stood in the middle of the circular patch of lawn encouraging his pupils , who squealed with excitement as they raced round the drive , making innumerable well-meant if clumsy attempts to follow his directions . Cateau rather expected to see both her nephews plunge to the ground on their heads at any moment , but Magdelon did not seem in the least alarmed . She raised her eyes from her work now and again , but only to beam benevolently on her lover and the two little boys ; no doubt she was thinking how happy Longueville would be when he had a son of his own ... . Just as Louis , who , although the younger , was a good deal more agile than his brother , had finally succeeded in circling the ring half erect on his mount , and was shouting : Look , Maman ! Look at me ! ' there was a rumbling and a jingling and a big brown coach hove into sight at the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge and through the lodge gates ; then the six shaggy bay Percheronsthat pulled it broke into a lumbering gallop , which brought them up to the door of the castle in a cloud of dust , amidst the crackingof whips and the whooping of postilions.  | Cateau glanced up in astonishment . She had often seen her brother-in-law driving in town , where his equipage was second to none at court in conventional magnificence ; but it happened that this was the first time she had caught him off guard in the role of country gentleman . The heavy windowless carriage , with its enormouswheels and flapping side-curtains of Spanish leather , was like a page from the past . In just such a conveyance  --  perhaps in that very one  --  had the Marechal ridden forth to war in the days of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu . Then , as now , his coachmen and lackeys had worn leather jerkins and broad-brimmed plumed hats ; his original band of followers , who had won their spurs at La Rochelle and later plundered the countryside guerilla-fashion in the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been less prepossessing than the present crew . They were a swarthy , shifty-eyed lot , with long , unkempt black hair ; several of the men wore gold hoops in their ears , and all had strident voices and uncouthmanners . Robert , the Marechal 's chief valet , a grizzled villain with a game leg  --  souvenir of the Battle of Rocroi in ' 43  --  slipped with surprisingnimbleness between the curtains of the coach and turned to help his master alight . Cateau had not met La Ferte for several months ; she was shocked by the change in his appearance . Since he had become a chronic sufferer from gout he had been forced to forgo the violent exercise that had once kept him in fine physical trim , despite his indiscretionsat table . Now , although inactive , he had gone on eating as much as he liked of whatever he liked in defiance of the doctors ' orders , with the result that he had put on some thirty pounds . For a time his splendid big frame and lordly mien had enabled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole body seemed to have softened , as old men 's bodies often do . New creases appeared almost daily in his ravaged countenance , and as he had lately lost most of the lower row of his teeth ( the upper row had gone years ago ) , his jaw looked greatly shrunken , a defect all the more obvious since he had shaved his beard and contented himself with a mere straggling tuft on his chin . Gingerly now he stepped down from the high step of the carriage , leaning heavily on Robert and contorting his face in all manner of horrible grimaces , which would have been comic except that nothing the Marechal did ever appeared so . The little group on the lawn had risen to greet him . Fervaques , letting his book slide unheeded to the grass , stared openmouthed at his host . Magdelon was smiling calmly , evidently unembarrassed by this unlooked-for apparition . Longueville , too , Cateau thought , carried the situation off very well . He had clapped his hat on hisp393yellow curls and hastened over to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , how delightful ! ' exclaimed Monsieur de Longueville . ' We had not hoped to claim you from the charms of Bourbon for at least another week . ' The old man gave the young man a curious look , his thick lids drooping over the bold black eyes that alone of his features retained the fire of youth ; then he bowed his head . ' This is an honour , my Lord , ' he said , in a husky , metallic voice , like an echo of the clarion tones of the past . ' You are heartily welcome to La Ferte-Saint-Aubin . We meet all too seldom in Paris . But I must not complain . I know there 's little enough nowadays at Great Senneterre to attract young people . ' Could he be speaking seriously ?  --  or was his intention deliberatelyironic ? For there was Magdelon standing between her husband and her lover , and blushing as rosily as a girl ... . Longueville , at all events , chose to ignore possible unfriendly implications . He returned the bow as he murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure to see you . I called at your house several times last spring before going to Flanders with the King , but I was always told that you were out . Did the Marechale fail to deliver my messages ? Fie , madam , I believe you must have played me false there ! ' Magdelon smiled again and kissed her husband 's hand , to hide the fact that she was blushing more than ever . La Ferte patted her head , as if she had been a child , with his other great hairy paw ; and then Cateau rustled up smartly to bridge the difficult interval by presenting Fervaques , whom the Marechal acknowledged with a hollow guffaw and a thump on his guest 's startled back . ' I knew your father Bullion well , my boy , ' he declared . ' Or no  --  that was your grandfather , was n't it ? In any case , a dirty , thieving old rascal , if ever I saw one ! But he had a way with the ladies , had Bullion ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Madame de Sault in that connection  --  but that 's not to be repeatedin present company . I hope you 're as graceless a varlet , sir , as your late respected ancestor  --  God rest his soul ! Now come along , come along ! Zounds ! But I 've got a thirst to slake , after those cursed dusty roads ! Shocking state they 're in , to be sure ! I do n't know what the government 's thinking of . In my day the soldierscut ' cm to pieces . But we 've not had a war worth mentioning on French soil in more years than I care to count . Come along ! Come along ! Hippolyte , you dog , a flagon of Ay in the crimson cabinet  --  and look sharp about it ! ' So the party passed into the house , Magdelon clinging to her husband 's left arm , the Duc de Longueville , as befitted his rank , on the right of his host . Cateau and Fervaques followed the oddly assortedtrio , while Henri and Louis , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear . Supper that night was served in the great hall for the first time since Cateau had come to La Ferte-Saint-Aubin . During her husband'sabsences from home , so frequent during the early years of their married life , Magdelon had grown accustomed to eat in a small antechamber opening off the state apartment , which was more intimateas well as more easily heated in cold weather . The great hall was chilly even at midsummer , a vast room all gilt and marble and gaudy tapestries , lined with a double row of ancestralportraits . At least , that was what they were purported to be . . nor did the stiffly smiling painted lips betray any secrets concerning their origin , though it had often occurred to Cateau , and even sometimes to Magdelon , that , really , they could not all be ... since everyoneknew that the Senneterres were so new that it was as much as the Marechal could do to mention his grandfather 's name .... Supper itself was rich and abundant  --  far too abundant , thought Cateau , who would have preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying over the obvious waste in her sister 's house . Indeed , she had once gone so far as to inquire severely of Magdelon what became of the left-overs , and had shaken her head in bleak disapproval when the latter replied , with an easy laugh : ' Bless you , my darling , there are n't any ! ' It was a rather silent meal . The Marechal , whose impressive bulk loomed larger than before , if possible , against its splendid , spacious background , sat in the centre of the long board , hunched up in his chair , with his chin sunk on his chest and an unfathomable look in his murky eyes . Beside him Monsieur de Longueville , brave in scarletvelvet , his bosom sparkling with orders , appeared insignificant and flimsy , as if he were only two-dimensional and would have looked as flat as the Knave of Hearts ( whom he somewhat resembled ) if one could have managed to view him end on .... Fervaques , greatly awed by the august company into which he found himself thrust on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food into it ; while even Cateau , who generally found plenty to say to her brother-in-law , if only to dispute three out of four of his statements , felt little disposed to break the recurring edgy silences . Magdelon alone , radiant in white satin and pearls , seemed to be at her best this evening . She said whatever silly things came into her head , laughing and turning her face first towards her husband , then towards her lover , as if her contentment were complete , now that she had them both under one roof . Cateau marvelled at her sister 's sang-froid ; then again , as at the beginning of her visit , she was forced to conclude that stupidity rather than self-possessionp395was its keynote . Magdelon was happy because she was too dull to see that she ought not to be ; she felt secure because she had not the wit to perceive her danger . As dish succeeded dish La Ferte 's humour , which at first had been meditative rather than lowering , became definitely sinister . He ate a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly untidy eater , tearing his meat to pieces with his fingers and spilling his sauces recklessly down the front of his coat  --  and drank a great deal , in spite of his wife 's pleading glances . Magdelon would not have dared to remind him of Doctor Pecquet 's dictum , that stimulants were strictly forbidden ; but Cateau , who recalled it quite as clearly as her sister , shrugged her shoulders as she beheld the huge draughts of strong red Beaune disappearing down her brother-in-law 's gullet , and decided privately that tomorrow morning he would surely be in a terrific temper . By the time the Marechal had got to the end of the sweet , drops of sweat rained down his darkly flushed brow : he had worked himself up into a perversely aggressive mood , in which it was evident he intended to pick a quarrel , no matter with whom , no matter about what .... He had begun discussing the army with the Duke , and its prospects in the coming campaign against the Dutch ; this naturally entailed a review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scorn of an old trooper , dismissed summarily as a ' parcel of incompetent ninnies . ' ' Damme , sir ! ' he shouted , pounding the table with his fist . ' I know what I 'm talking about ! I tell you , there 's not one of the lot worth the powder it 'd take to blow him up . Crequy  --  pah ! Humieres  --  faugh ! Bellefonds  --  boo ! A bunch of lily-livered amateurs ! Zounds ! It was a different story in the days when I was at the head of His Majesty 's forces . We had some fighters worth mentioning then . There was n't half so much silly chatter about strategy , or military science , or that sort of modern nonsense . No ! In my time we simply went in and fought tooth and nail to the death  --  and Devil take the hindmost ! By God , sir , we did ! I tell you again , I know what I 'm talking about . I 've been in the service for nigh on fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I commanded the Comte de Soissons ' regiment at La Rochelle  --  yes , and damned well , too , though I say it myself ! I was at the siege of Privas in Languedoc  --  and in the wars in Piedmont  --  won my spurs as field-marshal at Hesdin for routing the Italian fox , old Piccolomini . Damme , sir ! Do n't try to tell me about the army ! Did n't I win the Battle of Saint-Nicholas in Lorraine , where the enemies lost two thousand men on the field and all of their cannon ?  --  and was n't I in charge of the left wing at Rocroi ? Damme , sir ! And how about my record in the Fronde ? '  | La Ferte was well away now , full-sail , on the favourite theme of his military exploits , yelling so loudly that the flame of the candles before him fluttered at every explosion and emphasizing his points by a persistent pounding on the board , which caused the dishes to rattle uneasily . Cateau sat back with a look of well-bred boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years , of the Marechal 's autobiography . Fervaques unfeignedly gaped at the quarrelsome old soldier . Magdelon , biting her lips , glanced anxiously from her husband to the Duke , and back again . Monsieur de Longueville , as a matter of fact , behaved very much better in these trying circumstances than his uncertain disposition could have given grounds to hope . He listened politely to the Marechal'stirade , tugging at his moustache to hide the amusement it caused him , but refusing to exercise the royal prerogative to interruptuntil La Ferte paused in the middle of a sentence to gulp a mouthful of wine before beginning again . ( For he had got only as far as the siege of Montmedy ; there was a deal else to follow , as Cateau and Magdelon knew only too well . ) At this juncture the Duke set down the glass of ruby-red Burgundyhe had been sipping reflectively and said , in a quiet voice : ' Sir , there is no doubt you have had an exceedingly distinguished career , of which His Majesty and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as yourself . I warrant there was more excitement to be had in those old cavalier days you speak of ; soldiersmay have been braver because the risks they were forced to take were greater . But I 'd fain not believe chivalry dead , nor that a young man of valour may not still find chances to prove his mettle . Besides , sir , are you not forgetting ?  --  some of our former leaders are still in the field , no less courageous and capable than of yore . Monsieur de Turenne , I dare swear , has lost none of his skill in years of inaction , and  --  God be praised !  --  my good uncle Conde 's yet to be reckoned with , as full of fire and natural genius as ever he was in the days of Rocroi and Nordlingen . ' Here , alas ! in his well-meant attempt to smooth his host 's irasciblevanity , Longueville had inadvertently stirred up a hornet 's nest . If there was one thing surer than another to goad La Ferte into a fury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he had fought sometimes with , sometimes against , as the sides shifted in the long years of the civil wars , remained active and able-bodied , while he himself  --  prematurely , as he felt  --  was laid on the shelf . ' Damme , sir ! ' he bawled , ' do n't you dare mention those nincompoops ' names in the same breath with that of a serious professionalsoldier ! Turenne may have his merits  --  I 'd be the last to deny ' em  --  but he 's always been as obstinate as a pig  --  and you know right well he 's been whipped at least twice for every time he'sp397come off on top . I call history to witness .... As for your uncle , sir  --  with all due respect to the blood of the Bourbons  --  he 's had luck on his side , that 's all . Luck  --  pure luck ! He was sent to war when he was a mere stripling .... Do n't I remember it ? Did n't I teach him more than half what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince gave him nominal command at Rocroi . Ask Turenne ! Ask anyone who was there ! Ask me  --  whose advice saved the day then and many another time for France , when his rashness would have tossed victory away for the sake of a little empty display . ' S death ! Did n't I show him up in his true colours in the war of rebellion , when I chopped his army to bits at the Battle of the FaubourgSaint-Antoine ? ... Yes , and I 'd have captured him and all of his men if it had n't been for that headstrong filly , Mademoiselle de Montpensier , who must needs play the heroine and turn the cannon of the Bastille on the forces of her own cousin , the King ! Well , she 's paid for that since .... No , sir ! Do n't prate to me of Conde 's militaryprowess , for I tell you , it 's a myth ! Had he the smallest success in Spain during the years of his exile ? You know he had not : he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was offered the chance , and slink back home like a beaten cur directly the King and the Cardinal gave him leave to do so . Zounds , sir ! I say ... As the Marechal continued heaping insult upon insult , his temper rose and his voice assumed the querulous bear-like whine common to cranky old men . The Duke suffered the angry monologue as long as he could . But at length his patience came to an end : he cared more , after all , for his uncle Conde than for all the rest of the family together . Springingup with white face and trembling lips , he drew his sword from its scabbard and flung it with a clatter at Magdelon 's feet . ' Enough , sir ! ' he cried . ' Hold , enough !  --  or , old as you are , you shall pay for this ! If it were n't for the respect I owe your wife , I 'd not have put up with your insolence so long as I have . Now I hand my sword into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to contain my wrath . Madame the Marechale , I beg your leave to retire . Madam '  --  to Cateau  --  ' I salute you . Sir '  --  to Fervaques  --  ' your humble servant . ' So saying , the little Duke strutted from the room with a parade of dignity so lofty that only the justness of his indignation saved it from seeming ridiculous . La Ferte , attempting to rise to head off his guest 's retreat , lurched drunkenly and fell back into his chair . As he collapsed his elbow struck the goblet of wine before him , overturningit . The carmine pool spread over the damask cloth , ran down it to the end and began to drip from its edge to the floor like drops of dark blood.  | Magdelon covered her face with her hands and burst into tears .. Fervaques , doubtful what course to pursue , regarded the sobbing form with dismay . There was nothing to say to comfort her : whateversuggested itself appeared at once to be something far better left unsaid . Cateau roused herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the situation . She rang for Robert to haul his halfunconsciousmaster off to bed ; then summoned her sister 's women , who , round-eyed with shocked curiosity , supported their weeping mistress to her own room . After that , she shooed away the remainingservants , who had naturally not had the delicacy to take themselvesoff ; mopped up the stains on the tablecloth as best she was able ; and , finally , blew out the candles and gave her hand to Fervaques , saying dryly : ' My dear , do you know , I believe we 'd better go back to Paris tomorrow ! '  |p399CATEAU  HAD BEEN HOME LESS THAN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS BEFOREdiscovering she had made a mistake in returning to town so precipitately . For , during her absence , Maman and her suite had also returned from Vichy , which meant that Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis was once more established in her post at the house in the rue Villedo , and the problem Cateau had been at great pains to postpone had finally to be faced with no further delay . It became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all , compared to the labyrinthine difficultiesof outwitting one 's lady companion . Olonne , say what one would , had let his wife do what she pleased and go where she liked , as long as he was not expected to follow . But Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis never quitted her mistress for a moment . Naturally , it was not her fault ; it was what she was paid to do . Nevertheless , it seemed terrible not to be able to shop or pay calls , go to Mass or the play , or even take the air in one 's carriage without that drab , discreetpresence . Nor was Cateau safer at home than abroad . There was no time of the day or night when she felt free from the possibility of interruption . She might send the girl out of the room , it was true  --  but who could deny her the door if she chose to return ? ... No , it was unbearable ! The Saint-Denis was eternally there , silent , unobtrusive  --  but on that very account the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or opened her letters , or had her hair dressed . Did the latter raise her eyes ever so casually , they were sure to encounter that other pair of eyes , brown and placid and unresentful ; while the soft voice would murmur : ' Did you speak , madam ? ... May I help you , madam ? ... Madam , do allow me to go instead of you ? ... ' There was no putting up with such a mild but relentless determination to do one 's duty . Worst of all , it was impossible for Cateau to see Fervaques without running the risk of betraying their secret . He could no longer call unobserved , for she could never be certain of being alone . It was dangerous even to write .... Cateau had often suspected Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis of inspecting her **29;7932;TOOLONG . . . . Of course , she could have made appointmentsoutside the house and stolen away to join her lover . It would have been hard , but with Quentine 's expert connivance she might just have managed it . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such stratagems . How many times then had she left home on the pretext of visiting the dressmaker or the drawingroomsof her women friends , only to exchange her coach for a public sedan-chair , once she 'd rounded the corner in safety ! How often had these clandestine excursions found their goal in some anonymous suburban pavilion , hired for their trysts by Candale or Guiche or the Abbe Fouquet ! What a web of mystery in those long-vanished times had surrounded her simplest comings and goings ! What a tissue of elaborate subterfuges had protected her least blameworthy frailties ! Indeed , she had grown so accustomed to depending upon them that she continued to practise her tinsel deceits years after she realized they were unnecessary . It was part of the game , that was all  --  merely what was expected of a professional coquette . And she had been young and reckless , and had greatly enjoyed seeing herself as the heroine of a series of breathless illicit romances . But all that belonged to a chapter of life that was closed . In spite of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow old . The very recollection of her early misdemeanours appalledher now , at her age of fixed habits and methodical pursuits . To roam the streets in search of love seemed to her both improper and highly ridiculous . No , it would never do . . . never .... Some dignified compromise must be found ... . Meanwhile , to Fervaques ' utter dismay , she forbade him the house save at hours when she was at home to the world at large  --  and she retired to her cabinet every evening after dinner with a thoughtful look in her translucent eyes . The solution , when at last she had hit upon it , was amazingly simple . Cateau was annoyed with herself for not having thought of it before . Since she could not meet her lover in Paris , she would meet him away from Paris  --  but not too far away . In this case one league would serve their purpose as well as one hundred . Cateau recalled the vague desire she had felt at La Ferte for a place in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Saint-Germain for days at a time . Saint-Germain was in the country , and a beautiful country at that , with its pure air and miles of green forests and wide , splendid views from the heights over the valley of the Seine . How delicious it would be , in this hot summer weather , to exchange the blistering cobbles of Paris for the streams and leafy solitudes of that convenient retreat ! Altogether , Cateau was charmed with her plan . She spoke about it to Maitre Le Caron as her man of affairs , but to no one else  --  and spent the best part of two scorching July afternoons examining available properties in the neighbourhood of the palace . ( For it appealed to her as piquant to establish herself under the very nose ofp401the monarch who had forbidden her to appear before him . ) When at length she drove back to town , late in the second afternoon , she held in her pocket a sealed parchment document designating Dame Catherine-Henriette d'Angennes de la Louppe , Comtesse d'Olonne , residing in the rue Villedo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel de Rouen , with its outbuildings and three hectares of garden , situated at Saint-Germain-en-Laye , in His Majesty 's province of the Ile de France . ' My dear , ' she wrote to Fervaques that very night , ' come to see me tomorrow as early as possible . I am sure I have found a way out of our troubles .... It seemed , in fact , that she had ; for the Hotel de Rouen , which Cateau and her lover hastened out to view together the very next day , appeared in every respect the refuge of their dreams . It was near the palace , but not too near , at the end of a blind alley running from the main square of the little town to the edge of the forest . It was also small without being poky , standing in grounds which , though much neglected  --  for the place had been vacant for several years  --  were a riot of rosebushes and lilacs and undisciplined mazes of shrubbery .... ' They want pruning , of course , ' said Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I shall engage a good superintendent at once . I 've heard of a man at the Duc de Luynes ' ... ' The house itself , tiny as it was , had distinct possibilities . Its proportionswere good ; it was a hunting pavilion that had been built for one of the minor mistresses of King Francois I , a long low building of buff-coloured stone , with a pair of tourelles rising like pricked-up ears at each end of the angular slate roof to mirror themselves in the miniature moat . Inside , there were two drawing-rooms , one large and one small , both with handsome Renaissance chimney-pieces , and an oval bedroom in one of the towers , whose walls were panelled in yellow and gold . This bedroom Cateau decided at once would be the very place for the carved gilt Chinese couch she had bought some months ago at an auction sale and had been wondering ever since what to do with . . . . ' And there are my Bergamo tapestries , ' said Cateau , narrowing her eyes and wrinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling . ' You remember  --  the set of the Pastor Fido Aunt de Marville left me . My dear , I believethey 'd fit those panels as though they were made for them ! Where did I put my notebook ? ... ' Fervaques sighed happily , and gazed out of the window at the green tangle of bushes that was at present the sole view it afforded . ' It will be our paradise , my beloved , ' he whispered , pressing Cateau 's hand to his lips in a transport of bliss . ' Where none but ourselves may dare enter  --  not even the good Saint-Denis ! '  | What do you mean  --  " not even " ? ' demanded Cateau , dropping her dreamy decorator 's voice . ' I should say , " especially not ! " Of all tactless idiots ! But do n't worry : she 's told me times without number the country does n't agree with her . It seems that grass makes her sneeze her head off ! Is n't it lucky for us ? Now tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should you place a console in this corner ?  --  or do you think a glass cabinet ? ... ' There was nothing Cateau enjoyed more than furnishing a house and , to tell the truth , she needed very little advice from anybody . It had been some time since she had been able to indulge in her passion , for her places in Paris and Caen had long ago reached the ultimatepoint of perfection ; not so much as a snuffbox could have been added without risk of spoiling the whole . She plunged therefore with eagerness into the delights of ordering furniture and materials  --  spent hours at the draper 's and the cabinetmaker 's , made innumerablediagrams on paper of alternative schemes of arrangement , even drew the design herself for a most remarkable bathtub of burnished copper , the outside of which was inlaid with panels of emerald-green velvet shaped like flowers . She was busy all day every day , as she had not been in years . For the first time since she could remember summer was not a bore . How could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled ?  --  nothing to do with dull human beings and their tiresome relationships , but delightfully concrete objects like cornices and over-mantels , window-trims and door-trims , and panellingand paint ? Fervaques shared Cateau 's enthusiasm . He was not permitted to see her in Paris any oftener than before , nor to accompany her on her excursions to the country ; but if he happened to be at SaintGermainwhen his mistress was there , too , it was easy to slip away from the palace to join her at the Hotel de Rouen . From his point of view the only annoyance was the time it took to get the house ready . July was long past ; August , with its pitiless heat , gave place to a flyblown and dusty September . The first leaves were fluttering down from the tall beeches in the garden  --  and still the workmen remained in possession . At length Fervaques began asking when , if ever , they themselves would be able to stay there .... Cateau was soothing but evasive . The floors really needed refinishing  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . There was always some maddeningly reasonable excuse ... . It was October before everything was ready . The days had grown short , the nights frosty ; most of the beech leaves had fallen now , and lay in neat rustling yellow heaps at intersections of the freshly gravelled paths . There was a smell of wood smoke in the garden ,  |p403and  the depths of the forest resounded with the music of hunting horns , in token that Saint Hubert 's Day was drawing near . Cateau had arranged to move while the court was in residence at Versailles , in order to avoid awkward encounters in the square . There were no difficulties of moment to be surmounted at the other end . She had no intimate friends in Paris ; in fact , save for her servants and Maitre Le Caron , Maman was the only person to whom she had confided her intention of living in the country . And Maman , fortunately , proved to be profoundly uninterested . After a first startled gape and a Jesus ! My dear ! Have you gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louppe thought no more of the matter , except to express the pious hope that , if Cateau had more fresh fruit and vegetables than she knew what to do with , she would not forget the Carmelites in the rue Bouloi .... As for Fervaques , he was seldom at home nowadays . He had had for some months his own lodgings in town , and besides was often at Saint-Germain , or Le Mans or one of his other government seats ; so that his mother and brothers no longer counted him a regular member of their household . The Countess 's measures had been taken well in advance of the move . A special staff was engaged for the new house , for she had decided to take none of her servants from the rue Villedo , who were to be left where they were under the temperate dominion of Mademoisellede Saint-Denis . It seemed best to keep the two establishmentsentirely separate ; and , as a matter of fact , the Hotel de Rouen was so small that it could be run with very few people .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our agreeable silvan sanctuary . How delightful ! ' Cateau wrote to her lover on her last night in Paris , as she sat at her desk trying to make up her mind whether three or four scullions would be needed , and if it were possible to do with fewer than the conventional half-dozen valets-de-pied . Only the indispensable Quentine accompanied her mistress on the drive out from the city in the handsome new coach Cateau had bought to inaugurate her career as a country gentlewoman . Quentinewas reflective , but not altogether disapproving . Her wages had been substantially raised , as a reward for her willingness to leave Paris . Privately , she feared that Madame d'Olonne had gone mad . ... Still , one had to admit that Saint-Germain was not the same thing as the real country  --  it was a thousand times better than La Ferte , for instance  --  far more amusing even than Caen . There were markets and shops within walking distance , and the proximity of the court was likely to provide a certain amount of good company . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that madam did not mean to stop there all winter .. . They reached the little town just as dusk was falling , rattled across the broad square in front of the empty palace , down the blind alley leading to the forest , and in a reassuringly short space of time drew up in front of the entrance to the Hotel de Rouen . Stars were beginning to twinkle in the powder-blue autumn sky , but their radiance was eclipsed by the welcoming blaze of candlelight brighteningevery window and streaming in broad beams down the garden path as the front door was flung wide at the carriage 's approach . Fervaques , wearing his uniform as captain of the Queen 's Light Horse Troop , was waiting on the steps to greet the Countess and lead her gallantly over the threshold . This seemed to Quentine a favourable omen for the future . She smiled to herself and nodded her head as she followed her mistress up the shining pathway to the great open door . That night , to celebrate the beginning of their life together , Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round table laid in front of the fire in the smaller of the two drawing-rooms . There were fresh broiled trout from the forest streams , stewed ortolans , and an iced pudding shaped by a mould in the likeness of a snowywhiteswan ; likewise vintage champagne and some very rare rossolis from the cellars of Charles-Emmanuel , Duke of Savoy . A string quartet , hired for the evening from the leader of the King 's private orchestra , played a pastoral symphony in a specially constructed bower of leaves and flowers that concealed the musicians from the eyes of the Countess and her guest . A cold wind had come up after nightfall and howled dismally in the half-bare branches of the trees outside the window . But inside by the fire all was cosy and warm . Cateau wore a most becoming golden dress made especially in honour of the occasion ; she smiled across the table at Fervaques , whose grey-green eyes were dizzy with rapture , and responded to his slightly incoherent toast with a gay little one of her own ( which had done duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no need of recalling that ) . What a luxury it was to be able to sleep together , without fear or constraint , in the carved golden Chinese bed in the tower chamber ! And , next morning , it was equally pleasant to wake side by side , to lie enlaced in each other 's arms while the sun filtered softly through the amber damask curtains surrounding their couch , and birds twittered ... or no : come to think of it , birds did not sing in October : that must be a pump creaking somewhere in the garden .... But there would be birds aplenty in May . . . in May and June , when the roses bloomed ... . Cateau drifted off to sleep again .... After all , why not ? There was nothing pressing to get up for in the country . They breakfasted late , once more by the fire , for the morning was chilly , in spite of the sun . Then Cateau made a leisurely toilet , while Fervaques sprawled in an armchair and watched her , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donned a smart leafcolouredserge walking-costume and a pretty plumed bonnet , and as soon as she was ready they set out to explore their kingdom like a pair of excited children . Fervaques was a most satisfactory companion on such an expedition . He thought everything Cateau had done absolutely perfect , and cried out continually in delighted admiration over this and over that , as if he really were unable to believe anyone could be so clever . After exhausting the possibilities of the house there was still the garden . Here Cateau moved about briskly amongst piles of yellow leaves , pointing out the spot she had chosen for the sundial , the allee she intended to line with the Roman marbles that were expectednext week . There would be a fountain here , a trellis there  --  and what did Fervaques think of placing an aviary in the sheltered corner on the south side of the kitchen-garden wall ? Aviaries , Cateau opined , were becoming quite fashionable , since Madame de Montespan had had one constructed at Trianon . The young man assented readily to his mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she marshalled her projects for immediate execution . With Cateau nothing was left to chance . She selected her spring bulbs and sketched out the herbaceous borders in a concentrated quarter of an hour , besides delivering to one of the under-gardeners a pithy lecture on the best way to prune rosebushes that greatly impressed Fervaques . He was so happy this morning that everything pleased him . He would perhaps have preferred a little less planning on their first day together ; but then , it was Cateau 's own place ; it was natural that she should wish to arrange it to suit her excellent and very definite taste . And presently , when all was settled , she led the way through a secret gate in the wall into the forest , where they strolled for an hour under the **25;7963;TOOLONG trees . They returned to the house with formidable appetites for midday dinner . Cateau 's face was flushed a beautiful pink that could never have come out of a box ; they glanced at each other over the bones of the roast fowl it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , really , what they had both always wanted more than anything else  --  although , strangely , they had not known it before  --  was to live their whole lives in the country . This ideal existence continued for a week . The weather was unusuallypleasant , sunny and mild , with just enough mist to lend a note of heartbreaking beauty to the distant views from the terrace overlooking the valley . And the lovers were always together from dawn to dusk , except on the mornings when Fervaques went huntingon horseback . Cateau had never cared much for riding ; she had given it up years ago . However , she drove to meet him in the forest with a picnic lunch ; they would then come back in the pony-cart , while Fervaques ' groom rode his master 's mount home by another road . In the evenings they played chess by the fire , or Fervaques sat and smoked while Cateau strummed the clavichord and tried the airs from Cambert 's new opera Pomona . Her voice was still fresh and sweet , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never the wiser . Then , one morning , they woke to find the square at the end of the blind alley astir with new life . Hundreds of horses  --  black , white , and brown  --  were clattering over the cobbles ; carriages of all sorts dashed importantly hither and thither ; postilions halloa 'd , whips cracked , harness jingled , dogs barked  --  and old people and children were got to the windows of houses in the town to watch the procession . It sounded like the victorious advance of an invading army  --  but it was only His Most Christian Majesty Louis XIV returning from a sojourn at Versailles to pass the winter in his castle at SaintGermain-en-Laye . That , of course , was the end of their idyll . Fervaques had no actual charge at court , but in his double capacity of cavalry captain and governor of one of the royal provinces it was expedient  --  this Cateau herself was the first to point out to her lover  --  for him to be seen as often as possible . Not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also for that of his family in general . Gallardon , his eldest brother , was supposed to be on the verge of securing the coveted post of first equerry of the Petty Stable , and was therefore surrounded , at this vital juncture , by a phalanx of interested relatives  --  all available Bonnelles and La Mothe-Houdancourts and their allies by marriage . There were numerous opportunities of attracting one 's sovereign'snotice . One could attend the King 's lever and coucher , his Mass and his hunt ; and besides these daily fixtures plays were given twice a week in the palace theatre , followed by cards and refreshments , and midnight feasts every fast-day . Moreover , parties of a spectacular nature were in prospect , to celebrate the approaching marriage of Monsieur , the King 's brother , to Princess ElisabethCharlotte , daughter of the Elector Palatine of Germany ; and it was generally understood that those who paid their court assiduously now would be included in the lists of guests for the later festivities . ( Who would have thought that Monsieur would marry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago ! Yet ElisabethCharlottewas a replacement for his first wife , the English Madame Henriette , who had died very suddenly the previous summer . ) Cateau told herself reasonably that she would not have cared to appear at the palace even if she had been especially invited : she had long ago outlived her enjoyment , which had never been whole/hearted , of the prosy routine of court life . No , there was nothing in it for her , though for Fervaques , it was easy to see , there was everything . She was only too glad he was willing to go without her . At the same time it was undeniably irritating to reflect that his cousins , Doudou de Ventadour and that chit of a Toucy , were there , where she could not follow him . Also , his frequent absences brought her a new problem , of filling the void in her days  --  and this was much harder to do in Saint-Germain than in Paris . She slept a great deal , which was good for her health , and walked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hours every day when one could neither sleep nor exercise . Cateau had never liked reading , in spite of her strenuous efforts to be literary in the days of her affair with the Comte de Guiche . Nor did she take pleasure in sewing , nor sing and play , save to an audience . There were , of course , meals to be ordered . It was possible to spend a surprisingamount of time considering food , even if , like Cateau , one were the reverse of greedy . She had long since conquered the aversionto good living engendered by her life with Olonne ; it seemed to her now that things to eat were important , just as clothes and furnitureand houses were important . Accordingly she began to fuss inordinately over her daily menus , hunted up half-forgotten recipes in favourite cookery-books , sent to Paris several times a week for divers out-of-season delicacies . She also worked tirelessly over the grounds , laying myriad schemes for the embellishment of her tiny domain , and consulting with the gardeners until the latter were reduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the weeks went on and the weather grew colder , even these pastimes failed to suffice . It was a pity , thought Cateau , that she had no tenants to care for : calling upon farmers and their wives was always one of her most dependable diversions in Normandy . Deprivedof this resource , she took to driving into Paris with Quentine to consult Maitre Le Caron on trifling matters of business , remainingto shop or attend the play , and often not returning till late at night . Fervaques once or twice got home before she did , and when this happened he was terrribly worried by her absence , pacing the floor until the sound of horses ' hoofs on the frozen ground told him that the wanderers were safe . Their personal relations continued as harmonious as ever . Indeed , owing to the enforced separation of their daily lives , their moments together took on a special quality of radiance . Cateau knew  --  and this knowledge sustained her through many tedious hours  --  that Fervaques would always rather have stayed with her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safe in her assurance that he would never find anyone he preferred to herself.  | When he came home from the palace , no matter how late it might be , she sat up in the gold Chinese bed , lighted a candle on the table beside her , and leaned on her elbow , while her lover regaled her as he undressed with a detailed account of what he had seen and heard during the day . Cateau listened with inscrutable eyes in an attitude of marble repose , saying not a word until he had finished speaking . She was not really interested in court politics , for herself .. . . But Fervaques was young , untried , with his name and fortune still to make . It was most desirable for him to produce a pleasing impression , to form contacts for future use with the people who counted .... Had he played hoca tonight at the same table with the Montespan ? Good ! That was as it should be . Cateau had made up her mind that the reigning mistress was all-powerful , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decently polite to poor La Valliere , whose day was done , though she lingered on like a tragic ghost at her rival 's triumph-feast . Monsieur de Pomponne , the new Minister of Foreign Affairs , was by all means to be sought out and propitiated . Then there were Monsieur de Louvois , the Minister of War , and MonsieurColbert , the Minister of Finance ... and she had lately heard ( never mind how ) that the Gramonts were said to be coming back into favour . It might be wise to pay the Marechal a compliment at tomorrow 's lever  --  that wily old Gascon was vain enough to believeanything he was told ... . It seemed to her sometimes , as she proffered these bits of advice to the eager-eyed lad at her side , that Fervaques was more like her son than her lover : he was as truly her creation as though she had borne him herself , for he had been nobody until she took him in hand . Even now , there was a great way for him to go ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home somewhat earlier than usual . Cateau had not yet quenched the candles ; she was sitting up in bed , a white fluffy cape over her shoulders , havingher nails polished by the drowsy Quentine , when she heard her lover 's step approaching with unwonted briskness . A quick glance at his flushed face and sparkling eyes caused her to lift her eyebrows in silent inquiry , which Fervaques answered by a jubilant nod as he flung down his hat and gloves and cast his sword on the bare floor with a clatter . Cateau dismissed Quentine , who departed yawning , and then held out her hand to be kissed . ( Such little formalities could not be insistedupon too often . What the youth at court were coming to ... ! ) It was not until this ceremony had been performed to her satisfaction , and the young man was established in his privileged position at the foot of the bed , that she permitted herself to ask : Well , my dear , what has happened ? '  | ' We 've got it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted for Gallardon ! It 's to be announced tomorrow at the King 's lever . He 's first equerry of the Petty Stable , appointed over the heads of at least four chaps who have been in the service longer than he has . ' ' Good ! ' said Cateau approvingly . ' I 'm delighted to hear it . Who told you ? ' ' Colbert himself . I was standing near him at the card-table after supper  --  we both were , as a matter of fact , for Claude was with me : he came out from Paris late this afternoon in response to a note from Aunt de la Mothe . Well , I noticed Monsieur Colbert looking over towards us from time to time , and smiling and nodding his head as he talked to the Montespan , as if what he was saying to her might concern us . I 'd not have dared press the point , for fear of being mistaken  --  but you know what Claude is ! He 's afraid of no one ! So as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the table , he managed to worm his way next to the lady , kissed her hand , and got into conversation with her and the Minister . Well ! It 's true ! It 's quite settled , just as we hoped it would be , at the price we offered , three hundred and fifty thousand francs  --  and he takes over his duties on the first of the month . ' ' It 's an excellent thing , ' remarked Cateau thoughtfully . ' Not that the post is so much in itself  --  but at least it will give him an official standing at court . And it 'll help the family to get back the position they had in your grandfather 's day , when Bullion was a name to be reckoned with . My dear , I 'm very much pleased that this has turned out as it has . Pray give Gallardon my best compliments ; I shall write him a letter tomorrow . Yes , ' added Gateau , ' and one to your mother , too . It 's only proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Fervaques , after a slight hesitation , ' I wonder .. . There 's something I 've been wanting to ask you for weeks . I 've only been waiting till this business was out of the way . Might I  --  I mean , would you mind very much if I asked Gallardon to dinner ? ' ' Here ? In this house ? ' Cateau looked surprised and somewhat indignant ; Fervaques felt a sudden stiffening in her pose . But he went on hurriedly : ' Yes ; why not ? It 's our home , you know . I think it would be only the friendly thing to do , do n't you ? ' Cateau was silent for a moment . Then she said : ' It is your right , of course , to have whom you please  --  Gallardon , or any of the rest of your family and friends . But not while I 'm with you . If you care to ask him here in my absence , I 've no objection . I can always spend the night in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the point  --  that 's not what I meant at all . I meant to have him dine with us both . You know I did . Are you ashamed to let him see we 're living together ? '  |p410Cateau  sighed : it was the old question , which she hoped she had succeeded in settling for good . ' You know that I 'm not , ' she said , ' but you must try to consider my position a little . Have you forgotten our bargain ? I came here to live on one condition  --  that we were to keep this life of ours a strict secret , apart from everything else . That was the understandingfrom the very beginning . I 've come and gone as I pleased , and allowed you to do the same . I thought you approved of the arrangement . Forgive me if I was mistaken . ' ' Mistaken ? Oh , no ! ' Fervaques exclaimed quickly . ' You ca n't think that . You know  --  you must know  --  how happy I 've been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect your good name with all that lies in my power . I have n't told anyone what we 've done . Not a soul at court has the slightest idea .... Only Claude , my own brother , who 's closer to me than anybody else in the world except you ... I 'd so much like to share my good fortune with him  --  show him how snugly we 're settled , you and I , darling ! You could trust him to the limit ; our secret would be quite safe with him . ' Cateau shook her head . ' That 's what you think . No doubt Gallardon would think so , too . But a secret shared is a secret no longer . It 's a miracle that we 've been able to keep ours as long as we have . Every day I 've been expecting it to leak out . I 've been racking my brain to try to decide what I 'd do when it did . For we ca n't continue this way indefinitely  --  you must see that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't risk anything that might compromise us . I 'm sorry , my dear . I like your brother , as you know . I 'd be delighted to receivehim in Paris , any day you care to bring him to call . But here !  --  oh , no , you 're not serious ! Or if you are , it 's because you do n't realize what you 're asking . ' Here Cateau turned her head away slightly , as if to indicate that , in her opinion , the conversation was finished . Fervaques said nothing more for a moment ; she supposed he had accepted her decision as final  --  as , indeed , he always had done , up to now . She was therefore surprised , and not a little displeased , when he burst forth afresh : ' But why ? Why ? I ca n't see why you need be so sensitive . It 's not as if I were proposing that you should receive my mother or Aunt de la Mothe , or even one of my cousins . Claude is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knows what the world is , what men and women are . I 'm sure he must have guessed months ago that I was in love with you . ' ' You must have told him , then , ' said Cateau pettishly . ' You 've no more discretion than a baby ! ' ' Certainly I did not ! But he 's eyes in his head , has n't he ? ' ' I wish , my dear , I could say as much of you . If you were n't blindp411to everything but your own interests , you 'd never suggest'I ca n't see what harm there 'd be in it . It 's the first thing I 've asked you to do . If you refuse , what can I think except what I 've always feared ?  --  that you 're ashamed of me and my love !  --  we 're not good enough for you ! ' ' Ah , I wo n't bear it ! ' cried Cateau , striving to avoid her lover 's reproachful eyes . ' I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to hear what you say . There 's no use in trying to argue with you , my dear . ' ' No , my dear , I assure you there 's not . For you 'll never be able to convince me I 'm wrong . ' ' I 'm well aware of that . I sha n't even try . Why waste one 's breath scolding a child ? ' ' Precisely . Why waste it ? I 'm sorry I ever mentioned the subject . But do n't worry , madam , I 'll not do so again . ' ' I hope not , sir , with all my heart . For if you should , you 'd find my mind as firmly made up as ever . ' ' I 'm glad to hear it , madam . ' ' I 'm glad that you 're glad , sir . ' ' Then we 've no further cause for disagreement , I take it ? ' ' None whatever . ' ' And can go to sleep in peace . ' ' The sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed and stamped into the dressing-room to take off his clothes . He was biting his lips to keep from bursting into tears . While he was gone Cateau extinguishedthe candle and lay back on her pillows . The light of the hunter 's moon , filtering through the bare branches of the beech trees outside the window , traced faint mysterious patterns on the wall . Presently Fervaques came back in his nightshirt . He slipped into bed beside her , and after a minute touched her shoulder softly , and attempted to put his arm round her . Cateau repulsed him without rancour , but determinedly . How strange men were ! she thought . Women were never so fatuous . They might on occasion demand endearments out of season , but they were not simple enough to suppose that a quarrel might be set right by a kiss . ' I shall forgive him , of course , ' said Cateau to herself , as she was falling asleep . ' But not for two or three days  --  perhaps even as long as a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that before their relations were finally readjusted on the old trustful basis . And it took more than time to improve them . Fervaques left for Le Mans the following morning , on a business errand to do with raising new taxes for the war against Holland . When he returned , a fortnight later , he stopped first in Paris to spend a few days with his family . He wrote to Cateau to tell her so , and to say he hoped to rejoin her shortly at the Hotel de Rouen . She received a second note from him , a day or two later , from which she learned that he was remaining in town longer than he had originally intended , owing to his mother 's insistence . Gallardon had caught a feverish cold and was in bed . Doubtless it was nothing to worry about , but Maman , who idolized her first-born , was greatly alarmed , and had begged Fervaques not to desert her . Another week passed before he was able to go back to SaintGermain . When at length he and Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perceptible wall of ice had formed between them . Cateau inquired politely after Claude 's health . Fervaques replied , with equal politeness , that his brother was very much better , thank you  --  in fact , quite out of danger , though the doctors had ordered him not to quit his bed till the end of the week , merely as a general precaution . Affairs went on in this state for a number of days : then , one afternoon , a frightened , sweating lackey in the Bullion livery stumbled into the palace , where Fervaques was attending a concert , to say that the young Marquis de Gallardon was dead . It had been totally unexpected . . . a sudden chill and rise of temperature , followed by heart-failure .... Madame de Bonnelle was herself in the doctor 's care , and bade her son and her sister , Madame de la Mothe-Houdancourt , come with all possible dispatch if they wished to find her alive . Fervaques was weeping when he told Cateau what had happened . He buried his face , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grief . Cateau comforted the stricken young man as best she knew how , stroked his hair and hands gently , said : There , there , my darling ! ' many times over . She was loath to leave him while he seemed to need her so much , and therefore decided to drive into Paris with her lover to spend the night in the rue Villedo . Braving discovery for the first time , she waited up in her bedroom for his return from the house of mourning  --  and that night they slept in each other 's arms , as they had not done for many weeks . But hours after Fervaques , worn out by his emotions , had dropped off to sleep , Cateau lay wakeful , brooding over the catastrophe that had befallen her . Their first quarrel was over ; perhaps in some ways it had left them closer to each other than before . Still , she reflected gloomily , something divided them now , and would continue to do so forever . Fervaques might not wish to think it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep from believing , as long as he lived , that his brother 's death was partly her fault  --  that poor Gallardon might not have died if only Cateau had been willing to ask him to dinner. pDURING ALL THESE MONTHS CATEAU HAD NO NEWS OF HER SISTER . She knew Magdelon was still in the country , and intended to stay there until after her lying-in . It was therefore not surprising to read in the Gazette , early in November , that La Ferte had come back to Paris without his wife . Fervaques , whose family 's house was across the street from Great Senneterre , heard from his mother , and duly reported to Cateau , that the Marechal was accompanied by young Henri . The lad had at last secured his father 's permission to join the army as a volunteer . Although he was not yet quite fifteen , there was talk of fitting out an infantry regiment for him to command in the war against Holland . Cateau could imagine how excited he must be at the prospect . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , if possible , how things were going with Magdelon ; but the situation was delicate . She was not on good terms with her brotherin-law ; moreover , she had private reasons just then for remaining out of sight . Hence , it seemed best for the present to let matters take their own course , trusting that if anything were seriously amiss , she would be apprised of it . Then suddenly , about a week after the Marechal 's return , Fervaquestold her that Magdelon , too , was in Paris . There had been no official announcement of her arrival ; but Madame de Bonnelle , who now that she was again plunged into mourning spent most of her time spying upon her neighbours , declared that the windows of the state apartments at Great Senneterre , boarded up since June , had been opened . Besides , her cook had caught a glimpse of the Marechale'sfour little maids playing Blind Man 's Buff in the garden . So there could really be no mistake about it ... . Cateau , greatly mystified , drove into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel de la Ferte-Senneterre appeared as it always did when its owners were in residence . Windows and doors had obviously been freshly painted , and flowers were blooming in jars on the balcony over the porte-cochere . The Swiss who admitted Madame d'Olonne said , in reply to her eager question , that Madame the Marechale had arrived from the country two days ago ; he believed she was not receiving this morning  --  but naturally the Countess might be shown up directly.  | On her way to Magdelon 's rooms Cateau was struck , as never before , by the gloomy atmosphere of the house , which neither its noble proportions nor the lavish expenditures of the Marechal could disguise . It was hard to see just what caused it : Great Senneterre was not especially old , nor in the least eccentric . Built on a regular classical plan , its rooms opened out in orderly rows , entirely lacking odd corners or surprises of any kind . There was perhaps something sinister in its very absence of imagination . All those square gilded halls with nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told herself she was being ridiculous . Of course , no unseen eyes stared at her  --  there were no phantom voices whispering on the vast desertedstaircase .... ' Come , now , ' said Cateau , half aloud , ' you know , this really wo n't do ! ' She rapped smartly on the door of the Marechale 's antechamber ; it was opened by the prettiest of the four maids , who smiled when she saw who it was . Magdelon was alone in her enormous room , lying propped up by pillows in the great canopied bed , under a counterpane of olivegreenvelvet embroidered in gold-thread designs of fruit and flowers . The colour of the counterpane might have been unbecoming , or the morning light streaming in from the high windows overlooking the garden too harsh ; for Cateau thought she had never seen her sister so nearly ugly . Her face was somewhat swollen and pasty  --  an effect only emphasized by the dabs of rouge placed too high on her cheeks  --  and her eyes looked as if she had been crying hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared strangely heavy and lifeless . She smiled , however , as Cateau came in , and motioned to the little maid to leave them . Darling ! ' said Magdelon , quite in her usual voice  --  that was a comfort , anyhow !  --  ' I 'm so glad to see you ! How did you get here so quickly ? I 've let nobody know I was back . ' Cateau bent over to kiss the white cheek , and then seated herself on a tabouret close to the head of the bed . Fervaques told me last night , ' she replied . ' I could hardly believe it , so , as you see , I 've lost no time in coming to find out for myself . But , my dear ! What on earth are you thinking of ? Have you gone clean out of your wits ? Or has an accident happened to change your plans ? Perhaps you 're no longer expecting ... I mean ... ' She paused to glance significantly at her sister 's figure , which was concealed so effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether what one could not help hoping for had actually occurred . But Magdelon shook her head . ' No , dear ; that 's not it . I 've been perfectly well . ' ' Then why ? Really , Magdelon , ' said Cateau impatiently , ' sometimes I wonder if you 've ever properly grown up ! It 's bad enoughp415to be having this baby at all  --  but I certainly thought you had the sense to realize that your one hope lay in keeping out of sight till after you 'd had it . If you 'd stayed in the country , you might possibly have succeeded in saving your face . Here there 'll not be a chance of it . What will La Ferte say when he knows ' Darling , ' said Magdelon , still smiling her stupid smile , ' I 've told you over and over : he knows nothing whatever about it . He 'll only suppose that I 've come back to spend the winter in Paris , just as I always do . If I 'd stopped away any longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . As it is , he 's not even seen me yet . ' ' No  --  but he will , sooner or later . ' ' Not for some time . Not for a very long one , I imagine . The poor man 's been dreadfully ill with gout all summer . He 's not got out of bed for more than three weeks , except to make the trip home from the country . Poor dear fellow ! I only wish -- 'Well , then , if he ca n't come to you , he 'll expect you to go to him . Magdelon , you know ... ' ' Not for some time , ' repeated Magdelon calmly . ' I 've given out that I 've had an attack of quartan fever  --  and you know how carefulyou have to be with that . I did have it once , the winter after Louis was born . It 's really a perfect excuse , because it lasts for ever so long , and between attacks , as I remember , you feel quite well and look absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me as often as I like , and play cards , and amuse myself fairly well  --  as long as I take care not to get out of bed . ' ' And what will your friends think ? ' sternly demanded Cateau . ' They 'll see you , even if your husband does n't  --  and they 'll guess at once what the matter is . ' ' Oh , no , I do n't think so . You yourself were n't sure when you first came in . If I do n't move about , no one can tell . And I promise to be very careful , dear . I had to do what I did . I could n't have borne to stop in the country all by myself another day ! ' ' Well , I suppose it was dull , ' said Cateau , with a pinched smile more intimidating than a frown . ' But at least it was safe  --  or safer , at any rate , than you 'll find yourself here . How long does the game have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six weeks , at the most . Believe me , dear , I can manage it . I 've planned it all out in advance .... La Ferte 's rooms are quite at the other end of the house : if I screamed at the top of my lungs , he 'd never hear me ! Do n't scold me , darling ! I tell you , I had to do it . ' ' But why ? Why ? ' Cateau was so seriously upset that she spoke more crossly than she meant to do . ' To risk all you have just because you were bored ' ' Ah , that 's not it ! You know it 's not ! ' p 416 Magdelon began to cry in her helpless , childish way  --  great round drops gathering on her lashes and rolling down her cheeks effortlessly , without spoiling her looks in the least . ' Longueville is going away . ' ' Away ? Where ? ' To  --  the war in Holland , ' quavered Magdelon . With his uncle Conde . ' ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , silly !  --  and then everybody 'll be going . So what 's there to cry about now ? ' Ah , but it 's different with Longueville ! He 'll never come back . ' ' How foolish ! What makes you say that ? He 's no more likely to be killed than anybody else  --  less likely than most , I should say . They do n't expose Princes of the Blood to mortal danger any oftener than necessary , ' declared Cateau unsympathetically , remembering how much greater the peril would be for Fervaques , riding proudly at the head of his squadron in the Light Horse Troop . ' My child , you 're being absurd . If you were n't in this condition , you 'd see it for yourself . ' ' You do n't understand ! ' cried Magdelon , making no attempt to check her tears . Charles is so rash ; he 'd rush up to a cannon 's mouth , just to show people he was n't afraid ! I feel he 'll be killed  --  I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know ... And if he 's saved , I 'll lose him all the same . His mother 's determined to marry him off ; she 's given him no peace for months , poor boy ! There 's always the Grande Mademoiselle , old as she is , now Lauzun is out of the way  --  or the Montespan 's niece , that Vivonne girl with her horrid thick ankles ! And  --  and dozens of others , besides ! He 'll have to do what he 's told . You know , the King 's never done a thing for him  --  and the estate 's been in debt ever since the old Duke died . Oh ! Oh ! We were so happy  --  and now it 's all over ! ' Magdelon sobbed harder than ever and beat her clenched hands despairingly on the counterpane .... Cateau glanced at her sister meditatively , and then looked away : she knew , from long experience , that there was no use in saying anything until the squall had passed . She sat perfectly still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bed and out of the ivy-draped window . The ivy was full of sparrows : even from the other side of the glass their cheerful cheeping sounded louder than Magdelon 's sobs ... . One could not help being sorry for Magdelon . Poor foolish child ! She believed , as she had at eighteen , that love ought to last forever ; she could not see at all what Cateau saw clearly , that the most romanticaffairs ran their courses most quickly . Of course , if Longuevillewere to be killed ... But he would not be killed . Princes never were . That was simply more of Magdelon 's hysterical nonsense , for which her condition of health must be held accountable . As for mar/tinge , it was another matter . There was no doubt that the Duc de Longueville was an astute young man , quite aware of his unique position as the sole adult single Prince of the Blood at the court of Louis XIV . He would certainly marry as well as possible . Cateau thought that the sooner he did so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the liaison must be nearly at an end . Everything would conspire to spoil it : Longueville 's station in life , Magdelon 's volatile , imprudent temperament  --  but , most of all , the tragic disparityin their ages . No woman of thirty-six , however charming , could hope to keep a lover fourteen years her junior . The wonder was , really , that he had been faithful as long as he had . ( And as to that , subterranean rumours had already reached Cateau concerning various other flames of the Duke . There were the Duchesse de Brissacand the Marechale de Castelnau , who were said to have come to blows over his favours ... to say nothing of Ninon de Lenclos , and that poor , silly little Madame de Coeuvres , who had been exiled last summer just in time to prevent fatal exposures .... ) Yes , Magdelon was lucky , whether she knew it or not . Longueville would leave her before satiety had set in  --  and , in after years , they could remember their ancient attachment with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child-to-be-born ! ... Cateau shudderedas she drew her cloak more closely about her .... There was nothing one could do except pray that the shameful secret might remaina secret , and that the Duke 's plan to provide for his illegitimateheir might go through without a hitch . Only a hare-brained dreamer like Magdelon could have been willing to repose her present safety , as well as all hope for the future , in the keeping of a houseful of servants , a word from whom , at any moment , might bring her to irrevocable ruin . But what was the good in thinking of it any more ? ... Cateau shuddered again , and then patted Magdelon , whose sobs were trailingoff now into a series of half-strangled hiccoughs .... Yes , she was quieting down at last . To assist in calming her , and also to diverther own thoughts from the dismal channels they had been following , Cateau began telling her sister about the Hotel de Rouen . She talked on for some minutes , describing the charm of the little place and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... You must come out to visit me there , dear , as soon as you 're well again  --  but mind , now ! Not a word of this to anyone , not even to Longueville ' ... and by the time she had risen to go Magdelonwas almost herself once more . The latter was even able to fetch a watery smile as she kissed Cateau good-bye and said : Darling , do come again  --  you 've done me so much good ! ' Cateau promised that she would , very soon  --  and her last memory of Magdelon 's face was the tail-end of the smile bravely displayedon the pale , altered features.  | She stole out of the room on tiptoe , as if it were important not to let anyone know what she was doing ( why was this ? ) ; and then retracedher steps through the succession of antechambers and echoing corridors to the head of the grand staircase . Once again , the thought of those rows upon rows of empty gilded rooms depressed her  --  even more , the picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in their widely separated apartments , each alone and a prey to what melancholy fancies God only knew as the weary days passed .... Cateau all but ran down the marble steps , passing her startled attendant lackey halfway in her flight , and emerged into the open air with a sigh of relief . Dearly as she loved Magdelon , she feared it would be a long time before she plucked up courage to call at Great Senneterre again . Her reluctance to see the La Fertes was abetted by the weather , which turned cold and wet in December and remained so for weeks . It had been years since Cateau had spent a winter in the country . She had forgotten how disagreeable it could be . The sun shone no more , and there was nothing in the chill opaque mists enfolding the forest and the little town on its border to compensate for its absence . The highroad to Paris was soon waist-deep in half-frozen slime , so that even if Cateau had wished to see her sister , it would not have been easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household at Great Senneterre . The Gazette informed her that the Marechal was still confined to his bed by the gout , and two or three brief notes from Magdelon mentionedthe fact that their writer had not yet got over her tiresome fever . ' ... It was a strange situation . Cateau sometimes wondered how her sister had the heart to go on playing her part in the bizarre drama , and , even oftener , how , with all the determination in life , she could hope to deceive her whole world so successfully . In the old days it would have been utterly impossible . But times were so changed .... Paris seemed to be more than half empty even at the height of the season ; for everyone who could afford it was at SaintGermainfor the fetes succeeding the wedding of Monsieur and the German princess . And , as far as Cateau could discover , those who were left behind in the capital paid little court to the La Fertes . Neither husband nor wife was the kind of person who was called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things now . He was no longer active in the army , and his governorship of Lorraine , once so important , had dwindled since the reconstructionof the duchy as a semi-independent state , some ten years ago , into a nominal control over Metz and Verdun and one or two other key cities in the east . If people were not forced to seek him on business , they not unnaturally preferred to leave the windy , disputatiousold man alone.  |p419As  for the Marechale , she had for years been too exclusively occupied with her babies and her lovers to have built up the phalanx of female sycophants that , as a rule , surrounded ladies of her rank . According to Maman , who went to call on her younger daughter several times without being admitted  --  and afterwards wrote the elder an indignant letter on the subject  --  Magdelon slept all day and played cards most of the night with her pages and waitingmaids .... ' I ca n't imagine what she 's thinking of , dear , ' wrote Madame de la Louppe , who had evidently quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her pre-Carmelite period . .. . Hence , for one reason or another , the couple appeared abandoned to a sort of splendid twilight isolation , which , dull as it was , Cateau judged to be of inestimable value to her sister 's scheme . However , in the dark days before Christmas , knowing that the baby must be expected at any minute , Cateau could bear the persistentdearth of bulletins no longer and therefore decided to spend the holiday season in Paris . She could not explain to Fervaques her true reason for the move , but luckily it was not necessary to do so . The state of the weather made driving in and out of the city impossible ; yet , at Christmastide , one could scarcely avoid it . There were special Masses daily in all the churches  --  Father Bourdaloue was , as usual , preaching ' divinely ' at Saint Paul 's  --  and Cateau had attended these services , as a matter of course , for so many years that it would have seemed odd to omit them from her schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busier than ever at the palace , going to innumerable parties to which she had not been invited ; so that he would hardly have time to miss her . On Christmas Eve Madame d'Olonne emerged from Midnight Mass at the Minims of the Place Royale to find it snowing heavily . Her eyes not yet accustomed to the darkness after the blaze of wax candles within , she paused on the steps of the church , Quentine and Lucie behind her , waiting for her carriage to enter the rue des Minimesfrom the angle of the rue du Parc Royal . As she stood there , holding tight to her veil  --  for the wind was as sharp as the night was dark  --  the crowd pushed past her into the street , bells tolled all over the city , and snowflakes swirled down in millions from a low prune-brown sky . ' Good evening , madam , ' murmured a voice at her elbow . ' I have news for you . ' Cateau wheeled round to find a man in a short fur-trimmed black cloak standing beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the open church door , but as he doffed his hat and bowed before her a beam fell full across his face , and she recognized the somewhat snub features and dark , heavy-lidded eyes of Gilette 's son , the young Comte de Fiesque .   Her heart gave a painful thump of alarm  --  for was not Fiesque Longueville 's most intimate friend ? and , therefore , what he had to tell her must concern .. . She could not speak at once ; but Fiesque , observing her anxiety , said quickly : Madam , your sister was brought to bed of a fine boy at six this evening . ' Cateau started . It was still hard for her to find words , but at length she managed to stammer out : And  --  and the Marechale ? ' The Count smiled reassuringly : he was , Cateau thought ( she had not known him very well before ) , a most self-possessed young man . He took her hand without waiting to ask her permission , and guided her skilfully to a point just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps now ; everybody had come out of church . All is well with Madame de la Ferte , ' he replied . I saw her myself , not half an hour after the child was born . Clement told me he was perfectly satisfied with her condition . ' Was the Duke there ? ' ' No , ' said Fiesque . He wanted to be , of course  --  but both the Marechale and I agreed that it would be wiser for him to stay away . No one was in the room when the birth took place except Clement , the accoucheur , and his assistant , old Madame Robinet . Your sister , madam , is a woman in a thousand . What courage ! What devotion ! Not a cry escaped her in the midst of her suffering  --  and as soon as possible , after her child was pronounced safely delivered , she sent word to me to come to her . ( I was waiting in the antechamber with her maids . ) We wrapped the little boy warmly in blankets and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house you have heard of , in the Faubourg , where Monsieur de Longueville was waiting , in his turn , with Porlier and the wet-nurse , to greet his son . All has passed off precisely as we hoped  --  the Marechal heard nothing , suspectednothing  --  and within an hour after the baby 's birth there was not a trace in the house of his coming . Madame de la Ferte begged me to find you , as soon as I had returned from the Faubourg , to tell you how matters stood with her . But they said at your house that you were in church : I 've tarried here on the steps for you , celebratingthe Feast of the Nativity in a double sense . Our Dear Lord is born , madam  --  and also an heir to the great name of Longueville ! ' Cateau drew a long breath . ' I 'm thankful it 's over , ' she said . But tell me , are you sure no one suspects ? Is it really a secret ? It would be fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody knows  --  nobody ever will know , save those to whose interest it is to keep their own counsel . Tonight you may sleep in peace : your sister is safe , and your nephew as well . But I must not detain you further . The snow is falling fast , and your carriage is waiting . ' P421As the young man bent over her hand a second time Cateau saw that his face looked white and drawn and that there were deep circles under the heavy-lidded eyes . ' May I not take you home ? ' she asked gently . ' It is late ; you must be very tired . Where do you live ? ' The Count flushed with pleasure . ' I lie tonight in the Faubourg , ' he answered . ' I promised the Marechale she should have news of her child in the morning . It 's a long way from here , madam ; I would not trouble you to drive so far . ' ' The distance is nothing , ' said Cateau . ' And if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . There 's nobody waiting for me , alas ! Come ! The horses are here . ' She clapped her hands to summon Quentine and Lucie , who had been eying them with curiosity from a respectful distance . Fiesque hesitated a moment longer . ' You are very kind , madam . It 's too cold a night to argue . But  --  can your women be trusted ? ' Cateau smiled . ' If they could n't , I 'd have packed them off years ago . ' She slipped on her mask and gave her hand to Fiesque , who helped her into her coach and took his place beside her , after muttering some instructions to the coachman . On their way to the Faubourg both were silent . Fiesque leaned back against the cushions and shut his eyes , apparently spent with fatigue . And Cateau , seeing that her companion had need of rest , lost herself in her own thoughts as they sped through the wintry streets . Paris was gay tonight : candles were lighted in many windows , bells went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be standing in a golden pool , sending out streamers of light over the snow and darkness around it . It was a long time since Cateau had been to the Faubourg SaintGermain . She had lived there , of course , as a girl , and been married there , at Saint-Sulpice ; and both before and after her marriage she had been a welcome guest in all the drawing-rooms of the neighbourhood . What wonderful parties there had been at the Luxembourg  --  the Orleans Palace , they had called it then  --  in the days of Monsieur , the Duc d'Orleans ( Gaston , the present King 's uncle ) and his daughter , Mademoiselle de Montpensier ! Madame de Choisy , too , Cateau 's old friend ( or enemy ? ) , had assembled , night after night , the most amusing and elegant company the town afforded . And there had been delightful receptions at the Little Luxembourg , and the Hotel de Conde .... How long ago all that seemed now ! The Faubourg had changed a great deal . Though it remained outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural as it had been . More and more noble families were building houses and settling there , new streets had been cut , old gardens and landmarks were fast disappearing . Cateau was not even sure she would have been able to find her girlhood home in the rue Ferou , though she would never forget the shabby red-and-gilt rooms , where Maman had received society during the Fronde , nor the tiny rectangular garden with its bosquet and the fountain that spouted a crooked jet of water , in which she had strolled on summer evenings with Magdelon , and flirted with the young Comte d'Olonne .... As for the Luxembourg , it looked much the same , but the gay crowds that had filled it with song and laughterwere dispersed . The old Duke was dead ; Madame de Choisy , also , was gone ; while Mademoiselle de Montpensier , the Grande Mademoiselle , had turned into a prim , acidulous old maid . Oh , how could it be ? How could so few years have wrought so many disastrouschanges ? And what , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the acknowledged belles of the quarter ? .. . Fiesque touched the Countess 's arm . Madam , we are there . ' Cateau peered out through the falling snow at a high stone wall with a small door in it . Behind the wall was a garden full of trees , their branches white with flakes ; behind the garden loomed the peaked roof of the house itself . As Cateau got out of the carriage she caught a glimpse , at the end of the street , of the twin towers of Saint-Sulpice squat against the sombre sky . In response to a knock the door in the wall flew open . Fiesque gave Cateau his arm to conduct her through the gloom of the garden to the house , which was tall and gaunt and , evidently , very ancient . All was dark within save for a light glimmering faintly in the middle window of the first storey . It 's an old place that belonged to the Montmorencys , ' whispered Fiesque . His Highness inherited it from his grandmother , the late Princesse de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door , which was opened by Porlier , the Duke 's secretary , a bent young-old man with a shock of greying hair and an anxious , gummy smile , who held a candle in his hand . Cateau had seen him several times with his master . She could not tell whether or not he had recognized her  --  probablynot , as she was heavily cloaked and was wearing a mask as well . However , it seemed best not to speak unless it were necessary . Porlier appeared to understand his part in the play perfectly . He nodded in silence to Monsieur de Fiesque , and straightway led them through the cold uncarpeted hall and up a flight of winding stairs to the first floor . There were no tapers in the room into which they were ushered ; the light that Cateau had observed from below came from a fire blazingaway on the hearth. tP423A cradle draped in scarlet velvet embroidered in silver stood in the middle of the room , which was richly furnished and hung with tapestries ; and in the cradle a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up out of the shadows , a plump , pleasant-faced young woman in a nurse 's cap . ' All well , Marie ? ' inquired Fiesque . ' All well , sir . He 's been sleeping ever since you left us . ' ' I 've brought a lady to see him , ' said the Count . ' We 'll stop only a minute . You may leave us , nurse . ' ' Very well , sir , ' said the young woman , dropping a curtsy as she went out . Fiesque turned to Porlier . ' You 've told her the child was mine , as I instructed you ? ' ' Yes , sir  --  certainly , sir . She 's no idea whatever of the true state of affairs . ' ' Nor need she have , if you continue to follow His Highness 's orders . The Comtesse d'Olonne would like to look at her nephew , Porlier . ' Cateau fidgetted at the sound of her name ; but of course , Porlier must have heard the whole story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundle of lace . The baby did not wake up . He looked , his aunt thought , not too admiringly , exactly like every other newborn infant : the creased crimson face and slits of eyes were by no means appealing . But she stooped to drop a kiss on the minute wrinkled forehead before handingthe bundle back to Porlier . ' Poor little thing ! ' she said . ' What a strange way to come into the world ! ' ' No stranger than his father 's , madam . If you 'll recall it , the Dowager Madame de Longueville  --  of course , she was n't the Dowagerthen  --  was brought to bed of His Highness in the Hotel de Ville , where she was living at the time as the head of the ParliamentaryParty in the war of the Fronde . He was , so to speak , a rebel from the day of his birth  --  why , the Provost of the city was named as his godfather ! That 's why he was called Charles-Paris d'Orleans . ' ' And the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam  --  Charles for his father , naturally , and Louis for his great-uncle , Monsieur the Prince de Conde . His Lordship has n't made up his mind , though , as yet , whether the boy will appear in public later as the Chevalier d'Orleans or the Chevalier de Longueville . That , I surmise , will be for his mother to decide .... Eh ! Look , now , he 's waking up ! ' The baby stirred in its sleep and gave a faint cry . ' Poor little Chevalier ! ' said Cateau . ' May he live to do credit to his name ! ' ' I make no doubt he will , madam . Eh ! He 's a fine , lusty chap already ! Only hear what lungs he has ! Mayhap he 'll be a monarch , too , some day , the same as His Highness . Please God , I 'll be alive to see it , madam ! ' ' A monarch ? What do you mean ? ' ' What , madam , have you not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the faintest idea what you 're talking about ! ' ' Why , then , ' said Porlier , moistening his lips and glancing nervouslyat the Comte de Fiesque , ' perhaps I should n't have mentioned it . You tell her , sir , if you will . After all , the whole country is sure to know sooner or later . ' ' I thought that His Highness might have informed you himself , ' said Fiesque smoothly , ' or I 'd have spoken before now . But , as a matter of fact , the Duchess Dowager had word from the Ambassador only last night . Monsieur de Longueville has been elected King of Poland . ' P325CATEAU FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE . SHE RECALLED THAT ONE OFthe Duke 's favourite boasts , last summer at La Ferte , had been of the offer of an all-but-mythical crown to the heir of the Longuevilles . But , at the time , the boast had seemed as mythical as the crown . How could a foreigner , however nobly born ... ? Well , said Fiesque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a century or more its sovereigns had been elected by a Diet assembled in Warsaw , the capital . If the people did not like the king they had chosen , they were at liberty to dismiss him and find another . . . . As the Count expounded the matter , it began to sound less incredible . According to him , the Condes had already an entering wedge through the Duchesse d'Enghien , the old Prince 's daughter-in-law , who was a niece of Marie-Louise de Gonzague , the last Queen of Poland . The childless Marie-Louise had adopted the Duchess as her heir ; and after the death of the former and her husband , King Casimir , the throne had been secretly offered to the Prince de Conde , or , failing him , to his son Enghien . They had both had to decline the honour , owing to Louis XIV 's refusal to allow his cousins to leave France .... This had happened two years ago , since when the Poles had elected a ruler from the ranks of their own nobility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one had supposed the question settled for good . But King Michael Wisniowiecki was young and flabby , in no way suited to the task of defending his realm against the frequent attacks of the barbarous Cossacks and Turks . There was much dissatisfactionamong his subjects ; affairs had come to such a pass that a delegationhad been privately sent to France , urging the King to reconsider his decision and , if he could spare neither Conde nor Enghien , at least to give them the only other available Prince of the Blood , Conde 's sister 's son , the young Duc de Longueville . His Majesty , Fiesque declared , had yielded at length to these entreatiesless out of friendship for Conde than because , with a war in immediate view , it would be wise to make sure of as many friendly nations in Europe as possible . He could count on a French King of Poland , obviously , to swing that country 's sympathies in the right direction . P426So the deal was apparently as good as settled . It was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French haggled busily over sundry bargaining-points . There remained a number of minor difficulties : the principal obstacle , in Longueville 's eyes , being the necessity of wedding the present Queen , who could not , alas ! be dismissed for fear of offending her brother , the Emperor , but would on the contrary be charmed to divorce King Michael ( these little things could always be arranged , if one were in good odour at the Vatican ) in order to marry the Duke . And with such a glorious future unfolding before him , the Count thought it hardly likely that his friend would be deterred by a wife more or less ... . That , Fiesque concluded , was the whole story : Madame d'Olonne might take his solemn oath that every word of it was true . Madame d'Olonne drove home to the rue Villedo with her thoughts in a whirl , so much excited that it was hours before she was able to sleep . Next morning , when she came to reflect more calmly on what had happened , she decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duc de Longueville , without doubt , who for years had striven vainly to get a post at court , and would now , at one stroke , find himself lifted to heights dizzily above the heads of his rivals . For Magdelon , too , even if she were not clever enough to see it directly . Since her lover must eventually leave her , how much better for him to do so at once , at the flood tide of their feeling for each other ! How much less humiliating , also , to have him depart to a distant land than to marry some wealthy French princess , as he otherwise must , and remain in Paris for the rest of his days ! This way  --  though the wrench would be violent  --  he would be removed completely , not only from her life , but from his own as well , disappearingin a golden apotheosis that would reflect glory on his former associates . ( It would be delicious  --  Magdelon ought , even now , to appreciate this  --  to be able to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . ) But , above all , it would be best for the child , for little CharlesLouis , lying unaware of the splendours in store for him in his scarletdrapedcradle in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . Charles-Louis would still be a bastard , it was true  --  but a royal bastard , which almost removed the stigma attached to the state . In years to come , when he was grown , he might seek his father and be acknowledged openly  --  nay , more , even Magdelon ( who , it was to be hoped , would by that time be safely a widow ) might without blushing avow the relationship . To give a child to a reigning sovereign was somehow not sinning . ( Look at La Valliere and the Montespan ! ) Magdelon could be proud , then , of what she had done . Who could tell what illustriousrole might be hers to play in the cloudy , uncharted future ? .. . P427Yes  --  yes  --  taking everything into consideration , Cateau was very much pleased at the surprising turn in events . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone , as the King wished to keep the negotiations under cover until he deemed the time had come to reveal their result . It was especially necessary , too , to avoid rousing her sister 's suspicions . Magdelon had not yet been told of Longueville 's good fortune . The poor thing had , after all , been subjected to a great strain ; Clement was afraid that , in her condition , the one aspect of the Polish affair to strike her would be the imminence of her parting with her lover . Accordingly Cateau was careful , when she went to see Magdelon on Christmas afternoon , not to say anything that might provoke the slightest misgiving . This was not difficult , for Magdelon , exhausted by her ordeal , looked so pale and pathetic as she lay on her pillows that Cateau scarcely spoke to her at all  --  merely contented herself with a kiss and a few loving words . However , when the caller returned the following day , the patient was a good deal stronger ; and though her mortal pallor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a normal interest in life once more . She still seemed to have no inkling of what had happened to Longueville . They talked instead of Charles-Louis , whom Cateau had been to see several times since the snowy Christmas Eve when he was born . She was made to describe in detail what he looked like , how he was dressed and had acted , what she thought of Porlier and the nurse .... ( Were they really kind to him ? ) Magdelon 's face grew wistful as she listened to Cateau 's circumstantial accounts of all she had heard and observed at the house in the Faubourg . Charles-Louis was the first of her children she had not nursed ; it seemed terrible to her that he should have been torn from her bosom in the very hour of his birth ; but even Magdelon had wit enough to see it had had to be so . She was full of gratitude to the Comte de Fiesque for the devotion he had shown her and Longueville in their hour of trial ; she dwelled often , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I told you , did n't I , dear ? I 'd not disappoint him ! Ah , I knew it  --  I knew it ! Charles says now that he 's nothing left to wish for . ' ' Does he , indeed ? ' remarked Cateau ironically . ( Poor Magdelon ! ) ' Of course , it 's dreadful we ca n't be together as we 'd like to be , ' Magdelon went on . ' But we 've been careful so long , it would be foolish to risk discovery now that the danger 's so nearly past . In fact , Charles says he believes , for the present , it would be well for him not to call here so often as he used to do . He 's even going to pretend , for a while , to be having an affair with the Duchesse de Brissac  --  just to put people off the scent , you understand . ' ' Oh , I understand , ' said Cateau , still more ironically . ( But irony was wasted on Magdelon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . ' Ah , I 've always told you , dear , Charles thinks of everything ! ' cried Magdelon simply . There never was anyone in the least like Charles . He 's arranging to take Madame de Brissac to the theatre  --  you know , Racine 's new play , Bajazet , is to be given next week at the Bourgogne . We decided that would make an excellent beginning , because everybody 'll be there for the first performance , and they 're sure to notice whom he 's with . If you 've nothing better to do , dear , why do n't you go to it with me ? Bring Fervaques if you like , and I 'll ask Fiesque to complete the party . ' Thank you , ' said Cateau . I 'd like it , of all things .... But do you think you 'll be well enough so soon , child ? ' Oh , I 'll be well . ' Magdelon 's voice was determinedly confident . I 'd not have stopped in bed so long as I have if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , though , yesterday , that I intended to get up on Sunday . I wo n't miss another minute of the winter if I can help it . I mean to enjoy myself now . There 's so little time left . ' The last sentence was spoken in a whisper , more to herself than to Cateau ; the latter wondered , as she went away , whether Magdelon had at last begun to suspect ... . The first performance of Bajazet at the Bourgogne , on the fifth of January , was an event of importance in social as well as theatrical circles . Since the triumph scored by his Andromaque , a few years earlier , Racine was considered the man of the hour ; the King 's marked preference for his pieces stamped the finishing seal on their success ; and nobody now would have dared stay away from them or hint that they were not perfect without running the risk of being dubbed members of the ' old court ' set . People professed themselves overcome by the tragic power of the new , incisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climaxes of the brilliant tirades  --  and it had become the fashion to quote especially striking couplets , as in former days one had quoted Corneille or the sonnets of Voiture . Cateau settled herself in her seat , well to the front of the Marechale'sbox , with a gratifying feeling that everyone who was anyone had managed somehow to squeeze into the Hotel de Bourgogne this afternoon . She smiled blandly as she turned her head slightly to one side , years of practice having taught her the precise angle at which her profile would appear to best advantage from the pit . It was delightful to find herself once more in the shabby old house , where she had spent so many happy hours in the past . She glancedP429with affection at the familiar smoke-browned tapestries on the walls , smelled the well-remembered smell of mingled patchouli and hot candle-grease , listened to the buzz of the assembling audience , the confused din of the hawkers ' cries , as the fruit and sweetmeat vendorspushed their way through the crowd of lackeys and soldiers and bourgeois below , charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it was fun to go to the play ; she had missed it sorely during those dull months in Saint-Germain . And it would be interesting to see what she thought of Monsieur Racine 's Turkish tragedy . ( Privately  --  though she would not for worlds have confessed the weakness  --  Cateau preferred the old plays of Boisrobert and the brothers Corneille , in which the great speeches were punctuated by comfortable intervals of comparative boredom , when one might relax one 's attention to spy out one 's friends . ) The Champmesle , too , was said to be very fine . Cateau wondered if she would like her as well as the Beauchateau and the Desoeillets , who had enchanted her youth . ( Ah , and Jodelet  --  and Floridor !  --  Could the stage really be as good as it used to be ? ) But there was another reason for being excited today : it was the first time Fervaques had appeared in public with Madame d'Olonne since becoming her lover . Cateau could scarcely have summoned the courage to try the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously after taking her place , but soon decided that people were not noticing her particularly  --  perhapsnot even so much as she had a right to expect . ( Had Quentine been clumsy with her mistress 's hair ?  --  or was the new yellow satin a shade too sharp ? ) ... Maybe the true reason was that , for once , Magdelon was too formidable a rival . Magdelon , Cateau admitted generously , was really superb this afternoon , in silver brocade and the Senneterre diamonds . Her figure freed at last from the defacing lines of approaching maternity , she looked slimmer than she had looked in years . ( That was partly , she had confided to her sister , because she had so little milk , this time , which was a dispensation  --  it was almost as if Providence had known that poor small Charles-Louis was to be deprived of his mother 's breast ! ) But in spite of her beauty Magdelon did not seem happy . She talked a great deal , even after the play had begun , and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . ( The young man received her advances with imperturbable grace : nothing seemed to surprise him . But that one could forecast , in Queen Gilette 's son .... ) At the same time her eyes remained restlessand vague . Cateau saw that , whenever their owner felt she was not observed , they sought the box on the other side of the theatre , where Longueville was sitting with Madame de Brissac . Cateau , too , stared at the pair very often in the course of the per- formance . They distracted her attention from Bajazet , which did not interest her so much as she had hoped . The story seemed rather farfetched . There was a deal of talk about the Sultan Amurat , a characterwho obstinately refused to appear ; and the Champmesle had had , up to act three , disappointingly little to do . Nor was she so pretty as Cateau had expected her to be . In fact , she was not pretty at all , being sallow and rather squat , so that the Turkish costumes she wore as Roxane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , and she had a trick of screwing them up into pin-points when she deliveredher lines that struck Cateau as affected . What men could see in a scarecrow like that ... There was no doubt about it , the best of the drama today was in front of the footlights . Poor Magdelon ! Why would she keep looking at someone who would not look at her ? ... The Duc de Longueville held his eyes riveted on the stage as long as the curtain was up , while in the intervalshe was all studied devotion to Madame de Brissac .... It was disheartening to be obliged to own that the Duchess was a very attractive woman . Her features were delicate and by no means imposing , but she had an appealing porcelain fragility and a demurenessof manner that admirably suited her style . Moreover , she knew how to dress . So many Precieuses did not ... . Between the third and fourth acts another man entered the Duke 's box and , after bowing over her hand , took his place behind Madame de Brissac . Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was her old gallant , the Comte de Guiche . She had not beheldhim in years  --  but , of course , nobody had : he had been exiled for court intrigues for almost a decade , during which a young generationhad sprung up that barely remembered the bold young leader of fashion in the fifties and early sixties . Guiche was now  --  how old ? ... Dear me ! Quite thirty-five , computed Cateau , who was even older . He looked his age , too . The sable curls were as thick as ever , but he had grown appallingly thin , and his face had shrunk so much that it was all eyes and nose . Cateau felt sorry for Guiche . It must be hard for him to reappear , shorn of his posts at court and in the army , to start life over again . If reports one heard from reliable sources were true , the King had not really forgiven him yet , but had merely granted him permission to return because Guiche 's father , the Marechal de Gramont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he died to see his eldest son once more . So the Count came back , and old Gramont pulled through , after all  --  which meant that there had been no inheritanceto come into .... Poor fellow ! Cateau , studying her former lover through a critical lorgnette , decided that he was still very handsome in a romantic , theatrical way all his own , though he had lost his aura of careless success , and his smile was now tentative rather than triumphant . P431It was worthy of note that Madame de Brissac , at any rate , seemed very much pleased to see him . Surprisingly , the new arrival received a greater share of her smiles and glances than the little Duke , who was at length reduced to pulling his moustache and oglingthe Champmesle during the latter 's thrilling soliloquy upon jealousy ( when it should have been clear that she had no time to spare for him or for anyone else . The conceit of the man ! ) . Longueville never once left his box till the performance was over . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the last act to present himself to the sisters . Magdelon was too deeply preoccupied by her own emotions to manage more than a flurried general-utility smile . Cateau , however , yielded her hand to the Count with all her old deliberate charm of manner . It was astonishingto find that she felt neither pleasure at seeing him , nor resentment at his treatment of her in the past . His presence produced simply no reaction whatever . They chatted for a few minutes . Cateau inquired politely for the health of the Marechal , and they exchanged opinions on the merits of the play . Had Madame d'Olonne heard Tallard 's remark to the King that Bajazet was as far above the rest of Racine as the rest of Racine was above all of Corneille ? That was perhaps hyperbolic praise , since one knew it could not fail to please His Majesty  --  but surely the Champmesle was very fine ! Guiche thought her unequalledin declamation . The tirade in the act just ended  --  could Desoeillets have touched such sublime heights in that ? .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , close to  --  bowed and took his departure , Cateau settled back in her seat with a sigh and flashed a smile of reassurance over her shoulder at Fervaques . ( What a blessing he was not old enough to recall ! ... ) On the whole , she told herself later , it had been a disturbing afternoon . The next day Cateau and Fervaques went back to Saint-Germain , where they stayed for the rest of the winter . The court was unusually gay just then . It was carnival time ; and the King was anxious to show his new German sister-in-law what that meant in France . Hence there were balls every night at the palace , masquerades , ballets , plays , and hunting parties in endless procession . People were so busy dressing for this and dressing for that , and undressing only to dress again , that , for the time being , even scandal was in partial abeyance . Cateau held her breath , during the first weeks of the new year , expecting to hear any day that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Marechal had repudiated his wife . But , miraculously , not a whisper concerning the La Fertes fluttered the fans of the palace gossips . Monsieur de Longueville , on the other hand , was much in evidence . He continued to dance attendance on the Duchesse de Brissac , and was said to have become a serious rival of the Comte de Guiche for her favours . Cateau met the trio one day as she was walking along the edge of the forest , inspecting the work on the great terrace Le Notre was building for the King . The men saluted her gaily , but Madame de Brissac drew aside her skirts , as if she had come across a slug in the path ; and her malicious smile was more devastating than an outrightcut . ( Insolent hussy ! ) Another morning , she ran into Madame de Richelieu , the recently appointed lady-in-waiting to the Queen ( for Cousin Julie had died at last ) , and her bevy of maids-of-honour . It was droll to observe how the old lady hustled her charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world like a flock of young turkeys . Cateau could hear their breathless exclamations of surprise after the encounter  --  ' My dear , did you see ... ? '  --  and the high , spiteful laugh of their ringleader , her bugbear , Mademoiselle de Toucy . On still a third occasion , it was the Prince de Marsillac whom she came across , in the midst of the wood  --  or , rather , the Duc de la Rochefoucauld , as he was beginning to call himself , his father having resigned the dukedom and the government of the province of Berry to his heir . Cateau had not seen Marsillac in more years even than the Comte de Guiche , though she had heard enough of the former since he had , inexplicably , become the King 's best friend . She would hardly have recognized , in the stout , pompous bewigged courtier , the earnest , round-eyed boy who had loved her so helplessly , so inarticulately , fourteen years ago . He was obviously not going to bow to her , so she pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chin in the air  --  the best means , surely , of coping with an awkward situation ! But she trembled afterwards for hours with mingled rage and fright , and blamed herself bitterly for having laid herself open to such insults . Fervaques , too , was at fault : he should have thought more of her reputation ! Something would have to be done about their way of life , and that speedily . Cateau made up her mind to speak to him seriously at once ... . And then , suddenly , none of these things mattered any more . Cateau 's social snubbings , her discontent with the country , Longueville'spursuit of Madame de Brissac  --  even the ever-present anxietyover Magdelon and little Charles-Louis  --  all faded into **25;7990;TOOLONG in the face of the one grim reality , War . One had known , of course , that it was bound to come sooner or later . And Heaven knew , it was not as if one had n't become inured to wars in the past ! Those four years of the Fronde and the weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , life had been played to an accompaniment of shrilling fife and rolling drum and the tramp-tramp of marching feet . P433But then peace had come with the King 's marriage to the Infanta , ten whole years of peace , scarcely broken by a skirmish or two in Flanders and the slight flurry of the Franche-Comte campaign in ' 68 . France was rich , France was mighty , France had everything it wanted . Gone , too , were the days of internal dissensions . There was no more religious strife , now that Catholic and Protestant were toleratedalike ; and the King had become so powerful since assuming the reins of government in person , after Mazarin 's death , that the very thought of the nobles ' stirring up trouble was impossible . Ah , it was so blessedly easy to grow accustomed to peace ! After the long , cruel strain the whole country seemed to exhale a sigh of relief . Arts and sciences flourished , commerce expanded , peasants tilled their land and raised their crops ; the King was pleasantly and innocuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital the most splendid in Europe , which meant in the world . It appeared as if the millennium had been reached . What had anyone left now to wish for ? .. . But , almost overnight , the picture changed again . There began to be talk of Dutch atrocities '  --  of the unparalleled insolence of the Lowland merchants , of taxes and seizures and unfair commercial practices  --  then of border incidents and the like . It was all rather vague . Cateau had never been able to find out from anybody just what the atrocities were . What was clear was that France had been insulted  --  and naturally France was not going to stand that . She did not have to ; she was too strong and well-armed , and possessed a powerful ally in England , who , it transpired , had promised , over a year ago , to aid in subduing the overbearing United Provinces . The English fleet was said to be invincible .... Dimly one suspected the real reason for all this unrest was that it was smart to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will on others because , if it did not , the others would not realize how great it was . It was part of the duty of a supreme monarch to conquer  --  so conquer he must , no matter whom , no matter on what pretext . Apprehensively Cateau followed the news in the Gazette , and enjoinedFervaques to glean what he could in his daily attendance at court . Many of the items were contradictory . The Queen of Spain had promised to help the Dutch . The Queen would not help the Dutch , but had decided to stay strictly neutral . War was imminent . War was unlikely . War was inevitable . . . . The Dutch Ambassador , Mijnheer Grotius , had sought an interview with the King , in a last desperate attempt to stave off hostilities . Much was expected to resultfrom this . Little was expected . Mijnheer Grotius asserted that negotiations were impossible . The King asserted that negotiations were impossible . Negotiations were already , in fact , in progress ... . So it went , seesawing back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which no particular pronouncement had been made by either side , Fervaques came home one night early in April with the news that war was declared . Once the worst was actually confirmed , Cateau said she had known it from the first . After all , there was the army , two hundred thousandstrong , ready and waiting for the fray : it could not just be told that it would not be needed and tamely sent home . Armies were uselessunless they could fight ; it would have been unthinkable to have spent so much money for nothing . For months , even years , MonsieurLouvois , the Minister of War , had been busy . He had prepared every detail in advance . This was to be a campaign like no other in history . For the first time the troops were to travel with their own supplies , like a nation on the march , no longer dependent on the foragethey could find . There would be flour for everybody , meat and sugar , oil and wine  --  fodder for the horses  --  brave silken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the men . At the same time it was announced that the Queen and her ladies would not accompany the warriors , as they had done in the past on various military expeditions to Flanders . Marie-Therese was pregnant  --  the Montespan , too , for that matter  --  and this was to be no Women 's War , but a serious fight to the finish . Cateau went to Mass the following Sunday , which was Palm Sunday , in the royal chapel at Saint-Germain , to hear Father Bourdalouepray for the victory of French arms over the heretic Hollanders . The King was there with his whole court . Poor dumpy MarieTherese , wearing a black lace mantilla on her frizzy blond curls , wept as she kneeled by her husband 's side . The favourites , Montespanand La Valliere , together as always , were just behind her , prayingardently  --  hands clasped , lips moving , eyes turned up in ecstasy . But Louis was sublimely unconscious of his womenfolk . He bent his head out of courtesy alone  --  was even God to be mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  looking proud and disdainful , as well he might . Doubtless his thoughts were already on the frontier .... A ray of yellow sunlight fell on his head , ennobling his urbane , sensual features , but also , alas ! revealing the pockmarks that pitted forehead and cheeks ... . In spite of her fears , Cateau 's heart swelled with pride as she thought of Fervaques at the head of his Light Horse Troop , leading his men on to triumph .... For of course the French would win . They could not help winning . They were always stronger than anybody else ; and this time they had a bigger , better army than ever before and the inestimable advantage of being led by the two greatest living generals  --  pace La Ferte !  --  the Marechal de Turenne and the Prince de Conde , once more united , as in the days before the Fronde . With such commanders , how could they fail ? The Dutch must bep435all-a-tremble in their beds , these nights , as they beheld the frightful vision of certain doom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rhine , Conde , with the other half , on the other , to combine at last and sweep down in full force on the luckless land and its young , inexperienced leader , Prince William of Orange . Yes , in those first raw , windy spring days , enthusiasm ran high in Paris and Saint-Germain , as the old familiar pageant , so long absent from the streets , began once again unfolding . Flags and flourishes , trumpets and drums , and soldiers , soldiers , everywhere ... . On the twenty-seventh of April the King left for Charleroi . He stole out of the palace early in the morning accompanied only by a dozen picked bodyguards , having taken leave of no one save the Queen and the Dauphin , his son . The Queen , it was said , cried bitterly , and vowed that she would never live through her lying-in , deprivedof her lord 's company . ( PoorMarie-Therese ! What a passion she had for her husband , however unfaithful he might be ! ) On the same day Madame de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle of Genitoy , which belonged to Sanguin , the King 's maitre-d'hotel , where it had been arranged that the lovers were to say their farewells . It was whispered that her confinement , like the Queen 's , would take place in June . After that , everyone seemed to be leaving . Plumes nodded , swords glittered , the roads to the north were filled with horses and coaches and line upon line of marching men . And all the houses in France held their complement of weeping women , brusquely awakenedfrom the dream of picturesque pageantry to a sharp realization that their loved ones were in danger . Cateau repaired to the vantage point of a balcony overlooking the square of Saint-Germain to watch the departure of the Queen 's Light Horse Troop . Fervaques looked very well at the head of his squadronriding his prancing grey horse ; it was a pity only that he did not sit straighter in the saddle . ( He had been a trifle round-shouldered since boyhood , and , lecture as she might , Cateau had not yet succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved his hat , as naively pleased as a child , before saluting the colours and galloping off . Dry-eyed , his mistress saw him go ; she smiled back at him and waved her handkerchief to the last . Unlike Magdelon with her little Duke , Cateau felt convinced that Fervaques would return . But after the soldiers had left the empty square was depressing . And when she went home to the deserted house , so strong a contrast to the cheerful bustle of the last few days ' preparations , it took all her self-control to keep from burstinginto tears . Happily , it would not be necessary to stop there alone . Her arrangements had been made some time earlier to move back to the city as soon as Fervaques had gone : less than an hour later she was in her carriage , jogging along the muddy highroad to Paris . But the rue Villedo was not much better . Her servants received her with blank courtesy , in which she fancied she detected an undercurrent of sarcastic amusement . ( Well , after all , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth between town and country , neither Quentine nor Martin , the coachman , had talked . ) And there was no mistaking the careful complicity of Mademoisellede Saint-Denis ' unconcern with her mistress 's actions . Cateau felt she could not possibly face an evening alone with Mademoiselle de Saint-Denis . She therefore ordered the horses again and drove to Great Senneterre , hoping to find the family suppingat home . The Marechal and his wife were already at table . At first Cateau thought that they must be expecting company , for the dining-saloon was swarming with liveried servants and ablaze with candles , whose flames fluttered in the soft spring breeze blowing in from the garden . But there was no one with them except Henri and Bonneville , the boys ' tutor . Magdelon rose with an exclamation of pleasure to welcome her sister , and insisted on having a place laid for her at once . She was wearing a glittering ballgown and looked thin and sad  --  there were dark circles under her eyes , as if she had been crying  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although evidentlystill badly crippled by gout  --  he could not get up to greet his guest , and one foot , swathed in bandages , remained on a stool throughout the meal  --  he was fully dressed in court costume , wearing his sword and the ribbon of the Order of the Holy Ghost . An immense black wig had been clapped on his head , beneath which his own sparse grey locks straggled out here and there in spite of Robert 's ministrations . ' You see us , my sister , in ceremonial dress , ' he began ; ' that 's in honour of my son . Young Henri here leaves us tomorrow , you know . He 's off to Charleroi to join the King 's regiment as a volunteer . ' ' Yes , aunt ! ' cried Henri ; ' and if I do well , Papa has promised me a regiment of my own in the autumn . What do you think of that ? ' Cateau glanced smilingly at the lad 's glowing face , and then with compassion at Magdelon 's strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scarce fifteen  --  she could imagine how his mother 's heart must grieve at the thought of their separation . Still , he was tall and wellgrown , with good broad shoulders and an air of assurance exceptional for his age . But for his beardless rosy cheeks , he might easily have passed for eighteen or twenty . ' What a lucky boy you are ! ' said Cateau . ' With the name you bear , you 're predestined to success . ' ' Oh , but I think that makes it harder , ' said Magdelon . ' More'sP437expected of a La Ferte than of the average soldier . I fear he may find the path to glory a steep one . ' Nay , Maman , ' protested Henri , only wait and see what I can do ! I 've wagered Brother Louis I 'd swim the Rhine and bring him William of Orange 's beard as a trophy ! ' Magdelon sighed . Child , you 're so rash , you 've no idea what warfare means ! Rememberyou 've promised your father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry , madam , ' boomed La Ferte .

I 'll say that for the old rascal , if he says he 'll do a thing , he 'll do it , come what may ! Ah , God , if only I were well enough to go , too ! I 'd show that handful of upstart Lowlanders what a Frenchmanis worth ! ' ' Oh , Papa , why do n't you come with me ? Perhaps the doctor is wrong ; perhaps what you need is exercise . ' La Ferte groaned . Damme !  --  when I ca n't put my cursed foot to the ground ! I tell you , boy , my days in the field are over . I 'm a worn-out wreck , fit for nothing now save to lie abed lapping up the nauseous brews of that villain Pecquet . Oh , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hellish idleness ! ' Sir , ' said Cateau diplomatically , you 've served nobly in your time . Many a man would be proudZounds , madam ! Do you think I do n't know it ! The past is cold consolation to a man who sees he 's still needed today . Turenne alone has n't enough authority . I suppose you saw in the Gazette this morningthat the rest of the marshals refuse to serve under him  --  Crequy , Bellefonds , Humieres  --  every one of the lot ! What do you think of that ? Rank insubordination ! They say it 's an insult to their office to take orders from a man who 's no higher than they . ' S death ! I 'd insult ' em , I would ! I 'd show ' em who was master , if I had my way ! The King 's been criminally lax with such riffraff . . . . Ah , if I could walk ! If I could walk ! ' The old man buried his face in his hands in discouragement . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who piped up , in his highpitchedyoung voice  --  Cateau had not known before that he had so much tact  --  : Tell us about the time you were wounded at Chimay , Papa , in 164o , and led the charge of your troops with your leg strapped to your saddle-bow ! ' Half an hour later , when a lackey entered to announce the arrival of His Highness the Duc de Longueville , La Ferte was re-enacting the siege of Gravelines  --  Damme , lad ! It took just nineteen days to reduce the garrison , though everyone swore they could hold out all summer ! '  --  while Henri watched his father with fascinated eyes . Cateau regarded his sister and brother-in-law with interest as the Duke swaggered into the room . She was curious to see if a situation ' were in prospect ; but both La Fertes appeared perfectly self-possessed . Magdelon was so wax-white already that she could not have turned paler ; and the Marechal seemed pleased by his caller , seated him straightway at his right hand , and plied him with glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid his friends good-bye . He had finally succeeded in buying the charge of colonel of a cavalry regiment , and was leaving the following day to join Turenne at Charleroi . Whatever the young man might be feeling , he was in complete control of himself this evening . He sat for some time at table over his wine , exchanging military gossip with his host . The size and strength of the various citadels on the Rhine that would have to be captured before the two main divisions of the army could join each other were discussed in detail ; likewise the difficulties of crossing the river into Holland , and the strange defection of the subordinate marshals . Who on earth would be competent to take the deserters ' places ? What did the Duke think of Chamilly ? Surely he was too little experiencedto assume much responsibility ! How about Luxembourg ? Could it be true that Enghien had inherited none of his father 's militarygenius ? And was it not mad to let Louvois , himself no soldier , meddle in the plan of campaign ? Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who thought this side of war far less absorbing than Papa 's accounts of delightfully gory battles , and besides had been plied by his oversolicitousmother with far too many good things to eat , struggled manfully to suppress his yawns . Cateau sat silent and bewildered . Never , she reflected , if she lived to be a hundred , would she be able to understand men 's propensity to keep to impersonal subjects , regardlessof what personal issues might lie between them . It was past midnight when they rose from the table . La Ferte , leaning heavily on his son 's arm , left the room , after bidding his guest a cordial farewell ; but , late as it was , the Duke seemed to have no intention of going home . He proposed instead a stroll in the garden ; and when Cateau would have excused herself , in an amiable effort to leave the lovers alone , he took her hand and insisted on her accompanying them . The garden was dark , in spite of the lanterns set at intervals along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the sort of spring night when one can almost hear things growing . Magdelon 's tulips were in full bloom ; they made chequered patterns of dimly seen colours under the canopy of the elms . Birds chirped sleepily inp439the shrubbery , fountains splashed , the church-bell in the monastery of the Little Fathers chimed once , and then was still . The scent of the orange trees in the tubs on the terrace  --  the biggest orange trees in Paris , La Ferte was never tired of boasting  --  was overpoweringly sweet . Back and forth they paced ; back and forth , three abreast ; Longuevillebetween the two women , whose silken skirts rustled on the gravel as the new leaves overhead sighed in the faint May breeze . Cateau soon discovered why the Duke had wanted her to stay : he had , it appeared , only just broken the news about Poland to Magdelonin a letter , and naturally did not wish to be alone with her when the matter was first broached between them . Magdelon , Cateau thought , behaved very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , Charles must accept his wonderful opportunity . What a chance in a million ! Now at last the King would be forced to acknowledge what his cousin was capable of .... But was it certain that there would be no slip in the proceedings ? Deposing a reigning monarch might prove a perilous task . Longueville , too , was at his charming best tonight . He rather deprecatedthe whole Polish affair , laughed at himself in the role of ruler over a country of wolves and bears and wild horses  --  I swear , madam , they tell me there are more savage beasts in their forests than Christians in my capital city ! Nay , though , if I really do manage to get there , I 'll send you a hundred ermine pelts to make you a robe fit for a queen ! '  --  and took it all so lightly that one might have thought it was merely a jest . Nothing was said about a possible marriage with the Emperor 's sister . There was no mention , either , of little Charles-Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on the other side of the river . Cateau felt they ought to want to talk about Charles-Louis : she made several attempts to disengage herself and return to the house , but Longueville would not let go her hand . At length , tired of walking , they sat down to rest in the grotto that was the Marechal 's latest addition to his garden ornaments . It was a quaint construction of rocks and shells , a copy in miniature of the celebrated Grotto of Thetis at Versailles . The somewhat mouldy interior was embellished by mosaic work in coloured stones and four statues of simpering sea-nymphs ; a small illuminated fountainin the centre possessed a secret spring , which , when set in notion , made a most lifelike , if faintly asthmatic , imitation of whistling thrushes . Here Longueville abruptly called for some music . On a beautiful evening like this ... Besides , were they not celebrating his election as king ? Nothing would do but that Magdelon must sing for them ;   a lackey was dispatched to the house to fetch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought Longueville sat in the middle of the bench by the fountain , still between Cateau and Magdelon . He was laughing a little and nodding his head as he pursed up his lips and tried to whistle in tune with the thrushes . Magdelon was silent in the shadows . Her back was to the light , but when the lackey handed her the lute she turned round in order to tune it , and a ray fell upon her face . Cateau thought that her sister looked like a young girl , with frightened , mysterious eyes . ' I 've not touched it in months , ' said Magdelon , in a small , choked voice . ' I may have forgotten ... What shall I play for you ? ' ' Madam , whatever you like . Psyche 's air  --  something of Cambert 's  --  I care not , so it be your choice . ' Magdelon struck a few rambling chords on the long cumbersome instrument , and then began to sing the words of an old song Cateau had not heard for years : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposesYour charms .... Fickle its way , Changing all life discloses . Beauty lasts but a day ; So , alas ! do the roses . ' Magdelon 's tones were clear and true . They bore little resemblance to her speaking voice , being at once much higher and fuller , a common phenomenon among well-schooled singers . She sang the refrain bravely to the end , with her lover 's smiling eyes upon her ; she even repeated it , in response to his gesture of noiseless applause . Then , suddenly she could not sing any more . Her voice did not break or falter ; but there were no notes left in her throat . She dropped the lute on the floor of the grotto and said , in an agonized whisper : ' Oh , do go ! Go now ! I ca n't bear it any longer ! ' Cateau hastened on ahead , to give her companions a few last moments together ; and when Magdelon caught up with her sister she was alone . ' Longueville 's gone , ' she said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's better so . ' She clutched Cateau 's hand : Cateau saw that she was trembling violently , and on the way back to the house she went on muttering : ' It 's over ! Everything 's over ! I always knew it ! ' On the terrace by the row of orange trees the Marechal met them . He had somehow contrived to hobble that far without Robert 's help and stood at the top of the steps , flanked by two lackeys holding smoking torches aloft , as he peered nearsightedly into the darkness below . P441'Ha , madam ! Is it you ? I thought I heard music in the grotto and was coming to join your revels . I 've packed young Henri off to bed for one last good night 's rest before he starts sleeping on straw . He must be up at dawn , you know , to join his regiment . But what 's this ? Tears ? That will never do ! ' Magdelon , unable to restrain herself , fell sobbing on the steps at her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort her as gently as if she had been a child . ' Nay , I thought you braver than that .... I promise you , the lad will not come to harm . Turenne will watch over him like a father , and Robert , you know , attends him wherever he goes . He has his orders .... ' Magdelon raised a piteous tear-stained face to falter , with quiveringlips : ' Sir , I know how good you are . But he 's so young , my heart misgives me ... ' She could speak no further , but , still weeping , gave La Ferte her arm as the couple passed on into the house.  |p442THE  DUC DE LONGUEVILLE REINED IN HIS HORSE AT THE TOP OF THEhill and sat at ease in the saddle , so that he might take off his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow as he gazed on the river beneath him . It had been a very warm day . Even now , when the sun was setting , round and red , over the edge of the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the air seemed heavy , almost stifling : it was filled with midges that gathered in clouds above the surface of the water and darting swallows in pursuit of the midges . The bank directly below the hill was marshy , overgrown with rushes and tall , thick-stemmed weeds with large lacy white flowers on them . The opposite bank looked much the same , tufted with precisely similar weeds and rushes . But it was really another country : it was the island of Betuwe , a part of Holland . Here , on the right bank , higher and slightly rolling , Longueville was still on the territory of the Elector of Cologne , who was friendly to His Majesty 's troops . That was why the men swarming about the rows of white tents in the camp , and between the camp and the Rhine , looked so comfortableand relaxed . They had had nothing to do all day for the first time since they had started marching north from Charleroi , over a month ago . They must have been glad of that , thought Longueville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy month , on the whole . It had not rained at all  --  rain was what made marching disagreeable  --  and there had been little fighting to do . Everything , so far , had gone according to schedule . After crossing Spanish Flanders the army had moved in leisurely fashion downstream , seizing various forts and fortified cities that belonged to the Dutch as they went . The garrisons of the forts put up a poor show of resistance . Conde took Wesel and Emmerich , on the right of the Rhine , while Turenne and the King were accounting for Buderich and Orsoy , on the left , with ludicrous facility . Scarcely a shot had been fired ; the Lowlandersseemed paralyzed by the sight of that tremendous double army with banners , its guns and sabres gleaming in the hot summer sun . Then  --  still according to schedule  --  Turenne and his troops had crossed the river at Wesel to join Conde at Rees , which also hadP443fallen without a struggle . Now all their forces were encamped on the slopes of the low wooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north of them , the Duc de Luxembourg , who commanded the Swiss and German mercenaries and other allied regiments , faced the Prince of Orange across the Yssel , a tributary of the Rhine . That was the situation on the evening of this torrid tenth of June . The French had got as far as they could get on neutral ground . If they did not cross the Rhine into Holland , there was only the narrowerYssel , on the other side of which Orange and his whole army were waiting for them . The Rhine was less well defended , a mere handful of men and cannon having been placed in the fort of ' I'ollhuis , on the Dutch side  --  but there were no bridges across it and , in spite of the drought , the water ran deep and fierce ; it was four times as wide as the Seine at Paris . Therefore , for the moment , there was nothing to do but wait , while Turenne and Conde made up their minds how to solve the problem . The soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hill slope they sat about in the shade , smoking and drinking and gossipingand staring idly at the pennants that drooped in the breathless air . Some , more industrious , polished their swords and their muskets , the smart new pieces with bayonets attached that were the boast of Monsieur de Louvois , Minister of War . Others combed the dusty woods of scrub-oak and beech in search of game , or wandered down to the river 's brink to hunt for snipe in the reeds or fish in the green swift-moving waters . Occasionally they would meet a party of peasants , on their way to or from the hayfields , whom they tried to converse with in a mixture of French and the bad , guttural Low German of the Rhine provinces . The peasants shook their heads in return and scratched their ears , bewildered by the rapid speech of the foreigners . However , the latter 's lively pantomime needed few verbal additions ; the gold and silver coins , of which the strangers possessed an apparently inexhaustible supply , likewise spoke for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laden with fowls for roasting and flasks of the fine dry white wine of the region . Altogether , it had been a pleasant recess in the strict course of military routine . Only the Duc de Longueville , atop the hill , preening his curls and setting his hat to rights as the sun slid slowly out of sight , looked flushed , preoccupied , and out of humour with the world in general . Longueville was bored . Like everybody else , he had had nothing to do all day , not much more the day before that  --  indeed , little enough during the whole of his month with the army . Of course , P444there was a good reason for this . He was the colonel of a cavalry regiment ; up to now , the cavalry had played second fiddle to the infantry and the artillery , which were naturally more useful in besiegingor storming a citadel . Their chance would come later , after they had actually got into the enemy 's country . But no one could deny it was dull . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wished , Uncle Conde might have made things more interesting for his favourite nephew . Uncle Conde had always treated him with paternal affection , excused his youthful peccadilloes , and straightened them out indulgently , time and again , when Madame de Longueville , from conscientious scruples , would have disciplined her idolized son . Longueville had repaid the elder man with a slavishly fervid brand of hero-worship . Uncle Conde had been splendid about everything : he had settled his debts , more than once ; got rid of importunatemistresses ; persuaded the family , a year ago , to turn over the title and the estate that went with it to Charles-Paris , disregarding the claims of his elder brother , the addle-pated Comte de Dunois . Best of all , he 'd undoubtedly had a great share in promoting the Polish affair . Oh , yes : Longueville had had every right to expect to be made a member of his illustrious relative 's staff , directly the war with Holland had broken out . What a disappointment it was to find that Uncle Conde had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once for Sedan , the rallying-point of his wing of the army , accompaniedonly by his son , the Duc d'Enghien , and the Comte de Guiche . There was a peculiar annoyance , for Longueville , in his uncle 's choice of companions . One understood the necessity for taking Enghien  --  poor Enghien ! who , for all his father 's anxious grooming , would never make a soldier . But it was not easy to forgive Conde 's preference of Guiche to his own nephew  --  Guiche , that romantic dreamer , that ambiguous hero of a thousand alcove dramas , as heedless in war as in love . Longueville had even dared remark on the singularity of Uncle Conde 's selection , only to receive the crushing retort : ' The Count 's an old friend and a damned fine soldier . He 'll be ten times more good to me than anyone else . ' Well , there was no help for it : Longueville had had to submit , and had trailed along with Turenne and the main part of the army , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other young officers of equivalent rank . He had not complained , and he would not complain : he 'd have scorned to betray the depth of his disillusionment . Besides , there was a grain of comfort in Uncle Conde 's last words before departure : ' Remember , my boy , you 'd better play safe this time . You 've too much at stake to take risks now . ' P445That , of course , was perfectly true . Everyone lately had begun to suspect what only a few knew for certain , that the Polish envoys were even now on their way across Germany to seek their new king . Longueville was set apart from his fellows by the grandeur of his destiny . Meanwhile , what was there to do save conceal the bitterness of the pill he 'd been forced to swallow , and hope against hope that somewhere , somehow , he might still win a laurel-wreath in his last campaign as a Frenchman ? Above all , it was useless to show temper towards Uncle Conde . Far from that , the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tent that very night , at which Monsieur the Prince and his son , Monsieur the Duke ( as they were officially styled at court ) , were to be honoured guests . It was almost time for them to arrive . If Longueville wanted to be punctual at his own party , he would have to make haste . Letting Pegasus , his white battle-charger , pick his own way down the hill , he then urged the horse into a smart trot along the spongy path by the water 's edge . As he passed them he flicked with his riding-crop the tops of the tall weeds lining the path , trying to cut off their white flowering heads .... After a little Pegasus turned off the road over the rough hayfields towards a cluster of tents , a kind of hamlet adjoining the city that sheltered His Majesty 's troops . There were ten or twelve of these tents , striped red and white and set in a semicircle , that belonged to the Duke and his numerous household . The open space between them was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mules tethered in rows , and several large wagons bearing the crest of the Longuevilles embossed in gold on their doors . As the young man drew near the camp he halloa 'd impatiently , to give warning of his coming . Swinging down from the heavy silver-studded saddle , he handed the reins to Bourgneuf , the chief equerry , who came hurrying out of the commissary 's tent at the sound of His Highness 's voice . The men and boys stood at attention and saluted their master : there were scores of them  --  coachmen and grooms , postilions and muleteers , lackeys and pages  --  for the Duc de Longueville travelled with a small army of followers . With the exception of the head steward of his estate and , of course , Porlier , who was busy in Paris taking care of little CharlesLouis , his entire personal suite went to war with their lord . Inside his own tent , which was lined with **26;8017;TOOLONG , six valets were waiting to undress him . Longueville flung his hat , gloves , and riding-crop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his legs , while Herve , his favourite valet-ofthe-wardrobe , kneeled solicitously to draw off the ducal boots .... David , the maitre-d'hotel , was sent for , to be interviewed concerning the menu for supper . His Highness was most particular about every detail . Not that Uncle Conde cared a rap what he ate  --  not he ! In fact , the old Prince had been frequently heard to make fun of the luxury Louvois had brought into fashion : he himself slept by preference in a hayloft or in his filthy patched tent smelling of leather and horses . As for meals , rough oaten cakes and a hearty draught of beer were his usual diet , a sensible one since he , too , like La Ferte , was now subject to gout . Nevertheless , Longueville was determined to offer his guests something out of the ordinary tonight . His royal cousin Louis would have provided no less : could he himself lag behind , now that he , also , was to be crowned king ? ... So there were grave and lengthy consultations over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast . The Duke wrinkled his forehead at the choice of the sweet , stamped and swore lustily till poor David trembled and broke into a sweat , after his cringing confession that he had been unable to procure the iced melons his master had ordered .... What was that ? The local fruit was n't ripe yet ? Good God , what difference did it make ? David should have known it would not be  --  he should have had the wit to send to Cologne , if necessary , rather than let the supperpartybe disappointed .... ' Damn it all ! What do I pay you for ? ... ' Longueville felt cruelly abused . There was no doubt of it , he was the worst-served noble in France  --  in France , did he say ? Nay , why not in the world ? With the ease of long practice he launched into an ardent tirade against his household staff , accompanied by a series of well-timed blows and kicks , which his valets dodged as best they were able , considering the exigencies of their duties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close by the entrance of the Comte de Fiesque and the Chevalier de Montchevreuil , the first of the guests to appear . As soon as Longueville spied them he stopped shouting and kicking , quite effortlessly , in the middle of a sentence ; smiled charmingly instead , and gave the newcomers his hand . The two young men smiled back and said : ' Good evening , Your Highness , ' respectfully . The Count , very smart in his dress uniform of aide-de-camp to the King , looked no less aloof and sleepy-eyed in the field than in Paris . What could one campaign more or less matter to him ? .. . The Chevalier , whose family name was Philippe de Mornay , a year or two younger than the other , was a round-faced , rosy youth , handsome  --  like all the Mornays  --  and obviously quite under the spell of his admiration for the little Duke .... Good fellows both , Fiesque and Montchevreuil ! None better in all Turenne 's army , thought Longueville . They had been devoted to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune ! be in a position to reward them . He was resolved that no one should lose who had rendered him service inp447the uncertain days of his youth . He had heard it said , it was even traditional to say , that Bourbons were ungrateful  --  but here , at least , was one Bourbon who knew what gratitude meant ! ... See how easy he was with his friends !  --  the pains he took to treat them precisely as if they were his equals in rank ! That proved he had a good heart , did n't it ? . . . As a matter of fact , it was only subordinateswhom Longueville treated as equals . With his peers he was uncomfortable , unless he were able somehow to assert his superiority  --  which doubtless accounted for his unpopularity with male members of the royal family . Fiesque and Montchevreuil , however , had no intention of presumingon their friendship with the future King of Poland . They stood courteously while Longueville completed his toilet , the Count handing him his shirt , the Chevalier clearly deeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar and cuffs . During these ceremonial operations the Duke laughed and chatted away with cheerful familiarity . How simple it was to get on with a man as long as that man took care to remember the value of their respectivepositions ! This hour at the toilet-table was the pleasantest of the day , the only one in which one could entirely forget the trials and tediums of military life . Longueville prolonged it deliberately , chaffing his friends on their recent conquests amongst the Flemish beauties ; displayingfor their benefit a new shipment of uniforms that had just come from his tailor in Paris , a gold-headed cane the Abbe de Choisy had given him as a souvenir of the siege of Orsoy . . . . The Chevalier , greatly daring , stammered a blushing reference to the latter 's possiblesignificance as a sceptre , which his idol received with smiling complacency . Before any of the three young men had the slightest idea how late it was getting , the sound of horses ' hoofs in the clearing outside betokenedthe arrival of the rest of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in attendancethis evening ; but the six valets lined up , three in a row , on each side of the entrance , nervously conscious of their master 's criticaleye upon them . One of the lackeys hastily lighted the candles in the portable carved wooden chandelier that swung from the centre of the roof over the supper-table , and placed two black leather chairs with arms ( denoting the rank of Prince of the Blood ) to right and left of His Highness 's own seat . Fiesque and Montchevreuil fell back to a deferential distance , while the Duke , clad now in fresh linen and laces , his curls brushed and shining , the blue ribbon of the Order of the Holy Ghost slanting across his white-and-gold bosom , advanced the prescribed three steps to the door of the tent to greet his uncle and cousin .   The Prince de Conde stood for a moment , staring about him , beforestalking in with stiff , rheumatic steps . He was wearing a worn leather jerkin and a pair of old boots that had certainly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adorned by a moulting cock 's feather and pulled carelessly over one eye , gave him somethingthe look of a brigand . This look was heightened by the general disorder of his person  --  the greasy , matted hair ; the straggling beard grey with tobacco rather than age ; his face even , alas ! not overclean . ( The Condos were proverbially a slovenly race . ) But when he doffed his hat to salute his nephew the huge beaked nose and the bright untamed valour in his greenish eyes ( much the colour of the Rhine water ) reminded one irresistibly of an eagle  --  a dirty , shabby old eagle , it was true , but still dauntless and unbeaten . His voice , too , sounded full of vigour  --  deep and brazenly male  --  as he clapped the foppish Duke on the back and cried out : And how 's our young sovereign this evening ? Eh , lad , I see you 're rehearsingthe Polish ceremony already ! ' Longueville blushed hotly and looked a trifle foolish : Uncle Conde could always put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off the jest with a laugh that he hoped sounded natural , and gave his hand to his cousin Enghien , then to Guiche and Marsillac , who followed hard behind the latter . None of the three was a member of his intimate circle : Enghien was a petulant pocket-edition of his father , devoid of Conde 's genius and personality ; there were half a dozen good reasons for disliking the Comte de Guiche ; while Marsillac , dully correct , yet astute enough to have become the King 's favourite courtier , was detested by everybody because everybody was jealous of him . ( Besides , Longueville and he had a private excuse for their lack of ease in each other 's society , since it was universallysupposed that they were half-brothers  --  the old Duchess having been exceptionally gallant in her youth and La Rochefoucauld , Marsillac 's father , her accepted lover through all the years of the Fronde . ) The young men saluted one another with glacial smiles and remarkedwhat a hot night it was ; then Longueville conducted his uncle to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , a difficult guest . His presence was so overwhelming that one could not , before it , embark on conversational trivialities . It was not his age that awed them : though he was already past fifty , he did not seem like an old man . No : it was rather the aura of his past triumphs , still unmistakablyclinging to him , that abashed people . One could not look at him without realizing that here was the victor of Rocroi and Nordlingen and the siege of Mardyck , a born general who had led the forces of France to unequalled successes when he himself was scarceIP449out of his teens . He had no need to deck his breast with medals to remind the youth of today of what he had done ; it was implicit in every turn of his head , every regard of those piercing green eyes . ' Great Conde , ' ' Monsieur the Prince , the hero '  --  so he would be called to the end of the chapter , whether he liked it or not . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endearinglypaternal ; and the young men returned his affection with interest . Enghien , his son ; Longueville , his sister 's son ; as well as Fiesque , Guiche , and Marsillac , the sons of old friends  --  all adored him and felt that whatever he did must be right because he did it . Tonight the hero appeared somewhat tired and dispirited : the heat of the day had been trying , and , though he did not complain , the rigid reluctance of his motions made it evident that he was suffering from an onslaught of gout , the one enemy he could not subdue . He sat silent while David and his corps of subordinate lackeys served the soup and the Rhine salmon and filled the guests ' glasses with pale gold German wine . His own simpler wants were catered to by his valet Pacolet , a disreputable old mummy who had been in his service for years and who invariably stood behind his master 's chair , bending slightly forward , an unmeaning grin on his skull-like features . The young men , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses  --  one could always talk about horses !  --  and exchanged sundry scraps of camp gossip . . . . There was the ridiculous plight of the Venetian ambassador , Michieli , who had insisted on following the King to war without proper funds or supplies , and now found himself , destitute of provisions , forced to beg for crumbs from his colleagues ' better stocked tables . The strange passion of Monsieur , the King 's brother , for making himself up every morning , as though for a ball at the Palais Royal , was also gone into exhaustively : naturally , as soon as the sun got at all hot , the poor little Prince 's cheeks ran till they resembled a painter 's palette . Guiche was especially acid on the subject of Monsieur , who had once been his bosom friend , in the days before the dashing Count 's love for Madame , Monsieur 's young English wife , had broken off their happy relations forever . From these personal matters they passed to a lively discussion of army affairs  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissariat and the extraordinary measures of discipline in the troops introduced by the infantry leader , Colonel Martinet . Most of the older soldiers were opposed to such revolutionarychanges , but , oddly enough , Conde broke his silence to put in a word in their favour . ' Discipline , lads , means nothing in itself , but it makes for ap450stronger army in wartime , and whatever does that , must be good . If I 'd had disciplined troops at the Battle of the Faubourg-SaintAntoine , they 'd not have been hacked to pieces as they were . We 're none of us so old we ca n't manage to learn a new trick or two . What my cousin 's army lacks now is not order , but experience . Because they 've not been up yet against real opposition , they imagine that every enemy they meet will topple over like tenpins . I fancy young Orange and his Dutchmen may have some surprises in store for us . ' ' Perhaps so , uncle  --  but when shall we be able to prove it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so hard to bear as inaction ! My God , are we to camp here all summer like sheep , in very sight of the rich pastures we dare not make ours ? ' ' Papa , could a bridge not be built ? ' inquired Enghien , with an air of great wisdom . ' Surely Julius Caesar did not suffer himself to be vanquished by so simple an obstacle as a river ? ' ' No , nor Louis de Bourbon , either , ' muttered Fiesque . ' Wait , my friends , and you 'll see'But , my God ! how can we fight , when we ca n't come to grips with the foe ? ' demanded Longueville impatiently ; while even the more prudent Guiche observed : ' Was it not Silius Italicus who said : " Away with delay ! The chance of great fortune is short-lived " ? What 's annoying to me is that the longer we do nothing , the more time the Hollanders have to build up their strength . I realize that the main Dutch army is waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are men arriving every day in the Fort of Tollhuis . I heard only this afternoon the report that was sent to Your Highness that Prince William had dispatched General Wirtz to relieve Montbas of the command . I know Wirtz of old ; he 's as sly as a fox , and twice as courageous ! Sir , there must be some way of crossing the Rhine before it 's too late to surprise the enemy . If only you 'd give me leave to try to find it ! ' Conde , who had paid little heed to the hotheaded remarks of the other young men , turned his glowing gaze on the Comte de Guiche with a measure of respect . Guiche had had a great deal of military experience in his comparatively short career , not only in France and Flanders , but in Holland and Poland as well , as a volunteer in the years of his exile . If he were seriously of the opinion that the Rhine could be forded , the venture might not be so foolhardy as it sounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , ' that we have intended , all along , to build a bridge , directly the material for it arrived . I 've been held up these last two days for lack of the promised wood and metal . It is a pity , I grant you , that the enemy should have wind of our plans and time to circumvent them  --  yet how dare I risk the lives of my men attempting to cross a river as wide and deep as the Rhine without a bridge of some sort ? It 's only too likely to prove suicidal . '   Nay , sir , ' exclaimed Guiche eagerly , ' with all due respect  --  and , naturally , I 'd not dream of setting up my insignificant knowledge against yours  --  but when I was fighting in Poland we had often occasion to ford streams no less powerful than this one  --  and I assure you , we never let the lack of a bridge hold us back ! ' Ah , well , boy , that may be  --  but consider a moment the differencebetween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cossacks with none-too-full bellies would think all in a day 's work might be an impossible manoeuvre for His Majesty 's sleek , well-fed troops . I vow , a good third of ' em may not even know how to swim ! '  --  And Conde threw back his head to emit the short , sharp bark that was his closest approach to a laugh . Still Guiche was not discouraged . Sir , you may very likely be right  --  as , indeed , when have you not been ? But remember this : your men need not swim if their horses can . My thought would be to leave the infantry here , and send only the cavalry across to rout the enemy 's outposts and clear out the fort . You could cover the move fairly well from this side with your artillery , and then later , at your leisure , build your bridge  --  half a dozen bridges , if you will  --  to transport the rest of the army . Do n't say it ca n't be done ! There 's no such word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince . Have n't I proved it a hundred times in the old days ?  --  when I was unfortunately in the forces opposed to Your Highness ! Livy says , you know , that " necessity is the last and strongest weapon . " There must be some spot where the water is shallow enough to permit us to cross in safety . There must  --  I am convinced of it ! Only give me leave tomorrowto scout about by myself , and I 'll engage on my honour to bring you before sundown the news you are waiting for . ' The Count spoke with an air of assurance that , Longueville could see , impressed Conde in spite of himself . Probably he had stolen a march on the rest of them and done a bit of reconnoitring on his own already . It would be just like Guiche to play a nasty trick like that . Damn the fellow 's impudent , independent ways ! Longueville had never been able to stand his superior smile  --  and his parade of classical learning , with his Livy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there ever more preposterous affectation ? Who really believed his boast that he spent three hours a day , wherever he happened to be , conning the works of those musty old Greeks and Romans ? As if anyone who cared to could not hunt up a few randomquotations in some handy anthology to spice his conversation ! None but women and priests were to be taken in by such flimsy pretensions . Especially women . Hang it all ! Was n't half Guiche 's success with the little Brissac his ability to spout verses from memory by the yard ? ... Yes , damn the fellow ! . .. All the same , though , it would not do to antagonize him now , when he was visibly on the verge of gaining his point with Uncle Conde . The Duke waved to David , as a signal that the lackeys might remove the salmon and bring on the roast , and said , smiling ( no one knew what an effort it cost him to produce that smile ! ) : ' Sir , I think the Count is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ? '  --  ' And I ? ' Enghien and Marsillac lost no time in speaking up , while Fiesque and the young Chevalier showed plainly by their faces that only their consciousness of inferior rank preventedthem from following suit . If there were going to be some heroic surprise action , none of the four could bear the thought of being left out of the fun .... Damn them , too ! Why , the whole army 'd be in it , if one did n't watch out ! .. . Conde good-humouredly surveyed the eager circle of faces in the candlelight . ' What ? All ready to volunteer ? Ha , Guiche ! You can take your pick of the lot . But I 'll need you , Enghien , tomorrow myself , to ride to Cologne on a mission to His Excellency the Elector . And Marsillac , if I mistake not , has been detailed to take charge of the evacuation of Rees . As for you , Charles , my boy , as a member of the staff of Monsieur de Turenne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you no task for the morning ? ' Longueville frowned . ' I was to ride up towards Doesburg , ' he answered sulkily , ' with the Comte de Roye and a small scouting party , to confer with the Duc de Luxembourg and see how the land lies in that direction . But really it 's not at all necessary for me to go . Roye 's quite capable of taking charge of the expedition alone . Besides , it 's useless , is n't it ? Since we all know perfectly well that the main enemy army is waiting there beyond the Yssel . Only a madman would think of trying to enter Holland that way . ' ' Perhaps . Perhaps . But it might not be mad to persuade the Dutchmen that that 's our intention , ' remarked Uncle Conde mildly , swooping on his venison , as if Prince William himself lay under his fork and knife . ' My boy , you must obey orders . That 's every soldier'swhole duty . Guiche had better , I think , explore on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up till he 's exhausted every possibility , no matter how faint , of achieving his end . That , too , is as it should be . Now , lads , let 's forget the war for an hour , at least , and enjoy the admirable dinner our host has set before us . Lord , Charles , this roast is an excellent thing ! Where in blazes do you get venison on the march , and at this time of year ? My fool of a chef has sent me in overdone mutton every night for a week ! ' ' Why , uncle , ' t is no great matter , ' replied Longueville , making once more a gallant attempt to suppress his rising irritation . ' Thesep453scrub woods hereabouts are chock full of deer , and the peasants , I find , are only too glad to break game regulations to get their hands on our good French silver . But come , sir , I see you are drinking nothing . Is this sour German wine too weak for your palate ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a health to His Majesty  --  and death and destruction to the scurvy Dutch knaves who dare to resist him ! The King , gentlemen , the King ! ' The toast was drunk standing , with perfect solemnity ; but afterwards , as if it were a signal they 'd been waiting for , the guests grew freer in manner . To tell the truth , the wine had circulated fairly liberally already , judging by their flushed faces and the sweat that poured off their brows . It was appallingly hot in the satin-lined tent . Although the sun had been gone for some hours , the air was still heavy and brooding ; it stirred just enough to set the wooden chandelierhanging over the table to swaying gently . The candles in the chandelier burned hard and clear : they were surrounded by scores of beetles and blundering night-flying moths , while in the dark fields outside crickets and frogs kept up a tireless chorus punctuated by distant rumbles of thunder . The supper drew to its close in a merry mood . Chairs were pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes . Marsillac and Monsieur the Duke removed their wigs . Guiche unbuttoned his waistcoat with a laughing excuse for the necessity of the gesture . ( As he did so , Longueville noticed that the Count 's left hand was minus three fingers  --  grim reminder of his Polish campaigns . ) Even Conde laid aside the hat with the moulting cock 's feather and sat with his legs crossed , picking his long yellow teeth , looking more than ever like a benevolent vulture . And young Montchevreuilhad apparently quite forgotten his fear of the illustrious company . Only their host sat aloof and suspicious . He seldom perspired like other people , despite the luxuriant yellow tresses that must have been quite as trying to carry as any court peruque . He smiled punctiliouslyat everything that was said , and made polite rejoinders whenever it was necessary ; but all the same he appeared to be sufferingfrom some strange blight on his spirits . Under the conventional surface of his thoughts coursed a black current of doubt concerning Guiche and Uncle Conde . It was clear that the pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , they 'd already discovered a ford across the Rhine , and planned to take base advantage of his absence tomorrow to work up some brilliant manoeuvre between them , in which he , Longueville , could have no part . It was cursedly unfair ! . . . And Enghien would be there , of course , no matterwhat his father pretended he meant him to do . Enghien always was there . That was " Uncle Conde 's invariable policy , to shove the poor chap into the limelight wherever possible , hoping that some day the latter would find glory thrust upon him , since he was obviously not destined to achieve it .... So far , the policy had failed . Enghien , clever enough about everything else , was a fool in the field . He could not understand the rudiments of military strategy , nor take charge of the simplest routine manoeuvre without making a muddle . In moments of crisis he was sure to lose his head completely and go gallopinground in wild confusion . Why , damn it ! the man could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable . For what reason , then , did Uncle Conde insist on pushing him ahead instead of Longueville , who was almost as close a relation and had twice his cousin 's aptitude for the career ? ... It was not , Longueville added bitterly to himself , as though he had unlimited time to wait for preferment . No , it must be now or never , with the Polish throne in sight ! .. . The little Duke brooded , his chin in his hand , nursing his grievance , even after his guests had stopped talking about the war and fallen back on the soldier 's second reliable topic , women . Warm with wine , the young officers began exchanging tales of their exploits amongst the Flanders belles . Conde , though taking no share in their conversation , listened indulgently , half smiling , to their ribald boasts . . . . What , after all , did women mean in his life ? Everyone knew that he had never loved his wife , who had been foisted on him by her uncle , Cardinal Richelieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was definitely relegated to one of the family 's remoter estates , while the Prince 's household , both in Paris and Chantilly , officially without a hostess , was more or less run by the Princess Palatine , Anne de Gonzague , the mother of Enghien 's wife . Here was no matter for scandal : the Palatine and Uncle Conde were old and good friends , trusted allies since the days of the Fronde , now united more closely than ever by their children 's marriage . But it was not clear that Monsieur the Prince had ever truly loved any woman . There had been talk of this one and that one in his youth  --  of poor , pretty Marthe du Vigean , who had fled to a cloister when her gallant deserted her  --  of the bold , handsome Duchesse de Chatillon . ( But that had been mainly a political intrigue . ) ... No , even then , the hero 's deepest affections had been reserved for his comrades-at-arms , the gay band of satellites known as Conde 's ' little masters , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit themselves in the summer and spent their winters drinking , gaming , wenching , and strutting like peacocks before a prostrate court . Longueville , who usually joined in talking bawdy with the best will in the world , found himself this time as silent as Uncle Conde . It was all he could do to force a smile as Marsillac , with lumbering im-P455propriety , told several foul stories almost entirely lacking in point . ... What was the matter with him tonight ? Why could n't he laugh as the others did ? Was the sour German wine really to blame ? .. . Tongue-tied and miserable , he sat twirling the stem of the empty glass in his fingers , until at length his condition became noticeable to the rest of the company . Guiche , who had approached the top of his form , leaned laughing across the table to say , with a significant glance : ' Your Highness seems distrait . Where are your thoughts , dear boy ? I 'll not offer a penny for them , for I dare swear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , eh ? Have I hit upon it ? Lord , sir ! if you 'll forgive my saying so , you 're wasting your time there . My lady 's a prim little taffeta doll , no more likely to come to life in a man 's arms than if she were stuffed with horsehair and sawdust . Good God ! When I think of the hours I 've put in dancing hither and yon at young Madam 's beck and call  --  and all without the slightest hope of reward  --  I vow my head needs examining ! I wager Your Highness has had no better luck . Or have you perchance concealed your successes expressly to make us rage with jealousy ? You 're a sly fellow , we all know , a very sly fellow ! Come , now , sir , no hedging  --  out with the truth ! How goes the campaign ? Has the little Brissacsuccumbed to your wiles ? ' Longueville hesitated , blushing furiously against his will . He strove to turn off the question with a jest , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not far from the truth . But tonight , somehow , he could not : instead , to his horror , he heard himselfmumbling , like any half-baked schoolboy : ' Ah , now , drop it ! You know Madame de Brissac is nothing to me . ' But Guiche was not to be fobbed off so easily . He leaned even farther forward , his impish smile still more pronounced  --  those white teeth , after all , remained his best feature  --  as he cried : ' Well , then , my hero , if the Brissac is n't to blame for your sluggish humour , it must be old woman La Ferte . There , now , boys , have n't I got it this time ? Gad , sir , as the poet says , " Neither absence nor time will be able to cure me " ! And it 's ancient history what the sisters La Louppe are capable of . Do n't I remember , to my cost ... ? Why , when the Olonne was the toast of the town it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hey , Marsillac , old fellow ? No hard feelings , I hope ? What 's past is past , though not yet forgotten . But they tell me she 's nothing at all compared to her sister  --  Messalina'scompletely eclipsed , and that sort of thing .... Well ! Well ! I 've been away from court so long that my gossip is scarcely up to date , but the rumour 's about that the Marechal does n't dare hire pages over twelve years of age  --  and that the reason his wife goes to the country so often is to get rid of certain tokens of her attach- ments that might prove embarrassing recruits to the nursery at Great Senneterre ! ... You 're a brave man , my master  --  as brave as I was , in my youth . But I freely confess that the little Brissac is more to my taste in this sober autumn of my career as an alcovist . More compliments than couch-work , so to speak ! . . . No offence meant , Your Highness ! But tell us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came away from Paris . Did you clap a chastity belt on her matronly form ? I trust you have n't neglected that little precaution , for if you have , ten to one you 'll find yourself replaced before the war 's half over ! ' Again Longueville made a desperate attempt to laugh , in order to show that the gibe had not touched him . Guiche was a brazen , mocking fellow , with respect for neither God nor man . But now , when all was said and done , he was only joking . It was idiotic to take his filthy insinuations seriously , for they were not meant to do more than raise a fugitive laugh . And the Lord knew , Longueville had taken part in enough debauches before this to know precisely the kind of lewd banter that passed for wit : he ought by now to be able to parry the thrust mechanically . What . therefore , were his astonishment and dismay to find himself on his feet , crying out in a sharp , shrill voice : Shut your mouth , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! ' Guiche paused in the midst of a fit of squalling laughter , his thick black eyebrows lifted in sudden surprise . But he had had no time to alter the rest of his features , which went on grinning unmeaningly , though the excuse for it had passed . Longueville gripped the edge of the table to keep himself from trembling . A hard pulse pounded in his temples : he felt he would burst if he could not manage to stop that senseless grin .... There was his cousin Enghien , too , snickering into his napkin like an illmanneredcolt . He hated him almost as fiercely as he hated Guiche . God ! How he hated them both ! Deliberately he reached for a decanter and poured out a glass of the yellow German wine ; then raised it , intending to dash the contentsin the Count 's mirthful face . But a hand fell unexpectedly on his shoulder  --  a hand with a grip like iron  --  and a calm , cold voice ( rather like iron , too , that voice ) whispered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing 's worth making a scene about any more . I had word this morning that the envoys from Poland are coming tomorrow . You 're to be crowned in Danzig , they tell me . ' P456THE THUNDER HEARD AT INTERVALS DURING THE COURSE OF THEDuke 's supper-party proved to be more than a sign of heat : not an hour after the guests had gone home a short , sharp thundershower swept with fury over the camp , drenching the tents and the wagons and the rows of patient , unprotesting horses and mules that cropped the grass in the open fields . Unfortunately , it did not last long enough to do much good . Early next morning , when Monsieur de Longueville set forth on his scouting expedition , the sun was as fierce , the sky as cloudless as ever . Before leaving he had given his staff detailed instructions concerning the Polish envoys , in case the latter arrived before he returned from his mission . These dignitaries were to be received with full honours , a special tent placed at their disposal , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comte de Fiesque , the Chevalier de Montchevreuil , and the Duke 's eight gentlemen-inwaiting . The Chevalier , of course , was rather young to assume much responsibility , but he had begged so hard to be allowed to help that Longueville had not the heart to refuse him . And , anyhow , with Fiesque in command , nothing could possibly go amiss . Fiesque , in his casual , unruffled way , was efficiency itself . He bore , as well , an ancient and honourable name  --  those Polish chaps were sure to have heard of him . Longueville was delighted to be able to leave the execution of his orders in such capable hands . It was only a pity , he thought , that the members of his suite were obliged to wear the King 's uniforms instead of the colours of his own ducal house , as they would have done in the old days . This was another of Louvois ' newfangled notions that had found little favour with the nobles . However , it could not be helped  --  nor would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon enough they 'd be transferring their allegiance to a new land and a new flag ... . Longueville smiled as he remembered the wonderful change to come . He sat up very straight in his saddle and flicked Pegasus lightly with the whip , so that the latter trotted briskly out of camp to take the road to the north . Behind them arose a clatter of hoofs as the Conte de Roye , who was the captain of a company in the Duke 's regiment , marshalled his thirty picked horsemen to follow their leader .   Longueville paid no heed either to the Count or his men . Roye was an excellent officer , but a Huguenot , middle-aged and austere , and therefore not one of his affinities . This , on the whole , suited the Duke 's plans very well , as it would spare him the necessity of making conversation during the long day they were to spend in each other 's society . He could say as little as he pleased , lose himself , for hours on end , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for since last night they had been tossing in painful confusion . In that dark welter the promise of the Polish crown shone out as the one constant ray of hope . He dared not lose sight of it for an instant . It would help him to face the future as nothing else could ; it was helping him now  --  just as , assuredly , it had helped him last night to conquer his temper . But for Uncle Conde 's timely reminder , who knew what might have happened ? Uncle Conde , of course , was right , as always : it would be the height of folly to risk spoiling things now , with the gleaming prize so nearly in his grasp . ... Just the same , Longueville would not soon forget the dastardly behaviour of the Comte de Guiche . No ! By God ! He 'd pay him out for it some day  --  see if he did n't !  --  the slippery , insulting fellow ! All night the Duke 's dreams had been fevered by an uneasy remembrance of his rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell us , do , how you left the old girl ! ' went on echoing and re-echoing in his subconscious brain , only to spring once more to sharp immediate life when he awoke . Was that the way men spoke of Magdelon ? Was that how they thought of his beautiful mistress , whose love had made him so proud ? For the first time in his life Longueville almost regretted his rank , which had kept him from learning what people really felt about his affair . Even now , if Guiche had n't got drunk .. . The whole morning through , Longueville could not get the matter out of his head . He sat speechless and depressed all the way to Doesburg , following blindly the dusty road that wound among fields and vineyards , deserted save for colonies of larks and an occasional group of peasants . The peasants stopped work when they caught sight of the Duke and leaned on their rakes to watch the gay beplumed cavalcade jingling by . But Longueville did not see them , nor did he hear the fluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his lips went on dully repeating : ' The old girl . . . old woman La Ferte ! ' ... In the cheerless illumination cast by these devastating words he felt he must make a serious attempt to appraise his emotionallife . What had happened to him ?  --  and why had it happened ? If he could answer those questions satisfactorily , he would have made at least a start at solving the problems that vexed him . To begin with  --  he might as well admit it at once  --  he had alwaysadmired older women . But there were excellent reasons forp459that . How could he have helped it , given his queer , unchildlike childhood ? .. . ' I never had my youth , like other boys , ' thought Longueville , with melancholy complacency . ' I never had a family , like other families ... This last was undeniably true . Although not an only child , he might really better have been one . His half-sister Marie , Mademoisellede Longueville , a cranky old maid with bookish tastes , detestedchildren on principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duchess . And Charles-Paris ' brother Dunois , three years his senior , if not quite an imbecile , was certainly far from normal . Their father and mother , too , were in no sense average parents . The Duc de Longueville seemed to childish eyes incredibly old . A careworn , bearded man , who seldom spoke , he looked what he was  --  an embittered noble , prematurely aged , not least by a clear realization that his failure was due to his own mistake . If instead of backinghis rebel brother-in-law Conde in the civil wars , he had only held out for Mazarin ... But there was no use , now , in raking up old scores . He had managed to save part of his fortune in the general crash of the party , as well as the governorship of Normandy . That was something to be thankful for . The Duchesse de Longueville , his second wife , was twenty-four years younger than he . Once so gallant , undisputed leader of fashion in Regency days , and a born intriguer , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes . In fact , in an agony of exaggerated repentance , she rushed to the other extreme  --  frequented Jansenist circles at Port Royal , gave up rouge and patches , wore hair-shirts under her silk gowns on fast-days , was birched regularly , and spent many hours confessing partly imaginary sins to her director of conscience , strict Father Singlin . But , with all her parade of piety , Madame de Longueville remained a social queen . She was still beautiful , too . Every afternoon when the family was in town , at the Hotel de Longueville in the rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre , her friends came to call , just as they 'd done for years . Their hostess reclined on the bed of state , languid and lovely in a cloud of dove-grey silks and laces , smiling her enchantingnew penitent 's smile  --  whilst a circle of female toadies filled all the space in the alcove about her . At these functions Charles-Paris was invariably sent for , to be presented to the ladies . ( There was no good in producing poor Dunois , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But the little Comte de Saint-Paul was a charming child  --  rather small for his age  --  but with such keen blue eyes and sunny curls ! His smile was as conscious as an accomplished coquette 's as he was handed aboutP460from one toady to the next , to be petted and praised . His knowing complimentary speeches  --  thoroughly rehearsed in private  --  were pronounced perfection ; and when , bowing quaintly , his hands on his heart , he passed a platter of sugarplums to the guests ( sure in advancethat the lion 's share would be placed in his pocket before he trotted back to the nursery ) , a ripple of ecstasy swept through the room . Even Maman would raise her head to smile with flaccid approvaland murmur ( she never said things out loud ) : Ah , yes , Saint-Paul 's the consolation of my declining years ! ' These were the principal pleasures of Charles-Paris ' early life . The Longuevilles , of course , were not always in town , but even in the country , at the castle of Trie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maman 's drawing-room was scarcely less full . Trie was not far from Paris ; it was also on the road to Flanders and the Baths of Forges ; and in those days few officers bound for the battlefields , or belles in search of a cure , would willingly miss a chance of paying court to the governor of the province and his famous wife . So the petting and sugarplums continued . As the Comte de SaintPaulgrew older , however , he became gradually aware that , though he might be his mother 's favourite , his father did not care for him at all . Not that Papa had said anything .... He was careful always to treat both boys with scrupulous fairness . Indeed , Charles-Paris had much more done for him than most younger sons . Because Dunois was too dull to share his lessons , Saint-Paul had a separate suite from the time he was able to walk  --  his own tutor and governor and gentlemen-in-waiting . Later , he was sent to the Academy to learn how to ride and handle a sword , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might take a fancy to the church , since it was obviously the best that could be aspired to in his case . But Saint-Paul was too intelligent not to realize that he meant almostnothing to his father , and too inquisitive not to make up his mind to learn why . He got it at last out of his governor Fontenai , . by dint of persistent questioning  --  the Duc de Longueville feared Charles-Paris was not his own son . It seemed that many people thought that Monsieur de la Rochefoucauld ... Mind , now ! Not a word of this to your family , nor to anyone else ! ' cautioned little owl-like Monsieur de Fontenai , wetting his lips and rolling his eyes . apprehensively , as if he were afraid that the **25;8045;TOOLONG of books in the library at Trie might be listening . It 's as much as my place is worth to tell you . But I suppose you 'd find it out for yourself , sooner or later  --  you 've a right to know , in a way , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal  --  and there 's not likely to be one now . Heaven knows , there may n't be anythingP461in those old stories ! It 's all so long ago , is n't it ? ... Only remember this : it 's no use your expecting anything from His Highness , outside of what it 's his duty to give you . Your best chance , boy , lies with your poor mother . God be praised , she 's a young woman still !  --  and you 've the whole future before you . Just wait  --  and you 'll see .... Wait  --  yes  --  he would have to do that ! Often it seemed to Saint-Paul that he 'd always been waiting for something . First , for his half-sister Marie to marry  --  that self-willed young woman 's tardy match with the sickly young Duc de Nemours was , frankly , a deliverance to her family . . . . Then , for his father to die  --  because , while he lived , the Duchess could give little help to her younger son . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the question of ' What to Do with Saint-Paul ' could be decided , one way or the other . Once the old Duke was gone , Uncle Conde had valiantly espoused Charles-Paris ' cause ; begged his sister to face facts , admit that Dunois would never be fit to inherit the dukedom , and settle the title on the logical heir . But the distracted Duchess could not come to a definite decision . She wrung her hands and wept , yearning with her whole heart to yield to her brother 's behest  --  still something held her back ... . Dunois had revolted from the Jesuits ' rule and was now at home again , asserting his right to his inheritance . And Madame de Nemours was supporting his claims  --  not that she cared a fig , really , what happened to any of them : it was merely an excellent chance to annoy her stepmother ! . . . What to do  --  what to do ! Would it not be wrong to steal Dunois ' birthright ? to bestow it on her ewe lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ? .. . Madame de Longueville asked her friends for advice , wrote long letters to all her relations , badgered Father Singlin , her confessor , as well as the good nuns at Port Royal and the Carmelites ' convent , until everybody was heartily sick of the subject . Meanwhile , the object of all this tender confusion stood aloof , waiting again , as usual  --  cynically aware of the secret motives underlying his mother 's distress . What would have happened in the end , it was impossible to guess  --  had not Dunois , surprisingly , taken matters into his poor , falteringhands and run away to Rome to be a priest . Then , when one might have imagined that the worst of his troubles were over , began the dullest and longest waiting of all . Saint-Paul was Duc de Longueville at last  --  but he had nothing to do ! His cousin the King refused point-blank to give him a post either in the army or the civil service . It had been made manifest from the beginning that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be considered for a military command.  | Longueville understood well enough why . He read the look in his cousin 's eyes clearly at their first meeting  --  the look that said , without need of words : ' Your mother was a dangerous and intriguingwoman . Your father was dangerous , too . They tried for years to upset my kingdom  --  I 'll take damned good care you never get a chance to follow their example ! ' So that was that ! The new Duke might fret as he pleased , make vain attempts to buy this charge and that , strut his way uneasily through various minor campaigns , meanwhile wasting his youth and gold and none-too-robust health on a round of aimless dissipation  --  until he met Magdelon de la Ferte . Oh , there 'd been women before  --  plenty of them !  --  for few were strong enough to resist the combined lure of a lustrous name and the youth 's charming , insinuating manners . Young girls he despised , finding their conversation insipid and their dowries insufficientto tempt him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties , some of whom , truth to tell , he had met in his mother 's own drawing-room ... . Magdelon was different . Hang it all ! Of course she was , no matter what Guiche said , or anyone else ! From the first day he met her Longueville felt that . It seemed odd now to think how nearly he had n't met her , how close he had come to refusing his first invitation to the Hotel de Senneterre , relayed to him by the Comte de Fiesque . He had n't wanted to go in the least  --  he 'd said so a dozen times  --  : in the end he 'd given in , his inertia overcome by Fiesque 's drawling insistence : ' I say , you know , my boy , you ca n't let me down  --  I 've promised to bring you ! ' The Marechale , it appeared , had ' sent for ' the Duke . She had said to Fiesque , with the easy arrogance of a beauty accustomed to havingher slightest wishes regarded as orders : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I see him everywhere with other women  --  in the Cours , at the playhouse , at the palace in Saint-Germain . Yet , I know not for what reason , he salutes me coldly , and leaves it at that . ' Fiesque had told her then that his friend 's timidity was responsible for his negligent ways  --  which gave the two young men a hearty laugh . The truth was that Longueville knew the La Fertes only slightly . He had been a child in the days of Magdelon 's early social successes ; she was much older than he , yet not old enough to have formed part of his mother 's circle . And he 'd begun his career in the army just as the Marechal was ending his . He admired Madame de la Ferte whenever he saw her , but he saw her seldom ... and God knew , it was n't women who were lacking in his life ! .. . So he went with the Count that afternoon expecting nothing , regrettingnothing , even thinking of nothing in particular . P463His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him forever . She was seated in a high-backed chair in one of the garden windows of the Gallery of Aminta  --  all in rose-colouredvelvet , a cherry-red ribbon binding her curls . It was spring  --  he remembered afterwards , inconsequently  --  and thrushes were whistling in the garden . Longueville stared and stared  --  he felt he had never seen her before , never , really , seen any woman !  --  There were other people in the room  --  indeed , many other people , for it was one of the Marechale'sreception days : she was surrounded by the usual crowd of vapid and noisy young men , each of them bent on securing as much of her notice as possible for himself . ( Longueville spotted Effiat and Marsan and that insufferable ass of a Tallard  --  just the set of fecklessriffraff he despised and particularly avoided at court . ) But somehow it was as if they had been alone together . As she gave him her hand her velvet-brown eyes met his blue ones in a long look  --  not challenging , rather thoughtful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question had been answered  --  a childlike smile , and said in a matter-of-fact tone , such as she might have used had they been in the habit of meeting every day : How do you do , Your Highness ? You look very happy this afternoon . ' Longueville wanted to shout out : ' I am happy ! Why should n't I be ? I 've just fallen in love with the most marvellous creature in the world ! ' Naturally , however , being a well-schooled courtier , he did nothing of the kind . He stammered instead something noncommittal about the sun in his eyes having blinded him  --  then , in a moment , recoveredhimself sufficiently to turn the remark into a compliment on his hostess 's charms , which Magdelon accepted gracefully . The rest of their encounter passed in general conversation . They had no opportunity to talk in private : Magdelon would not let him stay when her guests rose to go , but dismissed him with the others , so that he was forced to content himself with kissing the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet she did not look surprised when he appeared at her lever next morning at an hour so early that none but intimate friends could have hoped for admittance . She was seated in front of her toilettable , having her curls brushed by her waiting-maid . But as soon as Longueville entered she sent the maid out of the room , turned to her visitor , and said simply : I told the Swiss this morning I would be at home to one man in all Paris . Can you guess who it is ? ' Within a week they were madly in love  --  within a month all Paris knew it  --  within a year she was expecting his child . Longueville found peace with his new mistress , and contentmentp464 such as he had never dreamed of . Why would he not have been contented ? Magdelon did everything in her power to please him . She was , thought Longueville , the most sensible woman he 'd ever known absolutely the only one to realize that the secret of success for lovers lay in the female 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , after all ! Why did not more women see ... ? Before the first month was up , Madame de la Ferte 's little imperious airs , her front of self-assurance and self-sufficiency , had quite disappeared . They were not , as in her sister 's case , an indication of character so much as a smoke screen thrown out to conceal her secret humility . She was no longer queen of a court : because Longueville objected to rivals , the vapid and noisy young men had all been banished ... . She did not seem to miss them . With youthful intensity she gave herself utterly to whatever feelings possessed her  --  whether joy or pain  --  and , in those early days of their love , they had been almost pure joy . Magdelon was content to drift on from day to day , from month to month  --  from year to year , really  --  without asking what was to become of them . In the end , Longueville himself came to be affected by his mistress 's carefree attitude . Something would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before very long  --  that would decide things for them in spite of themselves . Meanwhile , life was nearly perfect as it was . When the Polish affair materialized out of a clear sky , two years had elapsed since the lovers ' first meeting in the Gallery of Aminta , and the Duke was as deeply devoted as ever . The birth of CharlesLouishad forged even closer ties between him and Charles-Louis ' mother . At the same time , he was too astute not to be beginning to see that the liaison must soon end . For one thing , he had to marry . The state of his fortune made it necessary . He could not marry Magdelon because she was not free  --  and even if she were , the match would have been impossible from every point of view . No doubt the crown of Poland was a blessing in more ways than one ... . This did not mean that it would not be a fearful wrench to part from her , to say nothing of parting from little Charles-Louis . Longueville was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken steps to assure his son 's future . In his will , drawn up just a few days before joining the army ( it seemed odd , at his age , to be making a will  --  but , after all , when you were going to war , you never knew what might happen ! ) , he left Charles-Louis half a million francs in cash , to be realized from the sale of his furniture and other personal effects , as well as the fine estate of Graville in Normandy . So that , in any case , the lad would not be a pauper . He told Magdelon what he had done  --  and she had cried and cried , and clung to him , and said that he must not speak of such terrible things . He told his mother , also , begging her to use her in/fluence with the court to have Charles-Louis legitimized , if it were possible to do so without naming Magdelon .... Madame de Longueville , who had not known before that there was a CharlesLouis , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal  --  but finally she promised to help her son ; in return , to please her , he promised to make a general confession before setting out for Flanders . And he had kept his word  --  so that was all right ... . Longueville thought about little Charles-Louis far more than he cared to admit . The idea of being a father fascinated him , the mysteriousnessof the continuity of life ! There was that other being , at once a part of you and quite outside of you .... How could it be borne to leave him , and never know ? . . . Well , he would do what he could to watch over his heir from afar . Not much , of course , was necessary yet . Charles-Louis ' health and education would be safe enough in good Porlier 's hands . Later , however , the Duke meant to see to it himself that the boy was launched on his military career under the best auspices . Perhaps he would do what his father had not done  --  perhaps he 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France and Poland were allies , thank Heaven ! so that some day they were assured of meeting ... . It had been devilish hard saying good-bye to Magdelon . But he had got through it somehow  --  and it was better so , best for them both . In the future  --  though he would never forget his love  --  Longueville hoped he might be too busy to miss her as sharply as he was missing her now . Of course , that would be the way of it ! Confoundit ! A king must have other matters on his mind of greater importance than a passion for any woman ! Look at his cousin Louis  --  a model in that as in all other departments of a monarch 's duty ! ... Well , to sum up , thought the Duke , everything would have been ideal  --  or not far from it  --  if it had not been for Guiche . His thoughtless , jeering words shed a new and horribly revealing light on the celebrated Longueville-La Ferte affair . In the beams of that light Charles-Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heretofore unsuspected . Good God ! Could the Count be right ? Was that really how people looked at him and poor Magdelon  --  as a besotted boy in the toils of a fading siren old enough to be his mother ? ... It made no difference that to him she was not a fading siren : if the world thought her one , then , alas ! for all practical purposes , she was one . There was nothing to be done about it .... The old girl  --  old woman La Ferte ! ' The cruel phrases stung his mind like a whip , drove the angry red high in his cheeks , started throbbingthrough his brain in torturing time with the pound of Pegasus ' hoofs on the dusty highroad . He would never forget them  --  never  --  never ! Damn Guiche ! Damn everyone ! It was spoilt now , thatp466 Olympian vision of a noble farewell to his lovely and generous mistress . High drama had been turned into burlesque farce  --  Racine to Moliere , at a moment 's notice ! .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with his wrath at being left out of things , ' as he expressed it , by Guiche and Uncle Conde . Easy enough , now , to see why they 'd done it . They thought him a mere babe , an infatuated suckling , tied to a hag 's apron strings .... Well ! He would have to prove they were wrong , and that as quickly as possible . Yes ! More and more surely he saw that there was one way , and one way alone , to clear his honour and show them he was a man as good as other men  --  as good as they were , no less ! He must perform an heroic deed  --  somethingfine and unheard-of and dashing .... But what ? All day long the Duke went on brooding over what had befallen him and the steps he must take to win back his lost esteem in the eyes of his fellows . He had plenty of time for these gloomy thoughts , as the journey proved quite uneventful . They saw no trace of the enemy the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they arrived at the camp of the Duc de Luxembourg , on the Yssel , just across from the frowning fortress of Doesburg , where the Prince of Orange was , there seemed to be nothing to do save deliver the dispatchfrom Turenne and bow themselves out . Monsieur de Luxembourgreceived them agreeably , gave Longueville and the Comte de Roye an excellent dinner in his tent , and sent them back late in the afternoon with an answer to the message they had brought . It was dull routine work . . . . On the way home , the sun felt hotter than ever . To avoid its rays Longueville decided to keep away from the shadeless river road , so they struck off instead through the comparativecool of the woods , on a wandering path that only once came within sight of the Rhine . This , as it happened , was directly oppositethe enemy 's fort of Tollhuis , which the Duke desired to inspect . Riding down over a sloping meadow to the water 's edge they found Uncle Conde , who , also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Conde did not appear surprised to see his nephew , but at the same time , the latter noted suspiciously , he offered no explanationof his presence there alone so late in the day . After rapping out a few businesslike questions about the state of affairs in Luxembourg'sarmy he handed his field glasses to Longueville and pointed out the enemy 's camp on the other side of the river , where the Dutch soldiers were swarming about in the red slanting sunlight . Guiche tells me they 've doubled their garrison since yesterday , ' said Uncle Conde . But at that , I 'll wager we 've still treble their number of cannon and ten times as many men . Oh , if I could only get at them ! '  |p467Nevertheless  , he maintained , in answer to Longueville 's eager inquiries , that no means had been found of crossing the river except by a bridge , and it would take two days at least to build that . Go home , lad , and rest , ' said the old Prince wearily . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as white as a sheet , and your men must be fairly well fagged out by this weather . It 's hard on us all , God knows ! Perhaps you will find the envoys from Poland waiting in camp . That would prove some diversion for you . ' ( This speech caused Longueville to sputter inwardly .... It was terrible ! Unbearable ! Uncle Conde talked as though he were a child to be distracted by toys .... But there was nothing one could say . ) Monsieur the Prince rode back up the meadow with the troop and reined in his flea-bitten grey on the outskirts of the wood , where he bade his nephew good-bye . Longueville turned round in his saddle once or twice to find Uncle Conde still watching him , a quizzical smile on his lips . Slowly the older man raised his arm in salute ... . The road back to camp through the forest , although somewhat cooler , was certainly longer than the direct route along the Rhine . It was late when Longueville 's party at length crossed the crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tents  --  so late that the sun had already set an hour before , leaving only a faint greenish-yellow tinge on the horizon . The swallows had deserted their hunting grounds by the river ; here and there the dark , industrious shape of a bat flitted silently by . Tired and discouraged , the Duke crossed the familiar stubbly field , letting Pegasus go as he pleased . There was no chance of missingthe way , with the torch flares from the camp to guide them . Longueville was so deeply engrossed in his own reflections that he failed to observe there were fewer torches than usual ; it was the Comte de Roye , dismounting to give his hand to his chief , who remarked on this and asked Bourgneuf , the Duke 's equerry , what it meant . Why , sir , ' replied Bourgneuf , half the camp 's broken up and left . About two hours before sundown they went , six thousand horsemen or so , with the King at their head . ' The Count smothered an oath . Gad ! You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? ' Longueville pricked up his ears . Where were they going , Bourgneuf ? ' Well , Your Highness , I 'm not sure  --  but I heard some talk from the ostlers of their taking the river road to the north along towards Tollhuis . It seems there was a message from your uncle Monsieur the Prince . They say he sent for the King to sup with him . There 's a rumour , sir , of a surprise move against the enemy  --  fording the Rhine , or some such business  --  but no one here can rightly tell what is in it . '  |p468  At that , some string seemed to snap in Longueville 's brain . Quite literally , stars exploded in front of his eyes , whole bouquets and constellations of rockets , like the fireworks let off for a garden party at court . In a blinding flash all became painfully clear , and remainedso : the fruitless errand on which he 'd been sent , the empty road they had travelled , Uncle Conde 's odd behaviour by the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the King and his cavalry .... Yes , mark that especially ! Not ordinary foot-soldiers , who would be useless in this particular form of attack  --  but the Light Horse Troops and the Cuirassiers .... His worst suspicions , then , had been only too well grounded . Guiche had found a way to cross the Rhine , after all ! God ! What a master stroke . What a superb action of gallantry it would be ! A heaven-sent opportunity , if ever there was one , for a man to distinguish himself in the field , and win his spurs before his sovereign for all the world to see .... And so he alone was to be left out of it  --  cheated of his chance for glory  --  wrapped in swaddling-clothes and kept safe from harm  --  all on account of those damned Polish envoys ! To hell with the Poles , anyhow ! What did he care for them and their paltry crown ? His comradeswere crossing the Rhine tonight without him . Without him ? Well , he 'd see about that . ' Bourgneuf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' What time did you say the King left ? ' Some hours before sunset , Your Highness . Well , let 's say about six o'clock , at a guess . ' And they were bound for my uncle 's camp ? ' Yes , Your Highness . So I was told . But indeedSix o'clock . That means they ca n't get there before nine , at the earliest  --  and it 'd have to be damned good going , at that ! Nine o'clock  --  why , it 's nearly nine now ! But the troops will need rest , and Monsieur the Prince must confer with His Majesty . They 'll hardly attack before dawn . I 've still time , I think  --  I 'm sure I have time ! ... Bourgneuf , saddle my horse at once ! ' Saddle your horse , sir ! But he is saddled  --  you 've just dismounted , sir ! ' ' Fool ! I do n't mean Pegasus . Another horse , of course ! Lord ! Of all the stupid ... ! Have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock precisely . I 'm going to get a bite to eat  --  and then we 'll see whether my uncle or I will have the last word concerninga little matter that lies between the two of us ! ' Afterwards , Longueville could scarcely recall how he spent the rest of the night . He had lost the power of connected thought , but by some dispensation his actions appeared to take care of themselves . Though he could not command them consciously , his body obeyed his inmost impulses , as if his mind had passed into his muscles . P469For instance , he did not know he was hungry , but his belly told him that he must eat  --  a hearty meal , too , for it had been long since he 'd dined , and the blazing midday heat had allowed him small appetitefor Monsieur de Luxembourg 's sumptuous repast . Then , with automaton swiftness , a change of boots  --  clean linen  --  and a quick douse of cold water on his sunburnt cheeks . No questions answered  --  there was no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do as you 're told ! ) He paused only for the briefest of interviews with Fiesque and Montchevreuil , who had been waiting in their friend 's tent to report that the Poles had sent word from Wesel that they would pay their respects in the morning . With scrupulous exactness the Duke repeated his orders for their reception , in almost the same words he had used earlier in the day . . . . After that , tired as he was  --  but was he really tired any more ? Longueville doubted it !  --  off to mount his fresh steed and gallop away into the night ... . Alone ? Of course , he was going alone ! No , not even Fiesque and the little Chevalier should come with him this time .... Lost ? Nonsense ! How could he get lost ? Why , damn it ! he could find his way to Uncle Conde 's camp blindfolded , if necessary ! Had n't he travelledit often enough in the last three days ? ... It was only a pity that he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the heat and the long hours jog-trotting on the stony highways .... Well , this roan stallion with the Roman nose was not too bad . Strange , he had never tried him before . ( Was he one of the last Norman lot ? ) While his horse carried him on at a furious pace , Longueville 's mind slid further and further into a coma . Now well beyond reasonedcerebration , one phrase kept repeating itself in his muddled head  --  later , he even found himself saying it aloud : I 'll show them  --  I 'll show them ! You see if I do n't ! ' In spite of the roan stallion 's undoubted stamina and speed , it was long after midnight before the Duke drew near his uncle 's camp . He had forgotten how dark it would be without a moon to guide him ; several times the patches of forest , insignificant by day , proved confusingenough to force him to retrace his steps and puzzle out the path . When he emerged from the shadow of the last clump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long straight stretch that led directly to the meadow opposite Tollhuis , cocks were crowing unseen in village farmyards and the sky had begun to turn grey . Stars twinkled palely remote  --  somewhere a church-tower clock struck three  --  a faint , cool breeze , surest sign of the coming dawn , blew through the reeds at the water 's edge . But now sounds of another sort started reaching his ears : the blare of trumpets , the rattle of sabres , shrill neighing of horses , an occasionalgunshot  --  loudest of any , men 's voices shouting hoarsely . P470 Longueville could not hear what they were shouting about , nor could he see what was happening , for the Rhine bent sharply here to the left , and the spit of sand forming the bend was covered by a screen of bushes and thick , untidy undergrowth . He spurred the roan stallion on to a supreme effort , crashed through the bushes he hardly knew how , and finally reached the meadow across from the fort of Tollhuis . The scene before him sent a thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn up in full battle array , as was the enemy 's on the opposite bank  --  but what was this in between them ? The river was full of dark objects  --  moving black blobs in the swift , steely greyness  --  that resolved themselves into horses with riders  --  horses nickering aloud their alarm , plunging and churning the Rhine water to muddy foam . The animals were evidentlyfrantic with fear , yet they continued to push forward towards the farther shore . To turn back was hopeless : those who did so were at once swept downstream by the force of the raging current . Longueville could see , as the light grew stronger , the Comte de Guiche on his chestnut charger at the head of the troop  --  hear his high voice screaming orders , telling the men to come on , not to be afraid ; for the water was deep for a few yards only . That was true .... In a minute or two the chestnut was already able to stand  --  soon a whole row of horses were floundering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the enemy 's guns in the fort opened fire , to be echoed by the fire of the French artillery on the heights above the German bank of the Rhine . The battle was on in earnest . Hurrah ! ' cried Longueville .... For he had not got there too late , after all . But what to do to get into it ? The roan stallion was sagging beneatheven its master 's inconsiderable weight , its sides heaving and streaked darkly with sweat ; obviously it was no longer fit to attempt the passage of the river . Longueville sprang to earth and glanced wildly about in search of a substitute . The bank on which he was standing was more and more crowded with horses jostling one anotheras their riders forced them down towards the water . By this time the advance guard had nearly all managed to get across  --  from the increased gunfire round the fort one could tell that the fighting was well under way  --  but they were being closely crowded from behindby other squadrons of the King 's Cuirassiers . Prancing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink in a last desperate endeavour to keep their footing , the heavy beasts splashed into the stream one after another , still others pressing upon them from the rear . Longueville saw no rider he knew . Help was not to be looked for here . Half crazy with rage and impatience , he began running up and down the field , wringing his hands and shouting to someone  --  to anyone ! ... But nobody noticed him . P471Suddenly a small boat shot out into the river from the sheltering thicket of bushes on the sand-spit ; it was manned by four peasants , who were pulling on their oars as hard as they could to stem the strength of the current . In the boat , standing muffled to the ears in their long military cloaks , were three officers . Even in the livid half-light Longueville recognized Enghien and Marsillac and , tallest of all in the bow , the hawk-like silhouette of his Uncle Conde . The devils ! Would they succeed in checkmating him to the very end ? ... Rapidly the boat made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cuirassiers .... Longueville hurried down to the brink once more and waved his hat to attract their attention . When that produced no result , he cupped his hands round his mouth and bawled at the top of his lungs : ' Uncle ! Uncle ! Come back !  --  or by God ! I 'll swim the river ! ' This frantic move at length took effect . Enghien , at the end of the boat nearest the shore , heard his cousin 's agonized voice topping the tumult and nudged Uncle Conde , who thereupon raised his right hand in token that he would answer the appeal . The boatmen reversedthe direction of their oars ; in a few moments the stern thrust itself in amongst the reeds , and Longueville  --  hatless , breathless , sobbing with relief  --  waded out through the shallow water and climbed aboard . There was no time for explanations , even if they could have been heard above the noise of the firing , which by now had grown heavy and fairly continuous . Longueville crouched in the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , he was there at last ! They had n't been able to cheat him of his chance . Now for a horse !  --  and he 'd be in the thick of the fray with the best of them ! .. . Bullets spattered the surface of the water  --  but it made no difference to him . He did not even take notice of the screaming horses and riders around them . A soldier , swimming so close to the boat that the Duke might have touched him , groaned as a Dutch marksman shattered one hand  --  but with the other he still kept aloft the streaming silk of his regimental banner .... How long the passage lasted , the young man neither knew nor cared . He felt rather than heard the boat grounding on the mud bank ; then , rallying all his forces , leaped to his feet and , pushing his cousin and Marsillac unceremoniouslyto one side , was ashore almost as quickly as Uncle Conde himself . It was hard to tell what was happening here . Smoke from the guns hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the battle in progress . Men on horseback galloped back and forth , drums beat , trumpets blared , Guiche went on shouting through the confusion . On the whole , it seemed that the French were in command of the situation , that enough of their soldiers to outnumber the enemy had succeeded in getting across . P472 In the other direction , however , to the right of their landing place , a small detachment of Dutch infantry appeared in a ragged , waveringline in front of a coppice of low-growing willows and alders . Their retreat to the fort having been cut off , the men were running aimlessly to and fro , obviously lacking a leader : one of their number , more intelligent than the rest , was attempting to fasten a scrap of white cloth to a stick , evidently feeling resistance to be useless . Cowardly beggars ! Would n't they even fight for their lives ? .. . ' Come , boys ! ' shouted Longueville , to the last group of Cuirassiers emerging from the water . ' Let 's cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give no quarter ! ' Looking desperately about him for a horse he could ride , he spied a groom in the Duc d'Enghien 's livery holding a smart English pony in readiness for his master 's use : they were both dripping wet , havingapparently just swum the river . Longueville did not hesitate . Heedless of his cousin 's protest and Uncle Conde 's horrified exclamation , he seized the pony 's bridle , vaulted into the saddle , and , repeatinghis cry of ' No quarter ! No quarter ! ' , dashed off at full speed towards the coppice . His long yellow hair flying in the breeze , he slashed left and right with his sword , while the Dutchmen fell back dismayed . A thunder of hoofs behind him told him that he was not alone in his adventure . ... Nearer and nearer the willows they drew .... Now Longueville could see the Dutch soldier holding the flag on a stick  --  the fellow 's eyes were wide with terror  --  he dropped the flag , flinging up both hands in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke did not care .... Faster and faster . . . . And then , without knowing how it happened , he found himself lying on his back on the spongy turf , staring up at the water weeds , whose white flowered heads nodded now , strangely , against the dawn-streaked sky , far , very far above him . The horses behind pelted by , missing his face as if by a miracle . In the distance drums went on beating , trumpets sounding , while , although he felt no pain , a great red stain spread over the white-and-gold front of His Highness 's coat . ' Spoiled a damned good uniform , ' he said lazily , to himself . ' I 'll have to dig up another for those blasted Poles .... ' And that was the last thought that Charles-Paris , Duc de Longueville , ever had . P375'OF COURSE , MY DEAR , I DO N'T PUT IT IN WORDS , ' SAID CATEAU , WI lOhad done little else for the last six weeks , but say what you will , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri is my nephew  --  naturally , that has nothing to do with the case ! But he is  --  or , rather , was , worse luck !  --  an excellent parti . You ca n't deny that . Son of a marechal of France , heir to a dukedom , colonel of his own infantry regiment , to say nothing of being governor of all those towns in Lorraine his papa turned over to him only last year  --  think of it ! Why , the Toucy 's a nobody compared to him ! Her father may have been a marechal , too ; but he came of very plain people in Picardy and had n't a penny to bless himself with . And she certainly has no beauty to boast of . Her sisters have some pretensions to looks , especiallyDoudou de Ventadour , though her figure 's a fright and I 've never been able to see what you find to admire in her complexion .

They 're married now , so I have n't a word to say . Not a solitary word . I 've kept out of the affair from beginning to end . But there are limits to even my patience . For instance , take this party Henri and his wife are giving today . It 's a matter of perfect indifference to me whether I go to it or not . To tell the truth , I 'd much rather not go .
