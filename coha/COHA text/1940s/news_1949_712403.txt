txt In simple statesmanlike words , Winston Churchill reaffirmed his confidence in the British people 's ability to win their economic Dunkirk and pledged himself to lead them again in their task if the Conservative Party is successful at next year 's election . Great Britain 's wartime Prime Minister was speaking to an evening mass meeting Oct. 14 at the London Empress Ha 11 , Earl 's Court , at the conclusion of a three-day conference of the Conservative Party . More than 10,000 Conservatives cheered Mr. Churchill in scenes of tremendous enthusiasm which echoed tl-feir veteran leader 's challenge of hope and confidence , and not despair . He gave this pledge in behalf of his party : " We will do our best for all without fear or favor , without class or party bias , without rancor or spite , but with clear and faithful simplicity as we did in the days of Dunkirk . .. . " Above all , we shall go forward without fear and with the unconquerable hope that our ancient and mighty people which , as I believe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War , are not confronted with any problem they can not solve , or with any difficulty or danger they can not overcome . " Mr. Churchill based his confidence on the great progress being made in three directions  --  unity of the British Empire , friendship with the United States , and unity of western Europe . Crusade Against Waste He congratulated the Conservative conference on having in its deliberations reached the conclusion that these three were not contradictory or divergent objectives , but could in conjunction " carry through that great social evolution which has covered the lifetime of the oldest of us here , namely the bringing forward of ever larger numbers of mankind to an ever more bountiful table of moral and material rewards . " Here was the old and welltried Churchillian leadership shining out again . It worked like magic on 10,000 Conservatives . But how in more precise detail could he save Britain 's economic exictence which , in his estimate , the Labor government is so lamentably failing to do ? Mr. Churchill declared he would offer no easy path for Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hundred million pounds a year could be saved from the wasteful and needless expenditure now going on in Britain on all sides . He cited extravagances of state farming and losses of nationalized industries and bureaucratic hindrances to private enterprise . More detailed economies , he said , could not be given without knowledge and control of the machinery of state , which the Conservatives did not have as yet . As sometimes happens , Mr. Churchill was wobbly on some of his economics . He does n't like them and leaves them to his advisors . But he made an effective answer to Prime Minister Clement R. Attlee 's claims that the Labor government has provided Britain with full employment as no other government could have done . Claims Credit for Jobs Mr. Churchill recalled that in 1944 , when he was Prime Minister of the national government , he appointed a committee to inquire into ways of preventing unemployment after the war . Leading Socialists like Messrs . Attlee and Herbert Morrison were members of that committee , which decided there would be no problems of general unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the greatest danger to the living standards of the British workingman was not from Conservative economies but from social extravagance , which has led to devaluation of the pound which meant a cut in the value of all social services . He had his usual lapse into sheer invective against the Labor government ? " The driving force of socialism is class hatred and envy . " He raised roars of laughter with his description of state-subsidized houses with rents too high for poorer people . But those poorer people , he said , had to pay their taxes and rates which meant they were subsidizing the state houses for richer people to live in . But on balance it was a more restrained and constructive speech than several of Mr. Churchill 's recent ones . For those who are looking for a detailed policy , it was a disappointment . For those yearning for leadership , it was an inspiration . Mr. Churchill put the Conservative Party in good heart for the coming electoral contest .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
