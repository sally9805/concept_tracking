At the age of four , hollow-eyed little Pessel Fachler weighed only 27 pounds . Born in Siberia , to which her Polish parents had fled to escape the Nazis , Pessel had been harried across Europe with her mother and grandmothers , ended up at war 's end in a Berlin refugee camp . Half-starved and bloated with edema , her puny body had withstood pneumonia , whooping cough , heart disease and tuberculosis . <P> U.N . ' s International Children 's Emergency Fund was doing what it could to help Pessel herself , but there were millions like her for whom it could do nothing . Broadcast through many of the world 's radio stations , a recorded wail from little Pessel 's scarred lungs was sounding last week , an anguished plea for help to these others . <P> The United Nations Appeal for Children , the worldwide campaign which Pessel 's cry served to open , was conceived by Norway 's tall , blue-eyed , idealistic U.N . Staffer Aake Ording , to fill a gap left by the world 's governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed down , member nations of the U.N . created I.C.E.F to carry on its work for children . U.N . experts figured that it would need at least $450 million to care for an estimated 20 million semi-starved and rachitic waifs for a year . The money finally assigned to I.C.E.F. amounted to only $39 million , scarcely enough to feed 4,000,000 children for six months , and with no provision whatever for medical needs . <P> In cooperation with over 20 member organizations of American Overseas Aid , Ording 's United Nations Appeal has turned to the citizens of 45 nations for extra funds . Throughout the world the campaign would reach a climax on Feb. 29 with a leap year appeal for every citizen to give the extra day 's earnings . The committee , whose International Advisory Board is headed by former OPAster Chester Bowles , hopes to gather $60 million in the U.S. alone . A third of this would go directly to I.C.E.F. The rest would be divided among the Overseas Aid group agencies , including Quakers , Catholic Welfare Conference , A.F.L. and C.I.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , Bowles boosted the impartial character of the U.N . drive , poked at U.S. ( and Soviet ) aid programs as " political " : " Recipients are bitter at having to swallow the hammer &; sickle or the American eagle . . . . " It was a bumbling beginning , but the American people , whose tax dollars had provided billions of unconditional foreign aid , could be expected to chip in again .
