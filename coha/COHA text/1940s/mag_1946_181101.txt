Trim , glib , tireless Mrs. Katharine St. George would not be downed . Her opponent for the Republican Congressional nomination in New York 's farmerish , four-county 29th District was earnest , colorless Lawyer Augustus Bennet . As a Good-Government candidate in 1944 , quasi-Republican Bennet had unseated Republican Ham Fish . Mrs. St. George , who takes her Party straight , had a low opinion of him . <P> From the start of her campaign , chic Mrs. St. George awed her constituents . She drove 200 miles and met 75 people a day , dined Republican leaders , spoke every other night . Her platform vibrated with promises of jobs and homes for veterans , hope for farmers and love for labor 's hard-won gains . " The ultimate goal , " said she , " is to have every union member a capitalist . " <P> The night she crossed words with her opponent in fashionable Tuxedo Park 's Masonic Temple , Gus Bennet extolled the value of public debate , citing for example the Lincoln-Douglas series . Purred Mrs. St. George : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not continually comparing themselves to the Great Emancipator . " <P> After that night , Mrs. St. George stopped worrying . A first-string hostess of Tuxedo , a first cousin of Franklin Roosevelt , a member of the board of governors of the Women 's National Republican Club , vice president of the St. George Coal Co. and an expert rider , she was politically irresistible . What 's more , Ham Fish was 100% for her , and down in the bottom of its heart , the 29th District still liked Ham . <P> When the dangers of too much Fish support became noticeable around election time , Mrs. St. George declared : " Nobody can pin a Fish label on me . Ham Fish would support a wooden Indian against Bennet . " Then she went on to carry all but one of her counties .
