POLISH WACS IN THE U.S. <P> These six young women , who have already learned how to cross their legs for U.S. photographers , call themselves Pestkas . Sent here by the Polish Government in Exile ( loudly denounced by the Soviet Union as fascist ) , they have worked behind the lines with Polish troops in the Middle East . When they arrived in New York last week they headed straight for a coiffeur , then shopped for stockings , cosmetics , lingerie . Next stop : Buffalo 's Polish colony .
