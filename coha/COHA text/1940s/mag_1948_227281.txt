Last week in Chicago , the International Typographical Union 's strike against the city 's five dailies ( TIME , Dec. 1 , 1947 et seq. ) was a year old , and still going strong . The strike had cost the 1,500 striking printers some $7,000,000 in wages , partly made up by $4,582,113 in strike benefits from I.T.U. What it had cost the newspapers , which had converted from Linotypes to Vari-Typers , they were n't saying . Best guess on the strike 's duration : until Congress amends or repeals the Taft-Hartley Act . The I.T.U. hopes it will then get back its traditional closed shop .
