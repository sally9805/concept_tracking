DRIVE IN THE COUNTRY A Story GRAHAM GREE1VE A s EVERY other night she listened to her father going round the house , locking the doors and windows . He was head clerk at Bergson 's Export Agency , and lying in bed she would think with dislike that his home was like his office , run on the same lines , its safety preserved with the same meticulous care , so that he could present a faithful steward 's account to the managing director . Regularly every Sunday he presented the account , accompanied by his wife and two daughters , in the little neo-Gothic church in Park Road . They always had the same pew , they were always five minutes early , and her father sang loudly with no sense of tune , holding an out-size prayer book on the level of his eyes , " Singing songs of exultation " ? he was presenting the week 's account ( one household duly safeguarded ) ? " marching to the Promised Land . " When they came out of church , she looked carefully away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Fred always stood , a little lit because the Arms had been open for half an hour , with his air of unbalanced exaltation . She listened : the back door closed , she could hear the catch of the kitchen window click , and the restless pad of his feet going back to try the front door . It was n't only the outside doors he locked : he locked the empty rooms , the bathroom , the lavatory . He was locking something out but obviously it was something capable of penetrating his first defenses . He raisedhis second line all the way up to bed . She laid her ear against the thin wall of the jerry-built villa and could hear the faint voices from the neighboring room ; as she listened they came clearer as though she were turning the screw of a wireless set . Her mother said " ... margarine in the cooking . . . " and her father said cc . . . much easier in fifteen years . " Then the bed creaked and there were dim sounds of tenderness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fifteen years , she thought unhappily , the house will be his ; he had paid twenty-five pounds down and the rest he was paying month by month as rent . " Of course , " he was in the habit of saying after a good meal , " I 've improved the property , " and he expected at least one of them to follow him into his study . " I 've wired this room for power , " he padded back past the little downstairs lavatory , " this radiator , " the final stroke of satisfaction , " the garden , " and if it were a fine evening he would fling the French window of the dining room open on the little carpet of grass as carefully kept as a college lawn . " A pile of bricks , " he 'd say , " that 's all it was . " Five years of Saturday afternoons and fine Sundays had gone into the patch of turf , the surrounding flower bed , the one apple tree which regularly produced one crimson tasteless apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've improved the property , " looking round for a nail to .1 drive in , a weed to be uprooted . " If we had to sell now , we should get more than I 've paid back from the society . " It was more than a sense of property , it was a sense of honesty . Some people who bought their houses through the society let them go to rack and ruin and then cleared out . She stood with her ear against the wall , a small , dark , furious , immature figure . There was no more to be heard from the other room ; but in her inner ear she still heard the chorus of a property owner , the tap-tap of a hammer , the scrape of a spade , the whistle of radiator steam , a key turning , a bolt pushed home , the little trivial sounds of men building barricades . She stood planning her treachery . It was a quarter past ten ; she had an hour in which to leave the house , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to fear . They had played their usual rubber of three-handed bridge while her sister altered a dress for the local " hop " next night ; after the rubber she had boiled a kettle and brought in a pot of tea ; then she had filled the hot-water bottles and put them in the beds while her father locked up . He had no idea whatever that she was an enemy . She put on a hat and a heavy coat because it was still cold at night ; the spring was late that year , as her father commented , watching for the buds on the apple tree . She did n't pack a suitcase ; that would have reminded her too much of weekends at the sea , a family expedition to Ostend from all of which one returned ; she wanted to match the odd reckless quality of Fred 's mind . This time she was n't going to return . She went softly downstairs into the little crowded hall , unlocked the door . All was quiet upstairs , and she closed the door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt because she could n't lock it from the outside . But it had vanished by the time she reached the end of the crazy-paved path and turned to the left down the road which after five years was still half-made , past the gaps between the villas where the wounded fields remained grimly alive in the form of thin grass and heaps of clay and dandelions . She walked fast , passing a long line of little garages like the graves in a Portuguese cemetery where the coffin lies forever below the fading photograph of its occupant . The cold night air touched her with exhilaration . She was ready for anything , as she turned by the Belisha beacon into the shuttered shopping street ; she was like a recruit in the first months of a war . The choice made she could surrender her will to the strange , the exhilarating , the gigantic event . RE ? , as he had promised , was at the corner where the road turned down toward the church ; she could taste the spirit on his lips as they kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so adequately matched the occasion ; his face was bright and reckless in the lamplight , he was as exciting and strange to her as the adventure . He took her arm and ran her into a blind unlighted alley , then left her for a moment until two headlamps beamed softly at her out of the cavern . She cried with astonishment , " You 've got a car ? " and felt the jerk of his nervous hand urging her toward it . " Yes , " he said , " do you like it ? " grinding into second gear , changing clumsily into top as they came out between the shuttered windows . She said , " It 's lovely . Let 's drive a long way . " " We will , " he said , watching the speedometer needle go quivering to forty-five . " Does it mean you 've got a job ? " " There are no jobs , " he said , " they do n't exist any more than the Dodo . Did you see that bird ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the turning to the housing estate and quite suddenly came out into the country between a cafe ( " Draw in here " ) , a boot-shop ( " Buy the shoes worn by your favorite film star " ) , and an undertaker 's with a large white angel lit by a Neon light . " I did n't see any bird . " " Not flying at the windscreen ? " " No . " " I nearly hit it , " he said . " It would have made a mess . Bad as those fellows who run someone down and do n't stop . Should we stop ? " he asked , turning out his switchboard light so that they could n't see the needle vibrate downwards to sixty . " Whatever you say , " she said , sitting deep in a reckless dream . " You going to love me tonight ? " " Of course I am . " " Never going back there ? " " No , " she said , abjuring the tap of hammer , the click of latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want to know where we are going ? " " No . " A little flat cardboard copse ran forward into the green light and darkly by . A rabbit turned its scut and vanished into a hedge . He said , " Have you any money ? " " Half a crown . " " Do you love me ? " For a long time she expended on his lips all she had patiently had to keep in reserve , looking the other way on Sunday mornings , saying nothing when his name came up at meals with disapproval . She expended herself against dry unresponsive lips as the car leaped ahead and his foot trod down on the accelerator . He said , " It 's the hell of a life . " She echoed him , " The hell of a life . " He said , " There 's a bottle in my pocket . Have a drink . " " I do n't want one . " " Give me one then . It has a screw top , " and with one hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that she could pour a little whisky into his mouth out of the quarter bottle . " Do you mind ? " he said . " Of course I do n't mind . " " You ca n't save , " he said , " on ten shillings a week pocket-money . I lay it out the best I can . It needs a hell of a lot of thought . To give variety . Half a crown on Weights . Three and six on whisky . A shilling on the pictures . That leaves three shillings for beer . I take my fun once a week and get it over . " The whisky had dribbled on to his tie and the smell filled the small coupe . It pleased her . It was his smell . He said , " They grudge it me . They think I ought to get a job . When you 're that age you do n't realize there are n't any jobs for some of us  --  any more forever . " " I know , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked abruptly ; the bright glare swept the road ahead of them clean of small scurrying animals . " She 's going to the hop tomorrow . I wonder where we shall be . " He would n't be drawn ; he had his own idea and kept it to himself . " I 'm loving this . " He said , " There 's a club out this way . At a roadhouse . Mick made me a member . Do you know Mick ? " " No . " " Mick 's all right . If they know you , they 'll serve you drinks till midnight . We 'll look in there . Say hullo to Mick . And then in the morning  --  we 'll decide that later when we 've had a few drinks . " " Have you the money ? " A small village , a village fast asleep already behind closed doors and windows , sailed down the hill toward them as if it were being carried smoothly by a landslide into the scarred plain from which they 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign , a clock striking eleven . He said , " Look in the back . There 's a suitcase there . " " It 's locked . " " I forgot the key , " he said . " What 's in it ? " " A few things , " he said vaguely . " We could pop them for drinks . " " What about a bed ? " " There 's the car . You are not scared , are you ? " " No , " she said . " I 'm not scared . This is .. . " but she had n't words for the damp cold wind , the darkness , the strangeness , the smell of whisky and the rushing car . " It moves , " she said . " We must have gone a long way already . This is real country , " seeing an owl sweep low on furry wings over a plowed field . " You 've got to go farther than this for real country , " he said . " You wo n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadhouse soon . " HE discovered in herself a nostalgia for their dark windy solitary progress . She said , " Need we go to the club ? Ca n't we go farther into the country ? " He looked sideways at her ; he had always been open to any suggestion : like some meteorological instrument , he was only made for the winds to blow through . " Of course , " he said , " anything you like . " He did n't give the club a second thought ; they swept past it a moment later , a long 111100111111110011 lit Tudor bungalow , a crash of voices , a bathing-pool filled for some reason with hay . It was immediately behind them , a patch of light whipping round a corner out of sight . He said , " I suppose this is country now . They none of them get farther than the club . We 're quite alone now . We could lie in these fields till doomsday as far as they are concerned , though I suppose a plowman . .. if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the accelerator and let the car 's speed gradually diminish . Somebody had left a wooden gate open into a field and he turned the car in ; they jolted a long way down the field beside the hedge and came to a standstill . He turned out the headlamps and they sat in the tiny glow of the switchboard light . " Peaceful , " he said uneasily ; and they heard a screech owl hunting overhead and a small rustle in the hedge where something went into hiding . They belonged to the city ; they had n't a name for anything round them ; the tiny buds breaking in the bushes were nameless . He nodded at a group of dark trees at the hedge end . " Oaks ? " " Elms ? " she asked and their mouths went together in a mutual ignorance . The touch excited her ; she was ready for the most reckless act ; but from his mouth , the dry spirituous lips , she gained a sense that he was less excited than he had hoped to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be here  --  miles away from anyone we know . " " I dare say Mick 's there . Down the road . " " Does he know ? " " Nobody knows . " She said , " That 's how I wanted it . How did you get this car ? " He grinned at her with wild unbalanced amusement . " I saved from the ten shil-lings . " " No , but how ? Did someone lend it you ? " 4cyes , , he said . He suddenly pushed the door open and said , " Let 's take a walk . " " We 've never walked in the country before . " She took his arm , and she could feel the tense nerves responding to her touch . It was what she liked ; she could n't tell what he would do next . She said , " My father calls you crazy . I like you crazy . What 's all this stuff ? " kicking at the ground . " Clover , " he said , " is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like being in a foreign city where you ca n't understand the names on shops , the traffic signs : nothing to catch hold of , to hold you down to this and that , adrift together in a dark vacuum . " Should n't you turn on the headlamps ? " she said . " It wo n't be so easy finding our way back . There 's not much moon . " Already they seemed to have gone a long way from the car ; she could n't see it clearly any longer . " We 'll find our way , " he said . " Somehow . Do n't worry . " At the hedge end they came to the trees . He pulled a twig down and felt the sticky buds . " What is it ? Beech ? " " I do n't know . " He said , " If it had been warmer , we could have slept out here . You 'd think we might have had that much luck , tonight of all nights . But it 's cold and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer , " but he did n't answer . Some other wind had blown , she could tell it , and already he had lost interest in her . There was something hard in his pocket ; it hurt her side ; she put her hand in . The metal chamber had absorbed all the cold there had been in the windy ride . She whispered fearfully , " Why are you carrying that ? " She had always before drawn a line round his recklessness . When her father had said he was crazy she had secretly and possessively smiled because she thought she knew the extent of his craziness . Now , while she waited for him to answer her , she could feel his craziness go on and on and out of her reach , out of her sight ; she could n't see where it ended ; it had no end , she could n't possess it any more than she could possess a darkness or a desert . " Do n't be scared , " he said . " I did n't mean you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had ever been ; he put his hand on her breast ; it came from his fingers , a great soft meaningless flood of tenderness . He said . " Do n't you see ? Life 's hell . There 's nothing we can do . " He spoke very gently , but she had never been more aware of his recklessness : he was open to every wind , but the wind now seemed to have set from the east : it blew like sleet through his words . " I have n't a penny , " he said . " We ca n't live on nothing . It 's no good hoping that I 'll get a job . " He repeated , " There are n't any more jobs any more . And every year , you know , there 's less chance , because there are more people younger than I am . " " But why , " she said , " have we come ? ? ? r He became softly and tenderly lucid . " We do love each other , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no good hanging around , is it , waiting for our luck to change ? We do n't even get a fine night , " he said , feeling for rain with his hand . " We can have a good time tonight ? in the car  --  and then  --  in the morning . . . " " No , no , " she said . She tried to get away from him . " I could n't . It 's horrible . I never said . . . " " You would n't feel anything , " he said gently and inexorably . Her words , she could realize now , had never made any real impression ; he was swayed by them , but no more than he was swayed by anything : now that the wind had set , it was like throwing scraps of paper towards the sky to speak at all , or to argue . He said , " Of course we neither of us believe in God , but there may be a chance , and it 's company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's a gamble , " and she remembered more occasions than she could count when their last coppers had gone ringing down in slot machines . H E PULLED her closer and said with complete assurance , " We love each other . It 's the only way , you know You can trust me . " He was like a skilled logician ; he knew all the stages of the argument . She despaired at catching him out on any point but the premise : we love each other . That she doubted for the first time , faced by the mercilessness of his egotism . He repeated , " It will be company . " She said , " There must be some way . . . . " " Why must ? " MAGAZINE " Otherwise people would be doing it all the time  --  everywhere ! " " They are , " he said triumphantly , as if it were more important for him to find his argument flawless than to find  --  well , a way , a way to go on living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He whispered gently , endearingly , as if he thought the very sound of the words tender enough to dispel all fear . " They call it a suicide pact . It 's happening all the time . " " I could n't . I have n't the nerve . " " You need n't do anything , " he said . " I 'll do it all . " His calmness horrified her . " You mean ? you 'd kill me ? " He said , " / love you enough for that . I promise it wo n't hurt you . " He might have been persuading her to play some trivial and uncongenial game . " We shall be together always . " He added rationally , " Of course , if there is an always , " and suddenly she saw his love as a mere flicker of gas flame playing on the marshy depth of his irresponsibility . She had loved his irresponsibility , but now she realized that it was without any limit at all ; it closed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can sell . That suitcase . " She knew that he was watching her with amusement , that he had rehearsed all her arguments and had an answer ; he was only pretending to take her seriously . " We might get fifteen shillings , " he said . " We could live a day on that  --  but we should n't have much fun . " " The things inside it ? " " Ah , that 's another gamble . They might be worth thirty shillings . Three days , that would give us  --  with economy . " " We might get a job . " " I 've been trying for a good many years now . " " Is n't there the dole ? " " I 'm not an insured worker . I 'm one of the ruling class . " " Your people , they 'd give us some-thing . " " But we 've got our pride , have n't we " he said with remorseless conceit . " The man who lent you the car ? " He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've burned mine . I 've got to kill myself . You see , I stole that car . We 'd be stopped in the next town . It 's too late even to go back . " He laughed ; he had reached the climax of his argument and there was nothing more to dispute about . She could tell that he was perfectly satisfied and perfectly happy . It infuriated her . " You 've got to , maybe . But I have n't . Why should I kill myself ? What right have you . . . ? " She dragged herself away from him and felt against her back the rough massive trunk of the living tree . " Oh , " he said in an irritated tone , " of course if you like to go on without me . " She had admired his conceit ; he had always carried his unemployment with a manner . Now you could no longer call it conceit : it was a complete lack of any values . " You can go home , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't drive you back because I 'm staying here . You 'll be able to go to the hop tomorrow night . And there 's a whist-drive , is n't there , in the church hail ? My dear , I wish you joy of home . " T HERE was a savagery in his manner . He took security , peace , order in his teeth and worried them so that she could n't help feeling a little pity for what they had joined in despising : a hammer tapped at her heart , driving in a nail here and a nail there . She tried to think of a bitter retort , for after all there was something to be said for the negative virtues of doing no injury , of simply going on , as her father was going on for another fifteen years . But the next moment she felt no anger . They had trapped each other . He had always wanted this : the dark field , the weapon in his pocket , the escape and gamble ; and she less honestly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe love , danger and a secure heart . He said , " I 'm going now . Are you coming ? " " No , " she said . He hesitated ; the recklessness for a moment wavered ; a sense of something lost and bewildered came to her through the dark . She wanted to say : Do n't be a fool . Leave the car where it is . Walk back with me , and we 'll get a lift home , but she knew any thought of hers had occurred to him and been answered already : ten shillings a week , no job , getting older . Endurance was a virtue of one 's fathers . He suddenly began to walk fast down the hedge ; he could n't see where he was going ; he stumbled on a root and she heard him swear . " Damnation " ? the little commonplace sound in the darkness overwhelmed her with pain and horror . She cried out , " Fred . Fred . Do n't do it , " and began to run in the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out of hearing . A twig broke under her foot like a shot , and the owl screamed across the plowed field beyond the hedge . It was like a rehearsal with sound effects . But when the real shot came it was quite different : a thud like a gloved hand striking a door and no cry at all . She did n't notice it at first and afterward she thought that she had never been conscious of the exact moment when her lover ceased to exist . She bruised herself against the car , running blindly ; a blue-spotted Woolworth handkerchief lay on the seat in the light of the switchboard bulb . She nearly took it , but no , she thought , no one must know that I have been here . She turned out the light and picked her way as quietly as she could across the clover . She could begin to be sorry when she was safe . She wanted to close a door behind her , thrust a bolt down , hear the catch grip . I T WASS'T ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tipsy voices spoke a foreign language , though it was the language Fred had spoken . She could hear the clink of coins in slot machines , the hiss of soda ; she listened to these sounds like an enemy , planning her escape . They frightened her like something mindless : there was no appeal one could make to that egotism . U was simply a want to be satisfied ; it gaped at her like a mouth . A man was trying to wind up his car ; the selfstarter would n't work . He said , " I 'm a Bolshie . Of course I 'm a Bolshie . I believe ? " A thin girl with red hair sat on the step and watched him . " You 're all wrong , " she said . " I 'm a Liberal Conservative . " " You ca n't be a liberal Conservative . " " Do you love me ? " " I love Joe . " " You ca n't love Joe . " " Let 's go home , Mick . " The man tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them as if she 'd come out of the club and said , " Give me a lift ? " " Course . Delighted . Get in . " " Wo n't the car go ? " " No . " " Have you flooded ? ? " " Tha 's an idea . " He lifted the bonnet and she pressed the self-starter . It began to rain slowly and heavily and drenchingly , the kind of rain you always expect to fall on graves , and her thoughts went dawn the lane towards the field , the hedge , the trees  --  oak , beech , elm ? She imagined the rain on his face , the pool collecting in each eye-socket and streaming down on either side the nose . But she could feel nothing but gladness because she had escaped from him . " Where are you going ? " she said . " Devizes . " " I thought you might be going to London . " " Where do you want to go to ? " " Golding 's Park . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick . It 's raining . " " Are n't you coming ? " " I 'm going to find Joe . " " All right . " He smashed his way out of the little car park , bending his mudguard on a wooden post , scraping the paint of another car . " That 's the wrong way , " she said . " We 'll turn . " He backed the car into a ditch and out again . " Was a good party , " he said . The rain came down harder ; it blinded the windscreen and the electric wiper would n't work , but her companion did n't care . He drove straight on at forty miles an hour ; it was an old car , it would n't do any more ; it leaked through the hood . He said , " Twis ' that knob . Have a tune , " and when she turned it and the dance music came through , he said , " That 's Harry Roy . Know him anywhere , " driving into the thick wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " A friend of mine , one of the best , you 'd know him , Peter Weatherall . You know him . " . ? No. , , " You must know Peter . Have n't seen him about lately . Goes off on the drink for weeks . They sent out an SOS for Peter once in the middle of the dance music . Missing from Home . ' We were in the car . We had a laugh about that . " She said , " Is that what people do  --  when people are missing ? " " Know this tune , " he said . " This is n't Harry Roy . This is Alf Cohen . " She said suddenly , " You 're Mick , are n't you ? Would n't you Iend ? " He sobered up . " Stony broke , " he said . " Comrades in misfortune . Try Peter . Why do you want to go to Golding 's Park ? " " My home . " " You mean you live there ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a speed limit here . " He was perfectly obedient . He raised his foot and let the car crawl at fifteen miles an hour . The lamp standards marched unsteadily to meet them and lit his face : he was quite old , forty if a day , ten years older than Fred . He wore a striped tie and she could see his sleeve was frayed . He had more than ten shillings a week , but perhaps not so very much more . His hair was going thin . " You can drop me here , " she said . He stopped the car and she got out and the rain went on . He followed her on to the road . " Let me come ? " he said . She shook her head ; the rain wetted them through ; behind her was the pillar-box , the Belisha beacon , the road through the housing estate . " Hell of a life , " he said politely , holding her hand , while the rain drummed on the hood of the cheap car and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie . But she felt no pity , no attraction , only a faint horror and repulsion . A kind of dim recklessness gleamed in his wet eye , as the hot music of Alf Cohen 's band streamed from the car , a faded irresponsibility . " Le 's go back , " he said , " le 's go somewhere . Le 's go for a ride in the country . Le 's go to Maidenhead , " holding her hand limply . HE pulled it away , he did n't resist , and walked down the half-made road to No. 64 . The crazy paving in the front garden seemed to hold her feet firmly up . She opened the door and heard through the dark and the rain a car grind into second gear and drone away  --  certainly not toward Maidenhead or Devizes or the country . Another wind must have blown . Her father called down from the first landing : " Who 's there ? " " It 's me , " she said . She explained , " I had a feeling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? " " No , " she said gently , " it 's bolted all right , " driving the bolt softly and nrmly home . She waited till his door closed ; she touched the radiator to warm her fingers  --  he had put it in himself , he had improved the property ; in fifteen years , she thought , it will be ours . She was quite free from pain , listening to the rain on the roof ; he had been over the whole roof that winter inch by inch ; there was nowhere for the rain to enter . It was kept outside drumming on the shabby hood , pitting the clover field . She stood by the door feeling only the faint repulsion she always had for things weak and crippled , thinking , " It is n't tragic at all , " and looking down with an emotion like tenderness at the flimsy bolt from a sixpenny store any man could have broken , but which a Man had put in , the head clerk of Bergson 's . The Simple and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the direct insight of the mystics and the reasonings of the philosophers percolated to the mass of the people by authority and tradition ; they could be received by those who were no great reasoners themselves in the concrete form of myth and ritual and the whole pattern of life . In the conditions produced by a century or so of Naturalism , plain men are being forced to bear burdens which plain men were never expected to bear before . We must get the truth for ourselves or go without it . There may be two explanations for this . It might be that humanity , in rebelling against tradition and authority , has made a ghastly mistake ; a mistake which will not be the less fatal because the corruptions of those in authority rendered it very excusable . On the other hand , it may be that the Power which rules our species is at this moment carrying out a daring experiment . Could it be intended that the whole mass of the people should now move forward and occupy for themselves those heights which were once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple to disappear because all are now expected to become wise ? If so , our present blunderings would be but growing pains . But let us make no mistake about our necessities . If we are content to go back and become humble plain men obeying a tradition , well . If we are ready to climb and struggle on until we become sages ourselves , better still . But the man who will neither obey wisdom in others nor adventure for her himself is fatal . A society where the simple many obey the few seers can live : a society where all were seers could live even more fully . But a society where the mass is still simple and the seers are no longer attended to can achieve only superficiality , baseness , ugliness , and in the end extinction .
