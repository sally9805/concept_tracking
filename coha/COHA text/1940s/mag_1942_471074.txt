What set him off sharply from many of the other correspondents was his failure to find spiritual exhilaration in the internal progress of affairs in the Soviet Union and the relentless way in which he fixed his attention on the day-to-day facts of life in Europe and their progressive deterioration as the years went by . Many of these facts of.life he has discussed in Harper 's , as , for example , in " Europe 's Revolt Against Civilization " in December , 1940 . His attitude toward his own country is reflected in the last paragraph of the present article . Mr. Chamberlin is the author of three books about Soviet Russia including the elaborately detailed The Russian Revolution , 1917-1921 . He has written also Japan Over Asia , The Confessions of an Individualist , and The World 's Iron Age . the last-named was published only a few weeks ago . PAVING FOR TUE WAR WHAT happened to all the Liberty Bonds that people subscribed for at the exhortation of Mary Pickford and Doug Fairbanks and hundreds of less well-known names ? Remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the country schoolhouses ? A lot of the bonds were sold in the post-war depression , a lot more were pledged to start playing the market ; most of the bonds ? aside from those which were held by banks , insurance companies , corporations , and other institutions ? ended up in the hands of relatively few people . in " How to Pay for the War " Peter F. Drucker sets forth the whole complex problem of financing this war , and especially argues against letting the war debt accumulate in the hands of the rich . The discussion , in a sense , is part of a series , following his " Must a War Economy Be Permanent ? " and " We Must Accept Rationing , " published in recent months . Mr. Drucker is Professor of Economics at Sarah Lawrence College . He came to the United States several years ago as correspondent for a group of British papers .

PILLAR TO POST o NE Jump Ahead of the Gestapo " is a chapter from a book by Patrick Maitland in which the author describes his experiences as a newspaper correspondent in Eastern Europe . Until recently the Washington correspondent of the London News-Chronicle , he may right now be on his way to the Far East with the armed forces , still trying to be one jump ahead . His life during the past few years has been a **53;27;TOOLONG sort of existence . He claims to be the only person who personally witnessed all the phases of the war in East Europe from Munich to the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Russia .

MY NOTES ! ccow Not to Write History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Reveille in Washington , the best-seller volume about what happened in the national capital during the Civil War . Anyone who has everengaged in a task similar to Miss Leech 's will feel the old pangs again when he reads this article . The question of the notes : when one has worked for several years over a project these notes get to have a singularly precious quality . The thought of throwing them away is unthinkable . Little by little , however , the truth sinks home ; the notes have fulfilled their usefulness and are now just junk . Miss Leech , who in private life is Mrs. Ralph Pulitzer , has written short stories , a couple of novels , and , with the late Heywood Broun , a life of Anthony Comstock . Incidentally , this book , published in 1927 , was the first book taken by the Literary Guild after they set up for business .

N " The Dunne Boys of Minneapolis " Dale I Kramer has traced the course of one of the fabulous chapters in American labor history . Mr. Kramer knows the scene very well for in the days when the Dunnes were just getting their truckers ' union under Way he was active in the Farm Labor Party in Minnesota . He says , " I guess it would be correct to say that I was one of the younger leaders . Officially I was State Miller ? manager of the Minnesota State Mill ? but I assisted Governor Benson with his farm speeches and some others and directed our farm campaign .

The kiting of British taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of a number of prominent union people . to important political jobs have given a vague impression of socialism moving in overnight . Mr. Durbin 's analysis helps to clear the vagueness away . ( The statement that there are fewer than a hundred persons left in Great Britain with as much as ? 5,000 of income left to spend is startling . Sterling is about $4.03 now . ) Mr. Durbin is Senior Lecturer on International Relations in the London School of Economics .

Margaret Bourke-White , author of " A Photographer in Moscow , " is one of the best-known American photographers . Early in 1941 she went to Russia with her husband , Erskine Caldwell , and they were there when war between Germany and Russia broke out .

BEE MAN etoyart Christowe 's story " Good Neigh-bors " recalls the old American saw , " You can always trust a bee man . " A farmer went to Cornell one summer to take a short course in apiculture and reported that he had never seen a collection of such sincere persons as those who gathered for the session . " Absolutely harmless , " he said , " and most of them had beards . ' Still , Sherlock Holmes wound up his career as a beekeeper on the Sussex downs . Mr. Christowe was born in Macedonia in 1898 and his experiences with beekeeping were during his boyhood there when Macedonia was a province of the Ottoman Empire . Recently he has been able to revive his interest ; he keeps bees on his Vermont farm . He says : " The incident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neighbors ' made such a powerful impression on me that it has stayed with me all these years . On recent visits to the Balkans as foreign correspondent I have seen many hives such as I describe in the story and I know there is no other way they can get the honey from those hives save by killing the bees . " Mr. Christowe came to America when he was fourteen , worked in factories and foundries in St. Louis , and later on railway construction gangs in Montana and Wyoming . After four years at Valparaiso University he worked at various jobs in Chicago and New York and then , in 1927 , went to the Balkans as correspondent for the Chicago Daily News .

We have been unable to discover who was responsible for reviving this South African term for use during the present war . It may have been Mr. Churchill , who came close enough to the Boers to be jailed by them in 1899 . In those days a commando was the administrative and tactical unit of the forces of the Boer republics .
