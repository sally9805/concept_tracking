Playing music for the movies and radio is like driving in traffic ; everything depends on the red &; green lights of the script . Four years ago , tired of stop- &-start; performances , a group of Hollywood 's best studio musicians organized their own symphony orchestra . Last week , their Santa Monica Civic Symphony Orchestra , with Jacques Rachmilovich conducting , made its recording debut with Aram Khachaturian 's Masquerade Suite ( Asch , 5 sides ) . Although it has little of the pounding , rhythmic vigor of the Soviet composer 's later Gayne Ballet Suite ( TIME , March 24 ) , this graceful reflection of a glittering Imperial Russian ballroom makes smooth and pleasant listening . Dmitri Kabalevsky , another Soviet up- &-comer,; gets a single side in the album with a galloping Fete Populaire . Both performances are excellent . <P> Other releases of the month : <P> Prokofiev : Symphony No. 5 ( Boston Symphony Orchestra , Serge Koussevitzky conducting ; Victor , 10 sides ) . A highly polished version of one of the decade 's chief musical achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiere in November 1945 . Performance : excellent . <P> Prokofiev : Piano Concerto No. 3 ( Robin Hood Dell Orchestra , Dimitri Mitropoulos conducting and at the piano ; Columbia , 6 sides ) . An early opus-started in 1917 , completed in 1921-which lacks the composer 's later lyricism , is difficult to play and almost as difficult to take . Performance : good . <P> Handel-Beecham : The Great Elopement ( London Philharmonic Orchestra , Sir Thomas Beecham conducting ; Victor , 6 sides ) . The latest of five suites culled by Sir Thomas from little-known music of Handel makes a charming period piece for ballet and listeners alike . <P> Mozart : Quartet in E Flat Major for piano and strings ( George Szell , piano , with members of the Budapest String Quartet ; Columbia , 6 sides ) . Although not one of his great quartets , this delightful , sparkling slice of Mozart is almost a miniature piano concerto . The Cleveland Orchestra 's conductor gives a crisp but playful assist at the piano . Performance : excellent . <P> Samuel Barber : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Concert Hall Society , 4 sides ) . Scored in Bach 's concerto grosso style for flute , oboe and trumpet solo plus strings , it smacks more of Stravinsky than Bach , has a sensuous eeriness typical of some of Barber 's later works . <P> The Gordian Knot Untied suite of Henry Purcell , Britain 's earliest major composer ( circa 1659-95 ) , makes a delightful companion album by the same orchestra ( 4 sides ) . Both performances : excellent . <P> Hovhaness and Cage : Piano Compositions ( Maro Ajemian at the piano with Alan Hovhaness assisting at piano , gong and drums ; Disc , 4 sides ) . Hovhaness composes with ancient Armenian instruments ( tar , kanoon , oud and saz ) in mind , achieves a marimba-like effect on Jie piano which is near-hypnotic in its insistence on repeated notes . Maro Ajemian performs John Cage 's Amores , I &; IV on a Cage " prepared piano " ( TIME , Feb. 22 , 1943 ) which gives off intriguing thwacking sounds , graduated in pitch and timbre .
