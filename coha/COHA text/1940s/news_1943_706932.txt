txt For the second night in succession Berlin on Sunday night was lighted by flashes and rocked by the explosions of two and four-ton bombs loosed by a " strong force " of British heavy bombers . In contrast to cloudy conditions that prevailed over Germany on Saturday night , the Royal Air Force bombers had to fly the best part of the way to Berlin and back in bright moonlight . With Nazi night fighters out In force , the raid cost the R. A. F. twenty-two planes . Pilots and crews reported many aerial battles to and from the target area , in which at least one German fighter was sent crashing to earth . When the bombers arrived over the Reich capital they found some clouds and , through heavy German anti-aircraft fire , made their runs .

F. strength of 400 to 500 bombers was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high explosives and probably 100,000 incendiaries were loosed on the Reich capital , according to press service dispatches from London . Air raid alarms lasting about an hour around midnight were reported in Zurich and Basle , Switzerland , last night , indicating that the R. A. F. might be attacking Northern Italy or Southwest Germany . While the R. A. F. 's big planes were on the Berlin trip British fighters on intruder patrol throughout the night attacked enemy transport targets and airfields in France , Belgium and the Netherlands . The fighters kept up their attacks for thirteen hours , swooping upon freight trains with cannons and machine guns blazing . Barges on Dutch canals and a convoy of Nazi trucks south of Fumes , Belgium , were mentioned among the targets hit . The air raid sirens sounded briefly over London early last night , but it was hardly worth blowing them . Nazi planes did some raiding on the southeast English coast and a few of the enemy came over the outskirts of the capital . Anti-aircraft gunfire was heard in one section of London .

F. hammering of Berlin apparently drew to the defense of the German capital enemy fighters from the heavily protected Ruhr , where the British had been raiding earlier this month . The rear and mid-upper gunners of a Lancaster , which dropped an 8,000-pound bomb into Berlin , were responsible for the shooting down of the Nazi fighter credited to the attackers  --  a Junkers 88 , that came in on the return flight . The captain of a Halifax bomber said navigation was exceptionally difficult at some points along the route , where large banks of clouds were met with and the whole landscape was baffling because the ground was covered with snow . Despite difficulties over the target area the same captain reported he had identified the Tempelhof aerodrome , the River Spree and a railway at Berlin . " When we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dropped our 4,000-pounder . By the time we left it had started a good steady blaze . " Many crews reported the patchy cloud effect , but all agreed Berlin showed clearly in the moonlight . The bomb aimer of another Hali1 fax said the Nazi anti-aircraft fire was intense as they " stooged around looking over the target . " 1He said he had a good view of the big bombs going off . " I had never seen an 8,000-pounder going off before , " he stated . " First it made a white I puff . Then there was a red glow which came up and spread out like a great illuminated umbrella and lasted some seconds . As we turned home we could see fires burning red through the slight ground haze . " Nazis ' Loss for Night Compared The loss of twenty-two British planes was naturally serious . Apparently what happened was that the Germans , caught flat-footed on Saturday night , were ready to Sunday and the weather was in their favor . It is a long road to Berlin and enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare the loss of twenty-two British and ten German bombers on the same night when the R. A. F. and the Luftwaffe were raiding each other 's capitals . The operative facts are that the British bombers , many times the number of the foe , had to fly about three hours over hostile territory while the Nazi bombers had about twenty minutes over Britain . The German reaction to the second-night raid on Berlin , as heard here in enemy broadcasts , took the ' form of thanking and praising the civilian population for its discipline and skill in getting fires under control . The Berlin radio , acknowledging heavy damage caused by the fires , described the raid as a " terror " attack . It said the R. A. F. dropped bombs at random on residential quarters . One German broadcast claimed ten Lancasters , four Sterlings , four Halifaxes and one Manchester were shot down by the Nazi night fighters and the German High Command asserted twenty-five British bombers were destroyed during the night . The Rome radio cited Berlin sources for a threat that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are not going to be intimidated by the bandits of the R. A. F. " Londoners were Inclined to laugh at the Germans ' Sunday night raiding over this city . Some bombs did damage in vs .. rious parts of the metropolitan area . At least twelve persons were killed , but perhaps half of these and many of those injured were victims of falling British anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel .

An " AA " shell exploded in the garden of Buckingham Palace and destroyed a plot of Brussels sprouts , The Associated Press reported . Of the ten Nazi planes shot down , more than half fell to British night fighters that closed with the raiders as they came in and turned away many . Wing Commander C. M.
