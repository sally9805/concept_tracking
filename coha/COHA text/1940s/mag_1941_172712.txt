All last week men killed each other in northeastern Hunan . They were fighting for no new victories to write on regimental records . They were fighting simply for rice . <P> Hunan-a round-bellied province that hangs like a bubble suspended from the lake country of the middle Yangtze* is famous for the most beautiful women , the most peppery food , the most savage fighting peasantry in China . More than anything else it is famous as the rice-bowl province of China . Its lush wet fields produce nearly 10% of Free China 's stupendous annual 47-million-ton rice harvest . <P> All through August , under the blue skies of Central China , the blue-robed , sun-browned peasants had watched their rice fields slowly darken in green , then fade to the color of straw . Within their firm husks the grains of rice had whitened and hardened . It would be a good harvest . Prices were dropping in anticipation . <P> The Japanese garrison in Central China watched the rice too . Japan was rice-hungry . As the harvest began last month , 14,000 Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice country . Last week while the decision seesawed in the balance , the Chinese soldiers fought desperately for their desperately needed rice . Two years ago they had driven the Japanese out of this sector . This time they meant to hold . But Hunan 's battle was only a minor incident in the great struggle of Asia for rice . <P> " All the Rice in Asia . " In Chinese , as in some other Asiatic tongues , one word is used for both " rice " and " food . " No other grain yields so heavy a crop on the crowded fields of Asia 's close-packed millions , no other food so satisfies their taste . The most populous countries of East Asia ( China , Japan , Java ) , for all their unceasing efforts , are barely self-sufficient in normal times . China has a slight but chronic deficit . Three other Asiatic countries ( Burma , Thailand , French Indo-China ) produce almost the entire world 's supply of commercially exported rice . Some years they export as much as 6,000,000 tons among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France . <P> The long war in Asia has upset the traditional pattern of rice distribution . Lack of manpower and successive crop shortages have , since 1939 , made Japan a major importer . Last year 's emergency need for almost 2,000,000 tons of imported rice ( a record figure , one-seventh of Japan 's total consumption ) was part of the urge that made her seize Indo-China . That need led to such abnormally large Japanese overseas purchases that Thailand placed export restrictions on rice , Burmese politicians urged similar action on their Government . <P> In China , the internal equalization of surplus and deficit areas has been upset by war . In Chungking , which formerly drew its rice from battle-pocked Hunan via the Yangtze , black-market prices of rice were 30 times pre-war prices last spring . Last year , to make matters worse , Szechwan , Chiang Kai-shek 's base province , had a crop failure . Its yield fell off almost 50% . To prevent hoarding , to make certain of Army and urban rice supplies , Chiang 's Government this summer decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice ) , not money . With a better 1941 harvest in the offing , Free China is faced with no immediate famine .
