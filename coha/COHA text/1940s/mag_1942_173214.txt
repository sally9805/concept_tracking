A community near Joliet , Ill. known as Stern Park Gardens was rechristened Lidice last week , leading Paragrapher Howard Brubaker to remark in The New Yorker : " Thus the name which Nazis thought they had extinguished will be mispronounced for all time . " As most Americans cheerfully began calling it Le-deese ' , the Czech Consulate in Chicago gave the Official pronunciation as Li-di-tseh . In Joliet they pronounced it : the nu sub-di-vizh'un.
