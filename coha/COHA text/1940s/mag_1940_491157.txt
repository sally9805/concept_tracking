ORSON WELLES . the boy who raised gooseflesh on a eontinent with his Martian monsters , reeeived his first important publicity in 1925 , when he was len years old . A newspaper of Madison , Wisconsin , printed a column about him in 1925 under the headline , A POET , ARTIST , CARTOONIST AND ACTOR AT 10 YEARS . The body of the article added that he was a writer , being the author of a tale entitled , The Yellow Panther . Although the article failed to mention it , Orson was also a dramatist and magician . He had written a play on how to run a hotel and could extract burning buildings from silk handkerchief 's . The infant prodigy was particularly successful " in the art of make-up and impersonations , " according to the article , which added : " At times when Orson is in the midst of a story and becomes partieularly interested in one of the characters , he is seized with an inspiration to paint the character , and forthwith takes up his box of oil paints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technique , shows a keen insight and appreciation . " The article was illustrated with a photograph of the many-sided little wizard . It is the face of a young , Grand Lama with large slanting eyes and an air of profound Mongolian wisdom . Welles has not changed completely in the fourteen years since then ; he can still act the part of a Chinese without make-up . 9 There was a touch of precocious showmanship or premature ham in the newspaper photograph ; the young maesiro is almost lost in an enormous Muck silk scarf , draped about his throat in artist fashion . According to his guardian , Orson hunted up the Latin Quarter necktie the moment he learned that he was to have his picture in the paper . At ten years he was already abusing the simplicity of the public . Orson was an old war horse in the infant-prodigy line by the time he was ten . Ile had already seen eight years ' service as a child genius . The I-knewhim-when people in the Orson Welles circle recall vividly that at two he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Fu Manchu . Devout people were inclined to cross themselves in the presence of the eerie little being . Some or the oldest acquaintances of Welles have beendisappointed in his career . They see the twenty-four-year-old boy of today as a mere shadow of the two-year-old man they used to know . Granted that be has attracted some attention as an actor , director , producer , designer . writer , radio star , Shakespearean editor and eontinent starer , they nevertheless consider him a hollow shell of his former self . Ile is thought to be going backward , like the Scott Fitzgerald hero who was born at seventy and retrogressed to zero . Orson was at Madison in 1925 because F. G. Mueller , a psychologist of that city , was specializing in the study of fate-marked babes . He had seized Orson at a summer camp and carried him off to Madison , after convincing the boy 's people that it would be a contribution to science to have his reactions clocked in a psychological laboratory and papers rend about him before learned societies . At Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zoological garden . Every kind of stimulus was administered to him , so that his unusual responses could be measured and recorded for posterity . They would shout " Cow " at him , and then , " Answer quick . ' What is the first thing that comes into your mind ? " and he would reply , " The seventeenth article of the Code of liammurabi " or " Was Voltaire right when he said that the adjective was the enemy of the noun ? " or something along that line . The verdict was that Orson 's unusualness resulted from " a profound disassociation of ideas . " According to Orson 's guardian , however , the boy had decided that psychology was a fake science and was experimenting on the psychologists in order to prove it . While Orson and the scientists were using each other as guinea pigs , the boy was spending part of his then have been crowded with action . He stirred Broadway with his all-Negro production of Macbeth and his gangster-dictator version of Julius Caesar . It was not wholly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadcast was a masterpiece of conscientious workmanship plus a fine instinct for horror . There are different estimates of Welles . One school regards him as the most important influence in the theater today ; another regards him as an upstart with a wonderful bag of tricks . As an actor be has been called everything from " a whining sea cow " to a coming Richard Mansfield . Some of his admirers think he has scattered himself over so many departments of human activity that he is not likely to achieve first rank in any of them . Hollywood put its seal of approval on him last summer by handing him the fattest contract ever given to an outsider . It is safe to describe him as the smartest and busiest boy at twenty-four in the country . For that reason , the story of his bringing up has a special interest . It ought to throw some light on how to raise a child , a subject on which little is known . into the tons of thousands , he is no longer the handicapped or underprivileged child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of the beautiful comes into play ; he has a fine aesthetic feeling for big round sums . RKO , which hired him to make pictures , and Campbell 's Soup , which hired him to do radio shows , do not consider him a mathematical idiot . The soup pays Welles more than $5000 a broadcast ; RKO pays him $150,000 a picture , plus a percentage of the gross . Lack of elementary education had another ambiguous effect on Welles . Never having been frightened in his youth by grammar , he acquired a good literary style without a struggle . On the other hand , he complains that ignorance of grammar has impeded his efforts to learn foreign languages : Lack of early schooling apparently tended toward mental freedom in the case of Welles . He was not compelled to accept the orthodox story about anything , even the multiplication table . He never had to memorize the arbitrary statements of the textbooks . Through accident he was kept moving from one set of adults to another . This furnished him with time as a pupil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day ho announced that he would like to deliver a lecture on Ancient and Modern Art . The teacher offered to turn the class over to him . That did not meet his views . He wanted the whole school . This was arranged . Orson gave a tenminute history of art and then launched into an attack on the school 's methods of teaching art , which , he said , were sterile ; instead of encouraging selfexpression , they encouraged feeble imitation and produced lifeless copyists . " You must n't criticize the public-school system , Orson , " interrupted a teacher . " If the public-school system needs criticizing , I will criticize it , " he replied . That made him worth a column in the Madison paper . Five years later Orson received further important publicity . Ashton Stevens , veteran Chicago dramatic critic , who bad seen the fifteen-year-old boy in prepschool plays , wrote in his column of November 11 , 1930 : " I am going to put a clipping of this paragraph in my betting book . If Orson is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowed , I will never make another prophecy . " The prediction was fulfilled . A newspaper clipping yellows in about a year , Before the year was over , Welles , at sixteen , had become a sensation in the Abbey Theater in Dublin . At eighteen he was playing leads with Katharine Cornell . His six years since Welles was educated on the come-and-get-it system . He had rarely been inside of a schoolroom before he made his attempt to reform the schools of Madison . During his childhood he educated himself chiefly by cross-examining his parents and other adults . To this day he has not mastered all of the Three R 's . He can read and write , but can not cipher . He has not much more than enough arithmetic to enumerate his fingers . If he has to add-simple figures , he writes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 in a column from the top to the bottom of a sheet of paper . Then he writes the figures to be added alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prolonged labor , in accordance with some system of his own , he arrives at a result of doubtful accuracy . It is not clear , however , that his ignorance of arithmetic has been an injury . His inability to count was a detriment to him in 1938 , when he had four hits on Broadway , but wound up with a net loss of $200 . His ignorance costs him heavily in New York night clubs . Nobody knows the defects of his early education better than the waiters . They seldom hnnd him a bill without writing it up 200 or 300 per cent . But , though Welles has lost money , he has saved time . His achievements have been the result . of inteuse concentration . Inability to calculate has left him free to devote all his energies to art and showmanship . Moreover , according to his close associates , he ceases to be a mathematical imbecile when he deals with large figures . When the amounts run a variety of witnesses , mostly members of the intelligentsia , for his cross-examinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools he would have been told , " These are the facts , and that 's all there is to it . " By his private method of self-instruction , he came to the conclusion that nearly everything was a matter of taste and opinion . That is why he rebelled in Madison . He thought the school authorities were trying to make him learn art , like a traffic code , by the memorization of rules . Orson 's next rebellion against orthodox educational methods took place a year or two later , after he had been sent to the Todd School at Woodstock , near Chicago . The instructor in ancient history believed that certain things were indubitably true and must not be questioned . He was a hero-worshiper of the late Prof. James H. Breasted , the famous Egyptologist of the University of Chicago . Breasted was inspired and infallible , as far as the teacher was concerned . The twelve-year-old Welles made a career of exposing Breasted . He wrote paper after paper to prove that Breasted contradicted himself , that he misread inscriptions and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborious researches in libraries to confound Breasted , and incited other boys to expose other authorities of the history teacher . The instructor complained to Roger Hill , the headmaster . 11 Not Lan Chaney , but iS  --  year.old Orson Weller as the hunchbacked Ric'lard 777 , ar prep school . Laolng makeup , he rarely played straight parts , as , at the right , In Wings Over Europe . " That 's great , " said Hill . - You 're getting those boys to do ten times the research they would do ordinarily . " Orson 's next rebellion against the schools arose over the teaching of Shakespeare . A Shakespeare lover at the age of three , he was troubled to find that most prep-school students and high-school students were Shakespeare haters . He laid the blame on schools which taught Shakespeare not as drama and poetry , but as footnotes . At fifteen he started his own edition of Shakespeare  --  an edition without a note , but with full stage directions and hundreds of lively illustrations by his own hand . He has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to read at high speed is , according to Welles , a soul-killing process in which the life and splendor of language is sacrificed to velocity . The rapid-reading mania is responsible , he asserts , for the younger generation 's dead ear for poetry . Welles is today seriously organizing a crusade to reform the educational methods which have brought literature into disrepute in America . The boy 's father was Richard Head Welles , a businessman , an inventor and promoter of inventions . He became fairly wealthy at one time as a manufacturer of carbide bicycle lamps , which replaced the old kerosene bicycle lamps . Among his side lines was the promotion of sports and vaudeville acts . He had national repute as playboy  --  or " sport , " to use the period word . Mrs. Welles was a cultured woman and a brilliant musician . Before her last illness she was preparing to make a tour of the country , reading to music the works of Tagore and other poets . The boy was originally named George Orson Welles , or Orson George Welles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was named after George Ade , the famous humorist , fabulist and playwright , and the late Orson C. Wells , a well-known Chicago businessman , both of whom had accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Welles on a trip to Rio de Janeiro a short time before the prodigy was horn . Orson 's birthplace was Kenosha . Wisconsin . He lived for a time at Grand Detour . Illinois , where his father owned the Hotel Sheffield . Most of his boyhood was spent in Chicago . The " discoverer " of Orson was Dr. Maurice Bernstein , a Russian-born physician , now a noted bone specialist in Chicago . As Orson grew famous , Doctor Bernstein became celebrated as an appraiser of gifted juveniles . His office is commonly knee-deep in suspected genius . Mothers and fathers plead for the Bernstein formula for developing extra-special children into earth shakers . Orson was a year and a half old when the physician discovered him . Doctor Bernstein , then practicing at Kenosha , had been attending Orson 's grandmother . He was overawed by the infant ( you were here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of me  --  and George Pelham . I should have liked to be at home in Georgetown. and as for George , I wished he were in the seventh circle of Dante 's Inferno . Ahead of me beyond the big green sofa at the end of the main wing I heard the door in the transverse hall in front of the elevator open and slum shut . I stopped short as I recognized the girl who came suddenly into view and broke into a run up the short flight of carpeted steps that led to the extended level our rooms were on . I tried to call , but she did n't hear me . I quickened my pace . If I could only catch up with her before she reached her grandmother 's sitting room ! But I knew I could n't ; she was going too rapidly . She reached the door and stopped just as I hurried up the stairs . She didn't. look around ; she just . stood an instant , her hand on the knob , her head thrown back a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't hear me . The next instant she was gone , and I heard the door close quietly behind her . I ran the rest of the way , sick with dread . At the door I stopped . I could hear her voice through the open transom , calm and cool and under complete control . " Grandmother , " she said , " I want you to know I 've decided to marry George  - -  -  1 leaned against the door frame . really more seasick than I 've been on the ocean , my throat aching horribly . Sonic People coming out of another room looked at me oddly . I knew I could n't stand there any longer , so I opened the door as quietly as I could and slipped inside . Cecily was standing in the middle of the floor , her face as white as parchment , her head erect , her dark amberflecked eyes clear and very bright . Her grandmother , a card in her hand frozen motionless halfway to the board , her lips as blue as sudden indigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the table from his sister , his face a complex mask of surprise and bewilderment. , had risen half to his feet , obviously not believing his ears . Ceelly 's voice , with not a break to indicate she 'd heard the door open or that she was in any way aware of anybody 's presence behind her , went on steadily : ? right away . The end of the week ? as soon as I 've talked to father on the telephone . " George 's face lighted . He sprang around behind his sister 's chair and caught her in his arms . Mrs. Chapman 's hand dropped to the table . She closed her eyes , her lips pressed together in a tragic bitter line . " Cecily , my dear , tell me again you mean it ! " George 's lips were muffled against her hair . Ceeily stood rigidly erect , her head forward against his shoulder , nodding slowly . And then George did a surprising thing . He released her almost abruptly and started for the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegram to the office . It has n't any point now , and perhaps it has n't gone . I 'll see if I can stop it . " He was gone . I sat down weakly in the nearest chair . Alexander Ridley smiled at his wife across the corner of the table . ( TO DE CONTINUED ) Confucius . At the age of two , the boy , according to the doctor , was uttering wisdom in polished sentences . The doctor 's immediate conviction was thatOrson would be a great . artist . Not being sure which art the boy would excel in , the doctor hedged his bets by introducing Orson to every art . tie started by presenting his protege with a violin , but the infant 's arms were not long enough to manage it . He then thought out a short cut for making the boy a Toscanini ; buying a conductor 's baton , he set Orson on a box and had him conuct phonograph versions of Mozart Atring quartets . He went on to buy the child a puppet theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit . The puppet theater was the most important investment .. Orson became an impresario , stage director and make-up man at two . The actors were made of cardboard and operated by wires . The curtain rose on an old man reading . He drowsed over an open book . A little mouse ran out from the wings and bumped into a candle , tilting it so that the wax dripped upon the old gentleman 's beard and stuck it to the book . The climax ca me with the aged scholar 's awakening and his frantic efforts to extricate his beard . Later , Orson and the doctor constructed a larger theater from a dry-goods box , with a window shade for a curtain . Orson carved and painted his actors , stage-directed them by pulling the strings , made up most of the dialogue and handled it von- lle is classified as a boy wonder today because he has done so much on Broadway at the age of twenty-four ; he is , however , a veteran of twenty-two years ' association with the theater . Orson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A B C 's . One of the books his mother read to him was the Lambs ' Tales Profn Shakespeare . When the boy found that he was listening to stuff written for children , he rebelled . By requiting the plays to be read to him in the original , he soon became a eonfirmed Shakespearean . Doctor Bernstein insisted that , for the boy 's health , he should he more in the open air . Orson agreed to go fishing , but only on the stipulation that his mother or somebody else should read Shakespeare while he fished . What he remembered of the plays he would stage in his puppet theater . In recent years he has been criticized for slipping lines from Coriolanus into Julius Caesar ; also for producing Macbeth with an all-Negro cast and switching the setting from Scotland to Haiti ; also for telescoping eight Shakespearean plays into his Five Kings . He came by these methods naturally enough , as he had been handling Shakespeare that way since he was of pre-kindergarten age . Lack of early schooling is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigy . The early-to-bed rule was not regularly applied to him . Ile learned from his father the habit of staying up all hours . This is one of the early acquirements for which he was later most grateful . Today he has the ability , when he is in a hurry , to get a good night 's sleep in two or three hours . During the time of his wildest . activity on Broadway , he worked for seventy-two-hour stretches without rest . He never carries a watch , but that is part of the imperial complex ; there are always a few king 's remem brancers at his elbow nowadays to keep him posted on the time . Alcohol is suspected of being injurious to growing boys . Orson was always allowed wine at the table ; at eight or nine he began making highballs for himself , partly because of his fixed belief that be was an adult . He skipped the cigarette period entirely and started on cigars at about ten . A happy family life is regarded as the keystone of a good bringing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they separated permanently when he was six . His mother died when he was eight , his father when he was fourteen . He was kept in circulation by a mild form of kidnapping . Sometimes with his mother , sometimes with his father , sometimes with outsiders , he had a sort of revolving environment , like a Max Reinhardt stage . This cultivated the migratory instinct . A seminomad as a boy , he became a globe-trotter in his early teens . Mrs. Welles had a wide circle of acquaintance among artists and intellectuals . From the first , Orson was a full-fledged member of the circle . He spent much of his time at the home of the late Edward Moore , music critic of the Chicago Tribune . The Moores had a place at Ravinia , a Chicago suburb , where Metropolitan and other stars held a regular season of grand opera . At the Moore home , Orson mixed with nearly everybody of consequence in the musical world . He was taken everywhere and became a lion of the Chicago salons . Nearly everybody in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was accepted as one of them . The idea that he would be anything except a top-flight artist never occurred to anyone . Exposed to intellectual conversation in his early years , Orson had a remarkable ability to assimilate it . His ears were exceptionally acute . He could catch what adults whispered among themselves and what they said behind closed doors . His auditory nerve was then and is now something like Edison 's quadruple telegraph ; he can participate in one conversation while kibitzing on three others . Recently he was in a restaurant with some people who became interested in the dialogue at the table on the left ; they eavesdropped eagerly , but without catching more than an occasional word . Welles then gave a , full account of the discussion at the table on the left and threw in for good measure the substance of the discussion at the table on the right .. This aroused skepticism . Garson Kamin , the movie director , and others put Orson to the test . They posted agents where they could overhear the talk of three near-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the examination with flying colors ; while continuing to take part in one conversation , he was able to render faithful reports on the three others . His astonished companions argued that evolution was still going on ; that Nature , in the course of her experiments , had endowed Orson with a new accessory which may in the future become part of the standard equipment of the human race . Welles insisted that the triple-eavesdropping faculty could be acquired by anyone who practiced earnestly . Doctor Bernstein was a sort of Phantom of the Opera or general backstage ghost . He haunted the wings at ( Continued on Page 96 ) ( Continued from Page 94 ! nearly every important show that came to Chicago . He loved musicians and theatrical people . Wherever the doctor wept , Orson went , so that he met most of the current celebrities . The young intellectual vampire preyed on the brains that . Doctor Bernstein scouted for hint . When Nicolas Constantinovieh Boerich , the painter of the Central Asiatic scene , had an exhibition in Chicago , he held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been provided only with a water-color set , Roerjell was pained . " Never paint with anything but oils , " he said . " Get oils . Do n't use your brush . Use your thumb . Only your thumb . " Orson switched to oils and worked solely with his thumb , until another distinguished painter made him get an assortment of brushes . One day Doctor Bernstein took Orson backstage to meet Houdini . The great , magician taught the infant magician a handkerchief trick and made him promise to practice it a thousand times . " Never perform any trick , " said Houdini , " until you have practiced it a thousand times . " Greatly im pressed , Orson followed the advice . The authority of Houdini was sufficient to break down his prejudice against . plodding mechanical toil . Though unwilling to grind away at school subjects , he found it a pleasure to undergo any amount of labor in the cause of showmanship . Most of Orson 's celebrities were as communicative as Roerich or Houdini . If any of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview was soon at an end . One day Mischa Levitzki committed the fang pas of asldng Orson if he were a Boy Scout . The Levitzld person was dropped on the spot . Later , Orson said , " IVIly did you take me to see that man ? " " Why , he 's one of the greatest . pianists alive , " said Doctor Bernstein . " Ile has nothing to offer us , " said Orson . The Child Who Fathered the Man Orson had nothing against the Boy Scouts , but he had a phobia against being a boy . His uatiu ambition was to escape from childhood . At hiodergarten age he was sent to kindergarten ; he put a stop to that by either feigning or having appendicitis . There has been a disagreement on this subject for nearly twenty years . The guardian , who was visiting Welles at Hollywood last September , was still arguing with his ward about it . Welles said that he had faked a pain in his right side and run his temperature up by pressing the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation , insisted that the appendix was in a had way . Both agreed that the boy had raged against being operated on until he flew into a greater rage because members of the hospital staff kept asking him if he were a Boy Scout . Finally he exclaimed : " Yes , I 'm a Boy Scout . I 'm an Elk . I 'm a Moose . I 'm anything . For heaven 's sake , give me the ether ! " In his tenth year Orson was fit for the Sorbonne in some respects , but not fit for the third grade in others . His guardian thought the boy should take up addition and subtraction . Orson was firm against it . Ho was working seriously on the universal history of the drama and employing his leisure in a critical analysis of Thus Spa ke Zarathustra . He had no time for infantile exercises , and he dismissed the subject in his lofty manner . " There will always , " he said , " be people around to add and subtract for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , to get Orson to learn to read . He preferred education by ear . He was nearly seven before he could be induced to take up the A B C 's . He used Midsummer Night 's Dream as a First Reader . It is the one Shakespearean play that he has never liked since . As soon as he had mastered the alphabet , however , he got a typewriter and started turning out plays and short stories . Learning to read and write was his chief surrender to conventional notions of education . His unorthodox bringing up seems to have benefited him in many respects , and nobody can say what effect illiteracy might have had on his career . Illiteracy never has had a fair trial . Orson 's father was against the complex art atmosphere the boy was being reared in . " You 're ruining him , " he kept telling Doctor Bernstein and others . Dick Welles wanted his son trained for some lucrative business . When he saw that the ' cause was hopeless , the father offered the compromise idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of Bud Fisher , George McManus and other famous comic artists , knew there was big money in pen and ink . To oblige his father , Orson added cartooning to his other lines . One of his sketches , done when he was seven or eight , pictures a woman driving an auto ; beside her is a small boy drives than when you drive ? " This and other items of art and belles-lettres produced by the child have been kept by Doctor Bernstein , who has from the beginning played the part of Boswell to his infant prodigy . Today lie has cabinets of Wellesiana . The first item goes hack four generations ; it is a drinking cup which Abrae ham Lincoln presented to one of Orson 's great-grandfathers on the occasion of his first birthday . Mrs. Welles was Beatrice Ives , a member of the Springfield family who had been friends and neighbors of the Lincolns . Another item tells its tale of the impression the infant prodigy had made on his circle at . three ; it is a piece of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orson at that age . Another department of the collection consists of letters of Orson , who had the habit of writing words on one half of a letter sheet and illustrating them on the other half . Orson learned much from his father . During the latter part of his life , Dick Welles , who was in nom ' health , did not feel like himself except when taking a little Holland gin . lie hated to be alone when he look it , so he made the boy a companion , and they often sat up talking until daybreak . The son could well afford to listen to the father , who had been a globe-trotter and international mixer , and who boasted that he had " read every book . " What Dick Welles lost in business , he was usually able to regain in the stock market and other forms of gambling . He had played some angle of nearly every important invention in his day , from autos to radio . An ardent enthusiast over aviation since the Wright brothers made their first flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having the motor in the air . He promoted a land-and-air plane  --  a glider attached by a long rope to a horseless carriage , operating on the principle of a boy running with a kite , When the invention was fairly well advanced , Richard Welles placed an aged colored man , a faithful retainer of the family , in the plane and launched it successfully . The experiment seemed to be prospering until the aged flier screamed for help . The problem of landing the plane had never been worked out in detail . Somebody cut the rope , and the plane fell . The venerable retainer was hurt , but not to any great extent . A photograph taken at the instant of the crash is an item of Doctor Bernstein 's Wellesian collection . The Nine Muses It is probably not wholly a coincidence that the singular lad had nine singular great-aunts . One was an important topic of conversation in Kenosha because she used her electric limousine to run after , not to ride in ; she tied herself to the machine by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pacemaker . Another , besides wearing a riding habit . at all times , hailed her friends on the streets of Kenosha by lifting an enormous wig , or transformation , and waving it at them . A third is still the subject of speculation ; she fell out of a jinrikisha in China and was never heard of again . A fourth was locally glamorous because she had once been courted by the famous magician , Hermann the Great . Another was remembered because she had refused to be rescued from the Johnstown flood , as she did not care to interrupt a party which she and other refugees had organized in her attic . Most of the great aunts were known to Orson only by family tradition ; one whom he knew personally was a parsimonious sybarite who took baths in ginger ale because , as she told him , it was cheaper than champagne . Strange religions ran in the family .

According to the authorities , Orson was not so bad as might have been expected . Ashton Stevens described him as " gabby and precocious , but not snooty . " Others say he was gentle and patient with the absurdities of adults . If lie offended anyone , he apologized in blank verse . He had a sort of patriarchal benevolence for all members of his circle . He is still the amiable patriarch . In radio or stage rehearsals , he addresses his east as " Children " or " Kiddies , " using the words affectionately , not patronizingly . Actors twice his age are not offended by his kindly paternalism . When he was producing Julius Caesar , Welles ' wardrobe was systematically robbed . He lost , among other things , quantities of cotton , wool and silk socks . The thefts were traced to an actor . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
