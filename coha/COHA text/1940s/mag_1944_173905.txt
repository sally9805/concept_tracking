The stage was set in Poland and the cast was in the wings . The Russian-German front from East Prussia to the Carpathians bore a strong resemblance to the Vitebsk front just before Joseph Stalin 's armies launched their great summer offensive in June . There were the same signs this week that Russia was accumulating tremendous reservoirs of new power behind the line , the same enemy fretfulness over blows that the Germans could see and feel were coming . <P> The Russian explosion in June and July had driven the last German from Russian soil , ended the Battle of Russia , whittled down the German armies in the east . It had pushed the German remnants back to the upper Vistula , to a line in front of Warsaw and East Prussia before giving them a chance to regain their balance . Now this line , which the Germans bragged they had stabilized , was regarded by the Reds as the starting line for their autumn offensive in the Battle of Germany . They were bringing up new , massive equipment with which they intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Chernyakhovsky 's forces aimed at the East Prussian border ; Rokossovsky 's and Zakharov 's forces aimed directly west toward Berlin , but could swing north to envelop East Prussia , or north and south to envelop Warsaw ; Konev 's huge bridgehead on the upper Vistula pointed at Cracow and German Silesia . Most of the surface activity last week was in the Balkans , but the great drive had passed from the explosive to the mopping-up stage . The noises from Berlin betrayed well-grounded anxiety about the sectors north of the Carpathians , the direct menace to German soil . <P> The line twitched along its length , most notably along the Narew River ( a tributary to the Vistula ) north of Warsaw . Moscow announced that the Red armies had blasted their way to the river , saluted the victory with twelve salvos from 124 guns , then let silence fall . But the Germans announced that the Reds had concentrated 30 divisions-more than 300,000 men-on the banks of the Narew , that they had begun to cross to the west bank . <P> Once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the banks of the narrow Scheschuppa River on the border , a Red Fleet correspondent wrote : " Before us stretches Germany . Beyond this insignificant river is a steep bank , then fields with clover , brush , clumps of trees surrounded by wire and trenches , big barns with tile roofs , the red and pastel-colored roofs of houses . . . . We know that the earth beyond the Scheschuppa River will take a lot of our blood , but we know that without this blood humanity can never find peace . " <P> Germany , too , was willing to spill more blood to keep the hated enemy out of the Reich . But she had only so much blood left in her body .
