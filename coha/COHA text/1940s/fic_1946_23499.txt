APROPOS OF NOTHING AT ALL A Story ELIZABETH JANE WAY S /NCE Jerry had left her , she had found it increasingly difficult to go to sleep . This was a surprise . She had imagined the empty days ahead and seen herself trying to cheat them by lying late in bed , by getting up at ten , ten-thirty , eleven , so that after making coffee , reading the paper , and tidying the apartment it would almost be time to get dressed for a luncheon appointment . It ' had been the terrible vacant beginnings of the days that she had dreaded . She had never thought about the nights . She had always slept well , even when she had been consumed with fury against Jerry . She had lain beside him in darkness , hating him , feeling her hate gush up and beat against the shadowy ceiling overhead , to turn and fall like meteors on his solid , immune body . And then ; suddenly , she would be asleep . Suddenly she would find that the gray light of morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groan beside her . She would lie stiff for a moment and then , as he awoke , slide out of bed and begin the sullen day . But now she could not go to sleep . Dinner and the movies , dinner at a friend 's house , dinner with another woman whose husband had dematerialized or never appeared at all  --  all these ended by eleven o'clock and left her stranded on the beach of night , with the tide still ebbing below her . She would lie stubbornly stretched out in bed with a book and wait , while the words ran through her head , forweariness to overtake her . It would not . She would turn off the light and relax defenselessly for sleep to take her as its victim , but the beast only sniffed her over and slipped away . The clock struck in the dark , busses stormed up the street under her windows , the el rattled by two blocks away . Time carried her rocking down its river , but never to oblivion . For even when sleep came , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not remember ever having dreamed before . But now she slid perceptibly into uneasy sleep , past thoughts she knew and recognized , which changed slowly , slowly , into misshapen figures , not even statues , into stalactites in the cave of night . She ran down echoing corridors with a leaping torch in her hand , and the shadows which it blasted away about her closed in behind and shut the way , lurked in ambush ahead . She was running to Jerry , running to him , hunting him . Where had he gone ? Where had he hidden himself ? There were traces of him everywhere . He had just left his room , the curtains there were quivering behind him . She spied him on the rear platforms of trains slowly pulling out of great , open , echoing stations . People showed her snapshots of him . There was a highball , half finished , that he had just put down . How can I dream of him ? she thought , snatching herself awake . I hate him !

It devastated my life for six years like  --  like the dust-storms . A green and growing place when I married him and now desert , desert , the topsoil blown away and the cattle starving . How can I dream of him ? she would think , and slide back into dreaming . She dreamt then , one night ( it was March now , time for winter to break , but there was no spring , it was cold ) , she dreamt that she had found him . She came face to face with him . He had a drink in his hand and looked surprised . His eyes went past her on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to put down this glass too , pass through the curtains behind her , slip out of this room as he had out of all the others . But the arrangements had somehow gone awry . They had not managed to decoy her into the long empty hall where she should have been wandering now , opening door after door on empty schoolroom after empty room . She had come too soon and found him . There were people around and she knew they were all watching her obliquely . I have a right to be here ! she thought defiantly . And then shamedly , helplessly , she began to cry . Here was her one chance . Here was Jerry before her , unable to get away  --  even his stolid brown eyes admitted that. - And instead of doing what she had intended ( what was it anyway ? she asked herself . But the memory flicked out of sight ) , she did nothing but cry . She stood facing him and the tears streamed down her face . She held out her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not hostile , she realized . If she should succeed , they would hand him over to her . They were just . But she was doing the wrong thing . She was doing nothing , nothing , but stand there and cry . And the moment was passing , had passed , she screamed as she tried to hold it back , but it was no good , the room was filled with sighs and Jerry slid back from her , further and further , the light dimmed and he was gone . When she woke up she was terrified . She lay huddled in bed , shaking with fear . The light in the room was pale but growing . Soon it would be day . How can I dream it ? she asked . I hate him ! I wanted him back . I wanted to beg , I held out my hands and cried for him . It was worse than losing him . It is n't true ! He 's no good to me . I hate him , I hate him .

The men were fairies and the women were very smart and hated her . She did well because she did not care about them at all . She ran around collecting English chintzes and brasses and talking to clients when the head of the department was away . She was supposed to be his secretary and she rattled off his letters with clinical efficiency , took his phone calls , and ignored him . He thought she was wonderful . So did her friends . They were very proud of her for starting out to make herself a career and a new life . Some of them said they envied her . They asked her to lunch and dinner more now , because she was not dependent on them any longer . She did not meet them often for lunch . She had lunch alone , usually , in tea shops or the department store restaurant and sometimes  --  not often  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hats were as chic as any . She never saw Jerry there . After a few months she was no longer the newest in the department . She had a place there and people said Good Morning and Good Night to her . A bewildered boy had taken her place as the novice . The men ran their eyes up and down him like steel shears and the women whispered and called him by his first name and took him out to lunch one by one . He was fresh from a year or two at college , had been rejected by the Army on some vague complaint . He had an allergy of some kind , he thought , but his skin was as pink and clean as a baby 's . She watched him take his place in this role , the role she had refused to fill , had indeed been unable instinctively to fall into . One after another he had lunch with the other women and she watched him behind her opaque eyes come back unmarked from these expeditions , laughing a little too loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then he was so young , he always laughed too loudly . All the other women were older , older than Kathie herself . She was only twenty-six ) . But he went to work at once , putting up the rolls of material left out on a table , moving wallpaper books from one room to another , doing odds and ends of menial labor left for him by the woman who had just bought his lunch . He did them cheerfully . He was quite a nice boy . o NE Saturday at quarter to one she found that they were the only two left in the office . Her boss had gone to a football game , someone else had called in to say she was sick , another was doing an out-of-town job , and the rest had simply disappeared . She gathered up her pocketbook and gloves ( she had her hat on . She had been wearing it at her desk for some time now , to show she was a lady , not really a secretary ) , and started out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing by the door to the reception room thoughtfully wiping his hands with a roll of cotton batting that streamed up out of a waste paper basket . Before Kathie knew what she was doing , she had spoken to him . " Hi , Johnnie , " she said . " I guess we 're the last survivors . Going to lunch ? " He brightened immediately . " Sure thing , Mrs. Nichols , " he said . " Wait a sec . I 've got to scrub my hands clean to eat with you . " She went on indignantly to the elevators . What does he think I am ? she asked herself . I did n't ask him to lunch ! I 'm not old enough to be his mother ! I 'm not going to take him out and buy him a good lunch just to look at his pretty pink cheeks ! He caught up with her as an elevator stopped . They crammed into it along with the Saturday crowd and Johnnie who was six inches taller than she backed her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . He grinned down at her and said , " This gets worse every week , does n't it ? You 'd think you were playing football . " " Did you play football at school ? " she responded , smiling up at him . " Sure , " he said . Someone pushed him and he turned and glared over his shoulder . " I was too light , " he added absentmindedly . The elevator reached the main floor and the crowd filtered out . Through the crowded aisles to the street she scolded herself for playing up to him . I wo n't buy his lunch , she thought furiously . I wo n't say a word to him . 1 ' 11 just get out there and get into a cab and go up to the Ritz . But the swinging doors were heavy . Johnnie 's arm reached out ahead of her and caught one and held it open . He piloted her out and around several bewildered ladies who were trying to find out where they were . " Which store is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight met them . In the street they were suddenly two people together and it did not matter that he crawled on hands and knees around her office for her with bolts of material trailing him . " Where do you want to go ? " he said . She blinked in the sudden light . " I do n't care , " she said . " O.K. " He took her arm and walked her straight across the street against the traffic . They went two blocks up and one over and down the steps to a little French restaurant . She remembered suddenly passing it with Jerry . This was the cab drivers ' route to her apartment from Penn Station . What difference does it make ? she thought . We never went in . T WAS fairly crowded but they got a table I against the wall and ordered cocktails . Johnnie told her about himself . He was worried about not being in the Army . This was 1944 and anyone his age and not in uniform was constantly explaining why . And he was worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something funny about the people in the office . He 'd wanted to talk to her often . He was awfully glad to have a chance . She was different . She reminded him a lot of a girl at home . He came from up-state New York . He boarded out in Brooklyn . They would n't take him in the Army . He 'd tried six times in different places . His mother wanted him to come home , but there was n't anybody there . They 'd all gone . They had another cocktail and she thought of things to say to him , but she did n't have a chance to . " Go home , " she wanted to say , " go on home , Johnnie , right away . " I do n't know when I 've had two cocktails at lunch , she thought giddily , and then the waiter planked the soup down in front of her . Johnnie ate like a little boy , like a farm boy , chasing bits of food around his plate and wiping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly through it all , including the bread episode . The crowd in the restaurant thinned out and they were left face to face , with Johnnie still asking her advice and she still quite unable to break in and give it . " Excuse me , " he said suddenly , in the middle of a story about a girl who was n't pretty but was very bright . Johnnie 's mother had just written him that she had gone and got married to a sailor . He disappeared into the men 's room and the waiter at once produced the check . She waited for several minutes . The waiter hovered . At last he smiled ingratiatingly and said , " I go off now , lady . " She paid it and waited a while longer . Johnnie appeared then looking brighter and pinker than ever . She took a long drink of water and got up . They walked back to the store together without speaking . Everyone was there when they got back and watched them come in together . The drinks died in her slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water-cooler several times . When she came back from one trip around four o'clock the receptionist said coldly , " There 's a call for you . They 've been ringing and ringing . " " Thank you , " she answered as coldly , and went in to pick up the phone . It was Hilda . Hilda was having a cocktail party that afternoon . Could n't she come ? She hesitated . If anyone had called her and Jerry so late for a party she should have refused at once . It was an insult to be called for a cocktail party at four the same day . Johnnie went past the door j ust then and winked at her . " I 'd love to , " she said at once . " It will be grand , darling . Thanks a million . I 'll see you . " Hilda lived in the Village , and she debated whether or not to go home and change . But if she did she would n't get there till six-thirty or quarter of seven . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the ones worth anything , made while sober , would all be arranged . It would be cab fare up and then all the way down again . Her dress would do and there was a hat she 'd been meaning to buy downstairs . She walked out again , smiling sweetly at the receptionist , and went down and bought it . At five thirty the bells clanged through the store and she went out to the washroom , cold-creamed her face , combed her hair , made herself up meticulously and tried the new hat . It was very becoming . She went back in , borrowed the clothes-brush out of her boss 's desk , and saw that her stocking seams were straight . As she went out , Johnnie , lounging on a table , whistled . She walked past without looking at him . Prk HE noise of Hilda 's party came out to I meet her on the stairs as she went up . She glanced apprehensively at her watch , but it was just five minutes after six . People must have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . Hilda was in the hall waiting and screamed down . " Hello , darling , who is it ? " " Kathie , " she called back . " How are you ? " " Fine , darling , I 'm so glad you could come , " said Hilda . " Come on up . " She kissed Kathie quickly and showed her where to leave her coat . Kathie took another , look at her hat and went out into the living room . " This is Kathie Nichols , " said Hilda to the room in general . " Hello , Kathie , " said a soldier standing by the table with the drinks on it . " That 's quite a hat . What can I give you ? " She glanced at what he was drinking and said , " Scotch and soda , please . " " That 's a good girl , " he said and fixed her a strong one . He was very good looking and wore wings on his breast . She talked to him for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . Finally she backed herself into a group discussing the latest play . Fortunately , she remembered the reviews and was getting along swimmingly , when Jerry Caine in with some people she did n't know . It seemed to her that the room fell away into silence around her . He did n't see her for quite a while . She watched him go over and get a drink , talk to some people , and finally come up to Hilda whose face flicked through surprise to cordiality . He looks thinner , Kathie thought . He never eats properly . Hilda 's eyes wandered for a moment and lighted on Kathie . She 's trying to apologize , thought Kathie , - but she ca n't hide how much she wants to know what I 'll do . Then she saw Jerry 's head beginning to turn and went at once over to the table for some more Scotch . The dates she might have had were no good to her now . The soldier smiled at her , but she could n't concentrate on him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was left in the middle all alone and conscious of Jerry watching her or not watching her  --  and of other eyes too . She was sure they must all be looking . I must go , she thought , it 's the only dignified thing to do . But the idea of facing the dust an cold wind of the street alone was more than she could bear . This kept her , kept her walking about the living-room , always on the opposite side from Jerry , as if they were performing some stately and complicated dance ritual which obscured the facts of heartbreak and pursuit and emptiness . I must go , she thought , and went and got another drink . nEOPLE were beginning to leave when rshe looked dazedly at her watch . It was seven-thirty . He 'll go in a minute , she thought , and I wo n't have spoken to him . I wo n't have a dinner date either . Her soldier had gone . She set her empty glass down and went right up to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw her coming over the woman 's shoulder 2t5c1 his eyes shifted suddenly , going past her to either side , as in the dream . But she was a little drunk now , too drunk to wonder why it seemed familiar . " Hello , " she said . The other woman turned and looked at her . " Pm Mrs. Nichols , " and she smiled and held out her hand . The woman looked bewildered and said at once , " How do you do ? " He must havebeen asking her to have dinner with him , Kathie thought . " How are you , Jerry ? " she said . " I 'm fine . How are you ? You look swell . " " Excuse me , " said the woman and slid out from between them . " I just wanted to say hello , " Kathie said . " I 'll go now . " She stood and looked at him . " You do n't have a drink , " he said . He would n't look at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Her eyes filled with tears then and she felt her mouth twist . " Do n't leave me , Jerry , " she said in a whisper . " For Christ 's sake do n't leave me . I 've had a hell of a time . I 've had an awful time . Please come back to me . Please . " The tears had spilled over now . " Oh my God , " he said , and took her arm and walked her to the bedroom . They had to pass Hilda . She backed out of the way , but Kathie could feel her eyes shiver up and down her spine . Inside Jerry shut the door and leaned against it . His eyes , watching her , were round and blank as brown marbles . They were the wall that he was hiding behind  --  retreating , retreating weak as water and no good to her . She did n't look , but went right up and put her arms around him . He held her loosely , not saying anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand it . Come back to me . I 'll die if you do n't . I 'd rather kill myself than live like this . Please , Jerry . Please come back . " She could n't say anything more . She was crying too hard . Someone rattled the handle of the door . " Just a minute , " Jerry called out and looked down at her . She had got over the wall and his face was still bewildered . He looked like a man caught in a rainstorm without an umbrella . " I do n't ? " he began and stopped . " Please , please , " she said , " I 'll do anything . I wo n't  --  I wo n't  --  I 'll love you . I love you , Jerry . Please . It 's no use , I ca n't go on like this . Say you 'll come back . " " Ooohoo , " Hilda was calling outside . " People want their things .

" Do n't cry , darling , " he said into the vacuum bell of the roam that insulated themagainst the laughter and clatter outside . But she stood there , with Hilda hooting outside like an owl , and cried and cried all over his shirtfront while , down around her , she could feel settle the aching desert , the dry dust , the despair of their life together that she had begged him to give her back , the hopeless loser 's prize at last found and regained , the empty power to be again torturer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE smart Peking Club , from which all Chinese are excluded , the I Japanese still remain members in good standing , make regular appearances before tiffin and dinner , shake poker dice to see who will pay for the next round of gimlets .
