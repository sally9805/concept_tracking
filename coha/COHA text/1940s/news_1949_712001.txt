txt The House went off on a ten-day Easter recess today with its Democratic members assigned by leaders to tell constituents back home that the Truman " Fair Deal " program was making strong headway despite " obstructionism and legislative slowdowns " by the Republicans . Such an assignment was given directly by Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , the House majority leader , and in a general pronouncement by Senator J. Howard of Rhode Island , chairman of the Democratic National Committee . The performance of the House thus far in the first session of the Eighty-first Congress was emphasized . The Senate , concededly behind schedule , recessed only until next Monday . Mr. and Mr. McCormack presented a sort of a box-score of accomplishments in Congress for constituent consumption during the recess season . This development came as the House passed its ninth and last appropriation bill for the regular departments and agencies . Leaders said it would be dififcult to find in Congressional history a similar record . Historically , they said , the log-jam around appropriation bills had persisted until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covered The ninth regular appropriation measure , adopted by a voice vote of the House , was the second largest of them all . It calls for $7,576 , - 886,181 to supply funds for twentyeight so-called independent agencies of the Government . Not only had the House backed up its Appropriations Committee to slash more than $500,000,000 from Presidential and Budget Bureau recommendations  --  including sharp cuts for the Veterans Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission ? but it reduced the committee 's recommendations by $1,065,000 . Most of this superimposed cut reflected an apparent conclusion by the House that the selective draft , passed after many weeks of struggle in Congress last year , was now a dead issue , or at least a dying issue . The proposed operating appropriation for the Selective Service System , already " cut to the bone " by the committee , was slashed in half , leaving only $4 , - 500,000 to operate the system throughout the year starting July 1 . The Appropriations Committee had recommended $9,000,000 , or $16,000,000 less than the appropriation for the current fiscal year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee said , in explaining its reduction , that the Army expected to make no draft calls between July 1 , 1949 , and June 30 , 1950 . Heating Urges Sharp Cut Representative Kenneth B. Keating , Republican , of New York ( a Reserve brigadier general of the Army ) arose to observe that $9,000,000 appeared to be too much money to put into a possible registration monthly of arriving-atdraft-age men in the various induction areas when their call to serve seemed to be unlikely . He proposed that the Selective Service System be reduced to a skeleton , supported by $4,500,000 for the coming fiscal year . The House at that time was sitting in committee status , with many members absent , but the vote for Mr. Keating 's suggestion was so overwhelming-82 to 9 ? that the leadership accepted it as being final . There was only one forced increase in the Independent Offices ' measure . This involved a rise of $3,434,950 in funds proposed for the training of prospective officers of the American merchant marine . The appropriations body had proposed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools affected included the Merchant Marine , . Academy at Kings Point , N. Y. ; the Cadet School at Pass Christian , Miss. , and the maritime training stations at Sheepshead Bay , N. Y. , St. Petersburg , Fla. , and Alameda , Calif . The House vote sought to continue this pay . In. the background of the prerecess proceedings , however , were the reports which the Democratic leaders desired to be presented to the constituents back home . Messrs . and McCormack emphasized these statistics : The Congress as a whole had passed thirty-eight public and eleven private laws . The House had passed 345 other bills . The House was " far ahead of normal schedule , " and , particularly , had passed all of the regular appropriation measures in less than four months . Further , it was held by the leaders the House had acted or was acting " on most points " of the President 's program . Senator listed some " exceptions and reasons , " as follows : The House Committee on Education and Labor had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $300,000,000 aidto-education bill and a minimum wage increase . Accomplishments Are Stressed Health insurance legislation awaited recommendations , in a special message , from President Truman . The proposed $4,000,000 , - 000 increase in corporate and personal income taxes was in abeyance pending a final look at the budget after pending appropriations were completed . Civil-Rights bills were being held back until other " Fair Deal " measures were cleared . As to accomplishments thus far , Messrs . and McCormack listed : For peace and security  --  Continuation of the Marshall Plan for recovery in Europe , economic aid to the extent of $54,000,000 to China , additional national security protection through an extended I radar network and a guided missile proving ground reaching some 3,000 miles ; a strengthened Central Intelligence Agency , a proposed seventy-group Air Force and a firmer unification of the military establishment .

Reorganization  --  House approval : of legislation to streamline executive departments in the interest of economy and efficiency . Appropriation Votes Cited To date , according to Senator 's compilation , the House had passed appropriation measures calling for $29,408,300,000 . This , he stated , was only about $1,211,600 under the aggregate estimates which had been made by the Bureau of the Budget . In charging the Democratic members of the House to tell their constituents about the state of the " Fair Deal " program in the Senate , Senator urged them to discuss the " recent action of the Republicans ( in the Senate ) in dooming closure reform " ( limitation of debate ) . " Far more than a change in the Senate rules was involved , " he said . " Far more even than the chance of passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that when the Republicans had an opportunity to prevent filibusters they " broke their promises " in order " to obstruct the Pesident 's legislative program . " This action in itself was " a first cousin " of a filibuster , he asserted .
