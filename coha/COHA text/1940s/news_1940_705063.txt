txt The administration policy of " blacklisting. " so far as national defense contracts are concerned . companies charged by the Labor Board with violating the National Labor Relations Act yesterday threatened to have repercussions on Capitol Hill , especially in the House of Representatives . The belief was expressed in some well informed House quarters that the Smith committee , which has been investigating administration of the labor act by the board , will call Sidney Hillman , labor representative on the defense advisory commission , and Attorney General Jackson before it for an explanation . Administration leaders were apprehensive lest the " blacklisting " policy , which is designed to strengthen the hands of the National Labor Relations Board , may develop into a serious row and complicate plans to seek a recess of the session next week . Earlier this year . the House voted two to one for legislation abolishing the present Labor Board and creating a new one with greatly restricted powers . Confusion on Policy Yesterday , Edwin S. Smith , member of the board appearing before the investigating committee on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract arrangement . He disclaimed any knowledge of it or of the Attorney General 's informal ruling that a company has violated the labor act when cited by the Labor Board and not after the board 's order has been upheld by the court . In its report to the House this year , the Smith committee took the Labor Board to task for an attempt to have government contracts and government loans denied those charged with violating the labor act . The committee labelled this an effort to apply " extra-legal " sanctions . It also pointed out that when this question came before the comptroller general , the comp- , troller general r ' , 0.1. d there is no federal law I disqualifying toose charged with violating a / federal statute from doing business with the government . Although there still is some confusion as to the " blacklisting policy " and to the extent of its application , members of Congress ex- , pressed the belief that it carries out the early , attempt by the board to deny government business to those accused by the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not passed : on the validity of the board 's decision . F , , pr some time , labor representatives have been try- i ing to get through Congress a law I  --  hich would accomplish this end , but have had no success It was considered significant that the new development in the " blacklisting " picture came just as Congress completed the last of the defense appropriations . It now would be difficult for Congress to put through a resolution disapproving the policy . It would not have been so difficult , however , to attach a rider to one of the defense appropriations and countermand this policy . " Blacklisting " Scheme Denounced Representative Routzohn ( Rep , Ohio ) , and a member of the Smith investigating committee . placed in the House record yesterday a statement denouncing the " blacklisting " scheme . Many members of Congress expressed fear . privately , that this policy will interfere with the defense program , since it places the Labor Board in a position to determine , arbitrarily , whether a company can execute a defense contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law for this contribution to confusion , " Mr. Routzolan said of Mr. Jackson 's opinion . " In fact . Congress refused to pass such a law last year and the year before . The Attorney General 's informal opinion cited no law , no statute , no court decisions . " His message is a masterpiece of the kind of short cut ' reason ' with which the national socialists have confused logical and sensible people in giving to their lawless acts the disguise of legality . - " Thus , without sanction of law , does he seek to turn our national defense production over to the whims of this intriguing , communist-infested agency of the Administration , an agency that the record shows has gone out of its way to sabotage industry and create national disunity . " Mr. Routzhon then asked whether this was another " slick political trick on the eve of the election " or " another of those over-clever flank moves of the left wingers towards national socialism and the political ownership of property .
