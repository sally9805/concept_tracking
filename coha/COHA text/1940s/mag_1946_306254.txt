Three years ago a young book-publishing clerk named George Braziller decided to go into business for himself . He was broke . But he knew of a business where he would not need much money . So he borrowed $25 and started a book club , the Book Find Club . <P> He picked his own books from those already in print , got the plates from publishers and had the books printed , all on two months ' credit . He signed up customers who would take at least four of his selections a year at $1.35 each , pay for them promptly so that Braziller could then pay the publishers . His only expense was the postage on the books . <P> By last week the profitable Book Find Club had 70,000 members and 70 employes . It was splurging on an advertising campaign , which it hopes will sell $1,250,000 worth of books this year , boost membership to about 100,000 . <P> For these solid business reasons , which have little to do with literature , book clubs are now booming as never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Braziller 's . This year , the 25 U.S. book clubs will sell over 75,000,000 books and gross $100,000,000 , one-sixth of all U.S. book sales . The clubs ' rapid spread is due primarily to the simple fact that book clubs are the best means yet found to reduce publishing risks to a minimum . <P> Bonbons &; Books . The man who put this golden formula to work in the U.S. is nervous , precise Harry Scherman , 59 , a onetime free-lance writer . When he flopped at that , he went into advertising . For a client , he devised a plan to give away pocket-sized classics with each box of candy , was amazed to find later that 1,000,000 classics a year could be sold for 10 apiece without candy . <P> So in 1926 he started the Book-of-the-Month Club to tap this mass market . He rediscovered the ever-new old fact that Americans like to have culture sold to them . He set up a board of five cultural experts , to choose a book a month for B.O.M.C. members . B.O.M.C. now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for books , but get a book free with every two bought , and one for joining . President Scherman can afford the dividend . <P> Pay Dirt for Authors . He pays publishers 30 a copy to lease a book 's plates , has the book printed himself . He guarantees publishers minimum royalties of $100,000 , often pays much more . Example : he paid Publisher Appleton-Century about $150,000 for Arch of Triumph . The publisher split this fee with Author Erich Maria Remarque , just as all B.O.M.C. royalties are split with authors . <P> Exactly how much Scherman 's club makes is his own trade secret . But the retail value of all books distributed by B.O.M.C. last year , including book dividends , was $25,000,000 . Because of the dividends , bookmen guessed that B.O.M.C. did not take in more than $15,000,000 . Of this , they estimated that no more than $3,000,000 was spent on advertising , promotion and mailing ; another $2,000,000 for royalties ; another $5,000,000 to print the books . Bookmen concluded : of the remaining $5,000,000 , a substantial chunk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . This month he will launch a new advertising campaign , which he hopes will boost B.O.M.C. members over 1,000,000 , make it the biggest book club in the U.S.
