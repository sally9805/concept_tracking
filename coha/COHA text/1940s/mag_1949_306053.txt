Alfred Stieglitz was the best photographer ever to come down the pike . Until he died in 1946 , the spindly , black-caped little man was also a prophetic educator in the cause of modern art . His widow , Painter Georgia O'Keeffe , has carried on his educational work as executrix of his will by dividing Stieglitz ' brilliant art collection and his own even more brilliant photographs among six widely spaced institutions : Manhattan 's Metropolitan , Chicago 's Art Institute , Washington 's National Gallery , the Library of Congress , the Philadelphia Museum and Fisk University ( for Negroes ) in Tennessee . To house its share ( 101 modern paintings , Stieglitz photographs and African sculptures ) , Fisk remodeled its old gymnasium into a gallery at a cost of $25,000 and named it for a longtime friend of the university , Author Carl Van Vechten ( Nigger Heaven , The Tattooed Countess ) . Last week 900 people got together to celebrate the new gallery 's opening . <P> Georgia O'Keeffe , a plain-spoken lady who looks as severe as her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood up when called upon and said : ' ' This is a gift from Stieglitz . It is for the students of this university . I hope you will go and look at these paintings more than once . " <P> That was that . But the catalogue of the new gallery contained a one-paragraph foreword written by O'Keeffe which told something more about the Stieglitz approach to art education . The collection had been given to Fisk , she wrote , " with the hope that it may show that there are many ways of seeing and thinking , and possibly , through showing that there are many ways , give someone confidence in his own way . . .
