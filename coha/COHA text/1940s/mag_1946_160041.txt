One autumn day last week in Seton Village , N. Mex. , death came to a man who , in an age of sweeping mechanization , had loved the natural earth , its seasons and its creatures , with rare intensity and an unusual power to communicate his vision to others . To three generations of children whom his stories of wild life had introduced to the life of woods and fields , to naturalists indebted to the scope and minute fidelity of his discernments , Ernest Thompson Seton 's death was something like the falling of a forest tree . <P> He was born ( 1860 ) in a city-bleak South Shields , in Britain , the twelfth child of a family of 14 children . The trail ( he seldom used the words " road " or " path " ) that led him to the woods was long and hard . It led him first to Canada , where his study of nature was hampered by frontier chores , poverty , parental obstruction and poor health . Audubon 's bird paintings inspired his drawing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , where he lived chiefly on bread &; milk . Later he changed his venue ( to Manhattan ) , but not his diet . His animal drawings began to catch on . St. Nicholas magazine published some of his first output of animal stories . <P> Mighty Hunter . On the plains of Manitoba , the sickly youth grew to be a young giant . His normal walking pace was a killing five miles an hour . Then , on the high plains of New Mexico , he became a celebrated wolf hunter-in the tradition of one of his ancestors , Evan Cameron , whom he called " The mighty wolf hunter of the North . " His first popular books ( Wild Animals I Have Known and The Biography of a Grizzly ) sold hundreds of thousands of copies among captivated readers on both sides of the Atlantic . <P> The writer was established , but the naturalist was not . Naturalist John Burroughs called Naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton a nature faker . So the younger man wrote his learned , monumental ( eight volumes ) Lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later the John Burroughs Memorial Association made amends by giving the still-living naturalist a medal . <P> Then Ernest Thompson Seton had a vision that would restore all the youth of the world to nature . He blueprinted the organization of the Boy Scouts ( with whose high command he later quarreled ) . Almost inevitably , the life and nature worship of the Indians obsessed him more &; more . There seemed no other way out of civilization 's ills . <P> In 1930 , he moved to New Mexico , established a cult devoted to nature , Indian lore and Indian dancing . In tribal dress , he lectured daily , worked on unfinished books , built an adobe castle as a museum shrine . When he died , he was planning a 10,000-mile lecture tour .
