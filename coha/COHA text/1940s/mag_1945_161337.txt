One sunny morning , at a North Carolina crossroads marked by a ruined chapel on a hill , a traveler climbed wearily from his horse . There , in the shade of a big poplar tree , William Richardson Davie , the future governor of the state , took a long , cool draught from the jug beside him , and gazed about . " Here , " he said to himself , " we will put our new university . " <P> Last week , more than 150 years later , the ivy-covered Davie Poplar still stood on the campus at Chapel Hill as a clutch of topflight U.S. educators ( among them 14 college presidents , including Harvard 's James Bryant Conant ) gathered to hold the annual meeting of the Association of American Universities and to help the University of North Carolina celebrate its 150th birthday . ( North Carolina 's party had been in progress since 1939 : celebrating first the 150th anniversary of its charter grant , then of its cornerstone laying , etc . ) Proud old University of Georgia says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisputed claim to the event it celebrates this week : it was the first U.S. state university to open its doors . <P> Except for the five years it was closed by carpetbaggers , North Carolina has been a leading U.S. school , is now generally regarded as the outstanding state university in the South . The fact that its prestige is at its highest today is largely the result of one man : its tiny ( 5 ft. 5 in. ) , jut-jawed , 59-year-old eleventh president , Frank Porter Graham . <P> Reformer . Dr. Frank , as his students call him , inherited from his hardy Scottish ancestors a scrappy spirit , a canny business head , and a set of literal Presbyterian morals . A bachelor until he was 45 , Dr. Frank neither smokes nor drinks . As an undergraduate at Chapel Hill he was a rugged little St. George , who led pious forays against the roughnecks whose doxies plied their trade in Chapel Hill graveyard . He was nonetheless twice elected president of his class . In 1917 , after taking an M.A. at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record . <P> He returned to Chapel Hill in 1921 , as a full professor of history . The university was down-at-heel ; young Graham was assigned to beg money . Traveling by bus and train , he went into every one of North Carolina 's 100 counties , returned with $5,500,000 to present to his boss , President Harry Chase ( now chancellor of N.Y.U. ) . The opinions he formed on that trip , on what his state needed , have made him a hair shirt to reactionary Tar Heel industrialists ever since . Many of the state 's progressive labor laws were incubated by him . <P> In 1930 the university 's 100-man board of trustees elected him president , but Frank Graham , happy in his professorship , said no . How he changed his mind is a story that is as unworldly as most stories about Graham : he met a marine buddy on the street who challenged him into accepting by appealing to the old Corps tie : " Frank , marines do n't run away from tough going . " <P> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vice president , visited Durham , ate dinner in a restaurant with English Professor Franklin Carl Erickson . A committee of angry trustees descended on Graham , demanded that he fire Erickson . He answered : " If Professor Erickson has to go on a charge of eating with another human being , then I will have to go first . "
