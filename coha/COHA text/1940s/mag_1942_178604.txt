With the exception of Whirlaway , who is still lounging at California 's blacked-out Santa Anita , nearly every glamor horse in the U.S. was entered in Florida 's Widener Handicap , richest race of the winter season . <P> From California came Charles S. ( Seabiscuit ) Howard 's Mioland and William L. Brann 's Challedon , who between them have copped over $500,000 of the turf 's purses . There was Market Wise , the rags-to-riches son of Broker 's Tip , who has put fabulous profits into his owner 's pocket . There was Attention , a worthy son of the late , great Equipoise ; and young Alsab , who had won more than $100,000 in one year of racing . Never before had a winter classic attracted such an all-star field . It was also an unusually large field . At the post were 17 starters . <P> In a large field , even the smartest jockey can not always keep a good horse from being pocketed or jostled . The 25,000 racing fans at Hialeah Park , more closely crowded than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumps , then necks and necks . On the far turn the horses were bunched like a hand of bananas . Coming into the stretch , the first ten could have been covered with a blanket . But the favorites were too near the stem . Market Wise , the people 's choice , got lost in the early shuffle . <P> In a stretch run that looked like Rosa Bonheur 's Horse Fair , &; floppy-eared chestnut pulled farther &; farther in front . It was Mrs. Payne Whitney 's The Rhymer , a four-year-old who-despite the fact that he was ridden by Eddie Arcaro , smartest jockey in the business-had been listed among " the field " in the pari-mutuel betting. - At the finish line The Rhymer was a head in front of Best Seller , a 58-to-1 shot . Third was Olympus , another " field horse . " <P> For long-shot punters , the race was a bonanza . Those who had played the field got $32.80 for $2 . Those who picked Best Seller to finish second got $53.20 . It was also a great day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who got a $5,000 bonus for saddling the winner . Gaver had had no intention of starting The Rhymer in such fast company . But when Samuel Riddle 's War Relic was scratched the day before the race , leaving Jockey Eddie Arcaro without a mount , Gaver decided to take a chance . " It goes to show , " said he , " that if you do n't aim at the moon once in a while , you 'll never hit it . " <P> Said Jockey Arcaro : " I said this morning I hoped the best horse would n't win and it did n't . " <P> <P> *Because the pari-mutuel setup is geared for only twelve horses , when there are 13 or more horses running , two or more of the less formidable contenders are grouped as " the field . "
