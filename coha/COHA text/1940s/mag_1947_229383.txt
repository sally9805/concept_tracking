When Field Marshal General Keitel was sentenced as a war criminal , General Ike Eisenhower was asked : Do you think you would have been hanged if the Nazis had won the war ? Said Ike : " Such thoughts you have . " <P> In Nrnberg last week the U.S. posed the same question for U.S. businessmen who had armed the U.S. war machine . The U.S. indicted 24 former German industrialists , all officials of I. G. Farben Co. , as war criminals , the first such indictment against businessmen in history . Among those whom it placed in the same category as Hitler and Gring were Farben 's board chairman Hermann Schmitz and Georg von Schnitzler , sales manager , who were mainly responsible for the growth of Farben into the world 's most powerful chemical giant . The U.S. charged the 24 civilians with fomenting and waging aggressive war , mass murder , plunder and " complete synchronization " with the Nazi High Command . The burden of the indictment was that , without Farben , the Nazis could not have m , ade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six U.S. corporations and to some 500 others throughout the world , the U.S. charged that " Hitler . . . and Farben found a basis for close collaboration as early as 1932 . Hitler came to power with generous financial assistance from Farben and . . . Farben 's foreign agents formed the core of Nazi intrigue throughout the world . . . . Ostensibly acting only as businessmen , they carried on propaganda and espionage activities indispensable to German preparation for and waging of aggressive war . " <P> Most damning charge was that Farben experimented on slave labor and concentration camp inmates with " deadly gases , vaccines and related products . " To supply slave labor for its synthetic rubber plant at Oswiecim , Farben allegedly constructed a concentration camp and worked the men , women &; children so hard that an estimated 100 a day died from exhaustion . <P> Most important , to U.S. companies was the old charge that Farben had weakened the U.S. by cartel agreements with Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey to restrict synthetic rubber development , with Aluminum Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Du Pont subsidiary to prevent export of tetrazene ( an explosive ) to Britain in 1941 . <P> The U.S. would have no trouble proving that the Nazis could not have made war without Farben . But it would not be so easy to prove which of Farben 's prewar activities had been respectable , if ruthless , business practice and which had been criminal warmaking . Nor would U.S. industrialists agree that Farben 's deals with U.S. companies had hampered the U.S. war potential . They have maintained that they got from Farben more industrial secrets than they gave . After years of argument , the point was still arguable . <P> But the moral problem which the indictment raised was plain . If Farben was proved guilty , did those who had dealt with Farben share the guilt ? If wars could not be fought without the help of industrialists , then were not businessmen , in the final analysis , the real warmakers ? That was what the U.S. War Crimes Commission seemed to hold in its newest Nrnberg indictment .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
