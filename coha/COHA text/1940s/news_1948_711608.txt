txt The most charitable interpretation of the vote of the American Legion Convention delegates for a resolution proposing a pension of $60 a month for all armed services veterans at the age of 55 ( to be raised to $75 a month at the age of 65 ) is that those who cast the 2,025 votes in favor did n't realize what they were doing . The action was taken at Miami against the policy of the leadership which had been able to suppress previous attempts to vote a bonus or a pension , on the grounds that this would undermine the Legion 's influence at Washington in seeking more liberal benefits for disabled veterans , which it certainly will . We hope some means is found to have the Legion membership take a sober second look and reverse the action of the convention . This is what the Legion 's proposal would mean if voted into law at the coming session of Congress : Immediate addition to the pension rolls at $60 to $75 a month of at least half of the estimated 3,700,000 veterans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 55 years . This would mean an immediate addition to the present $7,800,000,000 . budget for veterans affairs of perhaps as much as $1,500,000,000 . All Civil War veterans and all Spanish-American War and Philippine Insurrection veterans who are not now receiving benefits would automatically be added to the rolls at the top figure , since the average age of Spanish-American war veterans is now 72 . There would be a gradual increase in these pension figures to an astronomical amount as the survivors of the 15,700,000 veterans of the Second World War reached the pension age . The Legion action raises two questions which we do not believe the delegates stopped to ponder before they voted . The first is , how great a tax burden can the veteran ask the general public to assume to give him special benefits ? Second , in placing a dollar value on his wartime services , is the Legionnaire thinking of himself primarily as a citizen or primarily as a veteran ? No other country in the world has so well rewarded the citizens who have worn its uniform and fought its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the best fed , the best clothed , the best armed , the most entertained and the best paid . As veterans they have been given the largest bonuses , the most and the best hospital service , the most educational benefits , the most liberal loan and insurance allowances . The country 's care of its disabled veterans has not always been of the best , but even there the record is better than that of other nations ? and it should be . But , in the name of reason , there must be a limit to what the veteran can expect . Those who were disabled as a consequence of war service should have the best possible care . But a blanket pension plan such as the Legion has voted raises the question , what price patriotism ? If not repealed it can do incalculable harm to the good things the Legion does in its Americanism programs , its defense programs , its program in this state for racial tolerance , its other fine activities .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
