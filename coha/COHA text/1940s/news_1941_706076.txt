txt To meet their rising labor costs , the railroads probably will try to get " emergency " action on a freight rate increase . They intend to file a blanket rate increase schedule with the Interstate Commerce Commission early next week . As part of this petition . they expect to invoke the so-called seven-day clause . This is a plan by which freight rate increases can go into effect within a week after the new schedule is presented The I C.0 has authority to permit this . This authority is discretionary , however . Passenger rate increases are also in the offing . but no such speedy action will be sought by the carriers on this matter Under the Commission regulations for increasing freight rates , higher tariffs can be obtained in periods of from : One day , seven days ; 30 days : CIO days . and six months from date of filing the new tariffs . Expected to Ask Blanket Increase It is believed that the railroads are going to ask for a blanket increase in all rates . rather than varying increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the quickest method by which additional revenue could be obtained . Any inequalities between commodities could be ironed out after the rates were in effect . and any necessary refunds could be made by the railroads , it is declared .

For this reason freight rate increases can not be made retroactive . Objections Likely to Develop In invoking the seven-day clause under the LC C. regulations , the railroads would be applying for emergency relief . Objections to the higher rates probably would develop from a number of sources . If these objections were sustained by the Commission , the railways would have to make refunds . Some rail executives were displeased by the naming of a committee of 20 to plan what action to take on rates . The feeling is that this is too large a committee to obtain rapid action .

Divided on Passenger Fares The question of the amount of passenger fare increase has caused a division of opinion among the various railrOads . It is admitted by most of the roads that some increase in fares should be sought The east , it is believed , wants to increase fares by 10,4 and the west and south by only some In addition there also is the question of whether commutation fares should be raised at this time . One of the principal delays in seeking and obtaining higher passenger fares is the problem of working out new rates . Much of the delay in getting higher revenues from this business win depend on how quickly the tariff men can set up a new schedule . One of the difficult problems is fares to and from and through parts of Canada Fares in Canada are frozen and will not be affected by any increase in this country Because of this , tariff experts must set up rates an that a traveler can not travel through Canada on part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller cost than by going between the points by keeping entirely within this country .
