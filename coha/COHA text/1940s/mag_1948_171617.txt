Now that doctors have made it possible for people to live longer , their next problem is to make old age tolerable . This week , in Live Long and Like It ( Public Affairs Committee ; 20 ) , a doctor whose specialty is old age suggested a few helpful hints . The author : Dr. C. Ward Crampton , 70 , chairman of the New York County Medical Society 's committee on geriatrics and gerontology . <P> A man does not grow old in one package , says Dr. Crampton . A man of 65 may have a 40-year-old heart , 50-year-old kidneys , an 80-year-old liver , and try to live the life of a 30-year-old . A specialist should find out just where old age has got in its worst licks . The examination should include a search for damaged organs , and a psychological study of the patient 's worries and hopes . Then the doctor should recommend " antiaging " devices . For instance , diet : at 60 most men need more protein , calcium , iron than men of 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointers : exercise to give a man a " high head , a flat belly , a capable heart " ; care in the use of alcohol , which is " a dangerous enemy , an agreeable acquaintance , and a helpful friend . " Doctors should tell their elderly patients whether a drink would help them ( alcohol is a vasodilator , relaxing the coronary arteries ) or hurt them ( cocktails are bad for arthritics ) . Being overweight is not really a problem of old age , says Dr. Crampton , for fat men seldom live that long . But the public should put more of its money into research into chronic diseases , which make old age miserable . The U.S. , says Dr. Crampton , has been spending $22 per death for cancer research , $13,000 per death for infantile paralysis , and only a few cents per victim for the most common killer of all , diseases of the heart and arteries . <P> In Wolverhampton , England , Dr. J. H. Sheldon , director of medicine in the Royal Hospital , made a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old men are either in very bad health or very good health for their age , and fairly constant about it , while aging women showed a steady reduction in general health .
