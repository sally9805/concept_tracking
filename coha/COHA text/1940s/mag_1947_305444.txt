When The Green Pastures opened on Broadway in 1930 , Variety thought it was " dreadfully lacking in box-office ability , " predicted that " a ten-week stay ... should be sufficient . " Variety was dreadfully wrong . Alexander Woollcott , guessing better in the New Yorker , said it was " the highest peak in the range of the American theater . " Brooks Atkinson , in the Times , called it " the divine comedy of the modern theater . " The Green Pastures ( based on Roark Bradford 's stories ) won a Pulitzer Prize , ran for five years , played 1,779 performances in 203 cities to nearly two million people , grossed $3,000,000 , was turned into a movie , and attained the status of an American folk-legend . <P> It also earned a tidy sum and an abiding reputation as playwright and director for Marcus Cook Connelly . He has never risen to such heights since-he has spent his time writing or directing a couple of minor successes and a couple of major turkeys , acting a bit , devising Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week , at 56 , Marc Connelly took on a new job : associate professor of playwriting in Yale 's graduate School of Fine Arts , succeeding 68-year-old Walter Prichard Eaton . Connelly , who never went to college himself , will teach " Drama 47 , " a " professional " course started and made famous ( at Harvard , then at Yale ) by the late Professor George P. Baker . He will help 15 students dissect each others ' plays ; Yale will produce the best ones . <P> Connelly , bald , portly and more solemn with the years , is very serious about what he considers an exciting chance to develop the " theater as a social force " at Yale . Says he : " I hope my students wo n't be just writing for Broadway . I hope they 'll be writing for the world . "
