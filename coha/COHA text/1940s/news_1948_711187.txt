txt Five divers told today how a sunken treasure ship trapped them for two hours in the black deeps of the Atlantic as they hunted the wreck ' s 8 million dollar cargo . The story excited this waterfront , but listeners had to be satisfied with sketchy details from the veteran divers who escaped from 120 feet down yesterday , in cold seas off Cape Cod . Tom Griffin was credited by the others with their rescue after two hours of exhausting struggle in the depths . Wool Bales shift Edward Lane of Somerville , one of three brothers seeking the manganese cargo of a frater torpedoed in war time , was the first pinned helpless in the hulk when shifting bales of wool tangled his lines . Then three other divers came down to his aid  --  Walter Silveira of Boston , Thomas Sacco of Springfield , and Clarry Edwards of New Bedford . One by one they were bowled over in the blackness . One would free his lines and those of the mate he 'd reached first and then the rocking wreck would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lane said , ' and finally we were all cleared and able to go up . Tom worked two hours doing it and he 'd already spent an hour down there on his first shift .

Edwards said : " It was awful . I hope it 's all the tough luck we ' re going to have . ' The treasure hunters will try again , Lane said , because : ' We ' ve had bad luck with leaks , That 's why we had to put in here today . But if we had a vessel we could depend on , there ' d be nothing to raising that eight million dollars ,
