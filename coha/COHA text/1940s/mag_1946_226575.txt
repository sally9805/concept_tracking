In the air-freight business , crowded with weak chicks , an eagle appeared last week . American Airlines Board Chairman Cyrus Rowlett Smith announced that American intended to operate " an effective nonscheduled air cargo service . " Its " effectiveness " caused shivers to 2,730 new small operators , many of whom are veterans flying surplus planes . They now charge an average of 20 a ton mile . American plans to carry cargo at rates ranging from 18 down to the unheard-of low of 11 a ton mile for big shipments on long hauls . <P> Nonscheduled carriers cried that this was a rate war to drive them out of business . It would not be so much a war as a massacre . Most nonscheduled carriers operate on a shoe string ; American had millions to pour into the fight . <P> Airmen doubted whether American itself could make any money carrying freight at 11 a ton mile . American claimed it could , if it got enough business . But most airmen thought that American was less interested in profits now than in killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , was well aware that he might be accused of putting veterans out of business ; he hastened to defend American 's air cargo plans . In full-page newspaper ads he pinned a discharge emblem on American by pointing out that it employed 6,000 veterans , was therefore " the largest veterans group in air transportation . " The little business veterans , who would prefer to be the largest group themselves , were not impressed with the general 's logic .
