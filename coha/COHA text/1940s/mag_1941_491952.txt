27 the flash of real jewels , pinned across her chest , as one often sees them now , with no thought of decorative effect , but of preservation . She was an example of the power the war has exercised to change the look of the world in ways not to be accounted for by cause and effect . She might  --  and during the last few days I have seen many Londoners of whom this could be said ? have stepped out of Phiz 's illustrations of Dickens . " Was anybody hurt ? " asked the woman in front of me . " Not one of my little household , " answered the other . " Not my dear , funny old husband , and there was my father  --  such a sweet , funny old darling he is  --  he 's seventy-six  --  and my maid here " ? she indicated her companion " my dear Clara , who 's just like a sister to me . " Clara acknowledged the presentation with a jaunty nod . Tall and spare , she was epicene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lace that made a protest of femininity that was overruled by the rest of her . She wore a flat straw hat at an angle of fifty-five degrees to her forehead , and from the pale , boyish face in its shadow a cigarette projected as steeply as an antiaircraft gun . Her manner suggested that she was imitating an American marine as seen on the screen . Homeless But Happy A T THE house we found last night , they took us in , all four of us , as if we were dear friends they 'd known all their lives , " her employer went on , " and we went to sleep so happy , and when we woke up in the morning we looked round us , afraid that perhaps we had thought it all better than it was , because we were all so glad to get to bed somewhere . But it was just as we had seen it ; the man and his wife were so charming and the house was so clean and pietty , and we were just as happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief bus . Clara shoved us aboard in a protective masculine fashion . We passed an apiary where , in days that were , if possible , happier than this happy day , our voluptuary had bought some honey that had been exceptionally , preternaturally delicious ; and later , a roadhouse brought her recollections of happy summer evenings , of a swimming pool that had been the right temperature , that had even reminded her of the Riviera . Between us , Clara puffed cynically and indulgently at her cigarette . We were getting near Greycliffe , a prosperous white-collar suburb . " I shall cry when I see my lovely old garden , " said the voluptuary comfortably . " Oh , dear , I 'm so glad my sons are n't here . This would have upset them terribly , particularly the young one . He 's so terribly sensitive . He 's just over seventeen , and when the war broke out , he said , ' Mother , I ca n't stand this . I 'm going to Scotland . ' I thought it showed remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a pacifist , ever since he was a tiny child . So 's my other one , even though he 's joined up . He wrote me the most beautiful letter the other day , saying that he hoped that after all this was over , the youth of the world would join together to see that war never happened again . ' We must all , ' he said , ' take a deep breath and say " No ! " and if anybody went on wanting to fight , just burst out laughing . ' " Clara had thrown away her cigarette , screening her face from her employer with the hand that held it , and , having caught my eye , was grimacing horribly and holding her nose between the thumb and ( Continued on Page 48 ) forefinger of her other hand . It was not possible to doubt that she considered these two youths as effeminate , vaporing , chickenhearted and insincere . " And mind you , " her unconscious employer was proceeding , " I 'm a pacifist myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've any right , ever , to make war . I 'm sure it could always be prevented . I do n't believe anybody 's really wicked . If Hitler 's done wicked things , it must be because he 's been provoked into doing them . I blame the Jews very much for never having found some way of appealing to Hitler 's better self . There must have been some way by which he could have been made to feel what a great big silly he was making of himself . We 've often talked this over in our own sweet little kitchen , have n't we , Clara ? She often let me have tea in there with her when everybody was out , did n't you , Clara ? " " Town Hall , " said Clara , and pushed her out into the gangway . Before she herself left she turned to me , raised her eyebrows , tapped her forehead , shrugged her shoulders , sighed , and chuckled . Certainly she had talent . It was dazzlingly evident that , in her opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such a good sort that she meant to stand by the poor old cluck , come what might . But she had taken as an individual quirk of her employer 's a type of thought widespread and respected to such a degree that men had been hailed as great for professing it . There is nothing , really , in Tolstoyan pacifism that the lady from Greycliffe had not expressed . Even could it be said that there was nothing more in the pacifism of Mr. Bertrand Russell 's earlier days . Near the center of London I got out at the nearest point to my house  --  a corner where a row of tall white houses , inhabited by the rich and great , meets a main thoroughfare of dingy , plebeian , bustling shops . At the angle of their meeting is a clock tower . In the center of the clock face was a dark hole . The hands were apparently proceeding from nothingness . I turned the corner and saw that the mews behind the tall houses were no longer there . Neither was the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twisted piles of rubbish . Above them hung clouds of smoke , which were being probed by the tall pothooks of water jets from the firemen 's hose . Good Luck Mixed With Bad Some of the tall houses had had their backs ripped away . Furniture overhung the raw edges of the floors like stalactites , pale wallpapers looked light-minded and fatuous . Every window in the main thoroughfare was gone , mere black gaps , both in the shops and in the flats above them . The gutters were full of the blue-gray drifts of broken glass we see so often these days . There Was much coming and going , and all the people looked like doctors and nurses that have been working all night on difficult cases , their features drawn close to the bone . I turned to the right and saw that all the streets in the direction of my home had been ravaged . There was not a whole window within sight . Here and there a house had been gutted , and the light inhabited it with fantaste freedom , unconfined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a ragged interruption in a row , a hole from which traces of debris straggled away . When I had walked a block I passed a jolly woman sweeping some glass out of her house onto the pavement , and I asked , " What was it ? A thousand pounder ? " She said , " When it went off , I thought my back teeth would fall out . " " Well , " I said , " to make up for it , would you like a cauliflower ? " M3 basket was getting very heavy . " Indeed I would , " she said . " Why , it 's a fine one . Why are you giving it away ? Well , I 'm glad I 'm having a little good luck to mix with the bad . " " Still a Bit of London Left " . I was wondering whether my apartment also might not have been destroyed , and my husband with it . My wonder did not become panic , because I knew there was a fair chance that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better find out what I could now , before I went any farther . So I halted by an air warden who was standing by a barricade which had closed a street on fire , and waited till he had finished talking to a woman who owned one of the burning houses and writing down what she told him in a notebook . She was a very elegant woman , with curled silver hair under a gay black tricorne , and a scarlet jumper under her suit that annulled one of the most curious visual effects of the war , which is as striking as its underlining of people 's traits . A bombed house puts every note of color round it clean out of action . A raided area is as low in tone as an old-fashioned photograph . When the warden was free I asked him if the apartment house where I live was still standing , and he answered , " It 's as right as rain . There 's still a bit of London left , you know . " And there , when I turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its red roof solid above the treetops in our square . Part of a beautiful crescent , classical in its curve , was still burning , part of it already burned . I noticed , among the ruined houses , the home of an Irishman I knew , one of two sinister brothers from my father 's county , cold and merciless adventurers with warm manners and the peculiar shabbiness of those who have failed in ambitions which it would have been discreditable to have realized . The other brother 's house , in quite a different part of London , had been destroyed two nights before . Destiny strikes through aerial warfare with greater malice than ordinary hazard provides . The same people will be bombed out of their houses once , twice , thrice ; a family scattered over London will be struck through all its members . Another house in the crescent belonged to a superb person , an American scholar and a gentleman , who had in his time worked hard to prevent this war . During his tenure of a great office in Czechoslovakia he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans . His home had been full of fine , rich possessions , but over the loss of these he would not distress himself overmuch , though he loathes me saw such reassurance in his shattered house as my simpler self had found in the mass of our apartment house . " So you 're still here , " I said to the porter I met in the hall . " Just that , " he said , " with nothing to spare . I tell you the building swayed like a hammock . And the blast got into that underground passage that runs between the two courtyards , and it blew the head porter flat on his face He 's in bed with shock . " I sent the casualty my sympathetic regards , and used the house telephone to speak to Helen , the friend who , bombed out of her lodgings , has come , with her mother , to live with us for the duration of the war . She is a Scottish-Canadian , small and gallant , extremely able , a photographer by profession , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she sounded dispirited . No , she said , it had n't sounded much worse than many other bombs . " Well , there 's something , " I pressed . " Perhaps it is that we 're still off gas and water , " she said . " It 's depressing , but we 'll talk over everything when you come in for lunch . " So I went off , and it is part of my grievance that I can not say what I did next . I have never been one of those who , when asked for a week-end visit , murmur , " I am sorry , but I have promised to go and stay with some people on Long Island . " Promptly I say that I shall be with the Joneses at Port Washington . This candor is not due to any moral quality of an elevated nature ; it is simply that , baffled as I am by the universe , I like to peg down the elusiveness of experience by recording it as definitely as possible . I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a faithful log of my wartime day ; it would throw a light on a phase of the war as it affects others than myself . But because of the hideous fact of aerial warfare , I have to suppress an innocent and interesting fact . Another House Guest When I entered my apartment I held the telephone receiver to my ear and heard a noise as of someone dead , beating on an equally spectral tin can . For three weeks now we had been off the telephone . I made an exclamation of annoyance , which I checked on realizing that it had , in fact , been hardly a hardship at all . While I was taking off my coat , my husband came out of the kitchen . After greeting me with a wild perfunctoriness , he said , " Your Cousin Eva has a time bomb outside her flat , so she has gone to live in the settlement where she works , and she has left with us the Austrian refugee who has been living with her . A girl called Rachel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , his gaze , implied that this was an immense space of time . " Is she one of Eva 's lame dogs ? " I asked . She is indeed , " he answered . We had often remarked that Eva 's protkg6es , though she describes them as lame dogs , might fur more justly be described Its lame cobras , or even lame skunks . I went into the kitchen We always eat there now , for we have only a daily charwoman now , and Helen and her mother , Mrs. Mactavish , cook all meals on an oilstove and on the top of an oil heater . It is always pleasant when we meet for lunch , for I come up only for twenty-four hours a week , and we are fond of one another and have much to talk about . The charwoman , who has been with me for fifteen years , hovers about with a teacup in her hand , too full of class feeling to sit down , but actually one of the family . The picture today , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking more like Whistler 's mother than Helen 's . Helen herself was cooking silently , instead of chirruping like a little Gaelic canary in her technician 's joy at doing something well . The charwoman was not there at all . In the cook 's armchair sat the lame dog , reading Vasiliev 's History of the Byzantine Empire . She was a very stout girl in her early twenties , with a roguishly contemptuous expression . This is my wife , " said my husband , as one who fears hostile comment . " I am so glad that you have come , " I said . " It is hard luck that you should have had to turn out of your quarters . " " It is very hard luck , " answered the lame dog . " I have to leave Vienna for Prague , and then I have to leave Prague for Amsterdam , and then I have to leave Amsterdam for London , and they say that here I will never have to move , because the defenses are so good . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck on me . " Biting the Snore That Feeds One I noticed that my husband was not busying himself , as he usually does on these days before a meal , in frying potatoes on the oil heater or making the salad dressing . He had sat down quietly and was drawing his hand across his head . " Was my cousin much upset when they dropped the bomb ? " I asked . " Yes , yes , indeed , " said the lame dog , laughing heartily . " It could not he otherwise ; she is so very neurotic . It shows in so many ways . About her famous insomnia , for example . Every night , in the shel ter , she sleeps soundly , no matter how many bombs fall and how badly the guns fire , and when she comes up to me , she says , ' I have been awake the whole night ; I have not closed my eyes . ' And sometimes she has not only slept , she has snored . It is very amusing . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed one . " Lunch is ready , " said Helen , without conviviality . We gathered about the ' table for a meal that would be considered good at any time  --  for Helen is an exquisite cook  --  but which was miraculous in these circumstances . " Ha-ha-ha ! " laughed the lame dog , ns the vegetables were set down on the table . " Always the Brussels sprouts , in England always the Brussels sprouts . You two have traveled . You know what wonderful food we have in Austria . You can guess what torture your monstrous diet is to us Austrians . " We said nothing , and she took a long , slow drink of tea , her eyes rolling round her above the circle of her upturned cup . My kitchen badly needed repainting , and the decorators had been due to come in , but I canceled the order when war broke out , partly because it seemed an unpatriotic use of labor , partly because I feared that aerial warfare might undo the work as soon as it was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the raids bring in clouds of dust , and we have to use stronger and stronger cleansing powder , so the wood is showing through the paint . " I see , " said the lame dog merrily , " that you are too busy with your career to care much about domestic things . Well , I suppose I should be the same  --  for I , too , am an intellectual  --  had I not been brought up in a most beautiful home , with a mother who thought much  --  oh , fur too much -- about such things . " There was a pause , and my husband and I spoke humbly about other things , and Helen joined fierily in . But we gave the lame dog her chance by offering her a second helping of Hamburg steak . " No , no. no . No , indeed ! " she chuckled , shaking her head as if reminding us that once bitten , twice shy . And once she interrupted us to point toward the dresser at some jars of pickled quinces that Helen had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that a little bubble that tells bad news ? Are they not fermenting , no ? " Shuddering with rage , I said , before I realized that what I said was , in fact , perfectly true , " No . That is a flaw in the glass . " The front-door bell rang , and I went to open it . Eva stepped in , looking past rne , as she looks past everyone closely connected with her , to the distant objects of her charity . " I have come to see how Rachel is getting on , " she said . " You will like having her with you ; she is an unusual girl . " " I do n't quite understand why she is here , " I said . " It is the only thing to be done , " answered Eva . " In two days ' time , if the time bomb outside my flat has not exploded or been removed , I will take rooms at the Burnham Court Hotel . They have a very good shelter there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with the pathetic gaze , truculent and terrified , of the spoiled child that has grown up and can not understand why its sovereignty has passed from it . The eldest of a generation , she was allowed to bully all her juniors in the nursery , and now she runs about the world seeking for opportunities to make people do what they would prefer to leave undone . As people often do not wish to do what is morally admirable and practically advisable , Eva often renders real services to humanity by this impulse . But even when this is not the case , she can persuade herself and others that it is , with a plausibility which is the result of her passionate desire to be the little girl who is always top of the class , who always gets the good-conduct medal . To prove her wrong would be to strike at the roots of her being , to annihilate all there is of her , so nobody ever does it . I merely said , " It is not very convenient , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of despair under continued persecution which told me that in a second or two I would be beaten . The Sneer That Hurt " But why is n't it very convenient ? " she asked . " I do n't think you realize quite what it 's like trying to get on with my work and being cut off from all my things at the flat . It 's only two days . I do think you might do something to help . " She took it that it was settled , and added , " Now I would like to see Rachel . " I turned away obediently , as everybody in our family would have done , and went to the kitchen and asked the lame dog to go out to her . " Ach , your poor cousin ! " she said as she went out , laughing heartily . I sat down at the table and Helen gave me a ( mall cup of tea , because mine had grown a little cold . She is careful of other people 's comfort . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that girl sneers at my daughter 's cooking , " and her voice broke , not with a tragical sob but with a little childish crack . She is eighty-seven , she has had a life full of disappointments , she has been spared nothing of the blitzkrieg , and she has never before given the faintest whimper of dismay . " Oh , shucks , " said Helen . " I never learned to cook , I just picked it up as I went along on the ranch , and maybe the stuff 's not so hot , and if she does n't want to say ' thank you , ' she need n't . But all the same , she 's terrible . She raised Cain in the shelter last night with some of the other Jews . They were out to be nice to her , and asked her if she belonged to any of those societies they have , and she was downright nasty to them . She said that being Jewish meant nothing to her , and that she never felt herself a Jewess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the synagogue was just stupid . That old Miss Solomon did not like it at all . " An Unappreciative Refugee " Yes , that was quite disagreeable , " my husband mildly agreed . After we had all drunk some more tea and tried to talk of something else , he continued , " Really , you know , this is a very tiresome young woman . Yesterday I asked her whether she had reported her change of address to the police , and she told me that she did not mean to do so , that such trivialities were perfect nonsense , and that it was absurd of our government to subject refugees to them , since they must be anti-Nazi or they would not be refugees . " I groaned , for this opinion stamps any alien who holds it as an obstructive idiot . No sane person expects a country at war which finds itself harboring a vast number of persons of alien nationality not to keep a check on them ; and the wide-awake refugees know well that among their apparent partners in suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany to spy on them . " I did not argue with her , " my husband went on . " I simply said that , for her sake and our sake , the law must be obeyed . She got extremely sulky , and I left it at that . Then , when I came in just before lunch , I asked her if she had been to the police station this morning , and , to my embarrassment , she answered that she had , but with a look of cunning , mixed with contempt for me , that made one feel fairly sure that she had never bothered to go near the place . " This kind of folly might involve us in all sorts of trouble . I got up and said , " That is past a joke . I will go out and tell Eva that we can not keep this girl any longer , even for two nights . " But in the passage I met the lame dug coming back alone . " Has my cousin gone ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stayed only a little while , and then she hurried away , till nerves and all fidgets . I think there is nobody in the whole world so frightened of air raids as your poor cousin . " The lame dog took up her book again and settled down in the cook 's armchair , still chuckling over my cousin 's weaknesses . I was were aware that the others trying to be fair and not feel it was my fault . My husband rose from the lunch table quite a quarter of an hour before his usual time , saying , " Well , my dear , I must be going back to the ministry . " Helen said , " Mother , fill your hot-water bottle and you can go and lie down . " Mrs. Mactavish complained , in the wistful , shivered crystal of her old voice , " Well , I 'll not sleep . This afternoon I know I 'll not sleep . " I wished I could tell them that I knew why Eva had run out on us . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why should I , the best girl in the school , the one that gets all the prizes , have a time bomb on my doorstep , while you people , who are not nearly so good , are allowed to go on living in your home , among your own things , where you 're accustomed to live ? Here , take this , take Rachel , and you 'll have something , not a time bomb , but still something that will destroy this shocking , this unjust disparity of our lots . " For Eva is no fool , and I was certain that , in a part never quite subdued in her passion for goad works , she knew exactly what Rachel was . I began to wonder whether it was true that to understand all was to pardon all . Presently I went out shopping in the way we do these days , for things which have of late become urgently necessary , but remain unlovable . I had to chase from drugstore to drugstore for an adequate supply of sassafras oil , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia to our village , because we have a number of evacuated children , and sassafras oil has a lethal effect on the head vermin that springs up with lightning rapidity among any uprooted population . After that I went to buy a new hat , not for the old reason that I wanted to buy myself a new face , but because all the hats I possess have brims , and I find them uncomfortable to wear , now that I am always carrying parcels . So I went to Debenham and Freebody in Wigmore Street , and tried on turbans . In the triple mirror , though I was quite unconscious of having been greatly affected by the air raids , I saw that I had aged five years in the last two months . But I realized that few things could be of slighter importance . While I was pondering which of three turbans I should take , whistles were blown alt over the shop , and the assistant said , " Now we must go downstairs into our shelters . I am not allowed to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right overhead . " In the Milliner 's Shelter I said , " But I live not far away . I think I will try for it . " Her lips compressed as if she felt nausea , and she said , " I should n't risk it . " Plainly , she was remembering something she had seen , so I obeyed . She opened a door , the existence of which I had not suspected , though I had known this store for twenty-five years , and we joined a crowd that was passing down a ramp into the pale , wide cement entrails of the building . At last one saw fitters holding themselves uptight , with no pins in their mouths , and one saw the machinists , whom one had never seen before , and there were many little girls of fifteen and sixteen , fresh as flowers , curled and powdered for a terrific campaign against the male that was sometimes innocently and always optimistically conceived . The stream divided into two , for there was one shelter for customers and another for employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual blank cellar that has become the setting of so much of our lives , beside a woman df thirty or so , with a sleek golden head and a gay , light voice , like the tinkling of ice in a glass . We talked , for we are all talkative now , and we found that she , too , lived in the country , and that she had several vacuhes with dirty heads , which she found impossible to cleanse . But it turned out she had been treating them with quassia chips , an old-fashioned remedy of complete ineffectiveness , so I was able to recommend to her oil of sassafras and tell her where she could get it . I might , in times of peace , have been able to get the same sort of prestige with her by telling her where she could get Lanvin 's scent at wholesale prices . if Rebel Against Cousin Eva As she was writing down the address with a gold pencil in an ivory notebook , a commissionaire put his head round the door and said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went out into the subterranean passages and were swept along by the people returning , who , though they had shown no sign of perturbation when they went down to the shelter , were chattering and laughing with the abandonment of relief . When the ramp brought us up to the daylight , we said good-by , adding , according to the present London fashion , " Good luck , " and turned away to go on with our several purchases . But the millinery department was not where it had been , on the right of the doorway . I swung round , trying . to get my bearings , and found that my new friend was standing in a like perplexity , her long first finger tapping her bright mouth . " But where is the glove department ? " she marveled . At the same moment we both recognized what had happened . " This is n't Debenham and Freebody ! We have come up into Marshall and Snelgrove ! " we exclaimed . We had both known that these stores , which stand a block apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the artificial as we were , we were amazed to find that this unity was not merely a matter of entries on a balance sheet , but was materially expressed in these pale underground passages of cement and steel . I did not go hack to choose my turban . Suddenly I could think of nothing but the lame dog , and how intolerable she was , and how equally intolerable Eva was in thrusting this affliction on my household . I walked out into the street and began to hurry along , almost running in the urgency of my anger . And in a flash it came to me that I need not bow to Eva 's will . In these days quite a number of things seem no longer worth doing . Nobody can be bothered to keep up any pretenses or to make explanations , just as nobody could be bothered to undergo any treatment for the improvement of her eyesight or her hair . It is too late for all that . Whether our ledgers show a profit or a loss , they have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of equals , if she longed to be the cross little ruler of the nursery again , I could not help it . She was an adult like any other , with no leas , but no more rights ; and we were not in the nursery , we were in the Battle of London ; and if I had had the energy left to go on being her accomplice in her long ( Carl timid. / on Page 5.7 ) ( Gurebtuird ( nun Page 51 ) masquerade , I could not do it at the expense of such combatants as old Mrs. Mactavish , as tired and gallant little Helen , as my husband . It had begun to rain , and with rage I pictured the expedition my husband would have to make through the wet black night to the police station , to see if the lame dog had registered . But now , liberated from the belief that I must fall in with Eva 's wishes , I perceived that there was no reason why , if the lame dog could go to Burnham Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go now , at once , this evening . I went into a telephone booth and called the hotel , but there came again the sound of the ghost beating on its tin can . So I got into a taxi , which took me to Kensington by a tortuous route . We tried to go through Hyde Park , but there was a time bomb in ohe of the driveways , and it was as unvisitable as Tibet had been when I was a child . I had desired to visit Tibet then , I remembered , because of its strangeness ; but nothing I could have seen there could have been as strange as these streets I drove in now , lined with these solid houses through which , here and there , a great finger had struck straight down into the earth , peopled with men and women whose faces , resolutely not aghast , disregarded the striking of that finger . In a square that had once been fashionable , and still was dignified , I found the hotel . An old gentleman was paddling about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited in the lounge till the manageress came , listening to a man telling a woman how he had only the day before inherited his father 's old silver and had laid it out in his dining room so that an expert might see it and catalogue it before it was sent to the country , and how , during the night , a bomb had lifted out the windows and scattered the collection all over the adjacent gardens . I booked a room for the lame dog and paid for it . I had a feeling that I must go back at once and tell the girl what I had done , so that she could make her move comfortably and early . But I found that I was only a block from a store that had an excellent hairdressing department , and I reflected that if I did not have it done , I should have to go uncoifed for another week . With hardly a prick of my conscience I presented myself in the peachcolored-marble beauty salon , which had never struck me as remarkable when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed , but which now , silent and empty and dimly lit , recalled that the Baths of CeramIla had originally been an establishment of like nature . An Italianate young man , for whose attention I should have had to compete furiously a few months before , was openly glad to see me , let a yawn split what must have been an intolerably marmoreal profile , and explained with laughter that he had spent most of the previous night out on duty with the home guard during a raid so appalling that it had become comic . The Larne Dog Departs While he treated my hair as if it still mattered , I searched my features in the mirror for signs of the change , the deterioration which was making me act so ruthlessly toward the stranger in the gates , so flagrantly in contradiction to the tradition of my family and my kind . But the new bleakness , the new fatigue and age of my features told me that there was no element in the picture so trivial , therefore so little disagreeable , as moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat handsomely all refugees , because till now there had been so great a contrast between our lots . They had had nothing , we had still had all . Now airplane warfare had brought us to the same level . In this new dispensation those that were bad soldiers had to go to the wall , whether they were British or refugees . For a Briton this was a curious new thought . Back at my apartment I slipped my key in the door , paused to rehearse the lie that should sweeten the occasion , and went in with an uneasy pulse . In the kitchen , the lame dog was still in the cook 's armchair , and Helen and Mrs. Mactavish were going about the business of preparing dinner in hurt and wary silence . The lame dog stretched herself and looked up at me , smiling in confident expectation of being able to say something disagreeable quite soon . I wondered how this being , who seemed to have no ascertainable principle but derision , would bear herself under stress . It might be that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be trapped in the ruins for days , perhaps never to be dug out ; or a water main might burst , and we should have to fight for our lives in the flood . I had no idea what this woman was like when she was not jeering , but I felt confident that if the worst came to the worst , she could make it worse . " I am so sorry to have to tell you that a most tiresome thing has happened , " I lied . " One of the other two shelters in this apartment house has become unusable , and the people who ordinarily use it will have to come into ours , so the head janitor has asked us not to bring any guests . But I have taken a room for you at the Burnham Court Hotel , and it will be better if you go at once , while it is light . " " Hein ! " grunted the lame dog . " More mismanagement , I suppose . " " No , " / said . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down in an armchair in the hall . On the table there was a pile of letters , nearly all of them attempts of commercial organizations to carry on their usual course in spite of the blitzkrieg . Most are cheerful announcements of change of address , but the banks are tiresome , carrying on their old tradition of pompous inadaptability . One , with which I am concerned in a matter of trust funds , called on me peremptorily , in a letter which has taken four days to reach me , for a reply by return of post that shall elucidate a matter probably ever to remain obscure , since of the two persons most closely involved , one is an airman posted as missing , the other is a tradesman in a bombed suburban street . The light in the hall thickened with dusk . I had risen at half past six that morning . With my lap full of unopened letters , I fell asleep . I heard a key turn in the lock ; my husband came in , his face bluish with ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry cake the old lady likes , " he said . " Where is that girl ? I shall have to find out if she really has reported her change of address , and if she has not , I suppose I shall have to take her along to the police station . " " She is gone . " I said . " I sent her off to that hotel Eva mentioned . " " Thank God , " he said . " Everything is so easy and pleasant ; she was the only thing wrong . " Another Cup of Coffee For a time he dozed in the armchair beside mine . Then Helen put her head out of the kitchen and called along the passage , " You 'd best begetting dressed , you two . It 's corned-beef hash and fried eggs , and it 'll be ready in two minutes . " It was a quarter to seven , but we start the evening meal earlier and earlier , so as to finish before the bombs drop . We went to our rooms , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazer . I got into my thick brown siren suit and tied a red handkerchief round my neck . We would be too hot in the shelter ; we knew it . But since a bomb that got a gas main or too many incendiaries on the roof might mean that we would be turned out of the shelter and would have to walk till we found another shelter that had room for us , we had to dress for the night air . Round the kitchen table we ate our tomato soup . Helen dolloped spoonfuls of steaming hash from the skillet to our plates . The unpainted cupboards and shelves were ugly about us , the chintz curtains that had been so gay were dingy because of their black linings , the dark shade on the pendent lamp made our faces dirtyish . Mysteriously , happiness flowered among us , a real light , a real warmth . I laughed aloud , and Helen and Mrs. Mactavish , their eyes getting ready to laugh , too , asked me why . I was reluctant to tell them that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being with them , with my husband , in this moment , for I feared that such an intangible cause might fade to nothingness if it were named . " I was thinking of two people I met on the hue this morning , " I said , and I told them about the gentle , vaporing pacifist , and the epicene Clara . Everything went well . I remembered what the pacifist had said , and the vague river of her voice came and lived in my throat . I managed to convey the nautical roll of Clara'e movements . My husband disgraced himself by laughing into his cup of coffee ; we all mocked him for this breach in his notoriously correct behavior . Far away we heard it first . Then it was all around us , the wailing of the sirens , like the shaking out of a flag of sound that , in the end , covers the whole sky . Softly the first big guns rumbled in the distance . We pushed forward our cups for more coffee ; our happiness continued .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
