Trumpet-loud , trumpet-blasty is the voice of New Hampshire 's Senator Charles William Tobey , Republican . As a member of the Senate Campaign Expenditures Committee he investigated vote-fraud charges in New Jersey , found conditions that made him peal with indignation . Last week his brassy solo became a duet when Boss Frank Hague stalked into the committee 's hearings ( a subpoena had brought him ) . Boss Hague proved to be no piccolo player himself . <P> Sallow face crimson , fists waving , Frank Hague yelled denials that there had been any ballot-box stuffing , fraudulent voting , terrorizing of voters in Hudson County . Sample lines from the script : <P> Hague : " You ca n't . . . put any filth on me . The man does n't live who dares do that . The man does n't live who can put a finger on my moral character . He do n't live . Or on my political character . He do n't live . " <P> ( Shouts of agreement from 400 Hague henchmen in the hearing room . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . real government , conscientious government . " ( Pointing to Tobey and addressing Senator Alva Adams ) : " What 's he frothing at the mouth about ? " <P> Hague ( to Tobey ) : " Stand up , Senator . What a spectacle ! What a fine person to represent the people in the United States Senate ! " <P> Tobey : " Your position here is no different than that of the little woman who a few days ago sat in the chair you 're now occupying and testified that she had been beaten up and kicked in the stomach three times in a Jersey City precinct when she tried to vote . Get that clear . " <P> Hague : " You 're not going to smear me . . . . Why do n't you go to Philadelphia and investigate how Willkie got the nomination ? Why do you come here with your 10 picayune investigation ? " ( Aside to his followers ) : " Look at him . I probably will get just as low as he will in a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to defeat President Roosevelt in this State . They 're trying to smear him . But they 're going to beat him honestly or not at all . " <P> Hague ( as Tobey 's son , Charles Jr. , leans over to whisper in his father 's ear ) : " Tee hee ! Look at Willie whistling into his ear . " <P> Tobey : " He 's my son and secretary and he is n't Willie ! " <P> Exeunt-Hague cackling , Tobey indignant .
