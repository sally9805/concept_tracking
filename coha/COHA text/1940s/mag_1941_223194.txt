U.S. couturiers , last week and this , unveiled for the first time the **32;8183;TOOLONG . S. <P> The packaging is different from Parisian packaging in several respects . <P> &gt; It is not so dramatic . Every Paris collection had some spectacular clothes that were bought only by exhibitionists but made headlines . The American designers present good wearable , salable clothes , but little for exhibitionists or oglers . <P> &gt; The dresses are embellished with spangles , bugles , gold and silk embroidery , but not with Parisian lavishness . Reason : the wages of embroiderers were $8 a week in Paris , are $50 a week in New York . <P> &gt; The new styles have a shortage of seductive names . Whereas U.S. stores once unblushingly publicized a Schiaparelli pocket , a Vionnet neck or a Mainbocher waistline in a little $8.75 number , this year they may have to be satisfied with " a deep armhole cut " or equivalent . Exception : fall colors ( so numerous that no one color predominates ) have names like rose champagne , maharaja bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tight , only occasionally disguised by a minor bit of fullness , suspiciously suggest that U.S. designers have an eye on saving yardage . <P> Last year 's Manhattan openings , following soon after the demise of Paris , tried to establish New York as the fashion center of the world-but the luxurious fabrics were French and the clothes were admittedly Paris-inspired ( TIME , Aug. 19 , 1940 ) . <P> This year the fabrics ( good and traditional ) are American-made except for the lams . And the designers had to depend on their own ingenuity . <P> The chief trends of this ingenuity show in slender skirts with slits or " back droops " which fall much lower behind than in front ; " front peplums " give fullness to tight skirts ; the " deep armhole cut " and " soft shoulder " ( see cut ) . <P> High lights from the collections of leading designers ( opening last week in Hollywood and this week in Manhattan ) : <P> Howard Greer ( formerly Paramount 's designer , now turned free lance ) : fishtail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullock's-Wilshire , with Greer the leading West Coast designer for the custom trade ) : slim , slit skirts , the back dip , rounded shoulders , deeper armholes . <P> Bergdorf Goodman : pre-1914 tendencies with silhouettes narrowing at bottom , peg-top evening skirts , slim skirts slit to the knee , and a general up-in-front , down-in-back movement . <P> Saks Fifth Avenue ( head designer , Sophie ) : much ado over Sophie 's " plastic seaming , " and adaptation of Alix and Vionnet 's tiny seams and gores which give a gown a poured-on look ; a fitted hiplength , fur-edged jacket after Vermeer ; men 's tie silk for formal dinner gowns ; men 's sleeve lining for suit blouses . <P> Jay Thorpe : Elizabethan touches in the form of high standing collars on evening gowns , capes , daytime suits . <P> Milgrim : Near East inspiration , with harem skirts , " tent pole " silhouettes , camel driver 's tunics.
