txt Testimony taken at the hospital bedside of the Bolivian pilot of the P-38 fighter plane that collided Nov. 1 with an Eastern Air Lines DC-4 over National Airport was heard today by officials investigating the ' crash , which took the lives of all fifty-five persons aboard the airliner . The sworn deposition by Capt . Erick Rios Bridoux , the only survivor of history 's worst civil air disaster , differed sharply from the accounts of earlier witnesses called by Civil Aeronautics Board investigators . For one thing , Captain Rios reported that he had developed engine trouble a few minutes after taking the plane aloft for its first test hop and that he had promptly notified the tower of this and his desire to land . He declared that his radio message had not been acknowledged by the tower operators . Civil Aeronautics Administration tower operators previously have testified that Captain Rios reported no engine trouble and that he disregarded radioed instructions to circle the field and follou- the airliner in for a landing . Donovan E. Davis , supervisor in the control tower at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had heard the instructions to circle transmitted to the Bolivian pilot and had heard Captain Rios reply " Roger " in acknowledgment of the instructions . Says He Got No Turn Order Captain Rios declared that he had never been specifically instructed by the tower to " turn left . " Tower operators have testified that lit ! lad been told to veer off in these words when a crash appeared imminent . Capt. , Rios told CAB investigators , who visited him at an Alexandria , Va. , hospital on Tuesday , that he approached the field only after he was convinced from watching the ground and air traffic that he was next in line for a landing . He said he watched a C-45 Beechcraft approaching to land , circled out from the field and made his approach , convinced after watching the course of the twinengined plane that he was free to come in . Captain Rios continued : " I told them the tower ' Bolivian P-38 on approach . ' They repeated the altimeter setting , the time , ' clear to land Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . ' I heard some words ' Clear to the left , clear to the left , clear to the left , ' but nothing else , not calling anybody , any airplane , just ' Clear to the left . ' " Russell E. Potter , CAB attorney , explained to the hearing that Captain Rios was " not at all times intelligible " when being questioned on the course of his aircraft and the exchange of radio messages and that the statement " must be appraised in light of the conditions under which it was taken . " The deposition was taken in the presence of CAB officials and representatives of the Bolivian Government . Robert W. Chrisp , CAB officer presiding at the inquiry , emphasized that Captain Rios would be permitted to give a later statement when he had recovered from his severe injuries . The pilot was said to be still in critical cone dition . Captain Rios ' statement failed to clear up for investigators what place a twin-engine B-25 Air Force bomber had in the airport traffic picture just before the accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simulated instrument approach to the field about three minutes before the crash , according to tower operator testimony . Circled Twice , Rios Asserts Making no mention of a B-25 , other than to state positively that he would recognize one because of his training in aircraft recognition , Captain Rios declared that he had not started his direct approach to the runway until after he had seen a C-45 or possibly a C-60 land on Runway Number 3 . " I 'm sure , I 'm sure , " he told his . interrogators . " He landed and turned to the left . I was sure I was then Number One . " At variance with previous testimony was Captain Rios ' statement that he had circled the tower twice at about 3,500 feet before he came in for his approach . The control supervisor , Mr , Davis , told the inquiry panel that he had aproved the flight of the P-38 from the airport after first being assured that the Bolivian pilot could speak English . He said he watched the take-off of the fighter plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the plane through binoculars as it climbed to about 3,500 feet " about ten miles " out from the airport . Because it was unusual to have P-38 's operating from the field , he declared , he had also suggested to Glenn Tigner , the operator in the " . Number One " position in the tower , that he " watch " the flight . Mr , Tigner was issuing the instructions , over different radio frequencies , to the P-38 and the DC-4 when the planes crashed . Air Force witnesses from Bolling Field , directly across the Potomac River from National Airport , are expected tomorrow to testify on the movements of the field 's B-25 and to recount the exchange of radio messages between the P-38 and the National Airport tower as heard by the military tower . It was learned at the close of today 's fact-finding session that the Bolling Field accounts were expected to substantiate the accounts of the CAA tower staff .
