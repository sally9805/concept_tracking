txt In your editorial of Thursday , March 29 , on " OPA and Profit Control , " the textile industry is cited to illustrate forced shifts in production from lowpriced low-profit lines to higher-priced higher-profit items , because of OPA 's past failure " to permit the price of low-priced items to advance sufficiently to induce manufacturers to continue their production . " If in this you refer to cotton textiles , and if by manufacturers you mean mills producing cotton textiles , the facts contradict any such possibilities . War Production Board Order L-99 on April 20 , 1942 , froze looms in cotton mills to specific constructions of cloth . With enlargement of this order over three years , all freedom to shift from one cloth to another has been long since completely eliminated . The only shifts possible occur when WPB decrees a change to meet military or other essential demand . Mills are and have been totally without choice as to their prodduct , or as to price either . Your editorial also refers to charges that OPA is improperly controlling profits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control is to prevent profiteering in the guise of exorbitant profits . While no thoughtful person would condone profiteering practices , the measure of fair and equitable profit gives rise to wide differences of opinion as to the standards used . The essential problem is one of fair pricing and of allowance for contingencies in uncontrolled areas , such as raw material and labor costs . So far as cotton textiles at the mill level are concerned , it is our opinion that OPA has stressed unduly this element of price and has consistently striven to reflect the narrow levels of highly competitive pre-war conditions . Price control dogma never fails to express profits in a gross sense , before taxes . OPA , then OPACS , put ceilings on staple cotton goods lines in July , 1941 . After various shifts it froze values covering practically all cotton-mill products on May 4 , 1942 . It cut some prices later in 1942 . No other changes were made until the winter of 1943-44 , when a few groups suffering extreme hardship got a little relief . This did not occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belatedly admitted at that time that many mills had been running at a loss . Other adjustments were sought , but OPA did nothing . Finally , the Bankhead-Brown amendment to the Stabilization Extension Act took effect June 30 , 1944 , requiring OPA to re-examine cotton goods prices . Slight increases have since appeared , most of them temporary and subject to later readjustment downward . The large fabric group known as print cloths is a typical example . Such goods go into many staple clothing lines for men , women and children . From May 4 , 1942 , to last summer prices did not change on these goods . Then they went up an average of not more than 1/2. cent a yard . This is less than 11/2 cents for the amount of print cloth used in a dress or shirt costing the consumer anywhere from $3 upward . The 1/2-cent price rise , only increase in three years , is temporary . OPA proposes now to reduce this by 1/5 to 1/2 cent a yard , saving less than % cent on the price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost mills 2 cents a pound more than in May , 1942 , and unit labor costs probably are up 40 per cent . This is a good illustration of the picayune nature of OPA textile price regulation . The necessity of retaining in cotton textiles the system of required OPA Pricing by major groups of fabrics established by the Bankhead amendment can not be overemphasized . Major group pricing means merely that cotton blankets and related fabrics shall be priced according to standards of this industry division , denim and work clothing fabrics by their standards , and so on . It recognizes that cotton textiles are not a single industry . It recognizes that a cotton blanket and a cloth for men 's overalls , while both generically textiles , differ in every respect as to fiber quality used , production methods , distribution and customers . A general standard adding blankets to overalls does not provide fair pricing for both . Required pricing by the major fabric groups tin which each of these fits does provide an equitable base of pricing . This does not require that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these truly separate industries shall not be impaired in their price and profit structure by unrealistic and inequitable OPA nricine- methods . You are quite correct , I think , in suggesting that it would be unwise to amend the Price Control Act so as to permit a profit on each commodity or to each producer . But the present situation as to beef is that heavy losses are being sustained in its production , and such losses have continued for many months . When we complained some time back to the OPA they told us that losses on beef were immaterial , because the industry as a whole was making good profits on pork . This was true at the time , but since last August there have been uniform losses on pork also , The trouble with the over-all profit theory as applied to the meat packing industry is that there are hundreds of packers who process beef but no pork , and vice versa . It is poor consolation to the beef processor to be told that the industry as a whole has made money or that pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently important commodity to have a price structure of its own . The same is true of pork . While it would be impracticable to insure a profit margin on each meat item produced , the beef industry as a whole should be freed from its present losses , as should also the pork industry . The present statute requires a generally fair and equitable profit margin on " products resulting from the processing of agricultural commodities , including livestock . " OPA has construed this to mean that it is all right to have losses on beef if there are sufficient profits on pork . We do not so construe it , and our request is simply that the wording be clarified so that the beef industry may have its own price structure and the pork industry likewise . There may be some industries to which the over-all industry profit theory can reasonably be applied , but it is particularly inappropriate for our industry , because so many operators confine their production to beef or pork , and also because the so-called big packers have so many collateral lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as leather , vegetable oils and soap , from which they derive I profits . I have read with much interest the editorial " The Beech " in your issue of March 26 . The comment should have made reference to the widespread custom of young swains carving the initials or first names of their sweethearts on the smooth bark of the beech tree , frequently embellished with intertwined hearts pierced by Cupid 's arrow , the undying declaration " I love you , " and the like . It may interest your readers to know that the English word " book " is said by lexicographers to be akin to the AngloSaxon " bete , " meaning the beech tree , " because the ancient Saxons in general wrote runes on pieces of beechen board . " In other words , the twentieth century youth who carves his sweetheart 's name or initials on the trunk of the lordly beech is apparently continuing a practice begun by his ancestors ages ago . A writer in your columns recently pointed out discrimination in the income tax rulings regarding dependents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or day-to-day workers . If I work four days a week for four different employers I am hooked for $5.80 withholding tax . The man with a steady job and the same number of dependents pays $4 for five days ' work . The day-to-day worker loses many a day 's pay through holidays , weather or the employer 's willingness to skimp now and then on the payroll . If I am fortunate enough to average four days a week for the year , my total tax liability will be $55 to $60 . Then why the insistence of the tax collector in withholding nearly $300 in that time ? I ca n't buy groceries on the Government 's promise to repay me in 1946 , and I had trouble enough cashing the belated check for 1944 overpayments . In a statement of expected food shortages this year in THE TIMES was the figure of 5 per cent for vegetables as compared with 14 per cent for meat . Statistically that may be correct , but if the people of the country have not enough gumption to grow their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts . For three years we as a nation have been learning how to grow food in our back yards and in community and company gardens . With the expenditure of very little extra time and effort the average family can grow at least 20 per cent more than in 1944 ? weather permitting . , The American people have no need to go hungry or even to tighten their belts if they will adopt the commonsense method of feeding themselves . Forty-two per cent of the supply of fresh vegetables has been grown in Victory gardens in the past several sea ...
