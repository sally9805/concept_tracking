To Potsdam in 1747 went Johann Sebastian Bach , by royal invitation , and was joyfully received by " the most distinguished flute player in Europe , " King Frederick the Great . Himself an amateur versifier and composer , Frederick asked his famed visitor to improvise on a royal theme . Bach forthwith obliged , extemporized a three-voice fugue . Frederick , delighted but still royal , thereupon set a more difficult task : development of his original theme into a six-part fugue . That was a stumper , even for the 62-year-old master ; to make things worse , Frederick wished the assignment worked out in his presence . <P> Bach demurred , gracefully . But the King of Prussia 's poser had roused the King of Fugue 's dander : afterwards , in Leipzig , Bach went to work .

Last week , when the Bach Circle presented it at Town Hall , Manhattanites first heard it in its devious entirety . A capacity audience of Bach enthusiasts sat out the two-hour perform ance , then applauded quickly , quickly swarmed doorwards.
