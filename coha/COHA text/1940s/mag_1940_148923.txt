Last week , on the second day after Italy went to war , the Pope 's newspaper failed to appear for the first time since 1870 . Official explanation for Osservatore Romano 's nonappearance : " The printing press has broken down . " But on other occasions when its seven-year-old U. S. press has failed to function , Osservatore has appeared in mimeograph . <P> On Thursday , shorn of all war news whatsoever , Osservatore reappeared , announced : " In the present circumstances ... we are compelled to abstain from now on from printing the various bulletins . " Il Duce once more permitted Osservatore to circulate throughout Italy-if it could . <P> Bulky , balding Count Giuseppe Dalla Torre continued in the editor 's chair of Osservatore Romano , was still flanked by bodyguards wherever he went . Within the Vatican , friends of the Allies grumbled that Pius XII 's predecessor would not have let his newspaper be gagged . But the story went around that Pius XII had stiffened when Professor Guido Gonella , pro-Ally commentator for Osservatore , disappeared for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Professor Gonella reappeared . <P> Pius XII has kept strict silence about Italy 's war activities . As during the Spanish War , some Italian prelates have not . Last week Most Rev. Evasio Colli , Bishop of Parma and head of the Central Bureau of Catholic Action , asked its members to pray God " so that He may bless our dear country and protect the sons of Italy who are fighting bravely . . . . Every one must perform with perfect discipline the duty assigned to him . " <P> Two days later the whole Italian clergy sent a message to Il Duce . " May the sure victory of our arms gloriously place the Italian flag on the Holy Sepulchre , and revindicate the glory and rights of the House of Savoy , restorer of harmony amongst civilized people of Imperial and Christian Rome . " Il Duce , self-styled " Protector of Islam " ( which includes Palestine 's Arabs ) , said nothing .                    @
