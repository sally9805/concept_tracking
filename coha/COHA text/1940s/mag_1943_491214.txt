A BRAIN COMES TO BROOKLYN By J. ROY STOCKTON I T IS no accident that Branch Wesley Rickey is the highest-salaried man in baseball , with an income greater even than that of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis  --  greater even than Babe Ruth drained from the Ruppert beer millions at his home-run peak . Branch Wesley planned it that way when , as a poor boy on Duck Run , in Scioto County , Ohio , he became convinced that the brain was mightier than the bleep . He looked about him and observed that those who tilled the soil by the sweat of their brows were poor . They produced , but their efforts enriched some head man who was using his brain somewhere else . And so Week Rickey , as he was known to his boyhood companions , decided he would become a brain , a head man . Rickey did a very good job of it . During twenty-six years with the Cardinals , while far better athletes strained their muscles to the aching point on the diamond for comparatively modest wages , Brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year contract which expired December thirty-first last called for a $50,000 basic annual salary and 20 per cent of the profits on player sales . His take for 1941 was $88,000 , and for 1942 about the same . A brain man named Morgenthau will cramp his style a bit at Brooklyn , but his take will be all the law will allow . When the end of the war nudges things hack to normal , he 'll he a $100,000-a-year man  --  or Brooklyn will be a shambles . The only accident about the Rickey success story is that Branch chose baseball . It might have been almost anything else , for the Rickey brain is a most versatile instrument . He can preach a sermon to make the regular pastor blush for himself . He can embroider a contract or find loopholes in the law to confound the most agile corporation lawyer . His after-dinner speeches can warm the hearts of his hearers with love of all mankind or set them ablaze with righteous indignation , as he pleases . As a salesman , he can peddle a broken-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman as Phil Wrigley happy over the favor . He sold himself to Brooklyn so adroitly that  --  though he was facing unemployment at the time  --  the Dodger directors virtually begged him to take their $65,000 a year . Had he elected to be national head man for the gentlemen who go from door to door selling brushes , housewives today would be scurrying up and down streets , seeking to give dividend coupons to the brush salesmen . There is a bit of paradox in Branch Wesley Rickey 's presence in baseball . Baseball is a hard-riding , loud-swearing business , especially in the dugout , where Branch got his baptism . It was a shock to Duck Run 's God-fearing people when Branch , sprung from extremely religious stock , chose professional baseball , then considered an adjunct of the beer garden . And though Branch never appeared on the field or even at the baseball park on a Sunday , this did not satisfy the fundamentalists . For Sunday receipts pay handsome salaries to front-office people . Many could not see the consistency of what Duck Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eat the devil 's meat . " The baseball world , of course , knows of Rickey 's Sunday scruples . The Dodgers signed him as their top executive with eyes open . But the question has been raised by Brooklyn wags as to what the Flat-bush reaction might be if , on a Sunday afternoon at crowded Ebbets Field , a genuine crisis developed , with no president and general manager at the park . And if you know your Brooklyn , you know that there they really have crises , and for keeps . Rickey , questioned by the press about the Sunday angle after selling himself to the Dodger directors , took refuge in the Bible , saying , And on the seventh day He rested . " Since the quotation referred to the fact that the Lord Jehovah took a day 's rest after creating the world , Rickey 's casting himself in a similar role was so overwhelming the press could only subside , speechless . Years ago , Branch gave us a personal picture of his Sunday-baseball attitude . Hypnotized then , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump in our throat , feeling that there was a real man , a son worthy of his parents . It was n't that they had pledged him not to play Sunday baseball ; he just knew he would break their hearts if he did . At times , when the hypnotism wore off , we have thought of the fact that part of Rickey 's salary has been paid in revenue from broadcasting contracts with breweries and from whisky ads on the Sportsman 's Park fences , not to mention the sale of beer at the ball park . But those thoughts have not dulled our admiration for the man 's ability to stay with a principle , come hell , high water or $88,000 a year . Family background is important to the Rickey saga . The family tree goes back to a great-grandfather named David Brown . David , back in Pennsylvania , married Hannah Hubbard , who was disowned by her family because her bridegroom drank whisky . David , taking his wifeand child , a yoke of oxen and a cart , journeyed down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Portsmouth , Ohio , in 1819 .

" Uncle Frank " to all in Duck Run . Uncle Frank , described by a contemporary as " the most pious , devout , religious man I ever knew , a genuine New Testament Christian , always the main man in the church , " built the Duck Run Free-Will Baptist Church . While living at Lucasville , the family attended the Flat Woods Methodist Protestant Church , four miles distant . Everybody had to go to church every Sunday . They drove Clay and Nell to an old canopy-top surrey , singing hymns the whole way to church , forty-five minutes away  --  Aunt Emma , soprano ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul . Eighty-three years old when he died , his hair was still jet black . Wrestling was a favorite Duck Run recreation , and Uncle Frank was one of the champions . Though he weighed only 145 pounds , he barred no opponent . Brother-in-law , Alva Crabtree , 210-pound , catch-as-catch-can champion of Jackson and Scioto counties , often remarked that " Frank Rickey was the only man he ever saw whose back he could not dirty . " Branch Rickey loved his parents with unusual devotion , but he remarked that for all their moral substance , they had n't harvested much worldly reward . Branch determined it would not be thus with him . While his father , his older brother , Orla , and younger brother , Frank Wanzer , busied themselves with the farm chores , Branch studied and planned to be a brain . With gun in hand and his dog Major by his side , he could plan much better than when cutting a cord of wood . He left the ax and saw for Orla and Wanzer . Branch liked baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his scheme of things . Sports offered a fine vantage point for studying men , their strengths and weaknesses , for learning how to lead them . He organized baseball and football teams . He was always the manager and always the catcher . From that position he could see all , plan all , direct all . Baseball was his favorite game because it early offered gainful employment . He studied the things that made good baseball players tick , noting that there were certain requisites , a few fundamental and indispensable . Thus in adolescence he acquired one of his great assets  --  the ability to look at a green young athlete and see in him the makings of a great star , or flaws that would make it unwise to and pickhce ice ? spend too much money trying to develop him . ittthh err oegf egachv yt sa to tnnaui Rrhs iecrilkyeeywindow ss cpol nu : ihda- elcompartment on The baseball world thinks first of this gift when grouetatethset mupeerda gn e- of ballplayers in the world . Some insist he canj child he wants his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou ickey ' s formula , however . His success results from the foolproof e oo proof system he devised , rather than from ' his powers of observation , sharp though they are . There are three fundamental requirements for baseball stardom . A man must have fleetness of foot , a strong throwing arm and ability to bat . If he ca n't run and throw , there 's no wisdom in dallying with him . If he can do either one particularly well , especially throw , he still may be a fine prospect . Or he may be taught to hit a little . Rickey is quick to see fine knee action in a runner , rhythm in a throwing arm and timing at bat . There 's no magic about that . There are stop watches to time runners and tapes to measure throws . Modest-salaried scouts do n't miss these points , and the Rickey system calls for an abundance of scouting . It provides for tryout schools . From coast to coast thousands of boys are inspected , sorted and tested each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many fall by the wayside , but quantity production Days dividends . If you gather many bushels of apples , you 're sure to have a few big ones in yourbaskets . So Rickey , gathering thousands of young prospects , has found enough stars to win pennants in 1926 , 1928 , 1930 , 1931 , 1934 and 1942 ? and world championships in four of those years . When the Cardinals defeated the fabulous New York Yankees last October in the World Series , it was a proud valedictory for Rickey . Every regular on the team was a product of the farm system that Rickey conceived and developed , as he built the Cardinals from a bankrupt organization into a going concern worth millions . It is no reflection on Rickey 's overall ability that he touted many players as sure-fire stars , only to have them flop out without leaving an imprint in the majors . Besides getting publicity , that also demonstrated another Rickey asset  --  unbounded enthusiasm and steadfast devotion to his job . And it did n't hurt the Cardinal sale of players either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school days . One of the teachers who encouraged the young man was Jim Finney , principal of the Lucasville High School . He saw possibilities in Week as a student and athlete , urging him to attend college . It was at Lucasville , too , that Branch met the only sweetheart he ever had . Now the mother of his six children , she was Jennie Moulton , daughter of Chan Moulton , proprietor of the Lucasville general store . As Branch still puts it , she was the only pebble on the beach . He had to propose more than a hundred times before she finally accepted him . Determined to get an education , young Rickey 's thirst for knowledge was not satisfied with the regular Lucasville curriculum . He borrowed books and studied on his own . He daringly taught himself Latin from borrowed books . When he entered Ohio Wesleyan University , he was proud of what he had done to Caesar and Cicero . He recalls those days with pleasure . " I thought I was some stuff , " he told us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . We were starting Vergil and I sang of arms and the man , and went on singing , undaunted by snickers from classmates . Finally , the professor stopped me . Mr. Rickey , ' he challenged , ' where in the world did you learn that brand of Latin ? ' " ' From Grove 's Elementary Latin , sir , ' I answered . The snickers turned into roars of laughter . How was I to know that the Grove who wrote that book and the Professor Grove in the classroom were one and the same ? " That incident marked Rickey as a very green frosh indeed . He determined to quit college and go back home where people were kinder . If this was college life , Branch wanted none of it . But Professor Grove naturally felt he ought to do something special for a yokel so interested in the Grove textbook . He looked up the freshman-class goat , offered him special tutoring in Latin and persuaded him to continue his studies at Wesleyan . Branch financed his enthusiastic pursuit of learning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . He was no die-fordear-old-Wesleyan athlete , and he was frank about it ; his policy was strictly play for pay to get hook learning for Branch Wesley Rickey . In 1903 , Branch signed with a minor-league outfit as a catcher . He went along to Dallas , Texas , in 1904 , and moved up to the American League St. Louis Browns in 1905 . He was n't a big leaguer for long , catching for the Browns in 1905 and 1906 and the New York Americans , then called the Highlanders , in 1907 . Branch probably quit after only three years as a big leaguer because , as the records demonstrate , he was just so-so behind the plate . He still holds one big-league record that has never been challenged , however . While he was catching a game for the Highlanders on June 28 , 1907 , the Washington Senators  --  then called the Nationals  --  stole thirteen bases on Catcher Rickey . That is the largest total of bases ever stolen in an American League nine-inning game by any team . In fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ever has stolen anything from Rickey since . Protecting His Discovery Subsequently , Rickey entered the University of Michigan to study law . While completing the three-year course in two years , he also managed to serve as coach of the Wolverine baseball team . This probably gave him the break which paved the way for front-office prosperity . The Michigan coaching job gave him his claim to his greatest feat as a talent finder . Rickey is generally considered the " discoverer " of the one and only George Sisler , perhaps the most graceful and versatile ballplayer who ever lived , though his right to discovery has been bitterly challenged , on impressive evidence . Sisler , before Rickey saw him , was good enough to command a fair wage as a semipro , and , when still a minor , was signed to a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates . The late Barney Dreyfuss , Pittsburgh owner , went to his grave protesting that he had been robbed when the National Commission , then the high tribunal of the national game , awarded Sisler to the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a law office at Boise , Idaho , after a winning fight against tuberculosis at Saranac Lake , was in St. Louis as aide to Robert Lee Hedges , owner of the Browns . It was Lawyer Rickey who handled the Sisler case , seeing to it that the Browns ' contract George signed had more important signatures . Presiding over front-office ledgers and checkbooks , Rickey quickly showed more than he ever had behind his mask on the field .. As assistant to Hedges in 1913 , he was managing the club on the field before the year ended . Hedges sold out to Philip De Catesby Ball after the 1915 season . Branch remained as vice-president and business manager under the new ownership , but a civic-minded group of St. Louisans purchased the rival National League club , the Cardinals , and hired Rickey as vice-president and business manager in 1917 . The owners were businessmen impressed by Rickey 's commercial virtues and countinghouse mariners . The Cardinals , bought by the businessmen as a sort of contribution to civic charity , certainly needed somebody with financial acumen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for lack of railroad fare . The club offices were a couple of barren rooms in a converted dwelling house . Rickey met every emergency . One afternoon the late Charley Barrett , great Redbird scout and one of Rickey 's No. 1 worshipers , found the vice-president rolling up rugs in the makeshift offices . He asked if business was so bad that Uncle Branch had to do his own house cleaning . " Judas Priest , give me a hand , Charley , " Rickey replied . " Mrs. Rickey just wired that she 's coming home this evening . If I do n't get these rugs from her living room back where they belong before she arrives , she 'll boil me in oil . " Rickey had a trading conference scheduled with a representative of a prosperous club that afternoon , he explained to Barrett . He had borrowed Mrs. Rickey 's Oriental floor decorations to give the visitor the impression that the Cards were in velvet . Branch was getting along , however . Before the first five-year contract expired , Sam Breadon entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirC  --  t temperamental opposites , formed the partnership that put the Cardinals where they are today . Breadon , who came up the hard way , admired Rickey 's academic brilliance . Branch in turn admired Breadon 's businesslike willingness to listen to plans , and to back his judgment with dollars . Sam listened to Branch 's dreams and picked out the good ones . He saw in the farm system , child of the Rickey brain , a splendid idea and gave it the go sign . Breadon , too , was just the complement that the visionary Rickey needed  --  a businessman , but enough of a fan to take the chances essential in baseball . The Cardinals have been chided for paying below-average baseball wages . But Breadon never was niggardly with Rickey . From 1917 to 1922 , Branch drew about $100,000 . This increased to $150,000 for each of the next five-year periods , leaped to a quarter of a million for the stretch from 1932 to 1937 , and the contract which recently expired netted $350,000 . The Breadon-Rickey partnership was always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl and the lilting song . He resented the fact that he had a partner in the robust business of baseball who was accounted a spoil-fun prohibitionist . Rickey 's background made him frown discreetly on the Breadon way of life and he frowned , too , on Sam 's watchdog scrutiny of the books . The Breadon-Rickey Team Perhaps one of the first wedges in the breach between Sam and Branch was Breadon 's refusal to approve a salary boost for an employee close to the Rickey heart . Breadon was brief , Rickey was long-winded . Breadon would answer a question with yes , no , or state he could n't answer . To the same question , Rickey would say so much about so little that when you departed in a daze of polysyllables you could n't remember whether he said yes , no or perhaps . There was a table-pounding session we had with Branch back in the early days . The health of athletes and the temptations that beset them during summers away from the protective home hearth were being discussed . We suggested that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautionary measures mandatory in the armed forces . Rickey pounded the table in high dudgeon at the insinuation that he and the Cardinal club would break faith with mothers and fathers that way ; he gave us a two-hour lecture . The next day we mentioned the argument to Breadon , who said simply , " Oh , that . Certainly , we do that . " One of the disappointments of Branch 's life with the Cardinals was his failure to put over the team 's sale to Lew Wentz , Oklahoma oil millionaire . Branch had things to the point where Wentz was to call at the Cardinal office with a down-payment check for $100,000 . But the oil man suffered a headache attack that day , postponed the appointment and ultimately changed his mind . Besides the prospect of a happier setup , Rickey was to get a commission , reported to be as high as $100,000 . So he split the headache with Wentz . That was n't the only baseball-business pie in which the Rickey finger appeared . When Don Barnes purchased the Browns from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to be $25,000 . Master of detail when negotiating a business deal , Rickey is a notoriously poor manager of his own mechanics of living . He runs out of gasoline and finds , after the tank has been filled at a station , that he has no money . If he takes a notion to fly to California or Maine , he commandeers the nearest available transportation and rushes to **32;2128;TOOLONG the usual acces ( Continued from Page 54 ) Occasionally , of course , he has to have luggage , as , for instance , when he was to speak at a sports-writers ' dinner in Boston . In the Back Bay hotel suite , half an hour before speaking time , Rickey 's secretary heard him asking himself excitedly , with many a Judas Priest , " What will I do ? Oh , what will I do ? " In the traveling bag there was no dress shirt , collar , studs , tie or patent-leather shoes . The secretary steered the way to a haberdashery , made a second trip himself when studs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch finally was dressed . But before entering the banquet room he said , " Take a telegram . Mrs. Branch Rickey , Country Life Acres , St. Louis County , Missouri . No shoes , no shirt , no studs , no collar , no tie , but gosh , I love you just the same . " Breadon and Rickey have never discussed the reasons for their breakup . Undoubtedly , there was an accumulation of the sands of friction . One major thing may have been the Cedar Rapids decision that Commissioner Landis handed down in the spring of 1938 . Baseball 's governing rules forbid the ownership or control by the same party of two clubs in any one league . Cedar Rapids had agreements with clubs in lesser leagues , in many of which the Cardinals also had control of clubs . There was no visible St. Louis interest in Cedar Rapids , but the club owner there was devoted to Rickey , with a devotion deeper than money could have induced . Therefore the Cardinals actually controlled Cedar Rapids , and through that club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one club in lesser leagues . A Landis Landslide Breadon , a tough bargainer , but a stickler for the rules , sensed that something was wrong in the Cedar Rapids affiliation and suggested that it be cleaned up . Rickey looked at it from a lawyer 's viewpoint , insisting that the setup was within the law . But Judge Landis found out about the situation , and in his court it was not a question of another lawyer 's technical views . His decision imposed fines on the Cardinals and subsidiaries and took from the St. Louis organization more than 100 players by declaring them free agents . One thus lost was Harold  --  PeteReiser , subsequently a star with the Dodgers . Breadon took that decision to heart as a reflection on his personal integrity . Rickey still insists there was nothing illegal about the Cedar Rapids affair . That is characteristic of the man . A profound faith in his own righteousness is one of the assets that have enabled him to overcome tremendous handicaps . In more than twenty-five years of association with Rickey , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is still indignant at a police-court judge who would n't leave his bench to he shown dozens of motorists who were driving faster than forty miles an hour  --  the speed cited by a traffic officer who had arrested Branch Rickey , Jr . Another side of the former Duck Run boy 's attitude toward such trivia is illustrated by a motoring incident . A woman passenger in the back seat , amazed at Branch 's disregard for stop signs , finally remonstrated , " Why , Branch , do you know you 've gone right through four red lights ? " " Oh , so I have , so I nave , " was the retort . " Well , if a policeman stops me , I 'll just blow my breath in his face and tell him I 'm Branch Rickey . " At bridge , Branch never makes a bad play . If one goes wrong , somebody else slipped a mental cog . We once saw Branch knock down four quail out of a covey rise with a short-barreled twenty-gauge pump gun , and swear by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to think of it , we 'd better look behind that thicket , because he was sure he hit that one too . The cruelest blow to Branch 's pride was when he was forced to hand the field management of the Cardinals to Rogers Hornsby in May , 1925 . The farm system was functioning . Several brilliant young players had been developed . Breadon , with enthusiastic predictions from Rickey to back him , thought surely the team was ready to win on the field . But it was wallowing in last place . Sam went from one extreme to another , firing Rickey and appointing Hornsby , a rough-spoken fellow with a robust contempt for books . There was n't anything wrong with Rickey 's baseball theories . Major-league managers still use many Rickey innovations  --  blackboard talks , sliding pits , plays to catch runners off base . Rickey kept all sorts of statistics in a large scorebook as he sat in the dugout . He would jot down the distance by which each batter was thrown out at first on a grounder , where and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theoretically , he could tell you where any batter in the league was most likely to hit when facing any given pitcher . Actually , the law of averages must have been in a slump the years he managed the Browns and the Cardinals . A Crime on Horsehide His devotion to his scorebook once caused Rickey to be ordered off the field by an umpire . Writers who saw the gentlemanly Branch get the heave-ho from Sir William Klem say he does n't know to this day why he was banished . It was the custom at old Robison Field , where the Cards played in those days , for a coach on the home bench to unwrap and roll out baseballs whenever the umpire called for a fresh supply . One afternoon a new ball was fouled into the press box . A scribe drew a caricature of Klem on the ball and penciled under it the label " Catfish , " the one nickname Uncle Will can not abide . When Klem yelled for more baseballs , the scribe deftly tossed the decorated ball so that it rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Klem picked up that ball his neck swelled and turned red . Glancing at the Cardinal dugout , he spotted Manager Rickey , busily scribbling in his scorebook  --  an operation which looked guilty to Sir William . " Out of the park , Rickey , out of th " park ! " yelled the old arbitrator . Though Branch remonstrated eloquently that he could not comprehend , and pleaded for an explanation , Klem would not discuss , explain or relent . Rickey 's players could not understand his ideas or execute them . A few of the shrewd ones profited and were graduated from the master 's school to become managers themselves . But the majority either became wanderers in a labyrinth of theories or took to scoffing at it all . When Breadon switched to Hornsby and the Rajah 's simple philosophy of you do or you do n't , never mind what you did yesterday , Rickey thought he was being demoted . Actually , he was being kicked upstairs , where his skill as organizer and planner went on to build up the Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he insisted that disposal of his stock be a condition of the change . Had he retained those holdings , his income in intervening years would have been even greater , for in only three seasons since he took charge of the front office have the Cardinals failed to show a profit . Bowing to Rickey 's own jealous faith in his wisdom , subordinates have learned to take his word as law or get out . A byword in the Cardinal offices when a person thinks another is wrong , but wo n't argue about it is , " Yes , Mr. Rickey . " There are no exceptions to the yes business . One snowy day in Delaware , Ohio , Branch ordered that he be driven to the home of a college professor at Ohio Wesleyan . It was dusk , time was short and the master volunteered to show the driver a short cut . " Turn in here , " he said , pointing to a driveway . " Yes , Mr. Rickey , " said Art Fetzner , secretary  --  or perhaps Andy French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a moment of hesitation when the driver saw a forbidding white object just beyond the mouth of the driveway . " Why , Judas Priest , I do believe that 's a snow man , " said Rickey with glee . " I 'll tell you what we 'll do . We 'll hit it . That 's it . Hit it hard . " " Yes , Mr. Rickey , " said the driver . He did hit it hard . But instead of a snow man , it was snow-covered concrete , put there to close the driveway . Rickey , French and Fetzner were hurled against the windshield . " Judas Priest , that is n't a snow man after all , " was Branch 's concession . French and Fetzner were happy to be able to say , " No , Mr. Rickey . " Though an exponent of temperance , Rickey is intemperate in many ways . He 'll stay up all night , and keep the help up , too , catching up with correspondence or negotiating a deal . He called newspapermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce that he had just obtained Durocher in a trade . He was in his night clothes in his hotel room and disposed of a thick steak , rare ; fried potatoes , rolls , coffee and pie as he told happily how he had kept the telephone hot all night long arranging a transaction that was to help win another Cardinal pennant the following year . Branch probably is the only baseball official who ever broke up an organization of sports writers . Back in the early days of Cardinal successes , St. Louis scribes banded together for self-entertainment or to honor an outstanding figure in their world . It was Breadon 's turn . But because the writers did not see eye to eye with Rickey in the matter of cocktails , they thought it wiser to include Branch out . Breadon thought it would be rude , so Branch was invited . Before he was through the second paragraph of his after-dinner speech , in which he cited lifelong abstinence from misrepresentation , a heckler interrupted to demand why he had denied , several years back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward it turned out that such waivers had been sought . Peacemakers jumped to their feet , only to make matters worse . Partisans took sides and the Battle of Bill Doak , breaking up into skirmishes with every two cocktail glasses as a salient , also broke up the St. Louis Sports Writers Association . It has never met again , not even to ask if there was enough in the treasury to pay for a penitent parcel of flowers . A Nose For News Despite a verbosity that makes it difficult to quote with satisfactory accuracy , Rickey is an answer to the baseball writer 's prayer . He has a fine sense of humor and a nose for news and color . Whereas the average baseball man asks about a rookie 's arm , legs and batting average , Rickey finds out about family background , what his father does for a living and that an 59 uncle , named Louie , can play a guitar and ocarina simultaneously and say a neat mumbo jumbo on the side . Branch promulgated the first tales of Dizzy Dean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slightly on the portly side , there is a vanity about Rickey rather surprising in one of such rare intellect . When he moved to Brooklyn , press reports gave his age as sixty-two . In a press conference he made it his first point to correct that mistake , explaining he would n't be sixty-one for another month and asked that corrections be printed , so he could send clippings to Mrs. Rickey . If a newspaper prints a photograph he does n't fancy , he will send a messenger with a new studio portrait that does him justice . It always has irked him that he could n't wear clothes so he 'd look like a quietly tailored Leo Durocher . He complains that though he purchases the best suits from the finest tailors , he always is unkempt an hour after dressing . A swapping mania is part of the man . He 'll trade you hat , shirt , suspenders , belt , garters or socks , sight unseen if you prefer . Brooklyn 's Golden ' Tongue Rickey wasted no time establishing himself in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a monkey can do with another monkey . Asked by writers if his influence would carry any weight with the selection of the Dodger coach by . Manager Durocher , Rickey replied , " Generally speaking , no . But it might . And could and should , perhaps . In a given case , that is . " When an employee in the publicity department was fired in what a New York writer described as 300 well-chosen words , Branch included this gem among them : " Remember , Mr. Blank , happiness always lurks close to a poor man . " The fired man , after a slight case of recovery , said that was the trouble " It lurks and lurks and lurks . " In recent years Rickey has resided with his family at a country estate in St. Louis County , an elaborate establishment with stables , kennels , cows , turkeys , chickens and other things that make up a gentleman farmer 's farm . The estate is a far cry from the modest Duck Run farm that knew Week Rickey . Though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he gave the colorful winning Cardinals , Rickey 's personal friends are legion and devoted to him . Those friendships constitute a valuable chain , stretching from coast to coast , and provide an effective voluntary scouting system . If a fan buzzes in a remote crossroads town about a promising young ballplayer , a friend of Rickey hears the conversation and reports . There was the young pitcher who for a time was rated one of the most brilliant prospects in the Redbird organization . A friend reported to Branch . Scouts quickly were on the trail . They sent glowing reports , but regretted that there was discouraging competition in the field . The player was a boy in an orphans ' home and a wealthy major-league club , on the prowl ahead of the Cardinals , had gone so far as to offer to endow the institution substantially , in return for official co-operation at the proper contract-signing time . But Rickey took personal charge , sold the guardians a personal bill of goods , and the Cardinals got the player . Rickey faces a new challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he originated  --  building a great farm system . The system depends on an abundance of hungry young athletes , and baseball 's fertile fields now are sending their young men into the armed forces . As one veteran manager put it , " We have n't many farm clubs , but I 've got some hot tips on some wonderful rookies . One pitcher has n't any curve , and his fast ball is anybody else 's slow ball , but he 's forty , married , has three children , and has a glass eye . " For the duration , Rickey will he operating under a disadvantage . But those who know believe he 'll find a way , and baseball will experience another revolutionary innovation of some kind . Things already are happening in Brooklyn . Coach Chuck Dressen has been bounced . Popular Traveling Secretary McDonald has been exiled to Montreal . tin rummy and poker for high stakes are out . Even Manager Leo Durocher has been impregnated with the spirit of reform .
