THE PROFESSOR AND THE PULI A Story ROBERT MORSE T HE professor and his wife made their way across a field scattered with young cedars . At their feet opened the wide gorge of the Delaware River . Beyond the river all of Bucks County , like a huge map , tilted upward into the late spring haze . Mrs. Wood stopped for a moment to look more thoroughly at the far farmlands , the glittering silos , the high , terraced bluffs of the river . " Oh darling , are n't you glad we came after all ! " " Always yield to an impulse , " he said firmly . She thought : " But I am the impulsive one . He means  --  does n't he always mean  --  choosing ? Choosing for eternity . " They surmounted a little rise and saw their hostess waiting for them to come up to her . Martha Dodge had been Paula Wood 's classmate at Bryn Mawr . In spite of successful years as an executive in a New York firm she still wore a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , and an invitation to visit her friend 's new farm had pleased her very much , although she was surprised when her husband volunteered an acceptance . " Why not , my dear ? A day in the country will do us no harm . . . . " This was his yielding to an impulse . The three of them moved together toward a little clot of sheds and wire runways in the field beyond . Only Paula appeared to belong in this wide scene . It was notjust that her golden , brown , andfreckled colorings matched the colors of her surroundings . She was herself a fiddling , while her husband , for all his tweeds , looked pasted on , like a montage scissored from some other picture . As for Martha , she strode ahead of them , unmistakably a career woman , educated at Bryn Mawr , who had bought a new farm . Her executive energies had already transformed the property . Her freshly painted barns contained the best cows , the finest horses . She was proud of these and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs were the great rarity and the apple of her hazel eye . They exploded now into the bland springtime . Aroused by the sound of human voices and maddened by the prospect of human society , they came bounding from the shelter of the kennels or sprang upward from sleep among the grass of the runways to race noisily back and forth along the wire barrier . They were all alike , huge shapeless bundles of black wool , so agitated in every part one might have supposed there were three dogs under each matted coat . " Oh Martha ! " Paula cried . " What are they ? Where are their faces ? " " These are my pulik , " Martha said proudly . " Hungarian sheep dogs , you know . " They did not know , but they were enchanted by the frantic creatures , each struggling to place himself more favorably than his fellows to receive the attention of the visiting bipeds . As soon as one dog managed to stand on his hind legs and press belly and paws to the wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first the Woods were not sure whether the immense onrush was friendly or purely savage . But they soon made out it was all love , love , love , and they poked fearless fingers through to waiting tongues and ears . p ROFESSOR WOOD noticed one pull that remained quiet in all the flop and tumble . He was perhaps the largest of all , and yet he allowed the others to tread him down with their careless paws . No joy touched him . He did not even try to avoid the jostling . " Martha , is that big fellow over there sick ? " asked the professor . Feeling their attention on him , the dog began to tremble , His silver-rimmed eye rolled mournfully to them , then hid itself in the shaggy hairs of his face . " Poor old Bundash , poor old Bundash , " said Martha in a harassed tone . " No , he 's not sick , he 's just like that . That 's the way he is . " " There must be something wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I do n't honestly know what 's the matter with him . He had the same chance all the others had . But even as a puppy he acted just like that , scared and sort of neurotic  --  as if he 'd had a nervous breakdown in the womb . He makes me uncomfortable . .. . " " Uncomfortable , " said the professor to himself . " Her efficiency must have met with one of its few failures . She only understands what ' works . ' What does she know of the individual and his soul , the unlighted motives , the lethargies ? Even a dog . . . . " As if partly aware , as if . partly in defense , Martha went on : " Everybody has always been specially good to him . I praise him and pet him but it does n't seem to help . Sometimes I think if he could be separated from the others and live in the house  --  but I only get down a day or two a week , and the cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted her shoulders sadly . " She hates dogs . " The professor 's heart , a very tender heart , went out to the woolly heap of misery . As if telepathically aware , the dog lifted his head for the first time and looked at the professor with both eyes , like an old Florentine shade sitting up in his tomb of fire to look at Dante . For a moment the two were alone in the world together . Then the other indik all came barking and jumping , and Bundash 's head was forced down under their paws . It was too much . " Paula . . . " began the professor . " ' Always obey an impulse ' you know , dear , " Paula said , herself not untouched . " But I do n't think Flora would like it a bit . " Flora was a slim but aging dachshund , the tyrannical queen of the Woods ' New York apartment . Martha , who understood many things quickly , said : " Oh if you would only take him . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world for him . I would give him to you . He 's a really good dog , pure bred and all . . . . The truth is he makes me feel guilty somehow . " When the Woods started for home that afternoon Bundash lay inert and uncomplaining in the back seat of their car . How would Bundash , who had never left the cedared acres of his birth , feel about the Holland Tunnel ? What would he feel about the city beyond ? They came to the long plunge under the river . Their ears and eyes were assailed , as for the first time , by gleamings , clicks , and roars , and strangeness . There seemed to be an unusual number of cars and trucks . Many of them backfired in the echoing confinement . There was a smell of gasoline and hot machinery . " Dogs have such marvelous noses , " he thought . Aloud then : " Paula , see how he 's taking it . " She stretched out her hand . " He 's shaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehensively of Flora . Also there came to her an old vision of the Hudson rolling above them , the bottoms of ocean liners passing overhead . She was always prepared for a great rush of water , and only a second 's time to say good-by to her husband . " Good-by . I love you , " was the phrase she had rehearsed  --  and then the Hudson closing their mouths forever . The tunnel remained , for this one more time , watertight  --  and they emerged in the paved spaces of lower Manhattan , so like a place where the dungeon of one tyranny has been cleared away to make room for the guillotine of its successor . But there were no mobs hp.e , only thousands and thousands of metal vehicles streaming in curious patterns across the emptiness . These conflicting lines were not without their courtesies for their own metallic kind : one formation would halt to let another flow on , then would go ahead , then again stop . But there was no place in the pattern for flesh not cased in steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels as if in a gesture of defiance . Tonight no one questioned the tide of machines finding their way home through the various openings in the buildings . The %Voods ' Buick ( ' 38 ) chose the raised uptown highway , and swept Bundash and the others past funneled ships on one hand ( " Now I am above them . . " thought Paula ) and high , stepped towers on the other . The three red-haired children were waiting for them in the comfortable , shabby apartment on 78th Street , So was Flora . The children were enraptured with their new playmate and wrapped arms of varying chubbiness about his patient neck . Flora , aghast , indignant for but a moment , sniffed Failure and leapt without a further glance to the comforts of the best sofa . There , after many imperial yawns . she affected to doze . But that was the end of Bundash for her . It was not the end of Bundash for the professor . F oon and water first , These were es- sential to the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel this was his home , and was n't home to any dog the place where he was fed ? But Bun-dash showed no wish to prolong his life . Again and again they coaxed his nose to a dish of meat , and he turned away as from some meaningless substance . Water he snuffled up in large quantities , but that was the extent of his co-operation in the plan . However , the professor was encouraged to see that the dog stayed close to him , and he fancied that Bundash was grateful for the touch of his hand . The rest of the family made their overtures in vain . Their caresses seemed meaningless as the offerings of meat . Only the professor 's voice reached him , but reached him slowly , as if the way to his far-off brain wound through muffling thickets of hair . He responded to commands only after painful minutes of immobility . And yet he responded , The long look man and dog had shared in the kennels had amounted to a sort of vow after all . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor 's did not express itself in wags of the tail , friendly butts of the head , barks and prancing  --  only an oppressive propinquity . Of course it is too soon , the professor thought . Later we will see . Presently Flora yapped a signal that it was time for her nightly visit to the curb . Confident and svelte , she jingled down the three flights of stairs . But tonight she had to wait a long time at the street door . Professor Wood did not find it easy to persuade Bundash to follow him to the sidewalk , and once there Bundash did not understand why  --  even with Flora 's example . Or did he think the whole city was one enormous house ? After half an hour the professor conceded failure , and they climbed the stairs again . Long after the other Woods had gone to bed the professor sat up with his unsleeping pro-4.6 . He felt that his presence might be reassuring . Bundash , who showed a marked fear of open places , of the center with its dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers , and settled at last in the kneehole of the professor 's desk . This was to be his place . This was the cave from which he sent out his dark emanations of agony . The professor found himself painfully receptive at some animal level long unused . It was more than a sympathetic intuition . The agony was within his own skin . " How much of this am I getting from the dog , and how much is my own anxiety for a new responsibility  --  or just simply my own anxiety ? " he asked himself . An experience of his youth returned to him : his first night at boarding school . The recollection pleased him . It seemed to him now that he had been just like Bun-dash , that what he had wanted then , more than anything , was a cave out of the light . But in two or three days he had made the proper adjustments , the first of the adjustments that led in a long line to the present day and to a reasonable invulnerability . His brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had mastered all the major schools of thought . Aristotle , Kant , Bergson , Buddha , Marx , Pareto , Toynbee , Thomas Aquinas were familiar to him as his own pockets ( which they had done so little to fill ) . There was scarcely an argument that he could not answer with the most effective response man 's brain had been able to devise  --  as a trained wrestler knows the break for any hold . He gave courses in philosophy and ethics . His lectures in aesthetics had modified many of his students ' lives because of the fervor of his belief in the seriousness of art and his rejection of niggling formulas . During the war he taught mathematics . But he was not just a teacher . He had avoided and gone beyond the confinement of the academic world with its burning , spiteful rivalries and narrow scholarship . Completeness had been his deliberate goal , so that he had learned to play theeasier Bach Preludes , and had made himself an expert in the structure of labor unions , both foreign and domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-nine per cent of the Russians . He could distinguish the " periods " of Rubens , and was a deft hand with the income tax . The professor brought the same ideal of completeness to personal relations , so that his friends were very various , ranging from an alcoholic medium , through bankers , golfers , society women , painters , to mechanics and a Greek bartender with a shoe fetish . These types he valued as nearly as possible in their own terms , and would have been acutely shamed if he had detected in himself any prejudice or want of fairness . When with his friends he drank rather a lot , but never got drunk  --  at least not in the way that forgets itself  --  merely sleepy . In short he was a remarkable man , and reasonably invulnerable . The rosary of his accomplishments slid dimly through the professor 's mind , but brought no gratification . A swift thought darted out and away . Have I acquired all these things for my enrichment or for my defense ? If defenses , which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rolling stones against the mouth of a cave ? Bundash looked at him from his place under the desk . Nothing of the dog was visible but a single very clear , very round , beautiful eye shining out of a hairy darkness . Professor Wood made his weary way to bed , but he could not sleep . He could feel a steady pressure from the adjoining room . He knew there was no rest in the dark kneehole . T HE eye was still there in the morning , a smoky jelly . Had it ever closed ? Little Paula went on all fours to coax the dog to his food . " Darling Bundash , come out , come out ! " she shrilled in tones that should have persuaded a Lazarus . Fat Jimson , the baby , exhorted : " Hawo bub bosh . " But Bundash could not be moved . He needed a more difficult magic than the voices of children . The professor marched in from his tumbled bed . Miss Feitelbaum , who secretly adored him from the third row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravages a sleepless night had worked in his orderly face . " Oh Daddy , how funny you look ! " cried candid Miss Paula . Bundash indicated by the merest lifting of his bulk that he recognized authority . A word of command at last penetrated the woolly forests that lay between him and the world . He rose to his feet with painful halts , like the first clay of life separating itself from the earth . He consented to be led to the street , but again he had no understanding of what was expected of him . The gates of his body remained sealed . Block after block the professor walked him , and brought him home again at last , baffled . " He undoubtedly needs the sight of trees and grass . I 'll take him to the park after breakfast . " Professor Wood sighed ; he had planned to give his morning to a great pile of students ' papers , neglected over the weekend . He thought about reflexes . If you had never known anything but the country  --  if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite noticed how little vegetation there was in New York . The only green they had seen on their morning walk was a tuft of crabgrass that had sown itself in an iron urn , sole ornament of a paved courtyard . Again Bundash would not touch his breakfast . Again he drank a quantity of water . " Surely with all that water in him . . . " thought the professor , and it was in a mood of new hope he started out for the park , the dog huddled at his heels . He had never been so aware of the traffic before  --  the roaring , the shriek of brakes , the sharp musketry of exhaust pipes , the hugeness of the busses , and their terrible whooshing sighs . By the time he had got them both safe across the perilous stream of Fifth Avenue the professor was in a sweat of empathy . It was at him the taxis had hooted , the trucks charged , the ten thousand strangers stared . They were in the park at last . " Now ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrid novelties he had just come through , at any rate he responded to the lawns and bushes as he had to everything else  --  he trembled faintly and maintained the forlorn dignity of despair . Pigeons whirled and strutted about him . Childrenraced and rolled . Bundash remained a black silence against the sunlight and green and motion  --  a silence without a face . After some hours they started home , still unsuccessful . Between Madison and Park , Professor Wood , with his new animal awareness , sensed a change in the dog , a willingness . He was invaded at the same time by an unexpected knowledge , the knowledge of agoraphobia . They must find some protection against the exposed street . Instructed from within , he lifted the dog over a low privet hedge into a little stony enclosure . There was no doubt about Bundash 's intention , but just at that moment an ambulance came howling from one direction , a fire engine bore down on them from another . Lesser fire cars with screams and clanging followed , like infernal chariots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air was solid with sound . Windows jumped and chattered in their casements . The stones underfoot shuddered . And so did Bundash . It was useless for the professor to command or coax , the pull refused to leave his frail shelter . After fifteen minutes his master was obliged to climb the hedge himself and lift the big , trembling dog in his arms . Some boys behind him laughed as he scrambled back to the street . No doubt he and his burden made a laughable picture , but he was too fiercely identified with Bunclash 's sensibilities to care . Paula , when they got home , looked at her husband for a moment , then said : " Dearest , I think you had better take one of your luminaLs . You know Dr. Spencer said to take one whenever you got jumpy again . " T ins was only the first day . The second , following another sleepless night , was the same . Papers piled up on the desk . Bundash would not make water . Although he continued to drink greedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long walks , love was lavished on him where the subtlest insight failed , but he returned always to the kneehole in the desk . " He just has no sense of joy at all , " mourned the professor , swallowing another luminal with an early highball . " That 's what is most terrible . " " Now , now , Duncan . Just give him time , " said Paula . Much of Paula 's tranquillity came from her friendly confidence in Time . For this reason she rarely fretted about the children . When her husband read in their youthful backslidings a permanent corruption of character she was likely to say : " It 's just a phase , dear . " And she was of course right . But utter joylessness was the most terrible aspect of the dog . It amounted to not caring , not wanting to be saved . People who went to psychoanalysts surely had some undefeated quality in them that wanted to be saved from sickness of soul . They could talk . The analysts could draw words out of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to love , so joyless , so uninterested , that nothing could reach them in their cold secrecy ? For them , all approaches , all bribes and lures and threats were alike meaningless . " If only he could talk to me , " thought the professor , scarcely aware of his absurdity , " But nothing can be done with him until he clears his body . " The Woods ' friends had learned of their experiment , and with the softheartedness of New Yorkers , phoned frequently for the latest bulletin . The phone stood on the desk just above the dog 's cave , and each thrill of the bell pierced the professor to the brain . He or Paula would snatch up the receiver to say , " No , not yet . " A number of these friends dropped in at intervals for a cocktail and a look at Bundash . Each secretly felt he had an infallible way with dogs , but Bundash responded no more than a lump . Rather than being cheered by his well-wishers he depressed them , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way into the cocktail shaker . They began to drink like people keeping off the cold , defiantly . Mary Maple , who for decades had considered all males her province without bothering to count their feet , returned again and again to the seduction of Bundash . After four martinis she was the rough and ready Pal , after six she had shifted to the mysterious , all-understanding woman . Two more cocktails saw her on her knees screaming murder and obscenity into the cave under the desk . Suddenly she was sobbing . " Not even a dog , Not even a black ? ? of a dog wants anything of me . What does any of you know ? " They knew that her husband always seemed to find a job abroad . Rosalie Reagen , who had progressed from unexamined Protestant , to Atheist , to Communist , to War Widow , to Catholic , had meanwhile struggled to draw attention from the dog to herself , launching a provocative word here , seizing an elbow there . Now , giving up , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties . " But Paula had already led Mary to a back bedroom with kindly murmurs . The editor of the Spartan Review lifted the company to a purer air by drawing a comparison between Bundash and certain concepts and passages in Kafka . " Now if you take K 's insoluble problem of incommensurables. . . . " he continued . The other visitors spoke less and less . They stared in awe at the shaggy reservoir of mounting urine . A NOTHER DAY passed as before . The professor 's mind was aching with his responsibility and failure . He introduced Bundash 's case in his new lecture on Existentialism . It seemed a pertinent and illuminating example . But his strong instinct to externalize the trouble the poi had stirred up in him would have made the case seem pertinent to a discussion of any theme . Accordingly , after a long look at the rows of respectful faces turned to him , he began : " Since the direction of thought I wish to take up this morning does not permit , logically , any vantage-point outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best begin with a story from life itself : Once there was a dog . .. . " Miss Feitelbaum 's pencil slid over the page of her notebook . " Once there was a dog . . . . " she set down in her useful shorthand , then waited receptive and ecstatic for the next words . This was the stuff . Her pencil moved on , not missing a syllable . The professor had reached his classroom by subway , so wrapped in familiar custom and last-minute ideas for his forthcoming lecture he had scarcely noticed how he traveled . But now , as he boarded the subway for his return trip , he found himself trembling . Ears , eyes , nose , skin , suddenly blared his surroundings at him . Had he ever been in this place before ? There had never been so many people , people so angry or so indifferent , people slyly touching or crushing brutally against him . There had never been this train with its awful racket , reduplicated by the underground vaults . It was as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his skin and dispossessed his old self . Why else did he tremble ? Why else did he ask himself : Has it always been like this ? At the next express stop he made a bolt for the street level , determined to walk home . Here there was another unending crush of people , anonymous as insects . The busses whooshed . The traffic attacked him . Smells and sounds came to his senses without the human censorship of disinterest . He was a dog for keenness , but Duncan Wood interpreted the evidence . " What do any ofyou know , " he said almost aloud to the strangers , echoing poor Mary Maple . " Do you know how you are suffering , each of you ? " It was the paving that offended him most . His feet could feel the grain and harshness of it , as if they had become shoeless paws . Was there really earth underneath the stone and the asphalt  --  or just more stone and a network of steam pipes and drains . All fertility seemed shut away under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet over and under these hard surfaces , he observed children playing hardily in the thick of the traffic , for want of a better place . He imagined that presently the nameless strangers would carry their young underground , clasping them in their forearms like ant eggs when the hill has been disturbed , to cells hollowed among the steam pipes . He made his way up Lexington Avenue , buffeted by novel impressions . It was as if his senses were suspended just two feet above the sidewalk . He might have traveled on all fours , he was so aware of filth and gum trodden into the concrete , of wheels and hydrants , of human odors breathing over doorsteps . He reached home at last , footsore , or padsore , his mind filled with dingy and ominous visions . The street sounds fol lowed him into his apartment . He closed the windows against them , but , scarcely dimmed , they found their way to his dog-tender ear drums . Even his own children rasped his nerves  --  and for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow rooms , as if there were not air enough to go ' around . He even questioned his love for them . What is love ? Does one really love anyone ? He tried to summon up the shape of his love for these housemates , to probe and test the quality of its connective tissues . Nothing came to him but outside sounds and smells . There was still the desk to cling to , with its clear rectangular lines , with its piles of lecture notes , and papers , and well-known books . He would force himself to correct an examination . He seated himself in the usual chair , put on his glasses , and began to read , but the words meant little to him in his fatigue . He drummed on the desktop , his nails tapping desperately among the signs and symbols of his life work , among the paper proofs of long , ordered , intellectual endeavor . He was drumming on the roof of darkness . Under this wooden planking his legs extended down into the kneehole , into Bundash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask about Bundash 's condition . He was Bundash . In short the husk of custom had been stripped from him , and with it the tough tolerance required by city life . The little box of luminal was emptying rapidly . oxtE time before daybreak he said to S himself in his bed : Why  --  what hell have I been living in without know-ing it ? The picture of an alternative life formed in his half-dreaming mind . He could still escape the trap . He saw himself leaving Paula and the children , his work , everything he had been accustomed to love , and taking to the wilderness with Bundash . He saw a hermit 's cave  --  no , that was too silly  --  he saw a shack by a pond , a pond curiously like his first im-agining of Walden . He must find rebirth in those waters , wash away the old , con-trived , weary , death-appeasing self like an accumulation of stale sweat . The pool was around him , fresh and gray in the dawn . A black form dived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently that dripping head would be laid on his knee again , begging for a trout . A thick , miserable coughing in the next room interrupted this revery . He and Paula stumbled through the door together . There stood poor Bundash vomiting into a viscous green and black puddle . " No , no ! It 's too much . The dog is really sick , " and they bundled their puli off to a veterinary as soon as his office was open . Martha Dodge had recommended him in case of trouble . Later , Professor Wood called Martha . " I 'm sorry , Martha . I 'm afraid that dog is hopeless . We just ca n't keep him . Yes , I think he 's really sick this time . I 've left him at your vet 's . " H E REPLACED the receiver with a sense of defeat and of relief as well . Paula 's kind , charming eyes were on him . " You know , Paula , I 'm not sure it was just because Bundash got sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was beginning to mean something to me , something quite awful . " For a moment the professor glimpsed Bundash as the enemy , persuading him ever nearer to the edge of danger , drawing him into his own deathlike world where all endeavor , all love , all planning for time to come , were reduced to futilities . Bundash was Death , he thought . " But that is unfair , " he thought . " How can a dog be blamed ? " Meanwhile fat Jimson had pushed his untidy , resilient little person past the barrier of the professor 's legs , and now regarded him from thetwilight of the kneehole with an upward glance of unmixed geniality . " If there was an enemy , he was in myself , and will always be there . I should bless Bundash for giving me this fresh glimpse of him . I have been given a chance to choose again , the only choice . " He looked fondly on Paula , and leaned to prod his young son in the stomach till the toothless chuckles rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , " said Paula . " No , dear . My papers . " Some days later the professor received a note : Dear Duncan , I picked up the puli at the vet 's today . I 'm sorry you had a bad time . The vet says there is nothing in the world wrong with him . He did everything he was supposed to , and seems in quite good spirits , better at least than I have ever seen him . I do n't know how you did it in such a short time , but Bundash is now perfectly trained for the city . He heels perfectly and seems to know all about traffic . I have given him to Brenda Arden  --  the actress , you know  --  and she is utterly enchanted with him . By the way , what on earth did you say to the vet ? You made a great impression on him . He was quite worried about you . He says he never saw a more nervous man . Have you been working too hard ? It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down this weekend ? I have a new litter of puppies . Perhaps you 'd like one . As ever , Martha
