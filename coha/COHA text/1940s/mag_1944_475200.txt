AT THE coroner 's inquest over Estelle Carey 's body , a witness testified that the murdered woman was " the girl friend " of Nick Dean and that she worked for him in his night club . Nick Dean recently had been sent to prison , along with the other leaders of the Syndicate in Chicago , for labor-union racketeering . It had often been said that the Syndicate , an organization of gangsters , ruled Chicago . Unquestionably in recent years it had been powerful in some of the city 's labor unions and night clubs . It had also reached beyond Chicago and was affiliated professionally with the New York mob called Murder , Inc . Similarly , Estelle was involved personally with a purported member of Murder , Inc . Naturally , therefore , the overtones and implications of the Carey murder case were ? and still are ? of extraordinary interest . Nearly every well-patronized saloon and night club in Chicago has a " 26 game . " This is a cheap dice game , a concession operated for the amusement of patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is run by a girl , usually attractive . In many cases , like the hat-check girl , she works on a percentage for the Syndicate . Perched on a high stool behind the small spotlighted green felt dice table , she must be on duty long hours at night and must listen to the conversation of lonely male drunks ; and if , bored , she allows her game to show a slump in profits she can expect to be shipped promptly to a tavern where business is dull and her earnings small . Most 26 girls average less than $50 a week . Estelle Carey , nominally a 26 girl , had an income of at least $500 a week . Blonde , good-looking , Estelle was murdered February 2 , 1943 . Thirteen months later her killer had not been caught and it appeared he never would be . This is the story of her death , and so it is the story of her world , the world of the Syndicate . HE Syndicate " is a term tossed around familiarly by nearly everyone in Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alphonse CapOne used to be called the boss . ( But was he ? ) Just how tightly organized the Syndicate is today is problematical . Some say it is simply a loose federation of sluggers , murderers , fixers , ward heelers , policemen , lawyers , bondsmen , gamblers , and all manner of racketeers who employ one another 's services as necessity dictates but lack formal organization . Others say it is a criminal band with rigid hierarchy . The truth probably lies between these extremes , but all the evidence seems to indicate a pretty tight organization . The Syndicate sprawls all over Chicago and has a hand in everything . Traditionally it controls gambling and vice . It has been extremely active in labor unions . Its members own night clubs and a great variety of legitimate businesses . They turn up in surprising connections . Acting Captain William Drury , who investigated the murder of lovely Estelle Carey , says positively that " it was a gang job . " Other officers disagree , equally positively . Some of them say that Estelle 's Syndicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a crime of passion motivated perhaps by jealousy . And some even maintain that a fur-coat burglar killed her . Nobody knows , nobody but the murderer . Estelle Carey lived with another girl , Maxine Buturff , in a four-room apartment at 512 Addison Street , on the North Side near the lake , a desirable location . There was no elevator in the building . Estelle 's third-floor apartment was not ostentatious but it was nice . The rent was $75 a month , unfurnished . The furniture , Miss Buturff 's , was Swedish modern , of good quality . Each of the two young women paid half the rent . Estelle was killed here in mid-afternoon on a drizzly winter Chicago day , when dirty snow lay on the sidewalks and in the court of the big U-shaped apartment building on Addison Street . At 3:09 P.M. firemen were called to the apartment by neighbors who smelled smoke . When the firemen found Estelle 's body they notified police at the Town Hall District Station , only a few blocks away . Captain Drury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dining room on the floor , partially covered by an overturned chair . Her killer had beaten , stabbed , and slashed her , then had set her afire . The coroner 's physician discovered numerous wounds about the head and face and throat , some made by a blunt instrument and some by a sharp one but all superficial : the skull was not fractured and it was fire which had caused her death . Her feet were " burned off , " according to inquest testimony , and the flesh was burned off both legs nearly up to the knee , exposing the bone . The upper portion ofher body , protected by the chair , was burned only slightly . Near the body lay a broken bottle which investigation disclosed had not belonged to either E , steIle or her roommate , Miss Buturff ; apparently the killer had brought it with him and it had contained some inflammable liquid with which he saturated his victim 's clothing . ( Laboratory experts failed to identify the liquid but said there was no doubt that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its back , and it was believed possible that Estelle had been sitting in the chair when she first was attacked , perhaps reading , for a copy of Wilkie Collins 's The Moonstone was found near the body . However , it was plain she had fought for her life : the police found signs of a terrific struggle not only in the dining room , where the body lay , but also in the kitchen . Near the body was some hair matted with blood ; the fire made positive identification difficult but the police Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory said not all of the hair came from Estelle 's head and none of it from Miss Buturff 's . More hair was on the floor in the kitchen ; there were bloodstains on the stove , on the rear door near the base , and on the cupboard where dishes were kept . The officers also found in the kitchen a blackjack , a bloody bread knife , and a bloody electric iron . A fourth weapon , a bloody broken whisky bottle , lay near the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obliterated by the time the Bertillon experts arrived , for the fire , a hot one , had spread rapidly and done a lot of damage , and the firemen had made a mess of things in fighting it . The firemen said that when they reached the flat they found both doors locked from the inside , and so the police were confronted with the locked-room problem so popular with detective story writers . The front door was double-locked , not only with an ordinary spring lock but also with a bolt , identical to that on most hotel doors , which had to be manipulated manually from the inside . Obviously the killer could not have escaped by way of the front door . The windows were out of consideration , the apartment being on the third floor . Examining the rear door , the detectives found that it could be opened only an inch or two because a steel night latch , a sliding nut-and-notch arrangement , was set at half-lock . True , a window beside this rear door had been smashed , but the firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the end the detectives concluded that the murderer had fled by the rear door and that he had slammed the door behind him hard enough to snap the sliding night latch halfway on ( experiments proved this possible ) . This theory was bolstered when the officers , canvassing the large apartment building for possible witnesses , discovered in a ground-floor flat a Mrs. Jessie Lovrein who said she had seen a man come down the rear stairs from the section of the building where Estelle lived carrying two fur coats ( two coats , a mink and a sable , were missing from the apartment ) . He walked across an ice-covered vacant lot toward Lake Shore Drive , Mrs. Lovrein said . Immediately the police started trying to trace him . Mrs. Lovrein thought she had seen him at a little past 2:30 P.M. , and this helped fix the time of the crime . The firemen believed that the fire had been started only a few minutes before they were called at 3:09 . Estelle had been alive at 1:00 ? her cousin , Mrs. Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who contrasted sharply with the dead glamour girl , had telephoned her at that time to break a date to go to a movie that night . While Mrs. Zyrkowski was explaining that she could n't find anybody to take care of her baby , she heard Estelle 's doorbell ring and also heard the dog bark . ( Firemen found the dog , a Pomeranian , on Estelle 's bed . ) Estelle said she was expecting a caller . Mrs. Zyrkowski promised to telephone again , and she did , several times , but received no answer until finally a cop answered . Most of the police believe this caller who arrived about one was the murderer and that he was known to Estelle , although of course it is possible he transacted his business and departed and was succeeded by an entirely different person , the murderer . This theory is questioned because the one-o'clock caller has not come forward and identified himself . It is held chieflyby those who believe a fur-coat burglar killed Estelle . At first jewelry thought to be worth about $2,500 could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe in the closet , along with the key to a safe-deposit box . Police set about tracing the vault . They did not believe that the murderer had made a thoroughgoing search of the flat . Therefore , could robbery have been the motive ? True , the officers found no money in the flat , and Miss Buturff said that Estelle usually carried $75 or $100 ; true , two fur coats were missing , and Miss Buturff had seen them at 10:30 A.M. when she went to work . ( At that time Estelle was still asleep , alone , in one of the twin beds in the single bedroom . ) But the murderer did not find the jewels or the lock-box key , nor did he ransack dresser drawers and other obvious hiding places . The police wondered if the coats might not have been taken in order to build up a robbery theory and so conceal the true motive . Puzzling over these questions , they tried to determine whether a man or a woman had murdered Estelle . This was crucial , for on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder or a private one ? A man had been seen fleeing with the coats . Two cups , one containing the dregs of hot chocolate and the other dry cocoa and sugar , seemed to indicate Estelle had entertained a woman ; but Miss Buturff explained that Estelle had prepared hot chocolate for the two of them the night before . Perhaps the firmest foundation for the theory of the woman murderer was this : the beating Estelle received would not have killed her . What man would bludgeon a woman repeatedly with a heavy blackjack without fracturing the skull ? What man would attempt to slit a person 's throat but only inflict a scratch ? Estelle was only five feet three and weighed only one hundred and ten pounds ; yet she had carried on a long and perhaps almost successful struggle with her murderer , had at least yanked out some of his hair , and perhaps had wounded him , for , since " she bled very little , " it was considered possible that not all of the blood spattered about was hers . Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor was Estelle 's ; does a man snatch at a woman 's hair ? And yet again , the multiplicity and kind of weapons suggested a woman ? a butcher knife , an electric iron , a broken whisky bottle are a woman 's weapons . But is a blackjack ? No , a blackjack is a man 's weapon , more particularly , a hoodlum 's . Could there have been two murderers , one male , one female ? Bound up in this question is the attempted cremation of the corpse , one of the most puzzling circumstances in the case . Usually a torch murder has just one object : to conceal forever the victim 's identity . But how could the murderer in this case have hoped to conceal his victim 's identity when he had killed her in her own apartment ? What , then , was the reason for the fire ? One theory is that the murderer was an insanely jealous woman bent on destroying Estelle 's beauty . In rebuttal it is urged that the fire simply was set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estelle , not to the apartment itself ; had he coldly set about destroying the furnishings and weapons he would have sprayed the inflammable fluid in various spots throughout the flat , such as on curtains , rugs , overstuffed furniture . He did not ; he poured it on Estelle 's clothes , and on nothing else . Yet even this indisputable fact , pointing as it seems to toward an act of passion , does not rule out the possibility that Estelle was murdered by methodical gangsters , for they might have been torturing their victim , or they might have been attempting to disguise the crime as a private killing . The fire seems consistent with any of the several theories of motive ( and hence of identity of the murderer ) save one ? burglary . ( A burglar excited by the murder he did not intend to commit and desperate in his efforts to obliterate all clues might have been careless enough to saturate only Estelle 's clothing with the inflammable fluid ; but a burglar never would have brought the fluid with him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IL a warmly inscribed photograph of a good-looking young soldier ( nearly everybody in the case , including Captain Drury , was good-looking ) . They also found a batch of love letters from the soldier , professing his love and jealousy of Estelle ; at least one of the letters appeared to threaten Estelle if she deserted him for any other man . He himself was married , and his affairs in Chicago 's night life were curiously entangled with Estelle 's : before entering the Army he had been a headwaiter at an expensive Near North Side drinking place and his wife had worked as a 26 girl at the Colony Club under Estelle 's direction . His letters to Estelle spoke of his divorce suit , which was pending . The detectives also discovered in Estelle 's apartment an address book containing a number of men 's names . Each had to be investigated . One was a reputable business man , Earl M. Weymer ; Estelle had been mentioned prominently in his bitter divorce suit several years earlier , and a cop described him at the inquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police questioned him . He had known Estelle for several years . Recently he had seen Estelle in Florida but he insisted that he was not there " with her . " He last had seen her on Sunday in Chicago , two days before she was killed ; in evening clothes they had dined at the Ambassador Hotel , an expensive place frequented by people " in society , " and Estelle had not appeared worried , which seems strange under the circumstances , as we shall see . We shall return to this and to Estelle 's Florida trip , and to her other involved personal affairs . But perhaps it would be best first to trace briefly her life history . III HE was thirty-four when she died . She 0 had been born in Chicago . Her parents , like so many older-generation Chicagoans , had come to the city from small towns in adjacent states . Estelle 's father died when she was about two years old and her mother put her in an orphanage , where she remained until her mother remarried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adopting his name ( her true name was Smith ) . She quit school in her teens to go to work in a factory and later she was a telephone operator . In 1930 , twenty-two years old and a gorgeous natural blonde , she left home to make her own way . At the time of her death her mother , a thin-faced , plain , bewildered woman , was quoted as saying , " She was high-toned . She did n't want to live in our little apartment above a bakery . But she was a good gill " Estelle did not move in a single leap from the flat over the bakery to $500 a week as Nick Dean 's " girl friend , " the confidante of powerful Syndicate leaders . She worked as a waitress in a restaurant in Logan Square , then as a waitress in Rickett 's , a place frequented by theatrical and professional people on the Near North Side , in the heart of the bright-lights district . Here she was noticed by Nick Dean . His true name was Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time he met Estelle about a dozen years before she was killed he was close to the top of the Syndicate , from the leadership of which the federal income-tax men had just removed Al Capone . He was to become even more powerful , and Estelle was to rise with him . Before long she was running a 26 game at the Yacht Club , a flashy , expensive night club on the Near North Side ( since closed ) . It was said ? but , as is the case with so many statements made about Syndicate men , probably never proved ? that Nick Dean was one of the owners of the Yacht Club and that another was Lawrence ( " Dago " ) Mangano . There was a gambling room upstairs , and those who say the Yacht Club was a Syndicate spot point out that " you ca n't run a gambling joint in Chicago without the Syndicate 's okay . " MITE world into which Estelle now was 2. moving was the fringe of show business , the fringe of hoodlumism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Little Italy slums . Up and down it , from the river north nearly to Division Street , ran Rush Street , in the Nineties a Gold Coast street , now a street of tall brick apartment buildings and hotels , of night clubs and saloons from the sleaziest in Chicago to the fanciest , of faded brownstones remodeled into rooming houses and studio apartments . Rush Street , heart of the Near North Side , and the side streets off it were drab and deserted by day but they blazed with light most of the night . On this Near North Side lived side by side reputable persons of wealth , gorgeous girls in show business , artists , musicians , writers , " career girls , " hot-record collectors , cheap thieves , high-priced prostitutes , Syndicate business leaders , song-and-dance men . On the streets were convertible coupes , on the sidewalks slender girls in chubbies with dogs on leashes . At least one murder has been committed in a hotel lobby in this district in recent years . And in this district during the twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the gangs of Al Capone and Dion O'Banion : that of O'Banion , shot dead as he shook the hand of a caller in the florist 's shop he used as headquarters , and that of Hymie Weiss , his successor and would-be avenger , who walked into a machine-gun ambush in front of Holy Name Cathedral across the street from the florist 's shop . In the thirties the Near North Side night clubs were fancy and expensive . Many employed hostesses , observed ( illegally ) no closing hours , ran roulette wheels and crap games , and enjoyed the patronage of high public officials and playboys , of wealthy married men carrying on illicit romances , of people in show business and people in the rackets . These were not the haunts of cafe society . Dissatisfied customers and others have called these night clubs " clip joints , " and it is true they were expensive and they " got a sucker play . " This was Estelle 's new world . Her rise was rapid . When the Colony Club opened in 1938 she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club was the most expensive , the flashiest , the most " intimate " hot spot on the Near North Side . Located at 744 Rush Street , it was reputedly owned by Nick Dean , but he denied this in 1940 and told the police it was owned by his brother , August , and Henry ( " Sonny " ) Goldstone ( a night-club entrepreneur ) . " When I am in town I go over there and try to help out my brother . I know quite a few people in town . " He said he received no salary for this . He also said that the Colony Club employed about seventy-five people , all union members ( Nick was deeply interested in the labor movement , as we shall see ) . The Colony employed a rumba band and , almost alone among Chicago clubs , such single-featured stars as Carmen Miranda , Connie Boswell , and Maxine Sullivan . Its dance floor was tiny , its d6cor dramatic , its lighting subdued , its drinks and dinners expensive . It claimed to be " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its patrons did not even know about the gambling room upstairs . On the first floor were about six 26 games ; upstairs were at least two roulette wheels and several crap tables and chuck-luck layouts . The croupiers wore dinner jackets . One police officer has said , " The sky was the limit . " The story goes that Estelle once took $10,000 from a gambler in two hours at dice . She was good . She started as a 26 girl , and it was thus that her occupation was identified by her mother and her roommate at the inquest . ( Her mother said she did n't know whom Estelle worked for , but her roommate said it was Nick Dean , " the owner of the Colony Club . " Estelle 's social security card listed her employer as Goldstone . ) Before long she was in charge of the half-dozen or so other 26 girls who worked at the Colony . Nick Dean finally cut her in on the profits of the gambling , and her income was $500 a week or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother testified she had not seen her since the preceding August , although Estelle had sent her some money for Christmas . " Of course , you know , I was worried because she traveled , " her mother testified . " I had not seen her , did not hear from her so much . That is , she said , ' I can take care of myself . Do n't worry , mother . ' " IV N ow Nick Dean 's story is an interesting one . In it can be read the story of the Syndicate itself , for Nick Dean 's career might be called typical of that of most of the Syndicate big shots . As he changed , so did they , and so did Chicago . He began as a cheap stickup man ; he ended by extorting a million dollars from some of America 's wealthiest business men . Born in Chicago about 1900 , he pleaded guilty to a robbery charge on December 13 , 1915 , and was placed on probation for a year . Before the year was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty to a charge of assault with attempt to commit murder in a saloon holdup . ( Two charges of assault to rob and four of robbery were stricken off . ) He was then living in the slums of Little Italy on the Near West Side . He was paroled September 1 , 1921 . After that , Dean , like so many other Syndicate men , had a long list of arrests but almost no convictions . Among his associates during those early years , as revealed by the Criminal Court records , was Frank Rio , who later achieved fame as Alphonse Capone 's personal bodyguard . Some of the subsequent big shots came from the Black Hand gangs of Little Italy . Both by design and blind chance the Syndicate was forming . The catalytic agent was prohibition . Big Jim Colosimo , the vice ruler , had called in Johnny Torrio from New York to guard him against the dread Black Hand , and Torrio brought in as an assistant a kid from the Five Points Gang named Al Capone . The cure proved worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Capone and Torrio took over . That was in 1920 . The Syndicate is still in power . Under Colosimo 's rule power had been based chiefly on vice . Nearly coincident with his death came prohibition . Bootleg liquor became the flood that swept the big shots into power in Chicago . Before long , as one of them has boasted , they were buying policemen and politicians like bananas , by the bunch ; before long they were immune , except to bullets . Al Capone became a world figure ( though some will tell you he was only a front man for Frank Nitti , the brain , and others ) ; " Chicago boys " became a phrase that meant gangsters and still does ; murder lost its news value ; Chicagoans proudly pointed out Capone 's " castle " in Cicero to awestruck country cousins ; the take was three millions a week , and St. Valentine 's Day was not far off . In the twenties Capone 's organization grossed less than ten millions a year from rackets , including labor ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Dean got in on none of this immediately ; as late as 1924 he still was being accused of robbery . But by 1927 he had entered the activity in which , in common with the other Syndicate big shots , he later would make a million and meet disaster : labor . He was one of the first Syndicate leaders to enter the labor movement . The others were not far behind , for necessity pushed them . Times were changing . Al Capone went to prison in 1931 for income-tax evasion . Frankie Rio was heir apparent but he failed and was replaced . by Frank ( " The Enforcer " ) Nitti , born Nitto , a small , cold , flat-faced man long called the business genius of the Capone organization . He survived Leavenworth and intra- and inter-gang warfare and the bullets of Mayor Anton Cermak 's personal policemen ( Cermak was killed in Florida soon afterward by an assassin who , the Chicago story goes , was n't shooting at President-elect Roosevelt at all ) . Among Nitti 's lieutenants were Louis ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brother-in-law of AI Capone ) , Nick Dean , and a host of others . With their aid Nitti held the Syndicate together . ( About this time Dean met Estelle Carey . ) Repeal had dried up the main source of income , illegal alcohol . The revenue from vice declined . Gambling remained but was not enough alone . So the boys sought new fields of endeavor . Rackets were the thing ? rackets of all kinds . Labor was just one racket , but it was one of the most important . We can study the Syndicate by studying only its activities in labor . And we can best trace the full-fledged entry of the Syndicate , as such , into the labor field by studying what happened to George Browne . V G ORGE BROWNE was once a stagehand in a burlesque theater in Chicago . He was not a Syndicate gangster from the old days ; he was a labor man . He was shot mysteriously and wounded on January 27 , 1925 , according to a newspaper article which identified him as a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Before he became involved with the Syndicate he had achieved a measure of local success in labor circles . In 1932 he was defeated inhis first attempt to become president of the International ( A. F. of L. ) of the stagehands and motion-picture projectors . Just after that he met Willie Bioff , a Russian-born ex-pander who had been " picking up a dollar here and a dollar there " working in a gambling house for Phil D'Andrea and Jack Zuta , Syndicate leaders . Browne hired Bioff to help run the Chicago local of the stagehands . Times were hard ; Browne and Bioff threatened to strike Barney Balaban 's chain of movie theaters if he did n't contribute $50,000 to the union 's unemployment fund . Balaban said it would put him out of business . Bioff replied , " If Grammaw has to die , Grammaw has to die . " Balaban paid them $20,000 . To celebrate , Browne and Bioff threw a party at a night club owned by Nick Dean . They spent about $300 at the party , and Nick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day Browne received a phone call directing him to appear at 22nd Street and Michigan Avenue , where the old Capone headquarters had been located . He and Bioff went , and Browne was taken for a two-hour automobile ride by Ralph Pierce ( of whom more later ) and Nick Dean 's old friend , Frank Rio . They inquired into Browne 's union affairs . A day or two later Rio instructed Bioff to notify Browne that the Syndicate wanted fifty per cent of the union , or else . They got it , and more . In a house in suburban Riverside the mob met : Nitti , Rio , Campagna , and Paul ( " The Waiter " ) Ricca . They decided that Browne would make a good union president . Browne and Bioff and Nick Dean attended a subsequent meeting and so did Louis Lepke , the boss of New York City 's Murder , Inc. , mob who was electrocuted March 4 , 1944 , at Sing Sing . Nitti told Lepke to instruct Lucky Luciano , the New York vice king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd " voted for Browne in the coming union elections . Lepke replied truculently that he would see to the matter himself . ( This relationship , not always cordial , between Chicago 's Syndicate and New York 's Murder , Inc. , was involved curiously with the love affairs of Estelle Carey . ) Ricca was host in a New York night club at a third meeting , and he introduced Browne and Bioff to the men , including Luciano , who would take care of the New York end . As a consequence of all this , Browne was elected president of the Stagehands ' International at its Louisville convention , which was attended by a number of gunmen representing the mobs . The Syndicate was now in control . It put Bioff into the union as an " International representative " to watch Browne . And it put Nick Dean into a minor union office to watch both Bioff and Browne . ( Later Dean also became a representative of the International , reputedly at a salary of $22,000 a year , although he never had worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Thomas E. Maloy had quietly bossed its Chicago local with strong-arm methods since 1920 ; on February 4 , 1935 , two men with a sawed-off shotgun and a .45-caliber pistol drew alongside his car and shot him in the head as he drove up the Outer Drive just outside the World 's Fair Grounds , and a week later Browne took over his union . Officers of the International were entertained at Al Capone 's island home off Miami . And the Syndicate began to use its power . In 1935 it extorted more than $100,000 from Chicago theater owners by threatening to put two operators in each projection room . Nick Dean was the Chicago collector ; it was from him that Bioff received his share . As the payments began to roll in , Nitti , Ricca , Campagna , Dean , Bioff , and Browne met at the Bismarck Hotel , and Nitti told Bioff and Browne that the Syndicate would take a two-thirds split , not one-half . Bioff , long familiar with the ways of the boys , advised Browne to acquiesce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as partner in a burlesque show in Chicago . He cut Phil D'Andrea in . Presently the Syndicate was taking $150,000 from Loew 's in New York for " averting " a strike over wages . Then it moved to Hollywood , into the big money . Bioff became its West Coast representative and organizer , and of the first $75,000 extorted from the movie moguls , Ricca got $50,000 . By calling some strikes and threatening to call others the Syndicate , between 1936 and 1941 , wrung more than a million dollars from four motion-picture companies : Loew 's , Inc. , Warner Brothers , Paramount Pictures , and Twentieth Century-Fox . ( One motion-picture executive , at a conference with the extortionists , confused the initials of the International , IATSE , by which it was known , with a New Deal agency , and said , " My God , what is that man Roosevelt doing now ? " ) The boys set about making arrangements with officials of other allied unions whose members were electricians , stagehands , janitors , operators , movie-studio employees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly . Others were forced to cooperate . The quarry was the employers : the movie moguls and theater owners . But the quarry was also the workingmen , the rank-and-file membership of the unions . For the Syndicate played both ends against the middle . The boys put the squeeze on the employers ; to make it easy for them to pay off , the boys , far from calling strikes or fighting for wage increases , forced the union members , the workers , to accept cuts in pay . It was a complete sellout . More , the Syndicate perfected a permit system introduced by Tommy Maloy whereby no new members were admitted to the projector operators ' union but instead the union issued week-to-week temporary work permits , for which the operators had to pay ten per cent of their wages to the union ? i.e. , to the Syndicate . This brought in $4,000 a week . Moreover , the regular members paid $160 a year dues . And from time to time the Syndicate levied various " special assessments . " How did they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill , for example , Louis B. Mayer , and they threatened to strike the studios and theaters . On the other hand they threatened to kill legitimate labor leaders who rebelled ( and they threw an occasional wages or hours sop to the rank and file ) . So terrible was their reputation that usually mere threats were enough . Sometimes sluggings and murders were necessary ( four murders in 1938 , for example ) . D URING the middle 1930 's the Syndicate was riding high . In addition to the motion-picture unions it was definitely active in the affairs of unions of hod carriers , common laborers , building-service people , engineers , bartenders and waiters , truck drivers , laundry workers , and retail clerks . Nor were its activities in the mid-thirties by any means limited to labor racketeering . For instance , at the same time that the Syndicate ruled the laundrytruck-drivers ' union , one of the big shots controlled much of the cleaning and dyeing industry . He was , in effect , at once the drivers ' business agent and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food and bottled-beverage businesses , and succeeded in persuading nearly every tavern and night club of consequence in Chicago to buy its bottled water and a lot of its food from him . Syndicate men and politicians were partners in the ownership of breweries . And so on , and so on : the list of the businesses the Syndicate had moved into was long . HERE was an enormous amount of money in all this , and the big shots spent it lavishly . On a business trip to California , " Little New York " Campagna saw an intricate system of sprinkler heads watering a wealthy man 's lawn , and so he ordered five or six hundred of those sprinkler heads for his own estate . So did Paul ( " The Waiter " ) Ricca , who maintained a small estate complete with fish pond in the expensive suburb of River Forest . Campagna spent five weeks at Malibu Beach , sunning himself with his wife ? and calling a strike on a movie lot . Others in the mob spent their money on fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country equipped with riding stables and all the other accoutrements of the gentleman farmer . When they visited a night club ? usually owned by a brother Syndicate man ? their spending was fabulous . They habitually carried large sums of money in their pockets ; not infrequently when the body of a Syndicate man was found his wallet contained several thousand dollars . They were a sophisticated lot . Willie Bioff , on the witness stand , said blandly to an infuriated cross-examiner ; " Oh yes sir , I am a very despicable character . " Some of the Syndicate men lived at the " best " addresses and became friendly with thoroughly respectable people . They lived in a pleasant fast-moving world of sleek men and women , a world of elegance and money . Yet their power rested on unnumbered thugs and assassins , young men from the same slums which had spawned so many of these very big shots so long ago . It was a strange world , this world of the Chicago Syndicate . Only rarely is the veil lifted on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that violent death is never far away from the smooth Syndicate boys . ( One of them , though he sent his sons to college and lived at a " good " address , took the precaution of maintaining two adjoining apartments , one for himself and one for his wife and children . ) VI PTIO OPEN the Colony Club , it is said , .1 George Browne and Nick Dean used $65,000 of the money extorted from the movie operators . Here Estelle Carey was queen . We have seen how she lived ? expensive clothes , expensive jewelry , expensive furs . She was photographed astride a horse at a Rocky Mountain lodge and in fishing togs at a lake and in a white bathing suit at the wheel of a flashy convertible coupe with the top down . She wore her blond hair upswept , and she liked to wear sweaters ( frequently white ) and skirts as well as the cocktail dresses which were her professional uniforms . But the Syndicate 's luck turned sour , and so did Estelle 's . Willie Bioff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought back to Chicago from his West Coast throne and on April 8 , 1940 , was sent to jail to serve a six months ' sentence far pandering which he had dodged for eighteen years . " Little New York " Campagna visited him in jail , and Bioff said he and George Browne wanted to quit , and Campagna replied , " Whoever quits , quits feet first . " Two film stars , Constance Bennett and Anita Louise , were robbed by jewel thieves , and it was charged that the crime was plotted at the Colony . For once protection failed : the police raided the place , discovered the gambling layout that anyone could have told them was there , and closed the Colony . That was in March of 1941 . It may have been important to Estelle , but far more serious blows to the Syndicate were in the making . A West Coast labor-relations board had come across a $100,000 item paid out by movie producers to " labor leaders . " This had aroused the government 's curiosity . Mathias F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury investigation at New York . In May of 1941 George Browne , the old-time labor man who had taken to drink when he found that the Syndicate ruled him and his union , and Willie Bioff , the nonchalant pander , were indicted on charges of extorting money from the movie moguls . And Nick Dean , sought as a material witness , went into hiding . Estelle went with him , dyeing her hair black to escape detection . On September 29 , 1941 , he was indicted in New York for conspiring with Browne and Bioff , who were subsequently convicted ; for over two months he could not be found , but on December 1st , FBI agents arrested him while he was eating breakfast at Shorty 's Place , at 147th Street and Cicero Avenue , far from the bright lights of the Near North Side . He was flown to New York the same day . ( New York had jurisdiction because many of the movie payoffs had been made there . ) To the government 's chagrin Dean pleaded guilty on March 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000 . But though Dean kept his mouth shut and took the rap , Bioff and Browne had stood trial , and the testimony had furnished Correa with clues . When Dean was sentenced Correa spoke of his continuing investigation of the " Chicago super-racketeers . " Nevertheless for months nothing happened , and it looked as though the boys in Chicago would remain as always " The Immune , " a nickname which one of them bore . Meanwhile , what of Estelle ? Her man was in a federal prison , her night club was closed . Apparently during this time between Nick 's imprisonment and her own death she did not work . But she did not seem to lack money . She dyed her hair red and moved in with Maxine Buturff , whom she had met when both were waitresses . ( Miss Buturff since had become part owner of a small shop on Michigan Avenue that sold medium-priced women 's sport clothes . ) Before Christmas in 1942 Estelle went to Florida " for her sinus . " She must have been a woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furs , and she bought her cocktail dresses at the kind of Michigan Avenue shop usually called " exclusive , " and she bought two or three hats a month , paying $18.50 for at least one ; but salesgirls remember that she always was courteous and that she had charm and excellent taste ; they considered her one of their best customers , not only because she always paid cash and lots of it but also because she never was imperious . That she appealed to men of varied types  - -  - and that she possessed self-assurance ? is obvious , for observe the state of things while she was in Florida . She still was supposed to be the girl friend of the gangster Nick Dean ( who was married to a good-looking woman ) . But in Florida Estelle met the manufacturer Werner , whom she had known since her Logan Square days . At the same time she was writing letters to the soldier in Texas who was deeply in love with her and jealous of her . ( His divorce , then pending , was at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her name was being linked with a number of other men , and one of her lovers called her " a woman of great passion . " And now in Florida she became entangled with a shadowy character known as Eddie McGrath . McGrath , a New Yorker , had a police record dating back to July 27 , 1927 . He was known in New York as a power in waterfront labor , as an associate of Frank Costello and of Joe Adonis , the Brooklyn big shot , and as a member of Murder , Imc . On January 3 , 1943 , he was acquitted of a labor-racket murder at Key West . At this time Estelle was in Florida too ; Captain Drury says that Estelle and McGrath celebrated his acquittal , that they occupied adjoining rooms in a hotel at Miami Beach , and that when she returned to Chicago the week before she was murdered , McGrath came with her . was unsolved in March of 1944 seemed to indicate that she was killed by gangsters . For the chances of a solution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gang murders simply are not solved in Chicago , however many clues ? indeed , eyewitnesses ? there may be . This is not , as many people think , because the police are " fixed , " or paid off . Although unquestionably there is a working arrangement between the Syndicate and some policemen , at least in regard to gambling , a gangland axiom runs , " You can fix anything but murder . " Rather , it is simply because nobody involved in a gang murder will tell the police anything . Here is carried to its ultimate conclusion the old Black Hand 's omerta , the conspiracy of silence , broken but rarely . Witnesses seldom talk at all , and almost never on the witness stand . In a private killing numerous interested persons are anxious to place in the hands of authorities any evidence which will help obtain justice . Not gangsters ; they take care of their own trouble . Captain Drury points out that Eddie McGrath " was crazy about Estelle " and that McGrath still is at large , perhaps seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Lepke could have helped me in the Carey case . " Drury , a veteran officer with a reputation for personal honesty and diligence and intelligence , still hopes to solve the case .
