Calm hung over the quiet west London suburbs of Acton , Chiswick and Ealing . Housewives popped in &; out of neighborhood stores with hardly a glance at the sky . They felt perfectly safe ; the Germans had n't been over London for months . It was a few minutes after nine on Armistice Day morning . <P> Suddenly a submachine gun chattered . Leslie Ernest Ludford , a crippled lawyer who had paused to buy an Armistice Day poppy , crumpled to the sidewalk moaning . A dark sedan roared away . Later the sedan halted outside the home of two elderly women , Mrs. Annie New and Mrs. Emily Crisp . The doorbell rang . <P> Both women answered the summons . The gunman dropped them in their tracks . <P> Word that a mad killer was loose spread through the district . Police mobilized the largest force of . the war for the man hunt . Newspapers pushed war news aside to make way for a running account of the terror . Ambulances from the Air Raid Precautions services were dispatched to the suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims mounted . <P> Three hours passed before a police car overtook the sedan and rammed it . Out of the sedan the police dragged the driver , middle-aged Philip Joseph War , a Royal Artillery gunner on leave . The score of his marksmanship : one man , two women dead ; four women wounded . <P> Babbled Gunner War , when arraigned on the charge of murdering Lawyer Ludford : " Who is he ? I do n't know him , do you ? Why are you keeping me here ? "
