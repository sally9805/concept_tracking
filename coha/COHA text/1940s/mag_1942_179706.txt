In spite of the wartime ban on conventions the venerable 67-year-old American Bankers Association last week held its annual conclave almost as usual . No transportation was wasted , however . The meeting was by mail and through the industry 's magazine , Banking . <P> Conspicuously missing were cut-throat card games , tomfoolery , cocktail parties , hangovers . Even so , A.B.A. 's " Convention in Print " had nearly everything else : a long program , scores of speakers , round-table confabs , introductions to important delegates . <P> President Roosevelt opened the convention , praised the bankers for their " distinguished role " in the fight against inflation and in financing war production . Secretary Morgenthau thanked members for their crackerjack job of war-bond selling : " You have given the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employes and have made 85% of all sales . . . . " <P> Most important speech-by-mail came from smart , hard-hitting National City Bank Vice Chairman W. Randolph Burgess . Banker Burgess said that the Government 's unprecedented need for cash would force the banks to buy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 . This would boost bank investments in Government bonds to a titanic $49 billion ( $17 billion , 1929 ) , far &; away the highest ever and almost 70% of all loans and investments . <P> This means that the bulk of bank earnings must henceforth come from investments in Government bonds . This is not a happy prospect . Government bonds yield around 2% annually v. 3 to 4% on choice industrial loans , up to 12% on real-estate operations . To offset this revenue drop the banks want to reduce interest rates they pay , are already considering a flock of special service charges . They may even have to close some of their small , low-earning branch banks .. <P> Said Banker Burgess : " Earnings are between the upper millstone of low money rates and the nether millstone of high taxes . . . banks need to husband their capital . ... It is no bed of roses . "
