Last week Francisco Franco reorganized his military bureaucracy . Appointed chief of Spain 's military cabinet was General Agustin Munoz Grande , who served as liaison officer with the German Condor Legion in the civil war , proudly wears an Iron Cross bestowed by Hitler . Politically , he is a fanatical Falangist , no friend of the Allies , who are now buttering up Fascist Franco ( TIME , March 8 ) . <P> Militarily , he is efficient and capable , and he was probably the best man in Spain for the cabinet job . His most recent training in modern warfare was in Russia , where he commanded the Spanish Blues , who fought as the 250th Wehrmacht Division on the Lake Ilmen sector. * There he declared : " We only wish that among the silent graves on the Russian fields are also Spanish graves . " His wish has been fulfilled by at least 7,000 Spaniards . <P> <P> - The Berlin radio last week reported that Spaniards are still being recruited for Russian service .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
