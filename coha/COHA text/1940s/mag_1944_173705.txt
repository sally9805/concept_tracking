UNFINISHED BUSINESS-Stephen Bonsal - Doubleday , Doran ( $3 ) . <P> One winter afternoon in Berlin in 1915 , Stephen Bonsal met a bewildered American vainly trying to get directions from passing Germans . They brushed him aside . Bonsal came to his rescue , and so became acquainted with wirepulling , involved , ambiguous Colonel Edward House , of Texas , the Harry Hopkins of the Wilson regime . <P> Stephen Bonsal was soon acting under Colonel House 's orders . He knew far more about Europe than House did . Born in Maryland , educated in New Hampshire ( St. Paul 's ) and Germany ( Heidelberg ) , Bonsal had in 1915 been a world traveler and newspaperman for 30 years , became a lieutenant colonel in World War I. For James Gordon Bennett , editor of the New York Herald ( who , he says , was fond of " quoting winged words which , rightly or wrongly , he attributed to Abraham Lincoln " ) , Bonsal covered the meetings of Russian and German revolutionists in New York City and London , flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Harbor . When he met House he was on his way to the Eastern Front as a U.S. military observer . <P> House drafted Bonsal to serve as his interpreter . Later , when the Peace Conference was being planned , Colonel Bonsal was called in again , first as adviser on Balkan affairs , then as interpreter for House and Wilson at secret meetings where no stenographic notes were kept and no official translations made . He kept his diary at Wilson 's insistence . When he told the President that he was afraid the entries were indiscreet , Wilson said : " You ca n't be too indiscreet for me . I give you full absolution in advance . " <P> Secrecy and Agony . Unfinished Business is a 313-page volume of intermingled diary entries and long passages of considered reminiscence that pictures the Peace Conference against the dark background of postwar Europe . It is a timely and important book . The Peace Conference that Colonel Bonsal saw is not the one that most U.S. historians and editorialists have presented . The dazed and suffering Europe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more familiar , but no one else has presented the plight of the plain people of Europe , in relation to the strained secrecy of the Conference , and few have written of their agony as does Colonel Bonsail in terms so hardheaded and so poignant . <P> Pistol Shot . The first entry in Unfinished Business carries a date as arresting as a pistol shot : November 7 , 1918 . The next-to-the-last-one is two days before Christmas , 1919 , when Colonel Bonsal , out of the army at last , was holding a farewell dinner of reconciliation with a major who had previously threatened to shoot him on sight . But the central story of Unfinished Business is Europe in the spring of 1919 . Its value rests upon the author 's swings around postwar Europe .
