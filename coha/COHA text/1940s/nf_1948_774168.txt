txt  | tested , but was persuaded in 1819 to settle for a cash sale : As a vindication , Jackson , was named first governor of the new territory of Florida , though he soon withdrew from that politically unpromising , and presumably dull , post . The conquest of Florida , coupled with the victorious defense of New Orleans , obviously made Jackson a presidential possibility , though it was twelve years after New Orleans before he reached that goal . Many commentators have suggested that Henry Clay , John C. Calhoun , Daniel Webster and other brilliant lights could have graced the presidency more effectively than the certain less known persons who occupied the White House from Monroe to Lincoln . The superiority of the un-elected , however , is open to debate , and the temper of the times made most of them ineligible . The prominent statesmen of the day had harangued the Congress for so long on so many issues that the public was weary of them . Jackson was dearly the favorite popular candidate . If he had been unavailable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones would have emerged . The politicians in office were well aware of the danger , and the violence of their efforts to discredit Jackson pushed him into the liberal camp and surrounded him with the halo of the persecuted . The campaign to ruin Jackson converging from various sources , was vicious in the extreme . The opposition again exhumed the story of Jackson 's premature marriage to Rachel , a matter now many years old . The General had more than once fought duels on this subject , and now his opponents doubtless hoped to goad him to similar combats , from which his friends dissuaded him with difficulty . Nothing could hold back the popular demand , however . Tennessee sent Jackson to the Senate in 1823 , and initiated his candidacy for the presidency in 1824 . He had the.largest number of votes among the four candidates , but since no candidate had sufficient votes for a choice the contest was thrown into the House . Jackson had had about 153,000 popular votes to 108,000 for Adams , while Clay and Crawford had about 47,000 each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson and Adams each had seven states , whereas Clay had only four . It soon became apparent that Clay would be able to swing the election , as he wished . Henry Clay was the only candidate aside from Jackson to represent the West . His program of high tariffs , encouragement of business , and expansion coincided with the general feeling of t e western area at that time . Furthermore , since Clay came from Kentucky and would have given the West a new interest in the White House had he been elected , it was assumed in many quarters that he would be loyal to his section of the country , and would support Jackson who had so large a share of the popular vote . Clay , however , in his long political career had become essen- footnote ' These often quoted figures are incomplete and subject to qualifications . For detailed comment see Edward Stanwood , A History of Presidential Elections , p. 70-75.  | tially a Washingtonian , and he doubtless judged that the election of Adams would not stand in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular rival . At any rate Clay threw his strength to John Quincy Adams , assuring him of election , and subsequently was made secretary of state . Jackson then , and the West in general , clamored that a bargain had been made against the wishes of the electorate , and when Adams ran for re-election in 1828 , Jackson defeated him handily . In the election of 1828 Jackson had 178 electoral votes to 83 for John Quincy Adams , who was running for a second term ; yet in the popular vote Jackson fared moderately , as he had slightly under 56 per cent of the total . Nevertheless as presidential elections go in this evenly balanced country , it was a famous victory . Any impression that Jackson was elected by the revolt of the West alone , or by a working-class movement alone , is untenable . Separately or together , these elements were a minority . Jackson did carry the new western states and the solid South ; but it was the margin of independent votes which swung the larger states his way . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South gave him a nest egg of 97 , possibly because he was one of them and a slaveholder , though a kind one . Ohio and states West added 27 votes , making 124 . That left a debit of 6 votes to carry . Maryland gave him 5 ( out of II ) and Maine 1 ( out of 9 ) . Pennsylvania 's total of 28 and New York 's 20 ( out of 36 ) magnified the result , though they were unneeded . Nevertheless the urban societies naturally climbed aboard the bandwagon , and their leaders regarded him as their man . An unfamiliar lot of characters now swarmed upon Washington . At the President 's first reception at the White House , hordes of persons from all over the countryside tramped through the rooms , ruined chairs with their muddy boots and crowded the President against the mantelpiece , from which he had to be extricated by his friends . The social life of the capital was turned upside down . Jackson bought twenty spittoons for the East Room .2 New faces , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet given any sign of holding radical views . The old man was a hero , but he was old , tired , and ill . The ruddy hair had turned to an upstanding white brush . His long narrow face was seamed . The small blue eyes still blazed in their sockets , but the tall thin frame was worn . Had Jackson met kindliness and co-operation in the White I-louse , it is reasonable to conjecture that he would have died in peace and inconspicuousness , but his enemies gave him just the tonic that he needed , violent opposition . footnote 2 Charles Hurd , Washington Cavalcade .  | His principles , supported by other popular leaders of the day , were hard money , limited paper currency , little government spending , and a balanced budget . In later times these principles were the bulwark of the most conservative elements , illustrating that the liberal point of view is defined not by constant measures , but by issues of the times which can shift to diametrically opposite sides . A firm metallic standard of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coolidge was a Jacksonian ! Many of the monied people at this time held views that modern Wall Street would consider financially radical . Like Henry Clay , they desired tariffs and government spending to encourage new manufacturers and land specuj lation . The pay-off could come at a later date . The construction of vast public improvements would mean fat contracts . If paying off the federal debt meant a constriction of public money , that would be bad for the speculators . At the earliest stages of his administration Jackson was so prostrated by personal tragedy that not even opposition could arouse him to interest . On the way to Washington . for the inauguration , Mrs. Jackson had again heard gossip attacking her character , based on the old story ; had suffered a stroke ; and had died . The General was inconsolable and had little zest for his new duties , but was prevailed upon by his intimates that it was his duty to carry on . Only his close associates realized the depth of his sorrow , knew of his ill health , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the doughty general , and an early incident in the Cabinet circle enhanced the impression . Jackson had named Senator Eaton of Tennessee as secretary of war . Eaton had become infatuated with Peggy O'Neale Timberlake , the daughter of a Washington tavernkeeper , and the widow of a naval officer . Jackson advised Eaton to marry Mrs. Timberlake promptly , which was done . Official Washington , however , refused to countenance the match , and most of the Cabinet ladies failed to call upon their colleague 's new wife . Jackson , who for a lifetime had suffered from an unjust breath of scandal , regarded this as a personal affront , and directed that his Cabinet ministers instruct their wives to recognize the Eatons or their portfolios would be withdrawn . Whatever the merits of the issue , this first official battle of Jackson was of immense popular interest , understandable by everyone , far more absorbing than tariffs or finance . Whatever Mrs. Eaton 's conduct might have been , she was a tavernkeeper 's daughter whose presence would have been resented by the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told they could pay their respects or leave town . What a man , this new President ! New faces were numerous . Senator William L. Marcy of New York had said gloatingly " to the victors belong the spoils . " A politer term for the practice was " rotation in office . " Jackson apologists have pointed out that he did  | not dispense with more office holders than Jefferson had , and turned out fewer than some later Presidents . To the extent this is true Jackson by his own lights was the lesser man . He held that men who remain long in office are " apt to acquire a habit of looking with indifference upon the public interests . " Officeholders come to regard their jobs as " a species of property . " Nor did Jackson believe that any extensive training or experience were requisite . " The duties of all public officers are . . . so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance . " He warmed to his subject in his initial message to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic right " to official station than another . He favored limiting appointments to four years , pointing out that the government employee removed from office would have the same opportunities of obtaining a livelihood as the millions who never held office and that , therefore , those dismissed could have no cause for complaint . Indeed the President added that " rotation constitutes a leading principle in the republican creed . " It was this forthright advocacy of rotation more than the number of dismissals which gave Jackson the reputation of fathering the spoils system . He carried his idea logically to the recommendation that the presidential office be limited to a single term of four or six years . The warfare between Jackson and his regular Cabinet , his need for friendly advice from those who would not be political rivals , and the eagerness of the liberal wing to capture the President for their cause gave rise to Jackson 's famed " Kitchen Cabinet " who were his private advisers . Their influence marked a new phase in the conduct of the presidency . Jackson 's " Kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amos Kendall and Francis P. Blair ; newspaper editors , were steadfast members . The former was given a government post as auditor , but primarily served as an ideaman for the administration and a writer of many of its documents . Blair was made editor of the Washington Globe , the official organ of the Jacksonians . George Bancroft , historian , was a trusted adviser who drafted Jackson 's First Inaugural . Martin Van Buren , the only one of the official Cabinet to become an intimate , was the chief political councillor of the inner circle . Under the ministrations of these men Jackson became a social philosopher . Schlesinger Jr . observes " Kendall 's supreme skill in interpreting , verbalizing and documenting Jackson 's intuitions made him indispensable . " Undoubtedly the Kitchen Cabinet were responsible for making Jackson articulate , though to what extent they governed his ideas will always be debatable ground . Despite a good education in his youth , Jackson was uncouth and awkward  | in expressing himself , as his personally written letters indicate . Equally , he was abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are smooth , clear , well-elaborated . Most , perhaps all , of the presidents have had literary assistance in the preparation of their state papers though several of them had superior writing talents in their own right . In Jackson 's case the gap between the native man and the synthetic president of the official papers is striking . It is ironic that Jefferson , who was capable of exalted prose , often chose to be dry and equivocal in his presidential papers , while the rough-hewn Jackson 's messages in the main are characterized by literary grace and clarity . Jackson earmarked himself as a dangerous man in the eyes of the financial fraternity by hinting in his First Message to Congress , December 8 , 1829 , that the charter of the second Bank of the United States , due to expire some six years hence , would not be renewed . The charter was similar to that of the first bank , established by Hamilton . It specified five government representatives on its board of twenty-five directors ; also one-fifth of its capital was subscribed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer agent for the funds , and made public payments without charge ; but the government had little control over the bank 's policy , either in detail or in its major practices , beyond the fact that the secretary of the treasury could remove government deposits if he presented the reasons to Congress . The first bank had been founded in 1791 under a twenty-year charter . In 1811 when the charter expired an effort was made to renew it , but the Republicans were against it and the project was allowed to lapse . The war of 1812 , however , created a situation in national affairs which required some centralized banking facilities , and in 1816 the second Bank of the United States had been chartered , again for a twenty-year period . Jackson had been on both sides of the national bank question before he came to the presidency . In 1817 , he had opposed the bank because of its potential interference with states ' rights . During his governorship of Florida in 1821 he had favored the establishment of a branch there on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States had served well in its early days and its current president , Nicholas Biddle , in his initial years had been a man of exceptional brilliance and probity . The extensive powers and prestige of the bank , however , had inflated him . Most financial historians of today hold that the Bank was soundly conceived , but deplore Biddle 's political folly . As long as the bank had issued notes only against its resources , the flexibility of credit had been kept within reasonable bounds , and its paper could always be redeemed in specie . In time , however , the bank established numerous branches and issued notes against them printed to look like the drafts  | of the parent bank , with the result that Biddle was able to create or withdraw vast funds of credit at will . Jackson on July 10 , 1832 , vetoed a premature bill to recharter the bank ahead of its expiration date , and later demanded the withdrawal of government deposits . Jackson 's initial criticisms of the bill to renew the charter were tolerant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sort was desirable , but doubted that the present bank could be justified under the Constitution , because it gave exclusive privileges to a group of private citizens over whom the government had inadequate control . He pointed out that bank stock in value of $28,000,000 was now privately subscribed and affirmed that " the door of competition " should be opened in the re-establishment of the charter , which might give the government much more favorable terms . Jackson affirmed that the current bill proposes that " the bounty of our government is . . . to be again bestowed on the few who have been fortunate enough to secure the stock and at this moment wield the power of the existing institution . . . " Jackson obviously was unmoved by the Hamiltonian theory that it was advisable to have the most powerful financial interests closely tied in with the government ; and he was advised chiefly by men who deplored financial power without knowing how to regulate it in the public interest . In European countries , notably England and France , the state banks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried no weight with Jackson . he conservative elements , not surprisingly , feared a government bank , finer the control of the inexperienced Jackson . The President , alienated from his Cabinet , unsympathetic to the elder statesmen , swayed by unofficial advisers , commanded little financial confidence . The Biddle group , however , seemed not to realize that their arbitrary demand for renewal under the old terms was untenable . They refused compromise . Worse , Biddle used all the banks powers of credit , favors and bribery in the effort to force renewal . By so doing , he played into Jackson 's hands . " It is to be regretted , " Jackson 's message continued , " that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes .. every man is equally entitled to protection by law ; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions , to grant titles , gratuities , and exclusive privileges , to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful , the humble members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves , have a right to complain of the injustice of their government . . . In the act before me there seems to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principles . " Such a diatribe , obviously not in Jackson 's diction but bearing his authority , was a new note in government . For the first time the Executive had  | sounded the note of class distinction . Biddle had started the fight , and his methods were questionable , but now to the jacksonians he became the archtype of wicked wealth . Biddle in desperation set out to punish the President and the country by a nation-wide contraction of credits in 1833 , which produced the panic of that year . Delegations throughout the land called upon the President to relieve the situation , but his continuous answer was , " Go to Nicholas Biddle ! " The storm which Biddle had hoped to center upon the President devolved upon himself , and even earlier supporters of the bank realized that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought editors . Jackson countered with such a wooing of the press through government favors , using the government purse , that the independent press became alarmed . Pollard 's The Presidents and the Press gives a lively account of the contest for the favor of public opinion . The Richmond Enquirer which had fought for the election of Jackson said : We wish the Executive would let the Press alone . We can not any more approve of the appointment of so many of its conductors to office , although they be required to give up their papers , than we approved of the great pains which were taken by Mr. Clay to turn obnoxious Editors out . . . and to put in his devoted Partizans. ? We know that General Jackson solemnly disclaims all intentions to reward his supporters or to bribe the Press to support his measures . And we believe him ? we know also , the reasons by which he justifies these appointments . . . But we are better satisfied with his motives than his reasons ? with the integrity than with the expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many voices to this effect . The National Journal of Washington listed forty-two editors who had been placed on the public payroll , and observed : " Our liberties are in danger the moment the government begins to tamper with the press ; but the danger becomes more imminent when so large a number of individuals who constitute the public press have been openly and opulently rewarded out of the public treasury . " The charter was not renewed , and Jackson 's victory served to solidify his reputation as a popular leader . The bank issue was made to order for any politician ; but Jackson was faced with a far graver question , namely a test of the authority of the national government . When Congress enacted new tariff schedules in 1828 , the South Carolina legislature passed a resolution affirming its right to nullify the act of the federal government . " Nullification " immediately became a national issue . Again , like the " Whiskey Rebellion " and the Kentucky Resolutions , it challenged the fundamental authority of the federal government . What Jackson 's position would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | used the states ' rights argument in opposing the bank . " Nor is our government to be maintained or our Union preserved by invasions of the rights and powers of the several states , " he had said in his veto message . " In thus attempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak . Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and states as much as possible to themselves . " These sentiments were not conclusive . Jackson , like many another home-rule advocate who has come to federal office , was capable of reinterpreting his principles in the light of new occasions . That was what he did in respect to the resolution of South Carolina . He bristled with defense of federal authority . In proclamation and message , Jackson expounded the sovereignty of the federal government and of the Constitution , with all of the zeal of President Washington and using substantially the same reasoning . " It is the acknowledged attribute of free institutions that under them the empire of reason and law is substituted for the power of the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original states had entered into a compact and for that reason could secede , Jackson held , " It is precisely because it is a compact that they can not . A compact is an agreement or binding obligation . " He affirmed that he had the highest reverence for the " reserved rights " of the states , but that " in becoming parts of a nation , not members of a league , they surrendered many of their essential parts of sovereignty . " He pointed out that at every stage in the history of the Revolution , the united colonies had considered themselves as forming one nation and that " in this sense the states are not sovereign . " The firmness of the president on this issue was a surprise in some quarters . At first there was even some doubt as to how seriously he meant his proclamations . The doctrine of reserved rights had been preached so frequently , had been given so much impetus by Jeffersonian arguments that it had come to be regarded as both Southern and Democratic gospel , and Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the issue was at the crisis , Jackson attended a Jefferson birthday dinner on April 15 , 1830 . Many nullificationists were on hand . A score of speeches and toasts supported the position of states ' rights . When the President was called upon for a toast , he gave the single sentence , " Our Union , it must be preserved ! " He followed this up later by commanding the armed forces to be ready to enforce the law and he promised to hang any opponents . In South Carolina itself there were many sympathizers with Jackson 's view . They as he , saw the impracticability of a southern confederacy . The nullification resolution was repealed and the federal Union took on a new vigor . Though the charge of inconsistency can be leveled at Jackson and his associates on many counts , their record on public economy was both unassail-  | able and courageous . The spoils system saw to it that a sizable share of the available jobs were given to the faithful , but it did not extend to creating contracts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably on printing , were earmarked for the friends of the administration , but the creation of public works was frowned upon as an unpardonable extravagance . If there were a surplus in the government treasury that was a sign that taxes should and could be reduced . Jackson 's position in respect to public works was positive and adroit . In Tennessee where the speculative fever was high , government expansion was favored . Jackson in his first campaign had been able to avoid committing himself on the public works issue . By 1830 , . however , after he had served for two years , the pressure , by western constituents particularly , for improvements in their areas was growing . Jackson and Van Buren concocted a scheme to dramatize the president 's opposition to government spending . Van Buren was to watch the " porkbarrel " bills as they were introduced , and pick out a vulnerable one on which to hang the issue .3 In April , 1830 , Van Buren was able to report that the so-called Maysville Act would pass the Senate . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kentucky , in the heart of the Jackson stronghold . A veto of a measure benefiting that area would demonstrate to the country the sincerity of Jackson 's convictions . Van Buren and Kendall drew up the final form of the veto which , of course , was delivered in Jackson 's name , and defeated the measure . Jackson opposed the Maysville road bill on several counts . He believed that if the federal government should have a surplus it should be returned to the states . Again , he held federal taxec should not be used for any local project unless it were national in character ; and that yardstick , he affirmed , would be very difficult to apply , as the opinion of successive Congresses might well differ in respect to the national worth of any particular project . He had grave doubts as to the constitutionality of spending federal money on extensive improvements and suggested that if it were the will of the people to do so the method should be through an amendment to the Constitution . Finally , he observed , " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they lead far exceed the good which they are capable of promoting . They may be resorted to as artful expedients to shift upon the government the losses of unsuccessful private speculation , and thus , by ministering to personal ambition and self-aggrandizement , tend to sap the foundations of public virtue and taint the administration of the government with a demoralizing influence . " Andrew Jackson on the Indian question presented an extraordinary picture of the liberal temperament struggling in the coils of reality . Jackson 's footnote Marquis James , The Life of Andrew Jackson .  | democracy did not extend to the color of red or black . Yet officially his advisers made him consistently the champion of the underdog . Aside from Jackson 's presidential addresses , there was no evidence to indicate that he had any regard for the Indian as a fellowman or any respect for his right 's . Left to his own devices , it seems probable that the President would have made no attempt to rationalize the policy of the government toward the Indian , but since he allowed himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of his reasoning deserves consideration here . In his Second Message to Congress , December 6 , 1830 , Jackson said , " Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country . " He pointed out sadly that one tribe after another was disappearing from the earth , but said that " true philanthropy reconciles the mind " to such matters just as in life one generation gives way to another . The extinction of the red man , he indicated , was all in the course of progress . " Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers . " He asked what " good man " would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to the current republic occupied by more than twelve million people endowed with " all the blessings of liberty , civilization , and religion . " These pious remarks were a preamble to saying that the government proposed to acquire extensive lands occupied by the red men of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send them to reservations where " their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual . " The President conceded that the Indians might find it painful to leave the graves of their fathers ; but he pointed out that the white inhabitants of the United States obviously had left the land of their birth to seek new homes . In fact , the Indian might well consider himself fortunate over this new offer of the government . " How many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the West on such conditions ! " Jackson doubted whether the wandering savage had a stronger attachment to his home than the white man . Besides , since the Indian did not get along satisfactorily with his white neighbors in the same area something needed to be done about it . " Rightly considered , " said Jackson , " the policy of the General Government toward the red man is not only liberal , but generous . " And a year later , on December 6 , 1831 , Jackson reported further on the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that the savage on his reservation was not " beyond the reach of philanthropic aid and Christian instruction . " In fact , he noted that those who were missionaries to the Indians now had wider scope " subject to no control but the superintending agency of the General Government , " and therefore they could proceed more readily than in a general community to advance the Indians " from barbarism to the habits and enjoyments of civilized life . " Unfortunately for this cheerful prospect , the missionary efforts seemingly  | did not work out to Jackson 's satisfaction . For in his message to Congress on December 7 , 1835 the president reached a startling degree of pessimism . " All preceding experiments for the improvement of the Indians have failed , " he said . " It seems now to be an established fact that they can not live in contact with a civilized community and prosper . " The liberal tradition in the presidency , as channeled through Jackson 's mind , has been presented here as a series of lantern slides ? the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kitchen Cabinet administration , the bank issue , cultivation of the press , reassertion of federal authority , opposition to spending for public work , singular attempt to justify the extinction of the Indian . Many of the issues were concurrent and re-current throughout Jackson 's eight years in office . All took place in the atmosphere of new times , with a new group of men controlling the government . As has been seen , the administration was unpredictable . In the closing days of Jackson 's rule , a new issue arose which turned him back to the states ' rights theory , while at the same time forging a new weapon of federal control . The controversy stemmed from the activity of the Abolitionists . Impatient at the indifference in Washington , alarmed over the spread of slavery in new territories , the anti-slavery forces had embarked on a campaign of " education . " They imported speakers from England . They wrote pamphlets and letters to the editor . They had the support of many newspapers . Moreover , and this caused the chief uproar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their literature to whites , and allegedly to blacks , in the slave states . No considerable number of blacks could have been reached by the Post Office , but the principle enraged the Southern slaveholders . The pamphlets were inevitably inflammatory , some inciting directly to servile insurrection . The question raised here of free speech and free press obviously was a delicate one . The Abolitionists cited Tom Paine and other pamphleteers of freedom in justification of their procedure , but Jackson seemingly had no hesitancy suppressing the campaign as far as he could . In his Seventh Message to Congress , December 7 , 1835 , he denounced the Abolitionists ' conduct . Internal peace , he held , depended on noninterference with slavery in the South , on " the maintenance in good faith of those compromises of the Constitution upon which the Union is founded . " He inveighed against " the emissaries from foreign parts who have dared to interfere in this matter " and characterized the anti-slavery activities as " unconstitutional and wicked attempts " by " misguided persons . " Not content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson called upon Congress " to take such measures as will prevent the Post-Office Department , which was designed to foster an amicable intercourse  | and correspondence between all members of the Confederacy , from being used as an instrument of an opposite character . " A singular touch , that use of the word " Confederacy , " rather than " Union . " Jackson had used Union doctrine and had threatened force to block nullification of the tariff laws , yet he invoked states ' rights and the federal authority to suppress agitation against slavery . " Confederacy , " the term was a harkback to the Articles of Confederation , which the Constitution had superseded . Jackson went a long distance in his conciliatory language , and the concept was to be revived later to divide the Union . Jackson 's stand on the limits of free speech , his attitude on noninterference with slavery , his use of the Post Office as a means of federal enforcement , and his concessive language for the sake of harmony , are again examples of how policy is influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . Jackson brought about a few changes in the liberal tradition of the presidency , though the changes were not as drastic or fundamental as some might suppose . On the surface , the change of personalities throughout the top branches of the executive was the most conspicuous new note . The decline of the Virginia statesmen and other eastern notables has been lamented , but the shift demonstrated that the government was not to remain in the hands of a virtually self-perpetuating oligarchy , however able . The charter of the United States Bank had lapsed before and its second ? demise left a financial vacuum and created new political issues . Jackson had sounded a prophetic note in popular appeal . Jefferson had attacked " monarchical government " ; it remained for Jackson to cry out against the abuses of wealth . The pose of perfectionism in office was another new fashion introduced by Jackson , after his first inaugural , an attitude which has become familiar in public life . Possibly this mien was foisted on Jackson by his over-zealous literary aides . Washington , Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inadequacies , either from conviction or good manners . Jackson publicly admitted to no qualms . Whether on the extinction of the Indian or on noninterference with slavery , his tone was high minded . With all its pros and cons , Jackson 's was an invigorating administration , active not passive , giving prestige to the office . His nullification battle was his severest test . In it , he held the country together until the crisis faced by Lincoln . He retired in a wave of prosperity induced by state bank inflation . Courageously he had tried to put on the brakes through curtailment of credits , but that issue did not come to a head until the time of his successor , Martin Van Buren.  | Liberal in Depression All communities are apt to look to government for too much . MARTIN VAN BUREN , Special Message to Congress , September 4 , 1837 One of the most gracious , and on occasion most courageous , of men ever to occupy the White House was Martin Van Buren . For years , virtually to the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served but one term and his early detractors tried to dismiss him as a nonentity , a dissembler , a politician of no moral stature . Yet the interest in this supposedly inconsequential fellow still burns quietly like a perpetual candle . He is the subject of a biography by Denis Tilden Lynch , published as late as 1929 . Schlesinger , Jr. , devotes much space to him in The Age of Jackson . Gerald Johnson in American Heroes and Hero Worship must needs include him , even if somewhat satirically . Look in the publishers ' catalogs where most one-term presidents are noted with only one book or two devoted to their fame , and there are a half-dozen or more biographies on Van Buren , including that of the eminent historian George Bancroft , who wrote a glowing eulogy . There were several causes which served to bury the reputation of Martin Van Buren . Some say that he was the victim of the forces of reaction . Unquestionably the conservatives libeled Van Buren , but he was not without support from the Democratic press , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vituperation . More importantly , the financial panics during his administration produced a popular revulsion against him that was completely damning for years to come . Finally , for forty years after his term the nation was occupied with a series of new issues ? territorial expansion , slavery , civil war , and the reconstruction era . There was little occasion in those times to remember Van Buren , whatever his merits ; yet he made impressive contributions to the liberal tradition of the White House . As in the case of Jackson , moreover , surprise has been expressed that Van Buren was chosen for the presidency at a time when such men as Daniel Webster , Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun were available . There is no need to discuss further the relative merits of those gentlemen , but it is important to emphasize that Van Buren in his own period was as considerable a figure as most of his contemporaries . Monroe thought highly enough of Van Buren to offer him a place on the Supreme Bench , but he preferred a more active life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mentor , his constant  | companion , a force for harmony in the administration , willing to resign his Cabinet office in order to remove dissension .

He brought also an established reputation which had survived many political battles . He had been state senator in New York , state political leader , United States senator , and governor . Moreover , like Jackson , he represented a new sector of the population , as distinguished from the elite who had supplied the popular leadership in the early years of the Republic .

Their status obviously was prosperous , but a far cry from the wealth and position of the patroon families of the Hudson , the merchant-smugglers of Massachusetts , or the Virginia aristocracy . The young Martin was brilliant and ambitious . After a village school education , he entered a law office at the age of fourteen , where he supplemented his lack of schooling by intensive and systematic reading . From the outset , he was marked for eminence . Golden-haired , dapper , with alert eyes , fastidious in dress , and having an engaging manner , his talents were soon recognized by his fellows . He campaigned for Jefferson in ' Soo , and at the early age of eighteen was sent as a delegate to a state congressional caucus . By the time he was twenty-five , he could afford to marry his childhood sweetheart , Hannah Hoes . Four sons were born to them , but the mother died after only twelve years of marriage . During this time he acquired a high reputation at the bar and amassed a fortune which made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forty , thenceforth devoted virtually all of his time to political activity and brought new techniques to popular government . He organized mass meetings , county committees , political clubs . He has been credited , or demerited , with being the first American political boss . He was certainly the first to engineer politics on such a scale , though Aaron Burr had been a pioneer in the art . While the " spoils system " was the outgrowth of Van Buren 's New York political machine , he himself never used it for purposes of graft . He was steadily on the side of the underprivileged , in part for political reasons ; yet steadfastly , even when it meant his own downfall . The progressive extension of manhood suffrage in the various states presented an opportunity for leadership , or bossism , which was inevitable . The very size of the new vote called for some systematic method of organization , which gave rise to the party system in its modern form .  | Van Buren basked in the atmosphere of Washington . As secretary of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic figure , suave , politic , entertaining , civilized . His hospitality was of the best in delicacies and service .

He , a tavernkeeper 's son , addressed her with courtliness and consideration . Though Peggy O'Neal- , Eaton 's character was debatable and her manners flamboyant , Van Buren like a calm , unobtrusive tugboat , guided her through the choppy social seas . Silly as the issue seems in retrospect , Van Buren 's aplomb in this matter commanded admiration in many quarters and strengthened his ties with Jackson . Those ties , of course , had far more substantial strength than a single incident .

" 1 The Little Fox of Kinderhook could feint and conceal the direction of his intent when such procedures served his purpose . He tempered and smoothed the rough tactlessness of the Old Hickory . Yet Jackson , who was completely intolerant of fraud , said of Van Buren that he was " one of the most frank men . . . a true man with no guile . " 2 By the time Van Buren had resigned from the Cabinet to promote peace in the official family , had been blocked from an ambassadorship by madhinations of Calhoun , and had served in Jackson 's second term as vice-president , the public were fully aware of his essential principles .

Not so much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That principle is Democracy . . . It is with them the poor against the rich ; and it is not to be disguised that since the last election i.e. of Jackson , the array of parties has very strongly taken that character .

( Willie P. Mangum received South Carolina 's electoral vote , where the electors were chosen by the Legislature , and no popular vote was held . ) That Van Buren would succeed Jackson had been generally expected , abroad as well as at home . Tyrone Power , the British actor , in a memoir of a three-years ' tour of the United States shortly prior to the election , had pub- footnote Saki ( H. H.

He bestows an undivided attention to the matter before the house becoming his situation . As vice-president , this gentleman is chairman of the senate ; a situation at this time of peculiar delicacy , considering his position as the proclaimed director of the measures of General Jackson 's cabinet , and heir to his party and his power . His filling this chair with so little reproach under assaults and provocations which it required the greatest good temper and good sense to encounter or turn aside , I consider no slight evidence of that wisdom and political sagacity for which his party give him credit , and which have acquired for him amongst his admirers the familiar cognomen of the Little Magician . Van Buren 's administration began serenely on March 4 , 1837 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy as a world experiment . The country had been enjoying a boom throughout the Jackson era , and prosperity still reigned . The population of the country had grown from Io , 000,000 in 1821 to 16,000,000 . All sections had gained , and notably the West . Michigan at the start of the Van Buren term had 200,000 inhabitants , compared with io , 000 in 1821 . Illinois had 400,000 compared with 6o,000 at the earlier date . Pittsburgh , to quote Power again , was already " smoky . . . upon the manufacture of iron , glass , pottery , etc . " Everywhere expansion was observed . Town and country were lavish with new houses , or with old houses embellished with new scroll work and balconies . Washington , itself , however , bore a dingy appearance . Most of its roads were deep in black mud . Pennsylvania Avenue had been covered with a macadam surface , but Congress had declined to vote the few hundred dollars which would have been necessary for water-carts to dampen the road from the near-by Potomac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave rise to clouds of dust . The deplorable condition of Pennsylvania Avenue was much talked of , but no relief was in sight , for Congressmen dared not appropriate funds to make the national capital more agreeable , as long as they were denying incessant clamors from their own constituents for local appropriations . Congress had been encouraged in this economy by the constant refusal of both Jackson and Van Buren to favor public improvements wholly or partly aided by federal funds . It must be remembered that the federal government , still under fifty years footnote Impressions of America , by Tyrone Power , Esq. ; Philadelphia : Carey , Lea &; Blanchard , 1836 , vol . I , p. 164 . Mr. Power was a leading actor of his time , highly regarded as a person and as an artist on both sides of the Atlantic .

I , p. 195.  | of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal taxes were unwelcome and must be kept at a minimum . Prosperity was rampant , and as long as the government at Washington did nothing to interfere , criticism would be relatively mild ; but the nullification crisis and the failure of Clay to arouse wide public enthusiasm for his " American system " had discouraged initiative by the federal government . When Van Buren came into office , all outward signs were favorable for his enjoying a popularity of long duration . The critics of Jackson and his followers could get little serious attention as long as boom conditions prevailed . The Jackson era , however , had been supported by a wave of speculation which , as we have noted , the General had seen with foreboding . Consequently , Van Buren had inherited two Jackson measures , each aimed to be corrective , but each explosive . When Jackson had decided , in concert with his advisers , that the Bank of the United States was evil , he had been right in resisting improper financial influence , but had been ineffective in providing a satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a popular but embarrassing vacuum , because as a practical matter some repository had to be found for government funds and government surplus . Van Buren saw that an independent national Treasury was necessary . This was one of his first aims while in the White House , and an outstanding contribution of his administration . Before Van Buren was able to take that step , which required action by Congress , he was faced with the immediate consequences of the removal of the deposits from the Bank of the United States to local institutions . The surplus at the time of his accession had amounted to $37,000,000 . Jackson had favored placing surpluses , nominally as demand deposits , with some twenty leading state banks , though about fifty in all enjoyed some deposits . Webster and Clay had approved this policy , whereas Van Buren had originally opposed it , though later he was somewhat persuaded to it by Amos Kendall , the eloquent editor of the Jackson regime . Unfortunately and not surprisingly , the state banks in general had been less conservative than Biddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had led to a wave of credit expansion . Jackson , as has been seen , was well aware of the risks of speculation , having lost and made fortunes in that fashion . He had aimed to curtail inflation , by his issue of the Specie Circular which was promulgated on July ii , 1836 . This required that federal lands , open to public purchase at $1.25 per acre , must be paid for in gold or silver . Up to that time land speculation was almost limitless , as the purchaser could pay in whatever currency the states provided . When Van Buren came into office in March , 1837 , fiscal reform was long overdue . With his independent Treasury already in mind , he declined to issue the last of the federal payments which the state banks were expecting . The banks protested violently , as credits were over-extended and the need for  | further support was critical . Further , the effects of the Specie Circular , which Van Buren declined to withdraw , were already being felt . Within six weeks after his inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , saying that some federal relief was necessary or many financial houses would have to go to the wall . Van Buren in his Inaugural had stated that American democracy was on trial . The trial was perhaps nearer at hand than he realized . By May , 1837 , most of the banks of the country were closed , and the industrial and financial classes were prostrated . The nation had not been in such a fix since the days of Jefferson 's embargo . The crisis was more frightening than the embargo because its causes were little understood by those unfamiliar with finance . Most sections of the country , which were rural and largely self-sustaining , were not seriously affected ; but the cities , the merchants , the newly rich and the press were damaged and were vocal . Above all , there was a sense of shock that such a thing could happen to the American paradise . In a special message dealing with the conditions Van Buren truthfully said , " The difficulties and distresses of the times , though unquestionably great , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as affecting the permanent prosperity of the nation . Arising in a great degree from the transactions of foreign and domestic commerce , it is upon them that they have chiefly fallen . The great agricultural interest has in many parts of the country suffered comparatively little . " Van Buren 's calmness and immobility under fire were infuriating to those who sought relief . When pressed to call an extra session of Congress to do something about the crisis , he yielded by setting a date three and one-half months hence . He was unmoved by outcries against the Specie Circular . Public lands had been made available to settlers at a fixed price in specie . Those who had traded in the national resources with inflated dollars , had only themselves to blame . When he finally addressed the assembled Congress , his advice was that individuals should put their own houses in order , that the panic was due to over-activity in business and over-expansion in credit . He reiterated that the next installment of the surplus for the state banks should be withheld , that an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes might be issued temporarily to meet the needs of the government . Those who may have expected that Van Buren would try to cure the situation by an extensive government relief were due to be disappointed . " All communities are apt to look to government for too much , " he said . " Even in our own country , where its powers and duties are so strictly limited , we are prone to do so , especially at periods of sudden embarrassment and distress . But this ought not to be . The framers of our excellent Constitution and the people who approve it with calm and sagacious deliberation acted at the time on a sounder principle . They wisely judged that the less government interferes with private  | pursuits the better for the general prosperity . It is not its legitimate object to make men rich or to repair , by direct grants of money or legislation in favor of particular pursuits , losses not incurred in the public service . This would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes a good government the most precious of human blessings ? is to enact and enforce a system of general laws commensurate with , but not exceeding , the objects of its establishment , and to leave every citizen and every interest to reap under its benign protection the rewards of virtue , industry , and prudence . " The country , or all of those involved in its financial and industrial interests , including thousands of land purchasers , speculators or otherwise , were forced to accept this policy which led to a general deflation . The ultimate wisdom of the policy was evident in the continued prosperity of America from 184o to the Civil War . In fact , the readjustment in credits came about so rapidly that under normal circumstances Van Buren 's first term might well have witnessed the beginning of the new prosperity ; but in 1839 there came disastrous crop failures . They hit the country a severe blow , more far-reaching than the earlier depression . Here was an actual destruction of real values affecting the great majority of the population . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certain critics of Van Buren have emphasized that he was skilled politically on behalf of Jackson , but not for himself . The charge seems wellfounded and is a credit to him , because in certain situations where principle was involved Van Buren followed his conscience rather than taking the political course . Notably that was so in his attitude toward the annexation of Texas . Texas had been settled by colonies from the United States , had revolted from Mexico , and had sought annexation with this country . The massacre at the Alamo had taken place in 1836 and public feeling had remained high against Mexican rule . The situation could have been a godsend for any president who desired to use it to divert public attention from panic and crop failure ; but Van Buren opposed annexation , for in it he saw seeds of trouble for the country . Annexation , first of all , would presumably mean war with Mexico , and consequent additions to public spending and public debt to which he was opposed . Annexation would mean expansion of territory which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the most dangerous political issues . While personally deploring slavery , he held that it was a matter to be determined by the states . In his Inaugural he had announced opposition to any attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia , and also said that he was " equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the states where it exists . "  | But where the Constitution , in his opinion , permitted , Van Buren was against slavery . " The suppression of the African slave trade has received the continuous attention of the government , " he reported in his Fourth Annual Message to Congress , December 5 , 1840 .... " I submit to your judgments whether this government , having been the first to prohibit by adequate penalties the slave trade , the first to declare its piracy , should not be the first also to forbid to its citizens all trade with the slave factories on the coast of Africa , giving an example to all nations in this respect which if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in breaking up those dens of iniquity. " 5 The President 's reluctance to annex Texas not only thwarted those elements of the South that favored slave extension ; but also disappointed the expansionists and the mass of the people who thrilled at the idea of adding so much land to the nation 's possessions . As a president during panic times Van Buren 's chance of re-election to a second term would have been slight , and his stand on Texas further dimmed his chances . Van Buren , indeed , was abused because of his courageous adherence to the democratic-republican theory of limiting federal powers . He put the finances of the government on a sound basis . In his message to Congress on December 5 , 1840 , he opposed " grants of public money for works of internal improvement . " He advocated " simple , unostentatious , and economical administration of public affairs . " The government expenses should be defrayed wholly by the customs ' receipts and the sale of public lands . " Under no pretense whatsoever " should the taxes exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to the new Treasury system , he said : 8 The new system established by Congress for the safekeeping of the public money , prescribing the kind of currency to be received for the public revenue and providing additional guards and securities against losses , has now been several months in operation . Although it might be premature upon an experience of such limited duration to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of its influences in correcting many evils under which the Federal Government and the country have hitherto suffered , especially those that have grown out of banking expansions , a depreciated currency , and official defalcations , yet it is but right to say that nothing has occurred in the practical operation of the system to weaken in the slightest degree , but much to strengthen , the confident anticipations of its friends . Despite his conscientious conduct of the office , the fates seemed against Van Buren . During his term , Canada revolted against British rule . There was strong sympathy for the movement in the United States , especially in footnote 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The penalties were not adequate and the United States was not the first country to prohibit the Slave Trade . 6In the revulsion against Van Buren , the Treasury Act was repealed in 1841 , but it was re-established in 1846 and has continued in service of the public ever since , a monu ment to its founder .  | the North . Many volunteers crossed the border to aid the insurrectionists . Here was an opportunity for expansion to the North , such as the South envisioned in the Texas prospect ; but Van Buren refused to be drawn into t war . He issued proclamations of neutrality , disavowed and denounced the Yankee volunteers , and thereby became criticized as a tool of Great Britain . His frequent unpopular positions coupled with the double depression were more than could be sustained at the polls . Van Buren lost re-election by 170 , - 000 votes , a slight margin but so distributed as to be costly . He even lost New York state . His significance , however , obviously lies in his conduct in the presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic processes . 4 j No military repute had aided his rise , which was due to plain but astute F politics . Like Jackson , he was identified with the commonalty rather than the privileged , and had a humbler origin than his predecessor . As a commoner and a liberal in depression he was a notable example of the capacity of the plain people to produce their own leaders . In his judgment , government expenditure to relieve the financial distress was unsound , and he refused to be stampeded . No man in peacetime faced greater pressures to act or greater opportunities for increase of personal power through the distribution of government favors ; but he remained calm and self-possessed . In foreign affairs he enhanced the pacific tradition , declining the tempta ; rtions of imperialism . In the independent Treasury , he aimed to provide the government with a self-sustaining financial apparatus . Van Buren as well as Jackson proved that neither recklessness nor dangerous ambition need be characteristic of an avowed leader of the masses . When Van Buren went out of office , popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance of untrammeled expansion was in the air . The roster elected up to Lincoln 's time , in the main , were temporizers , letting events take their course ; for the most part , they were presiding officers rather than policy-makers ; but ultimately the time came when new issues had to be faced .  | Between Van Buren and Lincoln came twenty years of further expansion , and of political inertia . The country continued to grow apace , and few were willing to come to grips with the unresolved disputes of nationalism and slavery . Through war with Mexico , purchase from Mexico and treaty with England , more than 1,200,000 square miles were added to the nation , bringing it to the present area of the continental United States . By the time of Lincoln 's first election there were thirty-three states in the Union . The creation of new states and territories inevitably revived disputes on slavery and states rights , sharpening the zeal of the Abolitionists and leading to notable debates in Congress by Clay , Webster and Calhoun , all three of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the public was lulled by a long prosperity lasting until 1857 . President Pierce assured the country in 1853 that agitation over slavery had ceased ; and in 1856 the nation let itself be distracted by transient issues . In 1856 , for example , the native American Party , rousing prejudice against the great influx of German and Irish immigrants polled 874,000 votes . Meanwhile the South , bewildered and alarmed at the growth of the country , seeing itself becoming a minority voice , seemingly unable to grasp its potentialities in the new areas and new markets , offended by the Abolitionists of the North , drifted toward secession . By no means all Southerners were thus affected , not even all the leaders , but the fear psychosis was potently at work .  | Lincoln and the Modern World The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . As our case is new , so must we think and act anew . We must disenthrall ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN , Second Annual Message , December 1 , 1862 The personal life of Abraham Lincoln , his general political career and the dramatic events of the Civil War are so familiar to the American public that they do not require detailed repetition here . Any character as spacious , as protean , as Lincoln , however , lives again for each generation . He has something new to say for each generation , and for each turn of world crisis . If the South had a lost cause , so even more did Lincoln . The successful trial by arms ultimately saved the Union , abolished slavery and hallowed Lincoln in the brilliant light of victory . But the cause which he lost , namely his attempt to settle the differences peaceably through the appeal for economic freedom for all , has an arresting significance for our time ; and each main step in his efforts may help a modern world to find the solution of its future through peaceful means . Lincoln aimed to preserve the Union without resorting to war . He repeatedly proposed various plans for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaveholding states . In the midst of complete victory of arms , he advocated a restoration of the seceding states on terms of full amnesty , self-government and without malice . In all three projects he failed , but that was not the end . The League of Nations failed ; but it laid a ground-work of international thinking on which the United Nations could be erected without the need for new preliminary foundations . Similarly , with the benefit of hindsight and in the light of Lincoln 's prestige as a man of the ages , it is easy to see that his desired and unrealized program might have saved untold grief then and for generations to come . The cynic might say that only when Lincoln 's doctrines of Union and emancipation were written on a drumhead did they prevail . Yet that would be an unhistoric half-truth . His lost cause , namely his attempts to reach a peaceable solution , and his tolerance toward the secession States , emphasized a repudiation of force as a final principle . Today , Lincoln 's philosophy and  | action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics and ideology can be resolved through patient understanding ; and that the alternative of war is intolerably costly . He also accepted the hard final fact that liberty must be fought for if need be . To the liberal of the open mind , wherever the opening may lead , Lincoln will seem a kindred spirit . In the sense of being an experimentalist by temperament , Abraham Lincoln was not a liberal . If the term refers to championing the cause of minorities , as such , against the powers of a centralized state , he was not a liberal . He said " These politicians are subtle and profound on the right of minorities . " t If the term liberal suggests that he would form a beneficent planned society and force it upon minority groups for their own good , Lincoln was not a liberal . While he insisted on Union , he equally favored self-government of the states in domestic affairs . Currently , all shades of thinking claim him . J. G. Randall , one of his most recent biographers , has said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent place : liberalism with him was no garment ; it was of the fiber of his mind . " 2 Randall , however , also refers to the active opposition to Lincoln within his own party because of his conservatism . The Abolitionists and various other professional liberals of Lincoln 's time regarded him as unsatisfactory . As late as 1897 Henry Villard , a liberal journalist of note , made the following patronizing comment on the martyred president : " When he entered the White House , he was certainly ready , as the record shows , for a compromise on the slavery question and remained so until the next year . He was also a believer in the doctrines of the spoilsmen and practiced them in the distribution of offices . Yet I am convinced that , had he lived long enough , he would have become a sincere and determined civil service reformer . " 3 Poor Lincoln ! Today , to persons who believe in moderation and mutual tolerance , Lincoln 's fundamental principles of government appear obvious and incontrovertible . To save the Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your enemies seem hardly debatable ; but it is necessary to revert briefly to the history of the times to understand how exhaustively Lincoln wrought the new framework of opinion out of the sincerely diverse and vehement views which existed in both North and South . The famed Gettysburg address and the Second Inaugural were not documents of sudden inspiration , but rather the climactic statement of philosophy and action which had been evolving throughout the long struggle . Most of the Southern leaders throughout the history of the Republic until 186o had affirmed their loyalty to the Union and to the Constitution . Robert footnote a Message of July 4 , 186r. 2 Dictionary of American Biography , vol . XI , p. 258. 2 Henry Villard , Lincoln on the Eve of ' 61 , p. rot .  | E. Lee wrote as late as 1866 , " All that the South has ever desired was that the Union as established by our forefathers , should be preserved , and that the government as originally organized should be administered in purity and truth . " There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions during John Adams ' time ; in an opinion by Mr. Justice Chase in 1796 ; in the Hartford Convention of 1814 ; yet South Carolina 's failure to achieve nullification had given pause to state sovereignty advocates . The threat of separation was still dormant in May , 186o , when Lincoln was nominated on the Republican ticket ; but in the gap since Van Buren there had been no President who would face bravely the economic issues , particularly slavery , which were increasingly dividing the country . The presidents of those intervening years were , except Fillmore , either Southerners , Democrats , or both , and hence unsympathetic with the demands of Northern opinion . Nevertheless secession spirit was being formed in the deep . South . As early as 1851 the Camden , S. C. Southern Republic editorialized : " We will secede . The first assault will be made upon us by the federal government by the act of retaining the forts about Charleston . This will be war . " The Democratic platform of 1856 , on which Buchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , present , and future , but issued warnings . It stated that attempts to interfere with questions of slavery would " endanger the stability and permanence of the Union . " It also said that any attempts to interfere with domestic slavery " as consummated , must end in civil war and dis-union . " The sharpness of the issue was further emphasized by the third plank of the platform affirming " that the Democratic Party will resist all attempts at renewing , in Congress or out of it , the agitation of the slavery question , under whatever shape or color the attempt may be made . " Several incidents in the administration of Buchanan brought public temper to a high pitch . A federal boat dispatched to supply Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston , S.C. , was fired upon by the shore batteries of the state , and turned back . Guerilla warfare broke out in bloody Kansas where slavery was the issue . John Brown of Ossawatomie on October 16 , 1859 , made his raid on Harper 's Ferry , Va. , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of many Northern politicians who were agitating the slavery question . The school books have recited various of his  --  ; , early pronouncements on the subject . On June 16 , 1858 , he had said , " A house divided against itself can not stand . I believe this government can not endure permanently , half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved ? I do not expect the house to fall ? but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will become all one thing , or all the other . " While these words did not exclude his later peaceable approaches to the  | issue , they were regarded as incendiary . They helped to win the support of the Radical Republicans 4 for his nomination in 186o . The Democratic platform of the same year reaffirmed the planks already quoted from the 1856 platform , and the election was fought out intrinsically on the slavery issue . There were ten Southern states in which not a single popular vote was cast for Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight were holding out the olive branch . The party platform recognized the rights of the states to determine their own policies , and by inference repudiated the Kansas affair , saying " The maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states , and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively , is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend ; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory , no matter under what pretext , as among the gravest of crimes . " The platform condemned the reopening of the African slave trade , opposed the theory that the Constitution " carries slavery " into the territories of the United States ; but in general it was conciliatory . To the disgust of the Radical Republicans , Lincoln was even less vigorous than his platform . He was biding his time , avoiding commitments , and evolving his first plan for peaceful settlement . The addresses of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became alarmed .. Samuel Bowles said , " Lincoln is a simple Susan , and the men who fought a week at Chicago to nominate him have probably got their labor for their pains . " Charles Francis Adams referred to Lincoln as " saying whatever comes into his head " and " perambulating the country kissing the girls and growing whiskers . " Henry Villard , who was covering Lincoln 's campaign for the New York Herald , was vaguely impressed by the candidate 's sincerity and his way with the plain people , but Villard 's enthusiasm was guarded . " I dare say that there are dormant qualities in Old Abe ' which occasion will draw forth , develop and remind people to a certain degree of the characteristics of Old Hickory : " Between the time of Lincoln 's election in November , 186o , and the inauguration on March q , 1861 , secession had come . In December , 186o , South Carolina seceded because of the election . Her leaders placed no faith in the assurances of the Republican platform . Her " Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared footnote 4 Radical as well as Republican is capitalized here because the Radical Republicans were a self-styled and cohesive element in the party . They sought more drastic and immediate action than the moderates .  | that " government can not endure permanently half slave and half free . " South Carolina therefore declared that she " resumed her separate and equal place among nations . " In contrast to the later official position of the Confederacy , the South Carolina Declaration affirmed that slavery was the heart of the matter . It referred to Article 4 of the Constitution requiring that fugitive slaves should be returned to their owners . " This stipulation , " said the South Carolina declaration , " was so material to the compact that without it that compact would not have been made . " The Declaration then went on to cite that the laws of certain Northern states had abrogated Article 4 , that servile insurrection had been stirred up and constant agitation carried on . " Thus the Constitutional compact has been deliberately broken and . . . South Carolina is released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederacy had been formed .

The right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the United States , and which has been solemnly affirmed and reaffirmed in the Bills of Rights . . . undeniably recognizes in the people the power to resume the authority delegated for the purposes of government . Thus the sovereign States here represented have proceeded to form this Confederacy ; and it is by abuse of language that their act has been denominated a revolution .. .

" 2 President Buchanan did nothing between November , 186o , and March , 1861 , to remedy the situation , and it is doubtful that there was anything that he could have done . Lincoln in his First Inaugural offered a program which could have been accepted with saving of face by all parties . He chose to assume that the issue was one which still could be settled by peaceful discussion . He overestimated the persuasiveness of reasonableness and good will in the circumstances , and underestimated the emotional sectional loyalty of the South . Or , at any rate , he felt that the effort should be made toward peace .  | Lincoln began by assuring " the people of the Southern States " that there was no reasonable cause for the apprehension which " seems to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interests . He quoted from one of his public speeches . " I have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists . I believe I have no lawful right to do so , and I have no inclination to do so . " The President-elect referred to the clause in the Republican platform recognizing the rights of the states , and he added , " I now reiterate these sentiments , and in doing so I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property , peace , and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration . " He also pledged that the Constitutional provision for the return of fugitive slaves would be enforced and that " there will be no invasion , no using of force against or among the people anywhere . " " I take the official oath today with no mental reservation , and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no action by the government , no beginning of the war , no inflammatory incident , if he could avoid it . " There needs to be no bloodshed or violence , and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority . " Even the normal function of the government in occupying its properties and collecting duties would not be enforced in localities where hostility would not permit competent resident citizens to officiate . " There will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers upon the people for that object . " Rather than enforce the strict legal rights under irritating circumstances , he said , " I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices . " There would not even be any insistence on the delivery of the mails . The mails would be delivered " unless repelled . " He discussed the theory of Union and constitutional rights at some length , appealed to " a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people , " asserted that " nothing valuable can be lost by taking time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a procedure for reaching a settlement . " Suppose you go to war , you can not fight always ; and when , after much loss on both sides and no gain on either , you cease fighting , the identical old questions , as to terms of intercourse , are again upon you . . . We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies . Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . " This degree of conciliation to states which had already announced the formation of a separate and avowedly permanent confederacy , this willingness to suspend the normal operation of the federal offices where they were opposed , was dangerously close to being an abdication of the federal authority .  | Lincoln was taking a desperate chance , for his position could be construed as weakness both by the South and by foreign governments . He intended , however , to preserve the symbol of authority by the retention of Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston , S.C. , or of Fort Pickens , off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronghold of federal authority in the Southern area . Relief could have been sent to Pickens , but confusion arose in the dispatching of the orders , so that that project failed . Sumter , already highlighted by the attack which had previously been made upon a relief boat , was the logical and dramatic symbol . Lincoln had been assured by General Scott that the fort had enough supplies to maintain the garrison for a year and a half . That would give Lincoln considerable time to conduct peaceful negotiations . The fort could remain quietly manned by federal troops , and it seemed improbable that an unprovoked attack on it would be made by the South . Lincoln counted heavily on Sumter as the key to his strategy . ' Shortly after the inauguration , however , Lincoln learned that Scott had been in error . Word came that the fort had only enough supplies to hold out for a few weeks . That changed the whole balance of the carefully wrought plan . Lincoln must now either abandon Fort Sumter or take the risk of sending reinforcements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile incidents by limiting the relief to supplies of food . As a further precaution , Lincoln dispatched a messenger to the governor of South Carolina to inform him that the government was sending food supplies , and only food supplies , to Sumter and that the relief ship was accordingly pacific in its purposes . The mission was not successful . General Beauregard in charge of the local Confederate troops called upon Major Anderson , the fort 's commandant , to surrender . This was refused . Beauregard began bombardment of the fort and two days later Anderson was obliged to evacuate , sailing north with his garrison . The war had begun . Fort Sumter was evacuated by the Union forces on April 14 , 1861 ; and on the following day Lincoln called for 75,000 militia to suppress the Confederacy and " to cause the laws to be duly executed . " The peaceful moratorium was over . The threat of force , however , accomplished no more than the olive branch had done . In fact , the proclamation rallied to the secession cause those Southern states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce the authority of the government , still left the door open for reconciliation , without retribution . In any modern totalitarian state , Lee , " Stonewall " Jackson , Beauregard , and most of the other footnote 5 For exhaustive presentation of this strategy see David M. Potter , Lincoln and His Party in the Secession Crisis ( 1942 ) ?  | Southern generals would have been eligible for execution . Perhaps in any modern state , totalitarian or not , for they were graduates of West Point who had sworn to protect the federal government . It is significant of the tone of Lincoln 's policy that the generals of the Confederacy have come down to us in a tradition of honor , even romance , not tarred by vilification . Congress was called into special session on July 4 , 1861 . Lincoln 's message formulated his outstanding reasons for pursuing the war : " This issue embraces more than the fate of these United States . It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic , or democracy ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can not maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes . . . . It forces us to ask , Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness ? Must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its own people , or too weak to maintain its own existence ? " He went at length into the history of the forming of the Constitution and the Republic , affirming that the states and their rights were creatures of the Constitution and that the state sovereignty idea was invalid . His reasoning followed closely that of Washington when the latter had pleaded for loyalty to the Union . Lincoln affirmed that " this is essentially a people 's contest . . . for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men . " He referred to the internal disorders and said that " ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets , " and that the only appeal from an election which had been held constitutionally and fairly was to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government " what men can not take by an election neither can they take by a war . " This address though reasonable in tone was clouded by the turmoil of the occasion , and by the fact that it was not too clear what the ballots had decided , for Lincoln had won but 40 per cent of the popular vote against the Northern and the Southern Democratic candidates . The president had assumed his war powers as Commander-in-Chief . He had suspended habeas corpus proceedings between Philadelphia and Washington . He was de facto a dictator , even though temporarily and regretfully . Some of his own party viewed his actions with surprise and alarm , whereas the Radical wing chafed at his continued efforts toward conciliation . Lincoln himself at this point apparently had some doubts about his policies , for he continued , " Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is to be the course of the government toward the Southern states after the rebellion shall have been suppressed , the Executive deems it proper to say it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided by the Constitution and the laws , and that he probably will have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the federal government relatively , to . the rights of  | the states and the people under the Constitution than that expressed in the inaugural address . " " Probably . " This may have been a hint that the secessionists could go so far that those states might lose their Constitutional rights . That was the position soon eagerly embraced by the Radical Republicans . Or , more likely , he was forecasting that the opportunity for the Confederates to return to the Union as slave-owning states would not continue indefinitely . In fact , six months later , in his Second Message to Congress , Lincoln enlarged the Union issue to emphasize specifically the basic right of economic freedom ; and by inference that spelled the abolition of slavery throughout the nation . The South Carolina Declaration gave him this opportunity . So did the Confederate Constitution . While the latter 's preamble did not mention slavery , its detailed provisions endorsed the protection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in human beings , was avowed as a foundation stone of the Confederate cause . If the Southerners who were not slaveholders could be brought to see that their best economic future lay with the Union cause , the war could be promptly ended . Tradition to the contrary notwithstanding , the great bulk of the Southerners were not slaveholders . The owners of huge plantations , most of the wealthy class , nearly all the political leaders had slaves ; but these men were a small part of the population . The majority were small farmers , shopkeepers , and wage earners . Their best opportunity resided in a free economy . The economic as well as the political freedom of the individual was the crux of the matter . The President in his message held that the slavery argument was placing the rights of property above that of human beings , that it assumed a fixed relationship between labor and capital . " Labor is prior to and independent of capital , " said the President , and there are no fixed rules governing their relationship . He pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole people were neither slaves nor masters , and that in the North at that time most men worked for themselves and were neither employers nor hired hands . The point was an important one . The bulk of the people were farmers using their own labor . Families were large . Wives , sons and daughters as well as the father of the family tilled the soil . Single-family enterprises were the norm , " asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other . " He pointed out , too , that in the main those who were now employers had in their earlier days relied on their own labor or worked for another . Lincoln knew whereof he spoke . In a later age the freedom to conduct one 's own business is less available for the average man , where more capital is needed and more risks involved . But the path was not always easy then . Lincoln himself had failed as a storekeeper , but had gone on to other goals .  | He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a republic freed from privilege . " This is the just and generous and prosperous system , " he concluded , " which opens the way to all , gives hope to all , and consequent energy and progress and imprpvement of condition to all . No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty ; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned . Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess , and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost . " Lincoln 's plea , for all immediate practical purposes , was a failure . The failure was not necessarily in the way the philosophy was presented , nor in the responsiveness or unresponsiveness of the Southern populace . The initial fault was in the lack of means of communication . The South lived , if not behind an iron curtain , certainly behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The papers equipped to handle out-of-state news were now often without telegraphic service and without regular correspondence from Washington . The presidential documents , of course , were transmitted to Southern officials , but even when they reached the Southern press they were meagerly reported and were received in an editorial atmosphere which was generally hostile . At best , there were great physical handicaps to the dissemination of news . In the rural sections ? and the country was predominantly rural ? the situation was naturally worse than in the cities . Lincoln had an acute sense of the importance of the press to any man in public life . He had corresponded for newspapers in his early days , and as president was always greatly concerned regarding newspaper comment . He carried on personal correspondence with Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune , Henry Raymond of the New York Times , and other editors . In general , Lincoln was given an unusually full press coverage by New England , the middle Atlantic and the Midwest newspapers . ' Some of his state papers such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many newspapers ; yet the coverage was pitifully inadequate compared to modern times . The general shortage of space made it impracticable to give a full report of Washington news . But further , the era of objective reporting had not yet arrived . Most of the great papers were the projections of interesting personalities such as Greeley , and Samuel Bowles of Springfield , Massachusetts . The editorial comment was likely to have more prominence than the thing footnote 6 See excellent summary by James E. Pollard in The Presidents and the Press ,  | commented on . The Associated Press , born in 1848 , was still a struggling young outfit . Hence it was that Lincoln 's policies did not and could not have a thorough and continuing presentation to the public . His brief proposal to free the slaves by compensating the owners for financial loss incurred , was commented upon in the Northern press on its first mention in March and July , 1862 , but his great exposition on the subject in December was almost wholly ignored . In the Southern press , understandably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , the inclination was not to treat it objectively , but as enemy propaganda . Lincoln believed that if the mass of the Southerners had access to the facts , if they had the opportunity for self-expression , they would embrace the Union cause . " It may well be questioned whether there is today a majority of the legally qualified voters of any State , except , perhaps , South Carolina , in favor of disunion , " he had said in his message of July 4 , 1861 , affirming that the voters had been coerced . The degree of actual or potential Union sentiment in the South , however , could be only a matter of speculation . The appeal to the self-interest of the plain people in the causes of Union and emancipation , even if it had been widely heard throughout the South , might not have evoked a general response . Traditionally the Southerners had not thought of themselves as plain people . Their habit of mind was colored by the plantation . The population of the South was composed mainly of large kin-groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the less prosperous of the group had the pride of the old blood tie . It will be recalled that Andrew Jackson in his South Carolina young manhood was hoisted up the ladder by an influential relative , and basked in the role of an aristocratic dandy . He donned his democratic vestments much , much later . Therefore , one can only guess as to the possibilities of Lincoln 's immediate persuasiveness had he been able to project his words to all the people ; yet this lack of communication was unquestionably a handicap in his efforts toward freeing the slaves gradually through payments to their owners , and in seeking a healthy reconstruction . Economic freedom for the colored man and the white laborer was not to be purchased by the impoverishment of others . Lincoln 's purpose from the early days of his presidency was to compensate the owners of the emancipated slaves . He was convinced that compensation was an important part of the procedure . The idea was not a new one . Other countries had recognized the principle of payment , and the gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a more orderly transition . Great Britain in 1833 had voted twenty million pounds to free the slaves of the British colonial planters . The program included a seven-year  | apprenticeship to prepare both the economic system and the slave for the transition to a free wage pattern . In Mexico , Argentina and Colombia slavery had been ended under plans which provided for gradual change to the new order . Lincoln 's move toward a general freeing of the blacks was initiated in his special message to Congress of March 6 , 1862 , in which he requested that they adopt the following joint resolution : ? Resolved , that the United States ought to cooperate with any State which ma adopt gradual abolishment of slavery , giving to such State pecuniary aid , to be used by such State , in its discretion , to compensate for the inconvenience , public and private , produced by such change of system . Lincoln in this message emphasized that the plan was voluntary . He felt that one or more states would respond to the offer and that would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " In my judgment gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all . " Once a start was made on this principle the main economic quarrel , namely slavery , would be near settlement . Then " practical reacknowledgment of the national authority would render the war unnecessary , and it would at once cease . " Congress passed the resolution . It attracted no " practical " response from the Confederate states . Indeed , the disasters and ineptitudes of the Union armies , who suffered defeat after defeat in the first three years of the war , discounted any proposals that might come from Washington . Meanwhile , of course , the Radical Republicans were urging a blanket emancipation at once without any nonsense about compensation . Lincoln was not ready for forced emancipation . In May of ' 62 , Major General David Hunter had taken it upon himself under martial law to declare the slaves in Georgia , Florida , and South Carolina " forever free . " Lincoln promptly repudiated this action in a public proclamation ; and he urged the slave states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the arguments for yourselves . . . . I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them . . . This proposal makes common sense for a common object , casting no reproaches upon any . It acts not the Pharisee . The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven , not rending or wrecking anything . This presentation also produced no response . The resolution adopted by Congress had not specified any terms of compensation . On July 14 , Lincoln sought to make the proposal more definite by recommending a bill which provided that the government would pay for the slaves in bonds bearing 6 per cent interest . Congress did not act on this suggestion ; and on September 22 , 1862 , Lincoln signed what became known as the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation . It was issued on September 22 , 1862 , several days after the battle of Antietam when Lee 's forces had been driven back . Before that the Union armies had been so unsuccessful that any such proclamation would have been theoretical if not ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hundred days hence , he would proclaim as free all the slaves held in those states still in rebellion . Even now , he added that before final action " upon the next meeting of Congress , " in December , 1862 , he would " again recommend the adoption of a measure tendering pecuniary aid " to all states " not then in rebellion against the United States " who would " voluntarily adopt i ? nmediate or gradual abolishment of slavery . " Lincoln 's second annual message to Congress on December 2 , 1862 , redeemed that promise . He renewed his proposal that the freedom of the slaves be accomplished through payment of interest-bearing bonds . He began by saying that there were already many opinions in respect to the best way of dealing with slavery . Some would perpetuate it . Some would abolish it suddenly . Some would end it gradually and with compensation for the slave owners , and still others would try to export the slaves through colonization , and there were other minor diversities . Hence , it was foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being the ideal one . Mutual concessions to reach a harmonious end were obviously to be desired . He agreed that his long term proposal would not suit those who were in a hurry to abolish slavery , but on the other hand it would give an opportunity for the nation to prepare both the colored people and the social scene for a gradual absorption of the freed men . The system would give each state an opportunity for considerable discretion on its own part as to how rapidly it would free the colored people within their borders . In a conciliatory tone he affirmed that " the people of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the North , " and allowed that the North had profited in its commerce with the Southern economy . Hence , he again disavowed any self-righteous tone . Lincoln argued that the financial burden of paying for the slaves would be continuously lighter for the taxpayer , as the increase in population would reduce the average per capita cost . In 1862 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be one hundred million by 1900 , a prophecy which proved to be twenty-four million too high . In any event , compared with the cost and the agony of the war , the expenditure would be negligible . He was willing to take the humblest tone to Congress if he could win them to this scheme : " Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors , nor that many of you have more experience than I. " He urged Congress to shake loose from the fetters of traditional thinking : " The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . As our case is new , so must we think and act anew . We must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . " " Fellow citizens , " he concluded , " we can not escape history . . . We , even  | we here hold the power and bear the responsibility . In giving freedom to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth . Other means may succeed ; this could not fail . The way is plain , peaceful , generous , just ? a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless . " Only a month remained before the final Emancipation Proclamation . , That procedure was the one desired by the Abolitionists . Why coddle the rebels , welcoming them back into the Union and paying them for their property ! Lincoln , though rebuffed , though the war continued and the slaves were set free , did not yet abandon hope for his plan . As late as February 5 , 1865 , he renewed the proposal before his Cabinet , seeking support for again presenting the subject to Congress , but not one would vote for it.7 Lincoln had failed in his effort to settle differences without warfare . He had also failed to establish the freedom of the slaves by an equitable system which would be just to their former owners . Above all , however , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his " paramount object " was " to save the Union . " If I could save the Union without freeing any slave , I would do it ? if I could save it by freeing all the slaves , I would do it ? and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would also do that . . . I have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty , and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free . As the war continued , even the objective of Union began to seem unattainable . Lincoln proclaimed a general amnesty , with certain exceptions , to all secessionists who would return and take the oath of allegiance . He fostered the forming of pro-Union governments in the Southern states , promising to recognize any who would affirm their loyalty , abolish slavery , and establish the fact that they were elected by at least 10 per cent of those zens who were qualified to vote in 1860 . Several Southern state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his program was violently opposed within his own party . There was some doubt of renominating Lincoln in 1864 , but the Republicans felt too insecure to drop him . In fact , the convention at Baltimore named Andrew Johnson , the war-governor Democrat from Tennessee , as vicepresidential candidate , and decided to run their ticket under the name of the National Union Party . The Radical Republicans did not bolt , as staying in office was their first desire ; but they were chafing increasingly at the President 's policies . A tide of victories for the Union armies , late in 1864 , gave the Lincoln ticket a sizable majority , which nevertheless did little to placate the self-styled radicals . footnote 7 Lincoln 's " Complete Works , " edited by John A. Nicolay and John Hay , Gettysburg edition , vol .

Lincoln 's course has been presented here as that of a liberal mind . Many additional instances could have been cited . Conversely , in numerous instances he stretched the executive power to a dangerous degree , though never for personal aggrandizement . His purposes throughout , as modern generations view them , were humanitarian ; but Lincoln in the eyes of the left wing of his party was an arch-Conservative , if not worse . Now that victory was safe , they began to speak out louder and louder . Representative George W. Julian of Indiana , a founder of the Republican party , in a lengthy and typical address , blamed Lincoln 's policies for the long duration of the war . " A little wholesome severity , summarily administered , would have been a most sovereign panacea . " He referred to Lincoln 's attitude of toleration as " the horrid infatuation that so long shaped the policy of the government in resisting this slaveholders ' rebellion . " He observed that " a system of retaliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not yet been adopted . . . The times of brotherly love toward rebels in arms have gone by forever " and predicted that Congress would " provide for parceling out the forfeited and confiscated lands of rebels in small homesteads among the soldiers and seamen of the war . " Regarding the critics of the government , such as himself , Julian said , " the moral appeals and persistent criticism of these men saved our cause from the complete control of Conservatism and thus saved the country itself from destruction . " 8 Julian purported to believe that Lincoln had recanted from his earlier principles , as evidenced by the fact that his Second Inaugural stated that slavery " was somehow a cause of the war . " Lincoln , in fact , had said this in his December , 1862 , message on compensation . Julian failed to note that the Second Inaugural mentioned both North and South as " those by whom the offense came . " The President had not changed in his basic attitude . To the day when he was assassinated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds . " The Julian " system of retaliation " was close at hand . Many years passed before Lincoln 's dream of a spiritually reunited nation came into being ; but his words , what he wished to do , his counsel on how to treat our fellowman even if he has been our enemy , have become more and more an exalting scripture for the nation 's conscience . footnote 8 Louis M. Hacker , The Shaping of the American Tradition , pp. 620-627.  | The Liberal Battleline Shifts The single vote by which Andrew Johnson escaped . conviction marks the narrow margin by which the Presidential element in our system escaped destruction . W. A. DUNNING , Essays on the Civil War and Reconstruction The fact of the American internal war , whatever it may be named , its length , the triumph of the North and the prostration of the South brought about a new orientation of liberal issues . Fortunately the passions of the day centered around Andrew Johnson as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the presidency the focus of contending views . Fortunately , indeed , because the confusion arid anger of the times well might have been diffused in a number of inconclusive separate vicious squabbles , prolonging issues indefinitely . Conceive , for example , the chaos which might have surrounded a temporizing Buchanan . Johnson chose to take his stand firmly and unafraid , even at times tactlessly and combatively and for that the nation owes him thanks . He made the presidency rather than the nation the battleground . The personal struggle of Andrew Johnson in the presidency is one of the most inspiring sagas in the American tradition , and it shall not be omitted here . A strong " channel , " that mind ! But first let us see what had happened to American issues . The " consent of the governed " doctrine had been settled through force of arms to mean that the nation , nothing smaller , was that unit of consent . Lincoln had pleaded for toleration and brotherhood in victory , but the fact of force was there . The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the federal government was no longer to be challenged . Henceforth the main issue would be as to how wisely it might exercise that authority . Justice as between sections should theoretically no longer be an issue , for t all sections were with equal right a part of the whole , though Johnson 's main battle was to establish that premise . The idea of Constitutional liberty for the free citizen faced a new test , with slavery abolished forever and the new status of the colored people to be determined . The Indians were long since doomed to be a dependent people . From the standpoint of the presidency they receded into a minor problem . Imperialism was virtually extinct . The contest to acquire territory for economic or political purposes was at an end and the nation now had far more land than its population could utilize for many years hence ,  | Peace with foreign nations also was no longer an issue . There was no urgency to fight for new territory , every reason to avoid combat . Alaska could be acquired by purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , was disposed to invade a nation hardened , if battered , in the practices of warfare . Even domestic commercial differences were dormant in the North . Those who were able to return to the simple agricultural economy of the farm and village were happy to do so . They were the vast majority of the population . The war 's end was marked by sharp declines in industrial activity and prices . The chief issue of the day was internal and political ? what should be done about the conquered South ? Who would control it , what would be its new pattern ? The Radical reformers and the carpetbaggers fought for dominion over the South , together and separately . Some of the former believed that all reforms could and should be effected at once . The latter claimed the spoils of victory . Johnson stood for the self-determination of the South , and thus laid the cornerstone of a new national unity . Held within bounds by the war and by the prestige of Lincoln , the Radical Republicans hitherto had chafed and seethed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and felt that they were righteously entitled to it . Vengeance upon the South , martial law below the District of Columbia , enfranchisement of the Negroes through elections policed by federal agents ? these were among the aims of the group led by Ben Wade of Ohio , George W. Julian of Indiana , Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania , and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , a group which now virtually controlled Congress . They needed to secure their positions promptly , for if the representatives of the Southern States were re-admitted to Congress under such conditions as Lincoln had proposed , the narrow margin of control now held by the extremists would be wiped out . Much depended on how fully the Radicals could influence , or would need to influence , the new President . If the Southern whites were not kept under control , Stevens said " they , with their kindred copperheads of the North , would always elect the President and control Congress . " Johnson 's decision ? whether to follow Lincoln or heed the Radical Republicans , would be a determining factor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents in point of character , humaneness and vision .

At the age of nineteen he married Eliza McCardle , the daughter of a shoemaker .

He had a stalwart physique . He was five feet nine inches in height , had piercing black eyes , a strong , mellow voice , and a self-possessed manner . Moreover , possibly because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine appearance . The impression of Johnson as an uncouth ruffian was invented by his opponents and fostered for years by partisan or lazy historians . This view is contrary to contemporary evidence and has been corrected by such careful modern biographers as Robert E. Winston , Lloyd Paul Stryker , and St. George L. Sioussat . Johnson had been elected to Congress in 1843 , at the age of thirty-five . Before that , he had served in the Tennessee legislature as a Jacksonian Democrat , and had campaigned for Van Buren . In Congress he had become noted particularly as an advocate of the Homestead Law , whicJ gave an opportunity for poor men to establish themselves-as farmers . As governor of Tennessee he campaigned for better schools and libraries . Such was the character of the man to whom the nation was entrusted by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . Unlike many of the President 's colleagues , Johnson was true to his chief and was among the first to recognize his stature .

" On another occasion he said , " I am only trying to carry out the measures toward the South that Mr. Lincoln would have done had he lived . " The task Johnson faced was obviously one of great complexity . The Radicals desired to confer the ballot on all the freedmen at once , to police the footnote 2 R. H. Battle , Library of Southern Literature , vol . VI , p. 2719.  | white vote by distinguishing between the " loyal " and " disloyal , " to seize the large plantations and divide them into small holdings . Some , like Julian , would turn over these lands to the Union veterans , others would give them to the blacks and the poor whites . The Radicals were also projecting a large program of education , health and general improvement for the colored race and the loyal whites . Louis M. Hacker , in The Shaping of the American Tradition ( pp. 593-596 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in carrying out parts of the program there were abuses and instances of self-interests , but clears them on intent ? " They sought to make the idea of equality work . " Against this project of imposed equality were many considerations . Did the unlanded or non-plantation whites desire salvation or enlightenment through the means of Northern force ? Apparently they did not . Further , would the black man benefit by sudden full citizenship ? Had there been complete good will on all sides , the difficulties would have been great enough . The freedmen numbered around four million . Most of them were unlettered , although some knew trades , and all by the misfortune of their slavery had no knowledge of self-rule . They were freed , it is true , but landless and jobless in an impoverished countryside . Lincoln 's plan of compensation could have provided the initial " pump-priming " capital to stimulate production and employment . As it stood , the colored people were the victims of each side . Various Southern states moved toward restrictive laws concerning the blacks , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to keep that vote under Northern manipulation . In following Lincoln 's pattern Johnson had pitiably small support in the official ranks . In the Cabinet , Gideon Welles and William H. Seward , secretaries of navy and state respectively , were the only men strongly in favor of continuing with Lincoln 's policies . Edwin M. Stanton , Lincoln 's war secretary , pretended to support the administration , but was actually a tale-bearer to Stevens et al , advising them of his chief 's programs so that the measures might be anticipated and opposed . Johnson 's leading critics may have been of good intent , but they were as bizarre a group of humans as ever occupied the public stage . Thaddeus Stevens bore a grudge against society . He had been born with a club foot . His father had deserted the family . Urged on by his mother , Stevens had succeeded despite the severest misfortunes . By 1865 , as a member of Congress , he was a grim and seasoned fighter with both ancient and recent grudges to be served . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them destroyed by Lee 's troops in their march on Gettysburg . Charles Sumner , born to the purple , brilliant and fluent , was a United States senator from Massachusetts . His talent for invective had brought him  | a brutal beating from a Southern opponent from which he had not fully recovered . A single man in his fifties , inadequately appreciated , having borne no arms in the war , he too had scores to pay which allied him with Stevens . Ben Wade , senator from Ohio , was made of cheerier stuff . He was a rough and ready politician , sixty-five by now . He thought that Johnson 's tolerant attitude toward the South was " political suicide . " He was being groomed by Stevens for leadership of the Senate , and perhaps for higher office . He approved of Stevens . Outside of Congress also there was eloquent opposition to Johnson , including Wendell Phillips and Horace Greeley . Greeley , who had often deplored Lincoln 's firmness for the Union , now was against amnesty and reconciliation . Of him Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough editor before the war , although I never agreed with him , but in all other matters he seemed to me like a whale ashore . He nearly bothered Mr. Lincoln 's life out of him , and it was difficult to tell whether he wanted Union or separation , war or peace . Greeley is all heart and no head . He is the most vacillating man in the country or was during the war . He runs to goodness of heart so much as to produce infirmity of mind .. . Greeley was a sublime old child . Johnson , Welles , and Seward did not wholly back public support . Henry Ward Beecher , pastor of Plymouth Church , Brooklyn , N.Y. , who had been a stalwart supporter of Lincoln at first endorsed Johnson 's policies . So did General Sherman . So did Grant . In general , the military leaders who had actually borne arms on the battle'Jfield were the most tolerant . General Sherman said : I perceive the politicians are determined to drive the Confederates into guerilla bands , a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . we could settle the war in three weeks by giving shape to the present disordered elements , but they may play out their game . . . I do not favor the scheme of declaring the negroes . . . to be loyal voters , whereby politicians may manufacture just so much more pliable electioneering material . . . they are no friends of the negro who seek to complicate him with new prejudices . Johnson , at the outset , was fortunate that Congress was not in session . On the day before he died , Lincoln had said , " I think it providential that this great rebellion is crushed out just as Congress has adjourned and there are none of the disturbing elements of that body to embarrass us . If we are wise and discreet we shall reanimate the states and get their governments in successful operation , with order prevailing and the Union re-established before Congress comes together in December . " Johnson hastened to bring about restoration on the Lincoln pattern . As early as the twenty-ninth of May , 1865 , he issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration of all rights of property  | except as to slaves , " to all but a few classifications , and the exceptions were permitted to apply for clemency . Johnson then proceeded to appoint provisional governors , or recognize governors already chosen , for the purpose of getting state governments reestablished . Loyalty to the Union and acceptance of the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery , were the only conditions required . The public in general was gratified , and Johnson was acclaimed in many quarters . The President himself said , " We are making very rapid progress ? so rapid I sometimes can not realize it . It appears like a dream ! " Thaddeus Stevens wrote to Sumner , " If something is not done , the President will be crowned king before Congress meets . . . . The danger is that so much success will reconcile the people to almost everything . " Ben Wade said , " To me all appears gloomy , " and Wendell Phillips alleged that President Johnson 's plan of reconstruction was a practical fraud upon the North . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern states , except Texas , had formed governments and chosen their senators and representatives . No wonder Johnson felt that the breach was healing rapidly . From the Radical point of view , however , this was throwing away the fruits of victory . No social revolution was involved in the Johnson program . The same leaders and interests as before the war were coming back into power . Slavery was abolished , but otherwise little was changed . The opportunity radically to reform the South would be lost if the present new governments continued . At the very start of Congress , the issue was joined . Thaddeus Stevens called a caucus which proposed appointing a committee of fifteen to pass upon the qualifications of states for readmission to the Union . This was wholly inconsistent with the Lincoln-Johnson theory . The states were in the Union already , and as Gideon Welles wrote , the committee was " in conflict with the spirit and letter of the Constitution . " Johnson , according to Welles , did not expect the Stevens caucus to prevail . The President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to clarify the purposes of the administration . The document had been drafted by the historian , George Bancroft , and reviewed by Seward . It unequivocally met the issues of the hour . Following a long exposition of the indestructibility of any state under the Constitution , Johnson reviewed the existing situation : The United States had recovered possession of all its forts and arsenals in the South . Resistance to the General Government was at an end . The existence of military rule by the North if continued " would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished and would have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection . " He took the position that , if it was to be affirmed that the states could not legally secede , which had been the contention of the Union party , then the  | states had not seceded legally and their intrinsic status remained unimpaired . Hence , as soon as it was possible to restore the legislative procedures in the Southern states , they had the right to resume their part in the nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government to bring about these local restorations as rapidly as possible . He agreed that the effort of the federal government to bring about these provisional state governments was " attended with some risk . . . for its success it requires at least the acquiescence of the states which it concerns . " Nevertheless , in the interest of order and the restoration of a peaceful society , he felt that the risk of setting up a disloyal government , or one which might represent only a faction in the given state , was less than to leave things in the unsettled situation of a military rule . Johnson on the day after Lincoln 's death had told a Congressional committee , including Ben Wade , that treason " should be made infamous . " This had encouraged the Radicals momentarily to think that Johnson would favor their policies of punishment and reform . Now he qualified that statement . " It is manifest that treason , most flagrant in character , has been committed , " he said . " Persons who are charged with its commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunals of the country , in order that the Constitution and the laws may be fully vindicated , the truth clearly established and affirmed that treason is a crime , that traitors should be punished and the offense made infamous , and , at the same time , that the question may be judicially settled , finally and forever , that no State of its own will has the right to renounce its place in the Union . " The indestructibility of the states , the legal dealings with treason ? one other cardinal issue remained ? whether freedom from slavery should be accompanied by the right to vote . Universal suffrage was a new idea , not only in the world , but in the United States . Negroes and all persons without property were excluded from voting in some Northern states . Massachusetts Abolitionists , such as Sumner and Phillips , who wished all male Negroes to be given the vote , denied the privilege to all women , white or black . Not until 1920 were there a sufficient number of states in favor of woman suffrage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic justice for the freedmen . " While I have no doubt that now , after the close of the war , it is not competent for the General Government to extend the elective franchise in the several States , " he said , " it is equally clear that good faith requires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their property , the right to labor , and their right to claim the just return of their labor . " He affirmed that industry must be freely opened to them , but that the franchise should be reserved to the decision of each state . Johnson 's program as set forth in his message seemed so reasonable to him , so much in accord with the Constitution , so close to Lincoln 's ideas , that  | he did not anticipate the violence of opposition which followed . The message of the President of the United States was normally the first order of business before the Congress , and Johnson hoped that his carefully reasoned appeal would satisfy all but the extremists . Congressional endorsement could solidify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era of amity . The committee of fifteen , however , delayed the reading of the message . The Clerk of the House under Stevens ' direction omitted the names of Southern representatives when calling the roll , and the issue of whether or not the Southern states were members of the Union was thereby precipitated at once before the presidential message was even heard . In the many months which followed , a succession of bills on Reconstruction according to Radical Republican ideas were passed , sent to the White House and vetoed . They all had the goal of keeping the South under military control . The essential details may be briefly stated . There were two attempts to pass a new Freedmen 's Bureau Bill . The Bureau had been established under Lincoln as a temporary measure to assist the freed slaves in becoming adjusted to civilian life . The first measure greatly extended the powers originally contemplated and used the desirable purposes of the Bureau as an excuse for military occupation . In his veto measure of February 19 , 1866 , Johnson outlined the dangers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedman 's Bureau with greatly enlarged powers . The bureau was to be governed nominally by the president of the United States , but acting through the War Department and a commissioner for the bureau . Agents were to be selected from the army or from civil life . The country was to be divided into sub-districts and districts with an army of salaried agents . In eleven states it was proposed to give the bureau jurisdiction over all cases affecting freedmen and refugees allegedly discriminated against by " local law , custom or prejudice . " Any white person charged with depriving a freedman , namely a former slave , of any civil rights might be subject to imprisonment or fine or both . Yet the bill did not define what those civil rights were . An agent appointed by the bill would exercise the office of a military judge . He might be a stranger entirely ignorant of the laws of the place . No provision was made for any general legal supervision of the fitness of such agents or of the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for jury trial or any fixed rules of law or evidence under the operation of the bureau . Trials could proceed without any previous charges or indictment ; and the punishment would be fixed not by statute ,  | but by a court-martial . From the tribunals there was no provision made for appeal nor any writ of error which might be made to the courts of the United States . Johnson concluded " I can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the Constitution . " While the presidential veto prevailed in this instance , a second similar bill was soon introduced having enough supporters to carry over Johnson 's opposition . The actual functioning of the bureau had its meritorious side . It became a vast relief organization aiding thousands of families including whites as well as blacks . There are numerous cheerful accounts of it in contemporary Northern sources ; but the price of these benefits was rule by martial law , and many abuses . Similarly , the so-called Civil Rights Bill aimed to enforce the immediate enfranchisement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as outlined in the Constitution . Here again Johnson protested in a vigorous veto message : In all our history , in all our experience as a people living under Federal and State law , no such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before been proposed or adopted . They establish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go infinitely beyond any that the General Government has ever provided for the white race . In fact , the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race . It interfered with the state legislation , he affirmed , and would tend to break down the whole system of relationship between federal and state law . He held that it would only serve to reawaken the spirit of rebellion and to delay the return of a true spirit of union and peace . This and a series of other Reconstruction Acts were obviously , as Johnson said , something new " in all our history . " The more vicious phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the younger Radical Republicans after several years . Yet the war had brought one fundamental change in national structure and policy which endured . The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution declared that all persons born or naturalized in this country are " citizens of the United States " f and of the state in which they reside . The states were by this amendment no longer the sole custodians of citizenship . The Fourteenth Amendment also limited state representation in Congress in proportion to the number of citizens actually qualified to vote . In other words , either let the black man vote or else do n't claim him as part of your population for representation purposes . Johnson agreed that this was a fair limitation . He desired no color discrimination , as such , and recommended a progressive franchise based on education and moderate property qualifications . The amendment also forbade any possibility of a compensation measure  | such as Lincoln had suggested . Federal authority was hereby affirmed forever and state " sovereignty " liquidated . Nationalism was the new rule of the country . Had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new era of amity might have followed . Unfortunately , federal authority , federal oppression and Negro enfranchisement were all tied together , to the ultimate disadvantage of the freedman 's cause . The Southern states , as well as the slaveholding state of Delaware , rejected the Fourteenth Amendment at the outset ; but the governments set up under the Lincoln-Johnson plan were turned out by Reconstruction and the new regimes accepted the amendment . Throughout the differences between the White House and the Legislature , the opposition naturally made every effort to make the President appear as a stubborn unreasonable man , trying to block the popular will . Actually , Johnson vetoed but twenty-one acts out of scores which were passed by the Congress . Indeed , he avoided collisions on all points but the central policy of Reconstruction . On this he was adamant . Johnson encountered so much turmoil in his contest with the Radical Republicans on reconstruction and the powers of the presidency , that much of his day to day constructive work has been forgotten . Johnson worked for international peace in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose-knit alliance to protect their subjects and properties in Mexico . A succession of rulers in Mexico had resisted foreigners . There was no stability in government and many " outrages " were committed , as Europe regarded them . Protection , rather than invasion , had been contemplated by the European powers at the outset ; but Napoleon III of France , after a dubious plebiscite in Mexico , had named the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria as Emperor Maximilian the First of Mexico . These events had occurred during the Civil War under Lincoln and became a Johnson legacy . General Grant in June 1865 affirmed to Johnson that Napoleon III had committed " an act of hostility to the United States . " Johnson desired no more war . As mentioned previously , the nation wished no more fighting and Europe had no zeal to engage America on this side of the Atlantic . Johnson , with the advice of Seward , his secretary of state , and other members of the Cabinet , realized that time was on his side . True to the liberal tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it might have served him personally . He decided to wait the issue out . A French-ruled empire on the American continent would be intolerable , against the Monroe Doctrine , but there was no need for a trial of arms at once . Actually , a local revolution occurred and Maximilian was executed , without the United States government becoming it:volved . Then came Alaska . The circumstances were remarkably similar to those which Jefferson had encountered in the purchase of Louisiana . Russia , as  | Napoleon I had in the earlier case , made the initial approach . Her ambassador made the proposal to William H. Seward , formerly in Lincoln 's Cabinet , now secretary of state under Johnson . Seward deserves the credit for prompt receptivity and action , for bargaining over the terms until the price was $7,200,000 for 500,000 square miles of territory , including four thousand miles of coastline replete with bays and harbors . With Johnson 's warm approval the Senate ratified the agreement on April 9 , 1867 , though the reconstruction controversy was continuing . The House , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces jeered at the project . The territory was referred to as " Walrussia " and as " Johnson 's polar bear garden . " Johnson did not wait for the House to approve funds and took possession in October 1867 , when the United States flag was unfurled at Sitka and the U. S. Army took over from the Russian troops . Meanwhile a growing public opinion approved the action , and in July 1868 the House voted the appropriation 113 to 43 . Johnson 's courage on Alaska was all the more notable since he had already " gone to the country " on the reconstruction issue in the fall of 1866 , at the mid-term Congressional elections . He believed earnestly that he expressed the popular will in pursuing the Lincoln policy of toleration . He denounced the Radical leaders by name , and that may have lost him some votes , as the president is held by some to be above the strife . The disfranchised South obviously had no voice at the polls . Hence the president had to look wholly to the North for support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forthwith determined to get rid of the president by the process of impeachment and conviction . The impeachment of a president was not a popular step . It had not been attempted hitherto in the history of the republic and it was discussed for some months in Congress before the Radical Republicans completed their plan . The plan took shape in the passage of the Tenure-of-Office Act in March 1867 , which provided that a president might not remove an appointee who had been approved by the Senate without the consent of the Senate . Johnson was advised that the act was unconstitutional , and many years later this was held to be the case , though at the time the Supreme Court avoided ruling on it . Stanton , the secretary of war , as noted previously , had been secretly an informer for the Radical Republicans though pretending to be a supporter of the President . Now , he came out in his true colors . The President dismissed him and appointed General Grant in his place . Stanton refused to retire and Grant , who had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , changed his mind . Johnson then appointed a man named Thomas . Stanton still refused to yield , and the Radicals had their issue .  | They succeeded in obtaining a vote to impeach the President at the bar of the Senate . The vote was in March 1868 , a year after the first step in the program . The President was accused on eleven points , including the heinous crime of criticizing Congress ; but the trial centered on the power-of-removal issue . The term impeachment is confusing , as it is an accusation not a conviction . As in the case of an indictment , the accused is innocent until proved otherwise , but the mere fact that the impeachment had been brought against the President was , of course , a national scandal . At this point Johnson became the victim of his own attorneys . He had stated to the press that there were previous examples in which a president had removed an appointee without the consent of the Senate , and without being challenged therefor . The point was well taken ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson 's lawyers and they became greatly perturbed over his attempt at public self-defense . At the close of a Cabinet meeting the attorney-general said to the President : " You are now , Mr. President , in the hands of your lawyers , who will speak and act for you , and I must begin by requesting that no further disclosures be made to newspaper correspondents . There was in the papers yesterday , or this morning , what purported to be a conversation between the President and a correspondent , in which the Pickering correspondence was brought out and made public . This is all wrong , and I have to request that these talks or conversations be stopped . They injure your case and embarrass your counsel . " His attorneys conducted the case with skill , erudition and good temper ; but the impeachment trial obviously was not comparable to an ordinary court case . Johnson had spent a lifetime amid the various issues involved . His real trial was before the bar of public opinion . The contest was intrinsically political rather than legal . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel hidden from the stage and silent while his accusers week after week held the limelight . On May 16 , 1868 , the Chief Justice , presiding over the trial held by the Senate , held that Andrew Johnson , President of the United States , " stood acquitted " on the charge relating to the Tenure of Office Act , and acquittal on all other points followed shortly . He had won a technical victory . By one vote his accusers had failed to muster the necessary two-thirds for conviction ; but Johnson 's prestige and reputation were severely damaged . In his fourth and last message to the Congress on December 9 , 1868 , Johnson made a final appeal for his concept of a liberal policy . He pointed out that the reconstruction had failed ? that the attempt to place the Southern whites " under the domination of persons of color " had destroyed good relationships and prevented co-operation in industrial enterprise . In vain , he urged upon Congress a " timely revocation of injurious and oppressive measures . "  | Johnson 's chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Union Party had been a wartime coalition . The Democratic Party at this stage was composed mostly of Northerners who had no sympathy with the man from Tennessee . Robert E. Lee said , " Everyone approves of the policy of President Johnson , gives him his cordial support , and would , I believe , confer on him the presidency for another term if it was in his power . " This presumably meant every one of Lee 's acquaintance , and was hardly politically helpful to Johnson at this period . Johnson was not an active candidate . The Democrats nominated Horatio Seymour of New York , a Tammany man , and the Republicans nominated Grant . Johnson 's commentary on the man destined to be his successor is touching in its clarity and lack of rancor . Said Johnson of Grant , " He was the strongest man of all in the support of my policy for a long while , and did the best he could for nearly two years in strengthening my hands against the adversaries of constitutional government . But Grant saw the Radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see it , or if seeing it did not heed it . Grant did the proper thing to save Grant , but it pretty nearly ruined me . I might have done the same thing under the same circumstances . At any rate , most men would . " Johnson 's term in the presidency was a tortuous period in the history of liberalism . Measured by ideal standards , the nation had failed miserably in its approach to re-union and the solution of the Negro 's status . Whether a more tactful president could have done what Johnson tried to do is a matter of speculation . Presumably Congress would have pursued the same course under a weak president , and without rebuke . Johnson at least asserted a steadfast moral leadership . His attempt to re-establish the Southern states at the least kept that aim before the public consciousness and assured the South that it had a friend at the head of government , that there was some element of hope for their future . On the race problem , Johnson 's advocacy of moderation seemingly fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic opportunity for the colored people , of education and gradual enfranchisement was sound in theory . Johnson blamed the Radicals for destroying that plan . Perhaps it was unworkable anyhow . An embittered South turned against the Negro , and a more tolerant policy was delayed for generations . At best , the size of the colored population in relation to white created racial tensions which were difficult to relieve . As Dunning has indicated , the impeachment trial was a supreme test of the presidential office . Had Johnson lost , it may be assumed that the Executive powers would have been seriously impaired . No president would have dared defy Congressional leaders . As it was , the trial strengthened the office and gave future presidents a precedent for bold independent action .  | A sodden era succeeded the end of Johnson 's term , eight years of moral and financial turmoil . The nation gained nearly a third in population despite war losses , but the aftermath of battle was woe to the victors as well as to the vanquished . Manufactures throve for a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole nation was exhausted , the health and pride of the young free nation had been blackened with gunpowder . The country walked in an evil trance . never had it been more barren of literature , enterprise , character . The cities for the first time knew poverty and beggary on a large scale . The farmers were the . least unfortunate class , having a roof and foodstuffs , but their lands and equipment still suffered from the neglect of war years . In the White House , Ulysses S. Grant needed a better brand of whiskey than had served him on the camp ground .  | Hayes and the Moral Reformation Not until the advent of President Hayes , his irreproachable cabinet and the Puritanical tone which Lucy Hayes gave to administration entertainments , did the social atmosphere improve . // A notable liberal rector of a fashionable Episcopal church in Brooklyn , N.Y. , addressed his congregation perplexedly on the occasion of his twentyfifth anniversary in the parish . During that long ministry , he explained , he had endeavored to arouse his wealthy morning congregation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , he had attempted to impress on the socialistic audiences who attended his Sunday evening forums that no social planning can serve humanity unless its agents and the individuals of society are imbued with the need for personal salvation . Each class of zealots , the well-to-do religious and the ardently planning socialists , continued resistant to their full obligations , the rector observed regretfully . The issue is one which has been long extant in reform and liberalism , and is frequently divisive . Cromwell was able to incite a middle-class religious revolt against the usurpations of Charles I and thereby promote a program of social reforms . Franklin Roosevelt in his first term repeatedly described himself as a reformer and a liberal , campaigning against personal wickednesses as well as advocating new social measures ; but the reformer and the e liberal in any given era , are often far apart . The liberal in today 's connotation may be inclined to assume an effortless native goodness in all individuals and to concentrate on improving the pattern of the state . As a natural corollary , he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent to which they changed the structure of the social order . As we have seen , the first sixty years of the Republic witnessed recurrent debates on the meaning of the Constitution . The statesmen and the reformers treated it as the chief social instrument , orientating most of their arguments around the relative powers of the states and the general government . For nearly forty years following the Civil War , however , most of the liberal drive by political reformers , educators , newspapermen , magazine writers , was against governmental corruption , a fight for integrity in public office . With few exceptions , social change by law was negligible . For more than thirty years there was no amendment to the Constitution , between the fif- footnote 1 Allan Nevins , " The Emergence of Modern America , " A History of American Life , vol . VIII , p. 96.  | teenth ( equal rights for white and colored ) finally proclaimed in 187o and the sixteenth ( income tax ) proclaimed in 1913 . Rutherford Birchard Hayes , nineteenth President , was destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He became the cleaner and the restorer of the nation 's conscience . His four years in office have been well ) nigh forgotten ; perhaps because of an assumption that a one-term president +p " " must have failed to retain public endorsement . Hayes , however , was the one president to advocate one term of office and adhere to that view once in power . James K. Polk had also declined renomination , but not on the grounds of general principle . Hayes was unpopular with most of the leaders in both parties , yet but for this courageous house-cleaning during four brief momentous years , the United States might well have become as corrupt as many an Old World dynasty , with as dire results . Not seeking re-election , he needed to give hostages to no man . In 1877 , the prestige of the United States government was at low ebb . After the defeat of Johnson 's efforts the worst elements in public life had had full sway . Grant , sadly incompetent as a civil administrator , headed an eightyear administration which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favoritism and peculation . Grant desired to run again , but public gratitude for his military successes had become exhausted . There was a wave of public repentance and a seeking after personal salvation . The postwar inflation , followed by depression , the cynicism in high places , homes broken through loss of loved-ones , the continued oppression of the South , made a mockery of national pride and shook the people 's confidence in their one-time glorious democracy . The people turned to soul-searching and a quest for the meaning of God . In the 187o 's came Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey in a series of religious revivals which swept through the country . R. A. Torrey , B. Fay Mills and a score of other evangelists were hardly less influential . The Protestant churches , which embraced the vast majority of the population , were crowded by converts and former backsliders who pledged themselves to lead a Christian life , every day of the week . There was no doubt of the sincerity of the movement . Worldly things had failed , military glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the social center of the community offered a way of life . Colleges and schools were founded by the score.2 The missionary movement went forward with revived impetus . And in the first office of the land the public desired a good man , good in the righteous , characterful sense . Hayes was a good man . His life story had almost a copybook rightness . He was born in 1822 in Delaware County , Ohio , the posthumous son of a farmer . An uncle provided him with an education at Kenyon College and Harvard footnote 2 Sixty universities and colleges were founded in the United States in the decade 187o1880.  | Law School . He married a childhood sweetheart in 1852 . In 186o he campaigned for Lincoln . He enlisted in the war and was wounded at South Mountain . He was in the House of Representatives in 1864 , then served two terms as governor of Ohio , 1867-1871 , and was elected governor for the third time in 1875 . In the governor 's chair he was known for his liberalism , his reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid citizen . As a young man he had joined the Sons of Temperance . His wife , Lucy Hayes , was a pillar of Temperance and of Methodism . She was also a graduate of Wesleyan Female Seminary and attended classes at Ohio Wesleyan University ( she could not enroll , as it was then a men 's college ) .3 Mr. and Mrs. Hayes were educated , substantial family people . By the time of Hayes ' nomination in 1876 , they had several children . Hayes was a churchman . Some sources refer to him as a Methodist , others as an Episcopalian , and still others say that he was not a communicant anywhere ( though he quoted from the Prayer Book in his First Inaugural ) . Since he was conspicuously a representative of the church people and their belief in moral reformation , the point is worth pursuing . Hayes did ultimately unite with the Methodist Church in Fremont , Ohio , after he had retired from the presidency . He apparently did not attach much significance to denominationalism . According to William Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raised in the Presbyterian Church and was later a regular attendant with his wife at Methodist services . During his days at Harvard Law School , he sampled various churches in Boston , writing home rather critical reports on the sermons . In Fremont ( named Lower Sandusky in the days of Hayes ' young manhood ) , where he first practiced law , he oscillated between the Episcopal and Presbyterian followings , who were apparently having a rather lively time . In October , 1847 he wrote to his mother , " Our Episcopal church has shut up shop , so I have turned coat and come out Presbyterian . I presume you will not feel dissatisfied with the change . " And then a month later he wrote to his sister , " Our Church ( the Episcopal ) goes off finely now , as the Presbyterian minister ( who was a great knave ) nearly broke down his congregation . " 8 Hayes went on to say that the vestry was made up of six of the finest men in town who were all " rowdies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officeholders in Washington were Episcopalians. footnote 3 Mary M.

" Hayes , however , continued to attend the Episcopal Church when he moved to Cincinnati until through Mrs. Hayes ' influence he became a regular attendant in the Methodist fold . In modern times this breadth of religious thought , the facility of feeling at home in various churches , is not uncommon ; but in the sectarianism of nineteenth century America it bespoke an unusual flexibility . 2 Rutherford B. Hayes was the logical candidate for the Republicans in 1876 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a clear record and the support of such notable reformers as Richard H. Dana , Carl Schurz and G. W. Curtis . Samuel J. Tilden of New York , his Democratic opponent , was also a man of merit . Each party was sensible of the popular demand for personal virtue in the White House . Tilden won the larger popular vote in the election , but its distribution was such that the vote in the electoral college was determined by which of two rival electoral groups should be seated from three of the Southern delegations . Here both Tilden and Hayes showed their stature . Tilden agreed to abide by the result , even though he knew that the Republicans could control the seating of electors . Hayes in turn obtained unchallenged endorsement of the electors in dispute by promising the Southern democrats ' that military surveillance from the North would be withdrawn . This agreement , known as " the Bargain , " was possible through a fortunate confluence of events which Hayes used to the full . The old-line Republicans , who might have preferred to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand a Tilden victory would throw them out of any federal patronage in the South or elsewhere . On the other side , they were forced to support Hayes who recognized the bargaining position of the South , and welcomed the chance to offer it ( with the commitment of his colleagues ) terms which he himself favored . Hayes in office immediately assured the country that he would be nonpartisan . " The President of the United States , " he said in his Inaugural , ... should strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best who serves the country best . ' ' Then followed a shocking recommendation , shocking to the politicos : that there be an amendment to the Constitution limiting the presidential term to six years and forbidding re-election . This was unwelcome doctrine , e from a party standpoint . It struck at the very roots of self-perpetuation . But even more alarming in the Inaugural Address were these words : " I call the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of declining a second term .  | our civil service ? a reform not merely as to certain abuses and practices of so-called official patronage which have come to have the sanction of usage in the several Departments of our Government , but a change in the system of appointment itself ; a reform that shall be thorough , radical and complete . " Hayes went to work with vigor . He divorced himself from the men who had surrounded Grant . His nominations for the Cabinet were chiefly men who had distinguished themselves in public service , without regard to party regularity . Secretary of State Evarts and Secretary of the Interior Schurz were instructed to draft rules governing appointments . Applicants seeking clerical jobs could no longer rely on political preferment , but were required to apply directly to the head of a department who would be held responsible ' for his selections . The Customs ' office patronage was exposed . In an Executive Order of May 26 , 1877 , Hayes directed that the collection of the revenues should be " on a strictly business basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He demanded that party leaders should have no more influence in appointments " than other equally respectable citizens , " and declared that government employees should not be assessed for party funds , compelled to work in party affairs , or be deprived of expressing their views on public questions " either orally or through the press . " The same spirit of reform was applied to all branches of the government , notably to the Indian Bureau which had been a scandalous pie for politicians and alert rascals . Hayes did not claim credit for the reforms . He modestly and wisely referred to the pledges of improved civil service contained in the platforms of each major party . He acted avowedly upon the recommendation of specific investigating commissions . Unquestionably he was responding to a clear mandate from the people . It would be naive , of course , to assume that Hayes forever put an end to patronage , favoritism , and recurrences of graft , that party leaders henceforth had no more influence than " equally respectable citizens . " Aided by the public wrath , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he restored the integrity of the White House to a level from which it has seldom receded . Whatever the subsequent lapses from honesty and efficiency , they no longer had " the sanction of usage . " Scandalous conditions continued to recur from time to time in state and city administrations ; but the federal government became an ideal of proper behavior . The public does not tolerate moral failures in the federal service with complacency , and serious corruption in the federal administration since Hayes ' time has been rare . For setting this tone , for frankly facing the fact of corruption in government , for cleaning it up , for enunciating principles of conduct , the good Hayes deserves his special place in the roster of the presidents . I-is influence for clean government has endured .  | In the realm of public finance , the trend of liberal thought has oscillated with the times . It is unsafe to pigeonhole a past president as liberal or conservative according to his fiscal measures . Jefferson and Coolidge were budget-balancers . A real dose of the original Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hayes like Jackson was opposed to sizable expenditures for public improvements , and he was a " hard money " man . In these respects , Hayes , like Jackson , collided with the perennial wishful-thinkers who believe that prosperity may be poured out inexhaustibly from the public till . Why not print enough money for everyone ? Hayes fought a hard persistent battle against that doctrine . During Hayes 's regime , the Greenback-Labor Party was at its peak and elected fourteen members to Congress . Its main demand was for the continued issuance of irredeemable paper money . During the Civil War the government had issued hills of credit printed in green on one side of the paper . These became known as " greenbacks " and were in circulation as currency , though they were essentially undated notes of the government , worth only as much as the market estimate of the government 's good faith . By 1865 , greenbacks had sunk to less than half their par value in terms of gold . The fiat money advocates believed that relief for the financial burdens caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the creditors in depreciated dollars , in which many of the debts had been contracted . Hayes held to the opposite course , that the only sound bottom for public and national credit was a record of meeting all obligations at their face value . In his Inaugural he urged " an early resumption of specie payments , " namely , the redemption of outstanding greenbacks in gold coin . A law , passed during Grant 's administration with his approval , already provided for the resumption effective January 1 , 1879 . Mints were working overtime in preparation for the event . The fiat money feeling was so strong in both parties , however , that a bill for repeal passed the House , though failing in the Senate . The immediate prospect of redemption in gold brought the " greenbacks " close to par by 1878 . The inflationists had yet another measure to their purpose , namely the plea for a bimetallic currency . This proposal had a strong appeal . Silver was hard money . Silver was one of America 's great resources . Plentiful mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bimetallism had the support of some leading British financial authorities . The idea was destined to persist until 1896 , and in 1878 took the form of the BlandAllison Act , which was passed over Hayes 's veto . The Act provided for the coinage of silver at a stated volume per month , and at an artificially pegged value per dollar . It fell short of the " unlimited free coinage of silver " goal  | of the extremists , but made a steady drain on the nation 's gold reserves . The law stayed in effect until 189o , when it was replaced by the Sherman silverpurchase law ; which was repealed in 1893 . The attempt to give the silver dollar a fixed value in excess of its actual value , and to make it legal payment for debts which had been contracted for at full dollar value was , in Hayes 's opinion , a fraud . " The standard of value should not be changed without the consent of both parties to the contract , " Hayes said in his veto message of February 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unflinching fidelity . There is no power to compel a nation to pay its just debts . Its credit depends upon its honor . . . The obligation of the public faith transcends all questions of profit or public advantage . Its unquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency as of the most necessary duty . . . A currency worth less than it purports to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditors , but all who are engaged in legitimate business , and none more surely than those who are dependent on their daily labor for bread . " Earlier in the Hayes administration proposals had been made to pay off United States bonds in fiat money . Hayes , here as elsewhere , opposed any effort to destroy the public credit . The result of his continuous stand for honesty in all things was to strengthen the financial stability of the government . In January , 1879 , the Treasury was able to sell government bonds in America and Europe to the amount of $14o,000,000 . It could be argued , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hayes policy may have been unwittingly unjust to the debtor classes . The restoration of the South , however , as has been suggested at the beginning of this chapter , was Hayes 's monumental achievement . Conceivably no one else could have accomplished so much in so short a time . Had Tilden , the Democrat , been declared elected , and had he attempted to free the South from military rule , the issue would have been regarded as a party measure and might have been kept alive for years . But Hayes , leader of the oppressor Republicans , made the initial moves . The Northern Democrats , dependent for future majorities on Southern support , could not object . Though Hayes 's removal of carpet-bag government at the outset was a political deal , he adhered to his principles long after there could be any personal consideration . The status of the South under Reconstruction nullified the principles of the Gettysburg address . There was no government by the people as long as a large section of the country remained under military rule . The cleavage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by slavery before the Civil War . Lincoln and Johnson had foreseen the evils that would flow from impoverishment of the South and from attempted reformation  | by force . Hayes , himself a veteran of the war , and a Northerner , held no bitterness . He had seen the evils grow and spread . In words reminiscent of Johnson , but with calmer temperament and in quieter times , he sought to restore the Republic . He had declared in his Inaugural : Let me assure my countrymen of the Southern States that it is my earnest desire to regard and promote their truest interests ? the interests of the white and of the colored people both and equally ? and to put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the distinction between North and South , to the end that we may have not merely a united North or a united South , but a united country . Shades of Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner ! These were not mere words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina on April 3 , 1877 , and on April 20 from Louisiana . The old die-hards were in a frenzy . Ben Wade , William Lloyd Garrison , James G. Blaine , Wendell Phillips , Ben Butler poured out their oratory against Hayes . Only a few notables , such as Schurz , stayed by him ; but Hayes did not need to be concerned . He asked no favors for the future . Moreover , with political despotism removed , the South staged an extraordinary educational and economic revival . Ideals , capital , energies , which had lain dormant under impractical and intolerable restrictions sprang into life . The fields were rich with harvest . The nation was one again . Yet the situation was far from being idyllic . The Negro problem remained unsolved . It had been augmented by the attempts at enforced reformation . Fear had been instilled in the Southern whites to the extent that now the accent on the future of the colored race was first on self-preservation for the whites . The resentment against the Northern carpetbaggers was even more acute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diction of the Southerners . Even the statistical improvement in the South was relative , a change from destitution to better days . The war had stripped the Confederacy of basic resources , dollars , horses , clothing , homes , the paraphernalia of existence , so that full recovery was many years hence . All this was true , the halting imperfections of re-union ; yet Hayes must be credited with laying the foundations for a spiritually united country . The significance of Hayes as a moral reformer can hardly be overemphasized . The American dream of the free life has included the implication of the good life , freedom for goodness , for self-realization in a noble worthy sense . No other nation has the motto on its coin " In God We Trust . " The test of high personal character has been required for the presidential office ; and it was the special task of Hayes to affirm that honesty of purpose and con : duct is the first requisite in government .  | Big country , big country , everything was getting big .

EDMUND BURKE In the era following the retirement of Hayes to the close of the century , America came of age . The life of most of her people had remained rural . Her contests had been political and racial , for the most part . The presidency had not been impelled to concern itself extensively either with international affairs or with modern industrialism . The United States , however , was rapidly becoming a modern state . As such , it was due to re-examine its domestic police policies over industry and to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grover Cleveland in 1895 chose to re-interpret the Monroe Doctrine in a manner destined to lead to the end of American isolationism . Monroe , encouraged by John Quincy Adams , Jefferson , Madison , and Calhoun , had declared that any extension of the European system in the Western Hemisphere would be regarded as an " unfriendly disposition " to the United States . On various subsequent occasions , the Doctrine had been invoked by Tyler , Polk , Buchanan , and Grant . The United States had stopped short of proclaiming the principle as part of international law , or of threatening to establish it by force . In Cleveland 's second term , however , Venezuela had become involved in a dispute with Great Britain over the boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana . She was unable to get attention for her claims , and appealed to the United States . Cleveland entered into diplomatic negotiations with Great Britain which were unavailing , and finally appointed an American arbitration commission . This decision to invoke arbitration in a controversy in which no territorial claims of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cleveland 's message to Congress on December 2 , 1895 , and created such a stir that the British ministry was shaken out of its previous attitude of studied indifference . The ministry found that Parliament was sympathetic to arbitration , but in its reply objected to Cleveland 's implication that the Monroe principle was an accepted part of international law . Cleveland responded in a special message to Congress of December 17 , in  | language bold and definite . He assumed that this was not a fact-finding issue per se , but an attempt by Britain to enlarge her frontier and hence her territory in the Western Hemisphere . He affirmed that the Doctrine was " essential to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government . It was intended to apply to every stage of our national life and can not become obsolete while our Republic endures . " In effect , the Western Hemisphere was the United States ' sphere of influence , and any issue therein , related to European intrusion was her concern . Cleveland reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States could not submit " supinely " to a continuance of the present situation . The war clouds seemed close at hand , but Britain agreed to a joint Commission and the affair was settled peaceably . Theodore Roosevelt amplified the Doctrine in expounding the policy of the United States , following the dispute with Colombia over the Panama Canal Zone . The Latin American republics had regarded the assumed protectorate of the United States with mixed feelings . The fact that the Republic of Panama had been encouraged by American interests to revolt against Columbia was regarded in many quarters as territorial aggression threatening the future independence of the Latin nations . Roosevelt responded to this in various official papers . In his annual message of December 5 , 1905 , he pledged that the United States would in no way use the Doctrine for aggrandizement or territorial aggression . He held that it was a source of strength which any Western Hemisphere nation might call upon , that all were guarantors of the principle and were meeting " on a basis of entire equality . " If the Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a statement of principle . In his first annual message he had said " it is simply a step . . . toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of a permanent peace on this hemisphere . " Combined with the theory of equality among nations , the concept forecasted the various league ideas which were to develop . Roosevelt by temperament and conviction , however , was an ardent nationalist . He advocated arbitration and world peace conferences , as shall be seen ; but with reservations on points involving " national honor . " It remained for President Taft to take the position that all issues might be subject to arbitration . The admission of that point was a prerequisite to the idea of a Union of Nations under whatever name . The presidency in the closing years of the nineteenth century , as at most times , stood in a moderate position . The White House view did not reflect the extremists , while mass opinion tended to be uninformed and sluggish . Probably few citizens comprehended the steps by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the  | Monroe Doctrine had become an official active principle , however , the country could not retreat from its participation in the world- scene . Meanwhile it was far more absorbed in its domestic struggles . Theodore Roosevelt , twenty-sixth president of the United States , was the first severe shock to the business circles of the modern world . In America the conduct of finance and business , with few exceptions , had been uncontrolled . There had been Populists and Greenbackers . The brilliant black-haired William Jennings Bryan , that Western troubadour , had scared the wits out of the settled classes in 1896 . All these efforts , however , had been defeated . No elected president had hitherto challenged the powers of big business , yet Theodore Roosevelt did so from the beginning . Andrew Jackson , to be sure , had fought the financiers controlling the United States Bank , but large widespread corporate enterprise had not emerged in Jackson 's era . The trust , namely a company or group of companies controlling a sizable proportion of the output in an industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible by modern machinery requiring large capital investment , by railroad transportation opening up interstate markets , and by the economies of volume production which gave the trust a socially useful stature , whatever its social liabilities might be . The trust initially won more praise than criticism from the public . It was big ; America was big , getting ever bigger , and proud of it . Here were the greatest freedom , the greatest resources , the greatest opportunities , the greatest fortunes . America , like most young countries , was a boasting country , and could point to its unequaled development under a system which knew virtually no limits to individual activity . Between Hayes 's retirement in 188o and the presidency of Roosevelt beginning in 1901 , American industry had developed as a robust phenomenon on a national scale . Hitherto each area had been served by its own group of factories and artisans . Now shoe machinery was displacing the hand cobblers , glass-blowing machinery took the place of skilled artisans . Standard Oil encompassed a host of local refineries . United States Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of which was a combination of its predecessors . A new type of industrial power thus had arisen , destined to be the chief issue in the republic for generations to come . Should industrial concentrations be broken into small units ? Taken over by the government ? Controlled ? Or wholly let alone ? Theodore Roosevelt was keenly aware of the problems posed . Industrial power was not separate from financial power , obviously the two were closely intertwined . But financial influence hitherto had been visualized as concerned with credits and securities . Finance had even appeared as hostile to industry in times of contracting credits . Industry was in the  | foreground : It visibly affected employment , prices , the rise or fall of communities . It was more tangible than finance , in many aspects beneficial , and generally hailed as an evidence of a growing and independent America . As industry grew , its alliance with finance became indispensable . The federal government since the Civil War had , as a rule , favored industry . The Republicans in particular advocated protective tariffs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against foreign competition . It was to be expected that a Republican president would favor the industrial system as it stood without interference . But Theodore Roosevelt had read some handwriting on the wall . The railroads were the first corporations in the country to grow to enormous size . They had , moreover , a clear and tangible effect on the whole life of the people . The location of their routes controlled trade . By their ratemaking powers they could foster or wither industries and industrial centers . Changes in rates , for example , could and did move the furniture-making center of the North from Indianapolis to Grand Rapids . The railroads in many instances were aided by public land grants and other public favors . Not surprisingly , they were the first objects of public control . Hayes had been succeeded by Garfield , then by Arthur , Cleveland , Harrison , Cleveland again , and McKinley . All through the period there had been a growing demand for government regulation railroad practices , with a sidelong glance toward the regulation of major corporations . The Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad operations and rates , and the Sherman Anti-Trust Law was passed in 189o . In neither case did the then current president take conspicuous leadership in the reform . Benjamin Harrison in his First Annual Message stated that in the year ending June 30 , 1888 , over two thousand railroad employees were killed in service and more than twenty thousand injured , and called upon Congress to require improvements in the construction of cars and in safety appliances ; but he did not address his attention to the fundamental economics of rail transportation . Cleveland skated close to the subject in his Inaugural Address of March 4 , 1893 , when he referred to the " immense aggregation of kindred enterprises and combination of business interests . " He observed that " to the extent that they can be reached and restrained by Federal power , the General Government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions " ; yet Cleveland was no zealous reformer . The right of the federal government to regulate business , while virtually unexercised in fact , was not new in principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in issue No. 10 of The Federalist , " A landed interest , a manufacturing interest , a mercantile interest , a moneyed interest , with many lesser interests , grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes , actuated by different sentiments and  | views . The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation , and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government . " Since the interests referred to by Madison , landed , manufacturing , etc. , had been largely local in scope during the first hundred years of the republic , they had not provoked attempts at fetleral control ; hence the earlier stages of public regulation are to be found in state laws . By the 189o 's , however , there were widespread popular clamors for economic reform . Robert M. LaFollette was fighting a strenuous battle against the monopolists in the Northwest , and his fiery career in Congress had already made him a national figure . Bryan had devoted his chief attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform also had said that " the absorption of wealth by the few , the consolidation of our leading railroad systems , and the formation of trusts and pools require a stricter control by the Federal government of those arteries of commerce . " Theodore Roosevelt was one of the most conspicuous cases of a political accident , coming to the leadership of the people via the wheel of fortune . The channeling of liberalism through that individual mind presumably accelerated the theories of government controls by some years , for the public had twice rejected Bryanism , in 1896 and in 1900 . The facts underlying his rise exemplify the unpredictable possibilities in a democratic state . Roosevelt was horn October 27 , 1858 . He was graduated from Harvard in 188o and undertook to study law . The law soon bored him . He then engaged in the writing of history , in ranching in the Dakota territory and in New York politics . As a native son of New York City , coming from a well-to-do and respected family , and not seeking any financial gain from politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the age of twentysix he was a delegate-at-large to the national convention . In 1889 he was appointed a Civil Service Commissioner under Harrison , and for six years Roosevelt and his wife studied the politics of official Washington . In 1895 he became police commissioner of New York , and in 1897 assistant secretary of the navy . From the latter post he resigned to organize a volunteer cavalry regiment in the Spanish-American war . The performance of Roosevelt and his Rough Riders in that successful conflict made Theodore Roosevelt a national hero . He became popularly known as " Teddy " and " T.R. " The Spanish affair has been dwarfed by the World Wars of later times , but in 1898 and ' 99 it seemed a glorious enterprise . The United States for the first time since 1812 had challenged a supposedly major power , and on this occasion had won an extraordinarily easy victory . The United States , also , in taking possession of the Philippine Islands had become for the first time  | an imperial nation . There were many who viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority . " T.R. " was perhaps the most conspicuous figure of the new day , and at the close of the war he was elected governor of New York . He won by only a modest majority , however , as the machine of each party regarded him with a dubious eye . Upon the renomination of President McKinley in 1900 , Roosevelt was put on the ticket as the running mate . This was against his wishes . Four years in the vice-presidency might well condemn him to obscurity , which was just what the politicians had in mind ; but the assassination of McKinley at Buffalo made Roosevelt president , and he took the oath of office on September 54 , 1901 . Like many liberal leaders Roosevelt was something of an enigma , inconjt sistent , impatient of the checks and balances of the Constitution , egotistic , yet wise enough not to yield to the temptations of dictatorship . " T.R. " was a showman , and the trappings of his act have become so dated as to obscure him , somewhat as the stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from George Washington . Roosevelt had been handicapped in childhood by asthma and defective eyesight . He had determined to overcome or to compensate for these weaknesses . He taught himself to ride , shoot and box . He became by choice an athlete and an outdoors man , consciously vigorous and aggressive . He championed " the strenuous life . " He spoke with a high clear bark . His blue eyes were alert behind the gleaming eye-glasses , and his wide smile bared his strong white teeth . He was fond of such shouted expressions as " Bully ! " and " Dee-lighted . " An observer has said of him , " he hissed his sibilants and boomed out his vowels . When , after the presidency , he would come to the Scribner offices the glass of the partitions vibrated with his voice ; his words filled every corner . " 1 This was a new tone for the White House . One of Roosevelt 's noted phrases , however , was " speak softly and carry a big stick . " In his initial message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry in deceptively mollifying terms : The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth of the country , and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase , not merely in the aggregate of wealth , but in the number of very large individual , and especially of very large corporate , fortunes . . . . The process has aroused much antagonism , a great part of which is wholly without warrant . It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer . . . There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth ; yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated by the person specially footnote 1 Roger Burlingame , Of Making Many Books .  | benefited only on condition of conferring immense incidental benefits upon others . The slightest study of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a business operation ; that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure . He denounced the agitator : " Many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great industrial combinations which are popularly , although with technical inaccuracy , known as trusts , ' appeal especially to hatred and fear . " Nevertheless , he went on to say : " There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare ... It is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be , not prohibited , but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled ; and in my judgment this conviction is right . " The big stick was now apparent . In the name of " a square deal " for the public he began on a career of government control and " trust busting " which was a new departure in the role of the presidency ; and he established firmly in popular opinion the idea of the public accountability of individual enterprises . Repeatedly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song ? large business enterprises were good for the country , great fortunes could be generally beneficent , but measures of appraisal and control were necessary . He denounced " malefactors of great wealth , " but aimed to distinguish between " good trusts " and " bad trusts . " To accomplish his purpose he succeeded in the creation of a new Cabinet Department , namely that of Commerce and Labor . Publicity he regarded as the initial remedy , affirming that the government " should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in inter-state business " and also should " assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business . " 4 The Department of Commerce and Labor was designed to accomplish that object . In it the Bureau of Corporations was supposed to gather data and publicize the workings of corporations , presumably determining which were or were not in the public interest ? In 1903 Roosevelt obtained a strengthening of the Sherman Antitrust Law in terms which also made the Interstate Commerce Act more effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U. S.

On footnote z The Bureau of Corporations was succeeded by the Federal Trade Commission .  | July 1 , 1905 , five corporations and seventeen individuals in the meat-packing industry were indicted for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Law , later pleaded guilty , and were fined . The radicals complained that fines were an inadequate deterrent . The breaking-up of certain trusts did not wholly do away with friendly understandings which continued the effects of monopoly ; but , compared with an atmosphere of earlier times which had been free from official criticism or restraint of business , the change was vast . The fact that two such huge corporations as the Great Northern and Northern Pacific could be stopped against their will from carrying out a proposed commercial agreement was a landmark in social policy . " T.R. " of course was denounced as a traitor to his class . The charge was inaccurate . He was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He even had the effrontery to characterize critics of corporations , other than himself , as " muckrakers . " His personal life at the White House was elegant compared to his predecessors . The White House coachmen in his regime wore livery and cockades , reminiscent of the formal days of the Federalists . " T.R. 's " interests were catholic . He entertained prize fighters , royalty , editors , writers , historians , economists , with a zealous enthusiasm not evident in the White House since the days of Jackson or equaled subsequently until the days of the second Roosevelt ; but he did not seek the society of commoners for commonalty 's sake . He was too extreme an individualist to have authentically the common touch . As in the case of Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase , one of the most notable and lasting of " T.R. 's " contributions to the nation was the building of the Panama Canal . Like Jefferson he stretched his powers uncomfortably far in order to achieve a quick result . The idea of a canal connecting the Atlantic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1846 the United States had officially claimed that its interest required the right to maintain and to police traffic across the Isthmus of Panama . The government had entered into a treaty to that effect with New Granada , the name of the country which then occupied the isthmus . The United States had repeatedly reaffirmed its position with successive governments in that area and from time to time had landed troops to maintain order . The first canal route had been surveyed by H. de la Soma in 1527 , who explored the area for Charles V of Spain . Spanish and English interests had considered the project and a French company actually undertook the work in 1881 , but went bankrupt . For some years the United States had been  | negotiating with Great Britain on the subject and Roosevelt 's secretary of state had concluded the Hay-Herran treaty which gave the United States a free hand . Congress then passed a bill which enabled the president to make a treaty with Colombia , or if that failed to undertake a canal through Nicaragua . Colombia was at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombian delegates signed an agreement which gave their country $25,000,000 in cash and other favorable terms . To the surprise of Roosevelt and the United States , the Colombian Congress rejected the treaty . Roosevelt and many others in the United States and Latin America suspected that the Colombian government , aiming to improve its bargain , made no serious effort to obtain ratification . Either a long indeterminate period of argument with Colombia , or a transfer to the Nicaraguan route , seemed indicated . Another possibility was that the citizens of Panama , who were frequently in revolution , might revolt again , throw off the rule of Colombia and make a treaty with the United States . This potentiality was enhanced by the fact that the Colombian soldiers on the isthmus had not received any pay from their government for some months . Roosevelt was infuriated at what he regarded as the duplicity of the Colombian negotiators , and at seeing a great accomplishment apparently snatched from his grasp . Officially , he was powerless to move to set up a revolutionary government . The new Panama Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for building the canal , was able to foment the idea , and Roosevelt dispatched Navy ships to the isthmus ostensibly to preserve order . Panama seceded November 31 , 1903 , without a shot being fired . The United States promptly recognized the new government , and Roosevelt officially advised Colombia of the fact . A storm of comment ensued . By what right did the President treat with Panama even if the revolution were bona fide ? In his Third Annual Message to Congress which followed shortly , on December 7 , 1903 the President defended his action in these words : When the Congress directed that we should take the Panama route under treaty with Colombia , the essence of the condition , of course , referred not to the Government which controlled that route , but to the route itself ; to the territory across which the route lay , not to the name which for the moment the territory bore on the map . The purpose of the law was to authorize the President to make a treaty with the power in actual control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The logic may seem a little specious ; yet , as a new government was in control on the Isthmus , the canal could now go forward . Congress , if it denied Roosevelt 's interpretation of its language , would be faced with re-  | pudiating the agreement with Panama , possibly returning Panama to the role of Colombia and with opening negotiations with Nicaragua . The building of the canal was permitted to continue . Politicians , some historians , and certain of the opposition press have aimed to present this event as a robbery of Colombia by " T.R. , " and as undertaken under secret circumstances of which the Congress had no knowledge . The latter point certainly can not be supported . The records in the case were immediately demanded by Congress , were received , and were accompanied by a special message of the President giving complete details . Elaborate research by the opposition , at the time and subsequently , has produced nothing to impugn the truth of the President 's report . In Harding 's administration the Senate ratified a treaty with Colombia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid Colombia , though without the apology which Wilson had favored . The act may have been politically advisable as a matter of relations with Latin America ; but the history of the canal area and its record of revolutions give plausible support to the President 's position ; yet " I took the Canal zone and let Congress debate , " Roosevelt is quoted as saying in a New York Times report , March 24 , 1911 . Almost the identical words were used in the report of the address as carried in the University of California Chronicle . Apparently Roosevelt wanted to have it both ways : bold and daring , yet legal and proper . It was difficult at times to determine what were Roosevelt 's real views . The President had a politically convenient code of ethics . He did not hesitate to speak on any and all subjects , and if he made a blunder he was quick to call the person quoting him a liar . Soon many notables were members of his " Ananias Club . " He chose to regard his statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing said by him should be regarded as an accurate quotation unless subsequently authorized by him . He inevitably made many mistakes of which possibly the most serious was being constantly misled by Japan , encouraging her invasion of Korea and Manchuria and fostering her ambitions to become a major power in the Russo-Japanese War . Roosevelt 's qualified views on internationalism have already been noted , yet he looked toward The Hague as the hope for an enduring world peace . A meeting of delegates from all major nations , to encourage arbitration as a substitute for war had been called at The Hague in the Netherlands , in 1899 by the Tsar of Russia . This occasion , known as the First Hague Conference , was the first effort in modern times to establish a unity among nations . This initial meeting did establish a so-called " Permanent Court of Arbitration . " The initial court and its successors became familiarly known as The  | Hague Tribunal . The Hague Tribunal , in its time , was the outstanding symbol of international peace and co-operation . The First Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible arbitrators from which contending states might select judges for the purposes of arbitration if they so chose . Literally , the panel was neither a court nor permanent , but it was a practical beginning since twenty-one arbitrations were held under it . Roosevelt used his influence repeatedly to strengthen the Tribunal . In 1904 , he addressed ? circular note to the powers reminding them that a Second Conference had been agreed to on the first occasion . As a result , the Second Hague Conference was held in 1907 where the American delegation sought for the establishment of a World Court , with paid judges who would devote their entire time to the rendering of decisions in international law . They were to be paid by an international fund and sit in regularly scheduled terms . Though the proposal was not adopted , the influence of The Hague Tribunal was enhanced by the continuing discussions , and Roosevelt gave it still further prestige by persuading a number of the powers who had certain grievances against Venezuela to accept the judgment of a court chosen from The Hague panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accepted by all parties thereto , accelerated arbitration treaties between states and gave further impetus to the idea of unity among nations . One of " T.R. 's " most lasting accomplishments which has become less emphasized with the passage of time was the enlargement of the public forestry , park , and other preserves . Under his administration millions of square miles were added to the public lands , an inestimable benefit to the future . He established a Public Lands Commission in 1903 , appointed civilian experts , turned the spotlight on the theme of natural resources , and named a Conservation Commission . Theodore Roosevelt 's years following his presidency need not concern us here where his impress on the office is the matter in hand . More than most presidents he had captured the popular imagination and had made the /presidency an instrument of positive policy . To the extent that a liberal tradition - implies change , " T.R. " was a shining example . Whatever he touched changed . The Monroe Doctrine , peace organizations , controls over industry , forest preserves , were changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors , his example established a new modern pattern , giving impetus to continued reform .  | Wilson was the first president to head a nation of forty-eight states . Oklahoma had come in in 1907 . New Mexico and Arizona in 1912 . All of the far western area had been included in the Union by 1896 . There was a feeling of completeness and maturity . Not quite the " era of good feeling " of Monroe 's time , yet a sense of confident progress untinged by desperate necessity , or harsh conflict . Socialists were politely received . One of them was a vice-president of the New York Life Insurance Company . Another became mayor of Berkeley , California . A third , inheritor of copper wealth , married a Jewish settlement worker . The social settlement movement flourished . Hull House in Chicago , South End House , Denison House , et al in Boston ; Greenwich House , the University Settlement , Cristadora House , Hudson Guild , the Henry Street Settlement , the Neighborhood House , in New York ; all were working to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , job training , slum clearance , health . Columbia had its Beard , Kirchwey , Woodberry , Seligman , J. H. Robinson ; Harvard its William James , Muensterberg , Santayana ; Wisconsin its Ely , Commons ( later at Columbia ) , and E. A. Ross ; no omissions are intentional . Many universities and colleges testified to a new intellectual ferment . In literature , Dreiser , Frank Norris , Kathleen Norris , Upton Sinclair , Willa Cather , Edith Wharton and Ellen Glasgow , to name but a few , developed the novel as a reflection of contemporary realistic life . A new generation of journalists , Ida Tarbell , Ray Stannard Baker , Charles Edward Russell , David Graham Phillips , cried havoc . Wilson was by no means the sole political apostle of enlightenment , but he was the one who was elected to the chief office ; and his role seemed relatively easy . No more war . The wicked and greedy were being exposed , and the remedies were recognized and ready to be applied . The mood was almost millennial , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost perfect State . "  | The New Freedom Freedom today is something more than being let alone . WOODROW WILSON , The New Freedom The rise of Woodrow Wilson and the pattern of his liberalism are significant examples of the interaction of events and personality in their influence on the presidency . Wilson , in his own eyes and in those of his times , was an ardent liberal , but he was poles apart from the Socialists , and from statism , and he had little of the vocal emotionalism of Theodore Roosevelt . He was the spiritual heir of citizen Thomaslefferson as a philosopher of the rights of man ; yet he was less flexible than erson. , and far more the instinctive administrator . Born of Scotch Irish stock on December 28 , 1856 , in Staunton , Virginia , the son of a Presbyterian minister , Wilson had in him more of the stubborn Scot than of the ease of the Old Dominion . He early had ambitions for political life and to this end studied for the law at the University of Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into politics , he turned to teaching , in which he was an extraordinary success . By the age of thirty-four he had become president of Princeton University and had written a number of historical works primarily on constitutional government . The sch000lmaster role was natural to him , as by temperament he was scholarly and didactic , and he was the only full-time university professor to occupy the White House . Lantern-jawed , confident of his superior intellectual powers , and having a gift for what he called " public utterance , " he was accustomed to bend others to his will . His determination was increased by a conscience at peace with itself , and the conviction that what he advocated was for the good of those affected . That Wilson was one of the greatest men in American history is unquestionable , even though his inflexibility proved to be his personal tragedy and robbed him of a still larger place in history . His accession to the presidency , as in the case of Jefferson , seems the work of Providence , as each man arrived in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratize the undergraduate life by limiting the social groups and advocating the quadrangle system of dormitories in which the students were compelled to reside . The uproar which this caused brought him to the attention of New Jersey politicians at  | a time when the Democrats needed a well-known and respectable candidate for the governorship . Wilson was elected , and forthwith embarked upon a number of reforms restraining the privileges of corporations . That in turn made him available as a possible nominee as the Democratic candidate for the presidency . Champ Clark of Missouri came to the convention with the greatest number of pledged votes ; but William Jennings Bryan , still the most influential member of the party , insisted on a candidate who would specifically reject the support of the Tammany Hall Democratic organization in New York . Wilson 's advisers urged him not to take that risk ; but in this instance his uncompromising temperament was justified and Wilson unequivocally declined the Tammany endorsement . Bryan swung his support to the Jersey governor and he was nominated . That was the next to final step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . The other vital factor was the split in the Republican ranks . Theodore Roosevelt had become embittered against his successor Taft . Taft , although easy-going and conservative by temperament , had in fact continued most of the Roosevelt policies . Taft had had a liberal record as a judge . He had championed international arbitration , and the League to Enforce Peace . He had effectuated a treaty with Canada , which virtually provided for free trade between the two countries . The Parcels Post Act and the Postal Savings Bank Act were passed with his support ; but temperamentally he was not attuned to the liberal element , and still less did he like being regarded as Roosevelt 's rubber stamp . " T.R. " had spent some time hunting in Africa following his retirement , and upon his return he reached an open break with his successor . At the Republican convention , both Taft and Roosevelt were candidates . When the latter was defeated he formed the Progressive Party . Had a World War not followed the campaign of 1912 within a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some degree of social reform was inevitable , but the public was not zealous for national controls . The nation was living in an age of innocence . There had been no major war since the Franco-Prussian conflict of 1870 . Norman Angell of England had written The Great Illusion which seemed to prove that another war was impossible because both the financial interests and commonsense of an enlightened world would not permit it . Any war of major proportions would be far more costly than any benefits which could be achieved by it . Americans further were convinced that they lived in a Promised Land which nothing could disturb . The wave of reform , which had begun in 1896 had been lulled during the McKinley years and had been resumed during the T. Roosevelt era , was essentially a clamor for honesty in business and in public affairs . The muckrakers , beginning in the early ' goo 's , had kept up their drumfire of at-  | tack on big business and corrupt politicians . Ray Stannard Baker , Ida Tarbell and others who had written their sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new American Magazine in 1906 and were continuing their exposes . The country , however , was intrinsically prosperous . It did not seek change , but rather the curtailment of the exploiters and the preservation of individual opportunity . A small minority , primarily Socialists , championed old age pensions and other forms of security , but in the main , especially outside of the large cities , the average citizen could be assured of making a living and being taken care of through his own efforts and savings from the cradle to the grave . The Wilson campaign , therefore , was not a contest between a liberal government and " the interests . " True , the more conservative groups rallied around Taft , but Roosevelt 's following was as liberal as Wilson 's and in many instances more radical . When the votes were counted it was found that Wilson was the leading candidate , yet with a minority of the total vote . He had something over 6,000,000 votes , to around 4,500,000 for Roosevelt , 3,400,000 for Taft and 900,000 for Eugene V. Debs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Debs and Wilson ( which however included the solid South ) represented a substantial liberal victory . Wilson immediately revealed the nature of his mind as a national leader . First of all , for the first time since Jefferson 's initial and sole attempt , the President personally addressed both Houses of Congress in his inaugural speech . By this action , he aimed to emphasize the need for a closer tie between the legislative and executive branches , with the intent to enhance the prestige of the latter . He carried trust-busting a step further than " T.R. " by advocating various government controls of industry , a reduction of the tariff and a reform of the banking laws . The address was hardly a surprise , since it reaffirmed the principles he had advocated in " The New Freedom , " as his collated campaign addresses were called . The message indicated the consistency of his intentions , and that he had no thought of compromising upon coming to office . Its forthrightness rallied about him liberal support from all parties . While Wilson 's immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The New Freedom " proclaimed that there had been a basic change in American society . " We are in the presence of a new organization of society . . . The life of America is not the life that it was twenty years ago . . . We have changed our economic conditions absolutely from top to bottom . . . We are facing the necessity of fitting a new social organization ... to the happiness and prosperity of the great body of citizens . " 1 Again , where T. Roosevelt had seen merit in large scale business if ethically conducted , Wilson inveighed against the intrinsic power of size . " Do n't de1 Woodrow Wilson , The New Freedom , edited by William Bayard Hale , pp. 3 , 4 ?  | ceive yourselves for a moment as to the power of the great interests which now dominate our development . They are so great that it is almost an open question whether the Government of the United States can dominate them or not . " 2 As an historian , he knew better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he specifically rejected that approach , saying , " Freedom today is something more than being let alone . The program of a government of freedom must in these days be positive , not negative merely . " 3 His avowed program of lower tariff workmen 's compensation , the right of labor to organize , shorter hours , and the like was simil : . at , . of earlier reformers His moor domestic ideal , however , was to beak uo large business units into small enterprises ? He recalled , as stated in " The New Freedom , " small manufacturing towns in Indiana and elsewhere where production was carried on by relatively small units , worker , owner , and manager being neighbors and often overlapping in their functions . Later sociologists have demonstrated that the small factory was seldom ideal from the average worker 's standpoint , except that the benchman of exceptional ability had greater opportunity to rise . The employer of small industry offered no other special advantages to the hands . Hours and security benefits were often inferior to those in larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories was , in fact , deplorable . The chance to quit , rise , and compete , was the chief redeeming note . To the small business men , both owners and managers , Wilson 's advocacy of smallness had strong appeal . The multiplicity of small enterprises spelled a multiplicity of executive posts , more opportunities to be " the boss , " a wider range of independence for thousands on the managerial tier . Tkte charionin of small enter.rise was an ate ro.riate . os ' ' .. . 1- of the Democratic ar y whose economic strength was derived from such sources . There is no evidence that Wilson took this position as a matter of political astuteness . He did not make the time , the times made him . Because he was a philosopher of the moderate-income classes , neither Tory nor Laborite , he was the leader of that day . An English critic of the day referred to the United States as a nation of villagers and shopkeepers , a description which many Americans welcomed with nostalgia . Wilson hoped that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small industry has persisted ; but neither he nor any of his successors have reversed the trend toward consolidation . Wilson tackled easier , special problems first and before he could move on to his supposedly major objective of decentralization , a world war had raised new issues of pressing importance . footnote 2lbid. , p. 285. 3Ibid. , p. 284.  | During Wilson 's first two years in office he met with almost no opposition . A tariff-for-revenue-only had long been a slogan of the Democratic Party . High protective tariffs had encouraged the development of infant industries in the United States ; but the now dominant agricultural South and West desired lower prices for industrial products and a freer foreign trade for their markets . Cattle growers sought protection against Argentine beef ; but in the main the rural interests favored a low tariff on manufactures . Within hardly more than six months after Wilson 's inaugural , the Underwood tariff was passed in October 1913 , not as drastic as the free-traders would have liked , but carrying substantial reductions . The federal income tax was enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years . The income tax became a means for reaching at last the pockets of large personal fortunes and achieved in part Wilson 's desire to limit wealth and power . In December 1913 , Wilson accomplished the passing of the Federal Reserve Act . This was a long overdue improvement on Van Buren 's project of an independent Treasury . The central United States Treasury served the business of the federal government , but it left the chief financing of the national economy in private hands . The new system served to co-ordinate the financial needs and policies of the government with the private banking facilities of the nation , under the general direction of the Federal Reserve Board . Under the Federal Reserve System , the country was divided into twelve districts , each with its Federal Reserve Bank , each supposed to take care of the financial needs of its area . This step in its time was regarded virtually as the economic millennium . It was believed that elasticity in the Federal Reserve System would prevent future panics and depressions , a dream from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One further curb on special privilege which Wilson established was the 4 creation of the Federal Trade Commission which was empowered to investigate and denounce a wide range of unfair practices including monopoly , unfair advertising , misrepresentation of products , and the like . It was the successor to Theodore Roosevelt 's Bureau of Corporations , but had more teeth . This and other measures , however , were not contemplated to effect any change in the nation 's general social structure , but to protect the small business man and the individual against exploiters . At the outset Wilson had been faced with a critical labor situation . In April , 1913 , there had been a strike at the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . The two sides had been unable to reach a settlement and a state of civil war had followed . Wilson dispatched two thousand troops to keep order , the strike had been broken and a substantial part of the labor element had be-  | come ' critical of the President . In other respects , however , labor leaders received a notable boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which specifically exempted labor unions from prosecution under the anti-trust legislation which prohibited other types of combinations . By the time Wilson had achieved these two years of legislation , which were not due to him alone but were the culmination of a long period of reform , his popularity began to wane . For the many evils that had been so strenuously expounded before the public , there were now a multitude of corrective laws . The cup of progress was filling up . Moreover , the public was beginning to tire of the same old story . It was significant that the liberal American Magazine began to fall into a decline , until the business manager in 1914 said : " Let me edit the magazine . I know what the people want and you fellows do n't . " He turned it into a " success magazine , " glorifying accomplishment rather than criticism , and its circulation increased enormously . Moreover , the change in the tariff schedules had affected numerous industries adversely by early 1914 . Business and employment declined , and the prestige of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of innocence was a confidence in the complete efficacy of moral suasion regardless of physical force . Pacifists said glibly that economic blockades would suffice to curb recalcitrant nations . ( They failed to turn back to Jefferson 's unhappy experience on that score . ) Bryan , appointed secretary of state , had drawn up a host of treaties between nations which were accepted as additional guarantees of peace . To prevent hasty or surprise attacks , " cooling-off periods " were agreed to in ' the Bryan treaties . All of these steps were commendable and idealistic efforts to find peaceful solutions for international differences ; and no one seemed to conceive the possibility that some nations might choose not to abide by the rules . Teddy Roosevelt had said : " Speak softly , but carry a big stick , " but the new method was to speak loudly and carry a little stick . The United States traditionally had had a small standing Army , and wanted no other policy . On the other hand , tradition had favored a sizable Navy to protect our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the administration and the public desired a reduction in naval establishments . As long as national policy , as it had been until the Spanish War in ' 98 , was to keep out of affairs beyond the Western Hemisphere , a nonmilitary procedure was logical . A nonimperialistic policy was in keeping with the American temperament , with the American devotion to individual freedom , with the American dislike of regimentation by the military or otherwise . Therefore , when Wilson began to extend his zeal for reform beyond our own shores , he was armed only with the sword of " public utterance " and the breastplate of moral suasion . The country was entirely unprepared in  | materials , trained man-power , or intention to back up any presidential ukases . Wilson may have suffered delusions of grandeur from the ease with which he had steered the ship of state into more liberal seas , for there he was running with the tide . He did a skillful job of piloting . He avoided rocks and eddies that might have ruined a duller captain , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectuating the popular will rather than forming it . Wilson 's contribution to statecraft on the domestic front was not in rousing or liberating the people , but in translating their desires into practical instruments of government . The times needed his intellect , his working knowledge of history and political procedures , his determined clarity ; and he did the job . Most of the new measures of government adopted under his regime , such as the Federal Reserve System , remain substantially unaltered to this day . But the ease of the success led him to an almost naive self-confidence in foreign affairs . When Huerta captured the presidency of Mexico by murder of his predecessor in 1913 , Wilson refused to recognize the new regime even though most other foreign powers had done so . Moreover , he read that country a lecture stating that the United States would never recognize a government which came to power by unconstitutional means . In Mexico a forcible accession to power had been virtually standard practice . Wilson 's decision to pass upon the constitutionality of foreign regimes was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by moral suasion proved ineffective . Some American sailors were arrested by the Mexican authorities at Tampico . Wilson demanded an apology from the Huerta government , which was refused . Another incident occurred at Vera Cruz , and Wilson dispatched some gunboats to that harbor , but only as a gesture . Mexico was not intimidated and the United States stood appalled at the President 's procedure in getting the country involved . The President said , " I do not see what other course was open to us or how we could have avoided taking such steps as we have taken . The next move is for Huerta . It depends upon him how far this thing shall go . I sincerely pray God it may not have to go to the length of definite war . " 4 Fortunately for him , Argentina and Brazil and Chile on April 25 , 1914 , offered to mediate the affair and Wilson was able momentarily to save face . Mexico , having discovered that Wilson did n't wish to fight and that the country was not prepared to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course by Germany , as the facts later developed . Wilson , jeered at by political opponents at home as well as by Huerta and the bandit leader Villa , had to take the stand that there was such a thing as being " too proud to fight . " At length , in the spring of 1916 when Villa made a raid across the Texas border , Wilson dispatched the army on a " puni- footnote 4 R. S. Baker , Life , vol . IV , p , 332 ,  | tive expedition " into Mexico , and called the National Guard into service . In foreign affairs , Wilson 's policy of moral suasion had thus far proved a complete failure . Meanwhile a far more serious crisis had shaken the world . In August 1914 , Germany had marched into Belgium , disregarding its guarantee of the neutrality of that country as a " military necessity " and calling its treaty a " scrap of paper . " To most of the United States west of the eastern seaboard , the war in Europe seemed none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial outbreak , the war news was not even on the front pages of the inland newspapers . Even when Germany began its submarine warfare and the British liner , Lusitania , was sunk on May 7 , 1915 , with many Americans on board , the chief clamor came from the states on the North Atlantic coast . Wars had come and gone in Europe , balances of power had shifted often in the century and a half of the existence of the United States . The nation had remained aloof , holding to its traditional policy of non-involvement in European affairs . This time there was the important emotional difference that the security of England was threatened .. While twisting the lion 's tail always had been a favorite American sport , the ties between the two nations had been close , because of similarity in language , the preponderance of English descendants in the United States , and the mutual economics and defense interests of the two countries . Also there was similarity of laws and customs . As long as England remained strong , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-aggressive policy toward us , America had nothing to fear from Europe . The cause of the Allies was further helped in the United States by the fact that France had helped America during her Revolution . Those sentimental and friendly ties had continued . Nevertheless , during the first year or more of war on the Continent , only a minority of sentiment in the United States favored the nation being drawn into the war .  | A War for Democracy An evident principle runs through the whole program I have outlined . It is the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities , and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another , whether they be strong or weak . WOODROW WILSON , Address to Congress on the Fourteen Points When Germany began sinking without warning any vessel found in Allied waters , or on sea lanes supplying the Allies , Wilson rebuked her in a series of firm messages . He outlined principles of international law as he conceived them , and stated how far Germany could or could not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfriendly act . " While there was in these messages until the very end of the series , no threat of war , they were sharp and corrective in their tone . It was historically useful for Wilson to have tried to discipline Germany by moral force before actually going to war . Had the method worked it might have been a cornerstone of international peace . Indeed , the notes were heeded for a time . The chance of Germany being influenced by Wilson 's persuasions at this point were small . Her case was too desperate . Adherence to the international code would have rendered the submarine useless , but seemingly it was Germany 's best chance for a victorious issue . The danger of Wilson 's procedure was that on his own initiative he was departing from the traditional isolation policy of the country and if he failed his very contribution brought the United States nearer to the conflict . Had his messages to Germany been stalling for time to educate the opinion of the United States and get prepared for war , his procedure might be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and letters indicate , however , that he thought he could make Germany recede , and that he could exert the moral force of the United States without any physical involvement . Right in the midst of this issue , in 1956 , came the national presidential elections . The Progressive Party of " T.R. " had faded from the political scene . The Republicans ran Charles Evans Hughes , who retired from the chief justiceship of the Supreme bench to enter the race . Hughes was a man of vigor and probity , formerly governor of New York , and famous for his prosecution and reform of major insurance companies . He had several weaknesses as a candidate , however . He had been on the  | bench and out of politics for so long that he had lost his touch . Furthermore , he had a full beard in a smooth-faced era . Grant , Garfield , Hayes and Benjamin Harrison had been possessors of handsome facial hair without suffering any political liability thereby ; but by 1916 the public beard was obsolete , limited chiefly to kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long with " the best people . " His special campaign train which toured the Far West included a committee of ladies from New York 's upper social strata , a bad political faux pas which cost many votes . With all the advantages of office and of a bungling opposition , Wilson nevertheless had a close call . The Democrats ' campaign slogan was : " He kept us out of war , " and for that he had the passionate support of wide areas of the country , though his strength in the East had sharply dwindled . A sizable public opinion along the Atlantic seaboard held that the United States should be in the war , or could not avoid being in it , and that the country should be led by a man who believed in that policy . Conversely , many of those who wished America to stay out of the conflict believed that Wilson 's procedure was bringing the country rapidly nearer the brink and that a prudent statesman like Hughes had the best chance to extricate the country from its situation . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hughes that for twenty-four hours he was thought to be elected , but the South and West supported Wilson solidly and California 's vote assured him of re-election by a small margin . Wilson had barely been inaugurated for the second time when Germany began a new series of overt acts which led Wilson in 1917 to ask the Congress for a declaration of war , which was promptly voted . From that time on until the beginnings of peace , Wilson 's administration added nothing to the liberal tradition of the White House . In the name of national security , critics of the administration were jailed , including Eugene V. Debs , the mild and naive leader of the Socialist Party . Hundreds of citizens were prosecuted for real and alleged subversive acts . The Selective Service Law was passed ( realistically known as the Draft Act ) , and an American expeditionary force landed on European soil . America had entered an entirely new era in her history . Cleveland , Theodore Roosevelt and Taft- had comprehended the need for international law , but the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war years continued , Wilson 's momRnla increased , or at the least , he evidenced less self-control . As commander-in-chief , with civil restraints removed , his normal impatience toward opposition or even advice wall 's , longer thwarted . The public interest , in fact , had been channeled into the one thought of winning the war . Liberalism had been less repudiated than forgotten . In the fall of 1918 , Wilson tolled the bell by requesting that everyone as a patriotic duty should vote for Democratic candidates .  | The country , already bewildered by the change which had shaken its hitherto comfortable and near utopian world , was deeply shocked and resentful . It rejected the advice of the President and Wilson found himself for the first time lacking a majority in the Congress . His attitude now revealed his tragic nature . It is to no ur ose to wish that he had been otherwise , for he was not otherwise . Imbued with his sense of destiny and rightness , he learned nothing from his repudiation at the polls . In his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take , and he desired as colleagues on l those who would agree . Before the ultimate victory of the Allies became apparent , though not before the toll of war was becoming intolerable to both sides , the President issued his Fourteen Points which he offered as the terms on which Germany could make an honorable surrender . They were general in their terms and intrinsically were never repudiated . The German Foreign Office wished to ask for more specific definition , but the German headquarters ' staff soon advised its government that the Points should be accepted , for the internal economy of Germany and hence her military power were approaching exhaustion . The points as presented by Wilson to Congress on January 8 , 1918 , were : I. Open covenants of peace , openly arrived at , ' after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view . II . Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas , outside territorial waters , alike in peace and in war , except as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international action for the enforcement of international covenants . III . The removal , so far as possible , of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance . IV . Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety . V. A free , open-minded , and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims , based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined . VI . The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a welcome , assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire . The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test footnote 1 Italics by the author , to highlight the principles stated ; but note that on several points there are scuttling qualifications .  | of their good will , of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests , and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy . VII . Belgium , the whole world will agree , must be evacuated and restored , without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations . No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another . Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired . VIII . All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored , and the wrong done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years , should be righted , in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all . IX . A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality . X. The peoples of Austria-Hungary , whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured , should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development . XI . Rumania , Serbia , and Montenegro should be evacuated ; occupied territories restored ; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea ; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality ; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into . XII . The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty , but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees . XIII . An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations , which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea , and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant . XIV . A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike . The President after stating , and making certain comments on , the Points , then said : We have no jealousy of German greatness , and there is nothing in this program that impairs it . We grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very bright and very enviable . We do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power . We do not wish to fight her either with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing . We wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world , ? the new world in which we now live ? instead of a place of mastery .  | It will be recalled that in the spring of 1918 , the Allies faced dark days , but the tide turned rapidly in the summer . The Allies accepted the Fourteen Points on November 5 , 1918 . Meanwhile , the Germans overthrew the Hohenzollern dynasty and , as stated , had accepted Wilson 's proposals as the basis for peace . Among Wilson 's Fourteen Points , his chief one and his great contribution was the last ? the League of Nations . The idea was not original with him , to be sure ; it was centuries old . Greece , Rome , the Holy Alliance , the formation of many of the modern nations including the United States and the British Empire had been coalitions of hitherto rival states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which national rivalries had proved to be well-nigh suicidal . Wilson determined to effectuate the idea and to do it in person . He decided to attend the peace conference . That move was the first of a series of glaring errors . Wilson at home still enjoyed a vast personal popularity . Abroad , he was regarded as a Messiah . The Allies realized that the troops and the finances of America were the margin that had made victory possible . The vanquished saw some . measure of hope in the Fourteen Points . At the least here was a victor who brought the semblance of an olive branch , rather than breathing vengeance . Had Wilson not tried to play the politician with such adepts as Clemenceau and Lloyd George , the French and British leaders , he might have remained at home as an Olympian critic stating what would or would not be acceptable to him . More deplorable , his policy refused American leadership in the causeto anyone other than Woodrow Wilson . The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate ultimately would have the responsibility of passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate had the power t , Q accept or reject the treaty . Wilson appointed none of the committee and no senator on the American peace mission which accompanied him . He had experts andM technicians of great ability who commanded public respect , but no Democrat or Republican who was important in the political sense . The peace negotiations began in January , 1919 , at Paris , and by the end of April , a committee of fifteen headed by Wilson , presented to the Peace Conference the Covenant of the League of Nations , which was adopted . To secure its adoption he had been obliged to accept definitions of his Fourteen Points which had seriously crippled their intent . But he had his League . The Covenant provided for a council holding the primary power and for an assembly which was largely advisory . The council was to consist of the United States , Great Britain , France , Italy , Japan and four additional powers to be chosen by the assembly . Thirty-two nations soon joined the League ,  | and fifty-five ultimately were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Geneva , Switzerland . Whatever faults the League might have had in detail , it was by far the greatest step toward international harmony in the history of the world . It was assumed by Wilson and by most people abroad and at home that the United States would be one of the first and most influential members of the League . The problems which would confront the League would be numerous and would come promptly , beginning with the redrawing of the map of Europe and the setting up of new nationalities which had been provided for in the peace treaty . Wilson was no longer convinced of the sufficiency of public utterance and moral suasion , and dear to his heart was Article Ten of the Covenant which provided for an international police force composed of soldiery from the leading powers , to enforce , if necessary , the League 's determinations . The President presented the treaty , including the League Covenant , to the United States Senate in July , 1919 , saying in effect : " This is it . " To his apparent surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had offended an . 1. aLdonen.athuzg , z iliate the critical elements . He seemed to have forgotte . that America for 159 , years had hued under a policy of international Isolation , , which the public be ieved had been established by President Washington as a fundamental prin- ci , ple forwthe nations welfare . The public had endured two years of intensive regimentation . It had submitted to the draft act , and had seen more than two million of its sons shipped to foreign soil . Wilson , further , had delayed recognizing the Kerensky liberal government in Russia and thus contributed to Kerensky 's fall and the advent of the Communists ; and he had shipped American troops to Archangel , Russia , for purposes which were not explained . There was more than a little fear that Wilsony s , , becoming a iaive if innocent , tool 9f , Lurope 's power politics . These conditions made fertile soil for critics of the League . Henry Cabot Lodge , senior senator from Massachusetts , seized upon Article Ten as an obnoxious feature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Other clauses were attacked . It was inevitable that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate , acting within its prerogatives , and hitherto almost insultingly ignored , should wish to introduce some face-saving qualifications ; but Wilson would have none of it . He was a tired man , and ill . He had suffered an attack of influenza in Paris from which he had not fully recovered . Opposition , never welcome to him , was now well-nigh unbearable . Instead of trying to conciliate the Senate , he determined to stump the country in a campaign of speeches in different cities to appeal to the mass of the people ; footnote 2 Except for the Monroe Doctrine and a sortie against the Barbary pirates , and the war with Spain .  | but in an address , at Pueblo , Colorado , on September 25 , 1919 , he suffered a , nervous breakdown and was brought back to Washington . There , stricken with paralysis , he refused to relinquish the reins of office . Robert Lansing , Secretary of State , because of the prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desired to carry on the government . Wilson resented Lansing 's intervention and dismissed him . The President became inaccessible not only to party leaders , but even to Colonel E. M. House who had been his unofficial adviser for many years . Wilson remained alive until February 3 , 1924 , but after his collapse in September , 1919 , he took no active part in public life . The Senate , after nine months ' wrangle , failed to adopt the League in a vote in November , 1919 . A second vote was held in January , 1920 , when a majority was mustered , but not the necessary two-thirds . Thus Wilson 's great dream came to a pitiful end , not to be revived until a quarter-century later .  | The mass of the population in cities were no longer hewers of wood and drawers of water , as long as they had the wherewithal . They turned the faucet and the water flowed . Central heating in their apartments or houses kept them warm . Fuel was brought to the door in trucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was electric light ; as long as they could pay the bill . The post-Wilson decade brought the greatest material advance for the common man that America had seen to date , in both labor- and mind-saving devices . The 1920 ? 1930 era marked the great rise of the motor car , the automatic refrigerator , the washing machine , modern lighting , and home tenantry . Freedom from muscular labor and financial responsibility had reached a new apogee . In the mental field motion pictures and phonographs provided mass entertainment at lower cost than had been available through stage , lyceum , or piano . Radios came on the market in the 192os . Self-created amusement such as folk dancing was relegated to remote regions and to faddists . " How ya gon na keep ' em down on the farm , after they 've seen Paree ? " How indeed ? That was the dominant social question which brought them swarming to the already congested cities . This was the era of the high standard of living in mechanical terms . Psychologically the new standards were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages , though in a different manner . The orientation of America toward the possibilities and the content of life had changed . The beneficial aspects were obvious . The rural dwellers who could afford the new machinery saved hours of toil , had more physical and mental mobility ; and the city populations enjoyed unprecedented gains in easy comforts . To be sure , if a man lacked the cash he became suddenly less than the hewer of wood and the drawer of water . In the city he was far from the woodlot , and it was conspicuous and humiliating to haul water by the pail from a public tap . And if without a job his case became as desperate as a serf exiled from a feudal barony . But for most , in this decade of the ' 20 's , the cash flowed in a seemingly inexhaustible stream . The era also was characterized by a literary renaissance . Seemingly even iconoclastic art paradoxically flourishes best in times of prosperity . Maxwell Anderson , Eugene O'Neill , Ernest Hemingway , Paul Green , John Dos Passos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , T. S. Eliot ? to name but a few ? gave America a rebirth in letters . As in the times just preceding World War I , there was a bright confidence in the sure march of progress .  | Interlude The times are wild . 11 Henry IV Wilson had been America 's most liberal president of modern times in the line of social planning . On the home front he had opposed economic power . He had offered the United States as a leader in world peace . Judged by Thomas Jefferson 's " absolute acquiescence in the will of the majority , " Wilson and his liberalism were , for the time being , repudiated . Warren Gamaliel Harding was elected in 1920 by a huge vote on the platform " back to normalcy . " Harding was a large , handsome man with big soft hands who looked like a statesman and had good intentions . His nomination had been engineered in part , however , by a rascally group who were soon appointed to office and began to fill their pockets from the public till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not touch Harding personally , but involved various of his officials , the new President died on August 2 , 1923 . He had been kind , humanitarian , good-tempered , but inadequate . Calvin Coolidge , the vice-president , succeeded . He had been governor of Massachusetts and was a native of Vermont . He was one of the few plain unmoneyed men ever to occupy the White House . While the majority of presidents were farm-born , they were or became men of considerable financial substance before reaching the presidency . Sandy-haired , sparse of figure , and taciturn , Coolidge looked like a village postmaster . Harold Laski has said that " Coolidge adored rich men , " but this is nonsense . Coolidge admired and was staunchly befriended by several men of wealth , including Andrew Mellon , his secretary of the treasury , Dwight Morrow , a college classmate , who later became a partner in J. P. Morgan &; Company , Frank Stearns , another classmate who inherited a Boston department store , and W. Murray Crane , a Massachusetts paper manufacturer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career ; but the faculty for adoration was not a Coolidge characteristic . He winced when Middlewesterners greeted him with boisterous enthusiasm . He had a dry wit , the gift of silence and the manner of a persimmon . Coolidge , while far from exuberant , was not a puritan . He liked his tumbler of whiskey and he believed in live and let live . The country found him restful . His political principles came out of the little red schoolhouse ; thrift , hon-  | esty and diligence . As a believer in home rule , he was perhaps closer to Jefferson than to any other predecessor and in a town meeting he might have seemed to be the perfect liberal , although he probably would have been shocked by such a designation . The practical effects of the Coolidge laissez-faire policy in the complicated economic structure of the decade following the first World War were to give free rein to speculation , inflation and business activity on a large scale . On the favorable side , a broad commercial prosperity was achieved . The production of motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and farm prices recovered substantially from their 1921 deflation . The four million soldiers returning from Europe and the American training camps found ample employment . There were many " soft spots " in both farming and industrial areas , but in the main there had been no peacetime period in recent decades when there was less poverty or material distress . Coolidge himself realized , however , that there were abuses and overexpansion . After one elected term following his succession to office because of Harding 's death , he did " not choose to run " again in 1928 . He had no comprehension of an elaborate social state ; and in an article written after his retirement he avowed that he had never understood the subject of tariffs . By the time Coolidge was ready to retire , the many abuses in the midst of prosperity , the numerous failures of businesses ( some dishonestly or incompetently administered ) , the millions of persons on fixed incomes who enjoyed no benefit from the prosperity of high prices , had begun to build up considerable liberal sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an answer to the country 's need . In view of the end of his career and the " typing " of him as a Bourbon by the Democrats , his liberal reputation at the time of his nomination has been almost forgotten . He was the great engineer , the poor Iowa boy who had made a sizable fortune and had spent much of it in good works . He was the great humanitarian , the Wilson appointee who had fed the starving Belgians . When hundreds of Americans had been stranded in Europe at the opening of the war in 1914 , it was Hoover who had organized a committee to get them home and had financed many of them out of his own pocket . He had stayed out of politics except for a competent term as secretary of commerce under Coolidge , in which he had avoided controversial issues . Hoover , in spite of the host of enemies that he made later , was singularly worshiped by the people who worked directly for him , either for pay or as volunteers , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoover was in the unfortunate position of having been mislabeled and misadvertised to the electorate as a liberal . Though probably as devoted to the nation and the public as any man who has occupied the White House , he was lacking in exterior warmth of personality . Nor did he have Wilson 's facility for projecting his ideas in glowing terms . Colonel Starling , secret  | service man at the White House through five administrations , has described the Hoover personality succinctly : President Hoover himself was a man of tremendous ability , and surely he was as earnest and as honest as any man who ever held the office . He was handicapped , I felt , by certain habits he had acquired during his career as an engineer , and by the fact that he thought of humanity as an abstract quality instead of a collection of highly differentiated personalities . Thus he believed that all tasks could be accomplished by adequate planning and sufficiently expert supervision , and the American people could be served and aided without reducing them to individualized portions of creative expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , Hoover 's influence on public affairs was inconspicuous . The Wall Street bull market was at its peak and general prosperity was undeflated . Few important governmental measures were undertaken , except for certain attempts toward the standardization of products and efforts to simplify the structure of the government . These matters , however , had no outstanding public appeal . Hoover soon alienated himself from the press through a shyness and reserve which gave the impression of arrogance . He was testy under questioning and was unable or unwilling to clothe his views in popular terms . He canceled press conferences without apparent reason , claimed he was misquoted , and often went for days without being accessible to the press at all . Yet while disregarding the press , his chief potential channel of information to the people , his mind was conceiving of the state as a force which could be engineered in the public interest . Any good intentions which he had , however , were beclouded by the stock market crash of October , 1929 , and the series of disasters which ensued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem the tide , and some of his measures , such as the Federal Farm Board , and the Reconstruction Finance Corpora*tion , were accepted , amplified , or reconstituted by his successor ; so , likewise , was his policy of large expenditures for public works to cushion unemployment . His successful appeals to industry to maintain wage rates was hailed by the liberals ; and it was the first time in the country 's history that wage rates had been maintained in the face of general deflation . In many respects , Hoover 's policy was clearly to the left of center and it was not until later years that anyone thought to describe him as a reactionary ; but he made a series of mistakes that accentuated even the unfortunate conditions which inescapably had to be faced . To placate the farmers he supported the Hawley-Smoot tariff for increases on farm products primarily , although other items were included . This precipitated retaliations by other countries , dimmed our fading foreign trade and damaged the economy footnote 1 Col. E. W. Starling and Thomas Sugrue , Starling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | of European nations which had already been in a depression for some time . He had a mania for " fact finding , " appointing numerous committees to report on special problems , holding that if the public had the facts the solutions would be forthcoming . This in practice was a form of delay and avoidance which was peculiarly distressing . Hoover 's fundamental error , moreover , was in believing that the depression would be short lived . Restoration of public confidence was his prime remedy . He might have been right , but it can never be proved because public confidence was not restored , and did not yield even to heroic measures . John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , immediately after the big crash stated on October 30 , 1929 , that " there is nothing in the business situation to warrant the destruction of values that has taken place " ; 2 the selling panic persisted and the market continued to sag . Nevertheless , as late as the autumn elections of 1932 , the administration and its Cabinet officers barnstormed the country preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be over as soon as the public had confidence . This optimism in the face of widespread financial distress throughout the land made a worse impression than a candid realization of the facts would have . The mere wiping out of speculators would not have been disastrous . The real blow to conservative opinion in the country was in the ruination of thousands who had followed the Coolidge doctrine of thrift and saving . In the year 1932 , scores of savings banks had closed their doors . Two major concerns who specialized in guaranteed mortgages , supposedly a prudent investment for widows and trust funds , went to the wall , even though they had had a record of many years without a single default in payments . One of Boston 's most conservative banking houses and a trustee for numerous family accounts , failed . It was not merely the speculators , or the men who had made sudden fortunes , who lost , but the millions of sober diligent citizens who saved for a rainy day , never expected riches , and had not benefited noticeably during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not idle in the face of disaster . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation , for example , was founded to strengthen the credit of the banking structure and to arrest the deflationary process generally . It began operations on February 12 , 1932 , with a fund of $500,000,000 with which some heroic work was done ; yet it was severely attacked by the very liberal organs that were crying out for an adequate relief policy . The R.F.C. was hotly criticized for rescuing banks which allegedly did not deserve to be saved , and in turn for allowing other banks to close . The total loss to depositors during the depression years will never be known . The figures of losses to depositors in closed banks , however , indicate the footnote 2 New York American , October 31 , 1929 . This , and statements that William Rockefeller and his son were " buying heavily " appeared widely in the press and had only momentary effect .  | trend . In 1929 the losses to depositors amounted to $77,000,000 , in 1930 to $237,000,000 , in 1931 to $391,000,000.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $168,000,000 for the year . This fact and other circumstances give support to President Hoover 's contention that things were already on the mend when he stood for re-election . Whether because of Roosevelt policies or not , the losses in 1933 rose to an alltime high of $540,000,000.4 Three-quarters of the reported losses in bank failures were on balances not exceeding $5,000 . The losses on the larger accounts often contributed to the ruination of businesses , and accelerated the downward spiraling of unemployment . Figures for depositors ' losses reported do not include mutual saving institutions which operate in seventeen states , but are the totals of commercial banks including trust companies , stock savings banks , in short the bulk of deposits . The losses of stockholders in the closed banks were even larger than those of the depositors , and the surviving banks absorbed millions of dollars of losses , by writing down the book value of their impaired assets . Most of the closed banks ultimately reopened either under the same management or under reorganization . The average per cent of loss to the depositors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ultimately the loss to individuals was complete . Moreover , whenever a bank closed , the shocked depositors had no way of knowing whether they were completely wiped out , or if not wiped out what would be the extent of their recovery . Many months , and sometimes years , ensued before they knew the answer . Statistically , most of the loss from the financial crash was salvaged , but for millions of Americans their former sense of security , stability And opportunity was irretrievably lost . The feeling of insecurity in turn shook the hitherto rigid conservatism of the middle classes and made the public at large receptive to change . footnote s From Annual Report of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for the year ended December 31 , 1940. 4 Ibid.  | Christmas Eve , 1932 , Eighth Street , Greenwich Village , New York .
