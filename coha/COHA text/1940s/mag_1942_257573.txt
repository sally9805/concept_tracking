Jesse Jones 's war-damage insurance corporation last week did a land-office business . Early estimates of $25 billion coverage were quickly upped ; guesstimators in the insurance field jumped their guess to nearly $75 billion . At that figure Jesse had already landed at least $100 million in premiums during his first week . <P> Biggest buyers were industrial plants , utilities , large owners of urban properties , big mercantile establishments . Gimbel Bros , and its affiliated stores went in for $64 million coverage ; Consolidated Edison for $300 million ; A.T . &; T. , $1.4 billion . <P> Home owners were less enthusiastic over the policies , particularly in inland sections where bombing seems doubly unlikely ; but mortgage holders were getting set to put the heat on them to sign up regardless . Whether lenders had any right to demand such protection was a doubtful legal question . In England the mortgage holder has to share the premium costs on domestic war-damage protection .                    @
