In one of the most remarkable documents of World War II-a summary of the Red Army 's great winter offensives in the south-the Russians said last week : &gt;The single objective of all the southern offensives was to " surround and defeat the German troops at Stalingrad . " &gt; " This plan was carried out in November and December , 1942 . " <P> With an air of triumph and finality , the Russians spoke wholly in the past tense , as though the battles of 1943 's first week were postscripts to a victory already won . <P> But the victory was not won , and the Russians in their second winter of war knew it better than most . The Germans at Stalingrad were surrounded ( see map ) , but they were not yet defeated . What the Red Army had won , but had yet to exploit , were positions and advantages which may eventually doom the Wehrmacht . Said Moscow Author Ilya Ehrenburg , preparing the Russian people for greater struggles : <P> " Victory is not a marble statue . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victory has many wounds , and eyes burning from sleepless nights . " <P> Doom in the South ? At Stalingrad a Red Army correspondent found Russian soldiers walking abroad in the winter daylight , out of their subterranean shelters , commanding whole blocks of shattered buildings and recaptured streets where no German bullets flew . Now , he said , it was the encircled Germans who burrowed into cellars , turned into " bearded beasts " and subsisted on short rations of horse meat . Now it was the Germans who were pressed between Red troops on every side , as the Russians had been pressed between the Germans and the Volga . <P> But Moscow dispatches noted two significant facts : 1 ) as of last week , the Germans held two positions on the Volga-the chief aim of their drive for Stalingrad ; 2 ) of the 22 Axis divisions caught in and near the city , 20 were German divisions ; only two were Rumanian . <P> According to the official Russian summary , the bulk of the 312,650 Axis troops killed and captured , the 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumanian and Italian . At some points of the Russians ' first advances , satellite troops outnumbered the Germans 5-to-2 . This probably explained the bag of 137,650 prisoners-the first such claims ever made by the Red Army . Cracking the 20 all-German divisions at Stalingrad will be a tougher task . <P> On the chill and windy Kalmuck steppes south of Stalingrad , where the Russians had narrowly repulsed a German counteroffensive , the Red Army still advanced last week . It drove down the Stalingrad-Caucasus railway , took the Germans ' strong defense-point at Kotelnikov , and rolled on southward . The Russians said that these operations , like those on the Middle Don and northwest of Stalingrad , were part of the great plan to defeat the Germans on the Volga . The accompanying threat to other German armies in the Caucasus was real enough , but by Moscow 's own account it was a future threat .
