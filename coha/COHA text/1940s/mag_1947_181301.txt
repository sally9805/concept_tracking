The bald , bearded Frenchman hunched painfully over his writing table was feeling old , ill and a bit sorry for himself . Painter Paul Czanne had studied hard , but had he learned , at 67 , to paint intelligibly ? Hardly anyone thought so . The old man scrawled the question once again . " Shall I ever reach the goal so eagerly sought and so long pursued ? " he wrote . " A vague feeling of discomfort persists which will not disappear until I shall have gained the harbor , that is , until I shall have accomplished something more promising than what has gone before . . . . " <P> A month later-on Oct. 15 , 1906-Czanne was drenched by a thundershower which came up while he painted in a field . Within a few days he was dead . But his art was not . The huge Czanne exhibition which opened in a Manhattan gallery last week-probably the largest ever to be seen in the U.S.-proved once again that his work had been infinitely better than the worried master dared hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the show were the products of his Paris period : the days when Czanne lived on the Left Bank , sat up late sipping red wine with a young writer named mile Zola . <P> Of the 68 oils and 18 watercolors in last week 's show , most looked hesitant and patchy , and a few were seriously out of whack . Czanne never learned to draw as fluently as the average commercial artist , and like most perfectionists he was stammeringly conscious of his failure to paint perfectly . If he had not inherited a comfortable income from his banker father , and been blessed with a stoically believing wife and a businesslike son to manage his affairs , the " Hermit of Aix " might never have created such powerful art . <P> Building with Dabs . Czanne has a lot of bad drawing besides his own to answer for . The 19th Century 's conscientious master did more than any other artist to make awkward drawing , dabs , distortion , and the fracturing of space fashionable in the 20th . Glimpsing a solid geometry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply it to art . Seen close up , his later paintings , such as Gardanne ( see cut ) , look like Cubist abstractions and were , in fact , the point at which Cubism first left the world behind . <P> But Czanne would doubtless be shocked by the modern artists who paint from imagination-and most of whom ( Picasso , Braque and Duchamp ) credit him with showing the way . For him , nature was everything , in spite of the fact that what he kept seeing in nature was , he insisted , " the cylinder , the sphere and the cone , all put into perspective . . . .
