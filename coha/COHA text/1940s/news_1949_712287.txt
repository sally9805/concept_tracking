txt The 55,500,000,000 foreign aid appropriation bill remained snagged in conference today as managers for the Senate and the House failed for a second time to reach agree'merit on any major item . After a two-hour meeting for adjustment of differences between the two chambers , so stormy at times that voices could be heard through closed doors , House managers said they " had no idea " when they would confer again . From the Senate side came an observation that it might be well for " a cooling-off period " to set in before another attempt at agreement . It appeared that , with Congress having passed yesterday a third extension of temporary spending authority to await final formal passage of appropriations , the pressure was off . It was expected that the conferees on the foreign aid measure would proceed slowly and perhaps belligerently . The latest extension measure permits credit spending by the National Military Establishment , the Economic Cooperation Administration , and more than a score of independent Government agencies , including the Veterans Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission , until Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , permitting further spending of operational funds proposed in appropriations bills caught in what is described in Congress as the worst log-jam in its history . With ' this third extension of temporary appropriations it was assured that Government payrolls involving some 2,500,000 military and civilian personnel could be met , at least until Sept. 15 . It meant that the ECA could sustain its flow of economic assistance to Marshall Plan countries . The armed services , further , could proceed with defense pro'grams , which were halted on Tuesday , when money authorization stopped suddenly in the midst of a ** dispute over the responsibility for the six-week delay , in enacted appropriations . The breaking of the deadlock also . permitted the Veterans Administration to mail out pension checks to veterans who had been left in an uncertain status last Tuesday , when pension payment was supposed to begin . The hospitalization services of the Veterans Administration , cut off from funds for two days , also went ahead . Flood Projects ** Up No conferences on the foreign aid measure were scheduled tonight for tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army civil functions bill providing for rivers and harbors and flood control projects throughout the country . The Senate , after two days of floor work on Governmental reorganization plans , returend late today to consideration of the $590,000,000 Interior Department money bill . The snag that was said to have prevented the foreign aid bill conferees from making any progress toward agreement is known as Amendment No. 1 . This is an item of $344,000 that the Senate approved for continuing the Joint Congressional Committee created during the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress to be a " watch dog " over the ECA . A majority of the House wants to give this committee no funds for the present fiscal year , it was indicated by a vote of 210 to 164 that instructed House conferees to " insist on disagreement " with the Senate 's action . On the Senate side today a complaint was made that Representative Clarence Cannon , Democrat , of Missouri , had " instructed himself , " as a conferee , " to insist on what he wanted . " Mr. Cannon , who is chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " watch dog " group , I made the motion for the House to give these instructions in advance of the first meeting of the conferees . The chairman of the " watch dog " group , Senator Pat 1VIcCarran , Democrat , of Nevada , also is a conferee . House Move Is Rejected After an hour of continued deadlock on Amendment No. 1 it was reported that the House conferees moved that it be passed over and agreements sought on other aspects of the $5,500,000,000 measure , They were voted down . After an hour more of futile bargaining the meeting broke up . Subjects of major disagreements awaiting settlement included the following : The $3,568,000,000 that the House approved for the ECA and provided that it could be spent in ten and a half months , if necessary , and the $3,628,000,000 that the Senate agreed on for a full twelve-month period . The Senate also provided for $150,000,000 of Marshall Plan loans financed by debt transactions , rather than appropriations . Some Senate conferees were said to be ready to propose acceptance of the House figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve months . The $1,074,000,000 deficiency appropriation voted for ECA by the Senate and the $1,000,000,000 allowed by the House . The $900,000,000 allowed by the Senate for occUpation relief in Europe and the East , and the $925 , - , 000.000 voted by the House . The $45,000,000 of Greek-Turkish aid approved by the Senate andl the $50,000,000 allowed by the House .
