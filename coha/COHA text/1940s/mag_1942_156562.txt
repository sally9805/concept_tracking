Nobody expected it ; few at first believed it . But from Washington last week came news that the Civil Aeronautics Board had abruptly abandoned its four-year-old " No " policy , had actually invited all comers to bid for air routes over the Caribbean . Said the Board in Docket No. 778 : " Any person desiring to render air transportation in the ( Caribbean ) area , and having equipment and personnel to inaugurate service immediately , may file . . . application for a temporary certificate . . . . " <P> CAB has never done anything like this before . Veteran airline operators expect CAB to squash new route applications , not promote them . They had reason aplenty : under four years of CAB control , U.S. airlines asked for 42,973 miles of domestic routes , were granted only 7,421 miles . Mostly because of this tightfisted policy , the combined fleets of all 18 U.S. airlines actually declined from 386 planes in 1937 to 359 in 1941 ( seating capacity , however , was increased ) . Atop this CAB clamped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new route even if the airline could prove the need and could furnish the planes . One upshot : President Roosevelt had to intervene personally before American Airlines could get a permit for its new route to Mexico City ( which CAB had turned down ) . <P> On last week 's dramatic turnabout CAB was prudently mum . But aviation insiders suspected that 1 ) the mushroom growth of some foreign airlines had the U.S. worried , 2 ) the airline bottleneck southward out of Miami and Brownsville had become too tight for comfort . <P> CAB has already done something about the bottleneck-it has granted charter certificates galore to foreign-owned airlines . Thanks to the board , Dutch-owned K.L.M. flies between Miami , Curasao , Kingston and Havana ; British West Indian Airways flies between Miami and Trinidad ; Central America 's TACA flies the Miami-Honduras-Costa Rica circuit . Yet at the very time CAB granted these certificates it sat tight on the Central American route applications of American Airlines , American Export Airlines and Pan American-Grace Airways . <P> This week most airline operators thought CAB was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand the better will be their chances in the airline-networked post-war world . But so far none has accepted CAB 's latest invitation to operate over the Caribbean . The hitch : CAB 's bid comes just when war has slashed commercial-airline equipment and personnel to the barest minimum .
