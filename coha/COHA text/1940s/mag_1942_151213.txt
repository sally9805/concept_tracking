Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik , Secretary since 1930 of the Ail-Union Central Council of Trade Unions , is a big man in his home country , a great man for telling Soviet workmen a thing or two . Sole survivor of the Central Council purge of 1937 , he has since expounded the line at home that the more Russia becomes socialized the more energy workers should spend on cultural and political activities , the less agitation on hours and wages . <P> Last December Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik went to Britain with 13 of the comrade trade unionists who listen so well at home . They inspected munitions plants , factories and shipyards , everywhere cheered by British workmen , everywhere given the fullest cooperation . Winding up his tour last week Comrade Shvernik said the British workers were fine but the British system not so good . He charged that there was " an incorrect attitude in some factories regarding the initiative of working men and women on their rationalizing proposals ; unwillingness to listen to the voice of working men and women and their shop stewards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of output . " <P> This off his chest , Comrade Shvernik and his 13 comrade commandos prepared for the trip home , pleased that their invasion of Britain had been so well received .
