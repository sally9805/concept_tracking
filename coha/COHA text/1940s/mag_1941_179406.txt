Dictator Joseph Stalin , who disposed of his Russian opposition simply by shooting it , was once widely regarded in the democracies as a sort of unwashed Genghis Khan with blood dripping from his fingertips . But as his armies have provided the principal opposition to Adolf Hitler , Dictator Stalin has come to seem increasingly benign to his new democratic friends . Last week United Press Correspondent Wallace Carroll , just out of Russia , reported that one U.S. official , after being guest at a Kremlin dinner celebrating the completion of aid-to-Russia arrangements , described the Dictator as " a nice old gentleman . " <P> At the dinner , grey-clad and booted , Dictator Stalin regaled his guests with a seven-hour , ten-course meal including cold and hot zakuska ( hors d'oeuvres ) , bowls of caviar , flagons of cognac and vodka , which many of the Russians chose to lace with red pepper . Thirty-one bottoms-up toasts were drunk ( some guests hazily estimated 37 ) ; Dictator Stalin preferred cognac . Among those toasted were Major Alva Harvey and Lieut . Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown the U.S. delegates to Moscow . They received the Dictator 's handshake . <P> At length the Dictator himself proposed a toast to President Roosevelt , and added ( his words translated by ex-Ambassador Oumansky ) : " May God help him in his task . " Several Americans , unable to believe their ears , checked the translation of these words with their Russian table companions . They discovered that it was correct . <P> The dinner over , Dictator Stalin led his bulging , elated guests from the banquet hall . Turning to them , he courteously observed : " The lavatory is on the left . " Mr. Oumansky again translated correctly .
