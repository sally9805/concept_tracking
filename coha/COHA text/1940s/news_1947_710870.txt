txt A saving to the home-buyer of $2,500 on the price of a house now selling for $7,500 could be effected if middlemen 's profits were eliminated , the House Labor Committee group investigating restrictive labor practices in housing heard yesterday . William Levitt , president of Levitt &; Sons , Inc. , which has built 3,40D small homes for veterans and has thousands more under way , gave the figures . Describing the practices that had enabled his concern to produce three-bedroom houses for sale at $10,000 each and two-bedroom cottages , with " expansion attics , " for $7,500 , Mr. Levitt said he could have brought prices down a third on the latter if it were not necessary to pay profits running as high as 53 per cent to dealers , distributors and wholesalers who do not even See the products they " sell . " Open-Shop Policy Mr. Levitt said his concern was able to economize partly because it operates on so large a scale , but that these economies are not so effective in the purchase of materials estimated to represent 80 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Levitt said , are brought down because Levitt operations are conducted on an " open shop " basis , with competent nonunion men accepted on a par with those  --  estimated at 50 per cent ? who carry union cards . Other features of the Levitt program are the prefabrication of stairs and other parts of the house and erection of the shell of the building on the site with precisioncut lumber . Mr. Levitt said his concern 's methods were just the opposite of the usual prefabrication technique , which he called inefficient . Another builder , Charles H. Reis of Bergen County , New Jersey , estimated that he could produce a house for $7,500 if allowed to em- ploy some of the economies practiced by the Levitt concern . The reason he can not , Mr. Reis said , is that well-housed residents of some communities resist zoning changes that would permit construction of the inexpensive homes needed by veterans . Mr. Levitt had told of obtaining zoning changes in Hempstead . L. I. , which permitted construction of the cellarless , dry-wall houses now going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils embedded in their concreteslab bases . With similar methods , Mr. Reis said , he could increase his production at least 300 per cent . Tie said the incentive wage system used by the Levitt corporation also would help speed up production . In attacking the distribution systems of plumbing supply concerns and other producers of building supplies , Mr. Levitt maintained that large-scale builders were the hope of the industry . They should be permitted the savings of large-scale purchases , instead of having to " buy at retail . " This brought on a discussion with Representative Thomas L. Owens , Illinois Republican , who asked : " Is it your thought that quantity makes the wholesaler , or is it his facility for distributing a manufacturer 's products ? " Mr. Levitt held that in other industries quantity was the thing , but for builders there is little chance to escape retail methods . Nevertheless , he said , in the near future all home building may be done by a dozen or so large builders , with the " custom-built " house becoming as rare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island builder explained that in declining to sign up with the unions his concern was simply trying to avoid sharing its management . He said the unions seemed to him like financiers who , when they float an issue of stock , demand a share of the management of the concernd involved . From other sources the build , ing trades unions received harsher treatment before the subcommittee , yesterday . One witness , told of a supposed threat on his life , which had prompted him to teply in kind to the union official who made it . The witness was Eugene J. Nelley , former Army captain , and the official he accused is to testify to , day under a subpoena issued after Mr. Nelley 's testimony . Christian G. Norman , chairman of the Building Trades Employers Association , asserted that the building unions have a monopoly on construction labor here . The unions ' leaders will have some chance today to defend them , as Representatives Ralph W. Gwinn , Wingate Lucas and Owens hold their final hearing before the reopening of Congress Monday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee with a prepared statement to refute charges by Walter Gordon Merritt that because of the monopolistic control exerted by unions and employers , prices are excessive and newcomers are excluded from operating here . He said that several important buildings here had been built by concerns from other cities , declared that BTEA members employed less than half the city 's construction labor , and noted that BTEA membership was open to any contractor who wished to join . He said only 1,000 of the many thousands of building concerns here belonged to the BTEA , but gave figures indicating that these did at least $100 , - 000,000 of business last year . The association , Mr. Norman said , was organized in 1903 , when the building trades already had a closed shop . It has consistently kept away from matters that might tend to control prices or restrict competition , he declared . " The members of our trade association must necessarily concern themselves with the maintenance of terms and conditions of employment that will induce rather than retard construction , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even the short run , to increase , willingly or unwillingly , the cost of production , slow its performance , or otherwise retard building construction . " Says Disputes Are Settled Answering questions from the committee members , Mr. Norman said the association had a proud record of settling jurisdictional disputes between unions with a minimum of work stoppage . This alone contributes to keeping down costs , he asserted . But as to monopolistic labor conditions , the veteran builder and negotiator declared : " I would say that labor has quite a monopoly in New York City in furnishing all the labor to do all the work , and the courts have sustained it . " He pointed out that labor unions were specifically exempted from the Federal anti-trust laws , but said their privileges must be exercised within reasonable limits , because " if the cost goes too high people are not going to build , and then we as contractors are not going to have any work . " Asked whether this had not happened already , Mr. Norman shrugged , but indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to the practice of making firm bids on construction work . When conditions were less settled , many general contractors did not care to handle contracts except on a costplus-fee basis .
