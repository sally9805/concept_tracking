State Secretary James F. Byrnes finally confirmed an old rumor . Meeting at Yalta . Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill had secretly agreed to pay Russia 's asking price for eventually fighting Japan-outright annexation of the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin . <P> Not even Jimmy Byrnes , who had been at Yalta , could tell the full story of the deal . He had not been told about it until after Japan 's surrender . Somewhat shamefacedly he conceded that he still did not know the specific terms of the agreement , had yet to see a copy , ' did not even know where the U.S. copy was kept . Had the U.S. got something in return ? Jimmy Byrnes said he knew of no Soviet concessions on territory the U.S. might want . <P> Next day Harry Truman added a little more information-the agreement was locked up with other Roosevelt documents in the President 's private files . But when newsmen asked whether any other secret bargains had been made at Yalta , the President said only that he could not answer-that there were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the U.S. public waited for the final truth about the Yalta conference , it could speculate on the import of the Kurils deal . In the Kurils are 6,140 square miles of islands shrouded by fog and volcanic smoke , bleak and thinly populated , without important natural resources . But the islands have great strategic importance . By their acquisition , Russia had pushed farther east into the North Pacific , was now smack astride the short Alaskan air route from the U.S. to the Far East . Paramu-shiro , a Japanese air and naval outpost in the northern Kurils , was frequently bombed by U.S. planes based in the Aleutians . <P> The Kurils deal gave added ammunition to U.S. proponents of outright U.S. annexation-as against administration under UNO trusteeship-of such wartime Pacific bases as the Marshalls , Marianas , Carolines and Okinawa ( which occupies roughly the same strategic position to the south of Japan as the Kurils do to the north ) . <P> Virginia 's Senator Harry F. Byrd promptly took occasion to call the trusteeship idea " absurd " - if Russia can claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
