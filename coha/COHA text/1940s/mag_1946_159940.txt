A big , tough segment of U.S. labor was out of hand . Last week the nation 's merchant fleet was tied up tight , the nation 's ports were dead . This week there was some reason to expect a settlement of the biggest maritime strike in history , but only on labor 's terms . The little moral authority which the Administration had left was wrecked . <P> C.I.O. 's National Maritime Union had started it . N.M.U. demanded a $17.50 a month wage boost , which the Government approved . Then rival A.F.L. seamen demanded $22.50-$27.50 boosts . The Wage Stabilization Board , believing that its duty was to hold the wage line , tried to limit A.F.L. to the C.I.O increase . Warned brilliant , 34-year-old Willard Wirtz , onetime law teacher , ardent puzzle fan and chief of WSB : this is a " stepladder " approach to further demands which would mean the end of Harry Truman 's badly bent stabilization program . <P> That was almost WSB 's last gurgle as A.F.L. seamen walked off their jobs a fortnight ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted , get them back to work and still not make WSB look too silly . The man of the hour turned out to be Labor Secretary Lew Schwellenbach , who crawled into the musty archives of Government precedents and came out with a nugget . <P> Since 1862 , he discovered , it has been Government policy to pay " prevailing rates " on Government jobs . Since the Government still owns many of the ships , all that was needed was for Economic Stabilizer John R. Steelman to rule that " prevailing rates " were those already agreed upon by some private shipowners , which included the $22.50-$27-50 boosts . <P> After this , the inspired Mr. Schwellenbach took to a hospital bed with a strained back . Mr. Steelman made the announcement . <P> The Breakoff . But that did not end it . Just as WSB had predicted , as A.F.L. seamen walked off the picket lines , N.M.U. seamen-who had honored the A.F.L. strike-rushed in . A.F.L. yelled wrathfully and in some cases A.F.L. longshoremen crossed the rival lines . But Joe Curran 's N.M.U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as A.F.L. <P> At week 's end , owners , A.F.L. and N.M.U. eyed each other , fought , threatened , broke off negotiations . N.M.U. , to show how tough it was , even yanked its men off security watches aboard the struck ships , leaving them and their cargoes unprotected from fire , storm , accident or decay . Owners pleaded for the Coast Guard . <P> The cost of the strike was incalculable . Such badly needed imports as copra , rubber , tin , tung oil , hemp , lead , wool , coffee , tallow and hides were cut off . Almost half a million men were out of work . <P> But worse than any of this was the cost to Government , which found out that it had no practical or moral method of keeping maritime labor under control . Neither labor nor management would ever again take Harry Truman 's wage stabilization policy seriously .
