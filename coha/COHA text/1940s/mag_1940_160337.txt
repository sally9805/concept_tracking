FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS-Ernest Hemingway-Scrlbner ( $2.75 ) . <P> In the ' 20s Ernest Hemingway created a stripped , hard-boiled prose for telling terse , hard-boiled stories about broken-down bullfighters , ham prizefighters , gallant trollops , homosexuals , mugs , spiritual victims of the war . " The lost generation " quickly turned his books into bestsellers , tried to talk like Hemingway characters as they sipped raw alcohol in speakeasies , tried to write Hemingway stories in garrets and penthouses . None wrote as well as he . <P> In the ' 30s Ernest Hemingway expounded the mystique of bullfighting in Death in the Afternoon . It was a best-seller too , but the Green Hills of Africa , in which Hemingway expounded the mystique of big-game hunting , showed a falling off . The depression was on ; strident voices were asking when Ernest Hemingway was going to become socially conscious . He kept on boxing , riding , hunting , fishing , did not say . <P> Some feared that the legend of Hemingway virility was about to develop into a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . . . . " Critic Bernard De Voto observed : " So far none of Ernest Hemingway 's characters has had any more consciousness than a jaguar . " Critic Max Eastman wrote his Bull in the Afternoon , one day traded blows with angry Author Hemingway in the most diverting literary brawl since Theodore Dreiser punched Sinclair Lewis . There was a feeling abroad that Hemingway was a little too obsessed with sex , a little too obsessed with blood for the sake of blood , killing for the sake of killing . Even his admirers wondered where he was going to find another experience big enough to make him write another A Farewell to Arms . If ever he did , they thought , he would produce another great book . They misunderstood Hemingway 's apparent obsession with killing , forgot that the dominant experience of this age is violent death . <P> In 1936 Hemingway found the great experience-The Spanish Civil War . This week he published the great novel-For Whom the Bell Tolls . He took the title from a passage by Preacher Poet John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it selfe ; every man is a peece of the Continent , a part of the maine ; if a clod bee washed away by the Sea , Europe is the lesse , as well as if a Promontorie were , . . . any mans death diminishes me , because I am involved in Mankinde ; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; It tolls for thee . " <P> For Whom the Bell Tolls is 1 ) a great Hemingway love story ; 2 ) a tense story of adventure in war ; 3 ) a grave and sombre tragedy of Spanish peasants fighting for their lives . But above all it is about death . The plot is simple , about a bridge over a deep gorge behind Franco 's lines . Robert Jordan , a young American International Brigader , is ordered to blow up the bridge . He must get help from the guerrillas who live in Franco 's territory . The bridge must be destroyed at the precise moment when a big Loyalist offensive begins . If the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offensive succeeds , the struggle of the human race against fascism may be advanced a step . The courage of the Spanish peasants is linked to the fate of all mankind .
