Turned over to the U.S. for an officer training camp , it was converted after V-E day into a campus for 4,000 G.I. students . At the start , there were only 3,611 , including 270 officers , 14 nurses , and eight WACs . They ranged in age from 19 to 46 ( average : 22 ) and in rank from buck private to lieutenant colonel . Their average education amounted to one year of college . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped Cokes in the PX bar or sprawled with their books on the well-trimmed lawns bordering the former parade ground . In the afternoon they enthusiastically piled into converted class rooms and laboratories in the camp 's red brick buildings , launched into their choices of 300 courses . Liberal arts and commerce curriculums attracted more than half , with science , fine arts , agriculture , engineering , journalism and education trailing in that order . <P> Of the faculty 's 230 members , 130 were first-rate civilian professors fresh from the U.S. on special leaves of absence . <P> Kenneth Olson , dean of Northwestern University 's school of journalism , planned to set up a model city room and have his students publish a daily Shrivenham Post on local newspaper presses .

The average program includes three hours of classwork a day , five days a week , and two hours of compulsory sports a week . Regular classwork will be supplemented with field trips and with lectures by visiting professors . <P> The university at Shrivenham will be one of three such schools for servicemen and women temporarily stranded in Europe . One opened last month in Florence , and another gets under way this month in Biarritz . ( A similar school for technical students only will open at Wharton , near Liverpool , next month . ) None of them has been officially accredited by U.S. associations , but students will receive certificates recommending credit in U.S. colleges . <P> With the opening of these centers , the Army will complete the last and most ambitious phase of its vast post-V-E education project . Hundreds of unit command schools have sprung up everywhere .
