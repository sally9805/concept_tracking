From Nanking , TIME Correspondent Frederick Gruin cabled this account of T. V. Soong 's final days as Premier : <P> <P> T.V. beat his way up to Nanking from Shanghai in a howling gale of antipathy and criticism . Huffiest &; puffiest was still the wind of Fu Szu-nien . Chubby , nearsighted , greying Fu , respected scholar and independent liberal , had expanded his polemics against T.V. into three newspaper articles . <P> " We must rip aside the iron curtain of the Soongs and Kungs , " he railed . He lashed at T.V. from every point of the pamphleteer 's compass , denouncing not only his policies but his personality : " Haughty and taciturn . ... As for his knowledge of Chinese culture , even after chemists analyzed it down to the smallest fraction , one can hardly find any trace of it . " <P> Instead of Tea . Thursday afternoon , in this atmosphere , T.V. invited all 30 members of the standing committee of the People 's Political Council to the Executive Yuan for tea . But the implacable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier 's party . Word went round that T.V. would have a rough time at the upcoming Legislative Yuan . <P> It was time to run before the wind . <P> Chiang Kai-shek sent word to Brother-in-Law Soong . <P> On Saturday morning , T.V. strode into the grey brick Legislative Yuan building . None of the waiting rank &; file knew what was impending . T.V. took a seat facing them , in the center of a long curved table . He was hatless , but in the chilly hall he wore his overcoat and kept a blue-and-red muffler up to his chin . On the chairman 's dais behind him sat rotund Sun Fo , Legislative Yuan president , and over Sun 's head hung the inevitable portrait of the chairman 's father , Sun Yatsen , with the words " Tien hsia wei kung " - Everything for the people . <P> T.V. read his resignation in a slow , composed voice , using the Shanghai dialect . " Three times during the course of the last year I submitted my resignation . . . . The Generalissimo has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national currency had been secured by silver specie until 1935 , when the U.S. policy of high prices for silver drained China 's reserves , forcing her to adopt managed currency . Managed currency depended on the people and Government " exercising self-restraint " ; there had been too little self-restraint . " The managed-currency system that saved China contained in it the germs of the poison that the country is suffering now . " <P> Instead of Peace . When expenditures outran receipts , T.V. went on , the only recourse was the printing press . But the course of inflation could have been stopped after the Japanese war- " if there had been internal peace . . . . Instead of peace and reconstruction , the country was plunged into war and destruction by the Communists . . . whose deliberate and conscious . . . aim was to destroy the economic system so that the Government would collapse . " <P> " The truth , " said T.V. , " can be told in one sentence . The present economic crisis is the cumulative result of heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of illusory peace , accentuated to some degree by speculative activities . "
