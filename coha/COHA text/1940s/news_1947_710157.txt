txt In The Nation Consistency by Mr. Truman That Is Also Fun By ARTHUR BROCK WASHINGTON , Feb. 6 ? Senator Taft sniffed suspiciously yesterday when the President repeated his call for a new law on Presidential succession . And probably so did nearly every other Republican , except Speaker Martin , who has been mentioned as eligible to the party 's nomination for President or Vice President next year . Mr. Truman , while being perfectly consistent , could hardly have overlooked the fact that he was having some good , clean fun , too . The proposal he repeats is that , in the event of a Presidential vacancy in an administration without a Vice President , the line of succession shall begin with-the Speaker of the House . If the House has no Speaker when the vacancy occurs , his plan is that the President pro tempore of the Senate shall act as President of the United States until a Speaker , who will then become President , is chosen . And if there is no Senate presiding officer other stopgap arrangements are provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to figure out the effects of such a law on his convention prospects , great or small . For if a vacancy should occur before the end of President Truman 's term , and this law were in force , Speaker Martin would become President . In the absence of any provision for a by-election he would serve out the unexpired term , and that would easily make him the leading contender for the Presidential nomination to succeed himself . There are legal , practical and philosophical arguments against Mr. Truman 's proposal , But this is a personal one which naturally weighs heavily with the numerous Republican hopefuls in Congress . Someone has estimated that all of the fifty-one Republican Senators are active , potential or wishful candidates for first or second place on the party 's national ticket in 1948 . And the House , which has contributed several Presidential nominees in recent years ( the Senate only one , Harding ) , is not without those who dream of the White House as they gaze at their faces while shaving . They think it very unkind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they mourn that a man who has been long in professional politics should show so little fellow-feeling for the members of his own tribe . lie had a chance , they reflect , to keep silent on the subject of succession , with the good excuse that a current vacancy , filled by his 1945 formula , would break the political continuity of the national administration , ordered by the people in 1944 to be Democratic for four years . If he had left the whole matter to Congress he would not have obliged numerous Republicans  --  and some Democrats who gave him the bill he wanted nineteen months ago  --  to search for reasons why they are now against what they then were for . With General Marshall first in line of succession under existing law , silence in the White House would have suited most of the politicians first-rate . The General is a non-partisan figure ; most people think the country would be safe in his hands ; and in his recent statement he completely and irrevocably eliminated himself from any possible consideration as a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , realized all this . But he believes in the principle be set forth in June , 1945 , that a chief executive should not be left ' with the power to name his own successor , as is the case under the present law when a White House vacancy occurs and there is no Vice President . And the fact that the Speaker , a Democrat in 1945 , is a Republican in 1947 , does not , in his view , affect the principle . Therefore he restated it . But in so doing there is room for suspicion that he knew the pangs this would bring to many ambitious Republican breasts and enjoyed ' the anticipation . If Congress seriously debates the measure he has recommended , the President and others can find some legitimate amusement in the performance  --  rare enough in these grave times . There are , however , flaws to be found in Mr. Truman 's plan . First , there is a legal technicality . In Article II , Section 1 ( 6 ) of the Constitution , Congress is empowered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President , by a statute designating what " officer " shall succeed . The original succession act designated the Speaker and the President of the Senate in such cases . But in the Eighties Congress concluded , from a line of Supreme Court decisions , that neither of these functionaries is an " officer . " Hence it passed the present law , which begins succession with the Secretary of State and follows down through most of the Cabinet list . This fault might be cured in the draft of a new statute , but lawyers differ heartily on the question . Then there is the point made by many Democrats in 1945 and now being dusted off by some Republican aspirants to their party 's 1948 nomination ? that it ib unwise practice to permit a member of one major party to succeed by statute a President who belonged to the party that defeated the nominees of the former at the previous national poll . This could happen ' with any Speaker or Senate President pro tempore . There are additional objections which will be heard , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman 's bill June 29 , 1945 , and sent it to Senate oblivion . * * * ( In answer to many inquiries , the essay " The Map and the Clock , " summarized in this space Feb. 4 , is to be found in a book by Charles Morgan , " Reflections in a Mirror , " second series published by Macmillan , )
