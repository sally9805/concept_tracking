International <P> Early one morning three years ago this week the curtains of Adolf Hitler 's study in Berlin 's huge Reich Chancellery stirred gently in the breeze . Inside , after seven nearly sleepless days of conferences and feverish meditation , the demoniac leader of Germany had reached his decision . A few minutes later , and hundreds of miles away , a German bomber snarled through the grey , drizzling Polish dawn and dropped a missile on the fishing village and air base of Puck . World War II had begun . <P> Lost Illusions . The world had held its breath since the announcement of the Nazi-Soviet Pact eleven days previously . Now it breathed again , not with relief but with the sense of destiny ineluctably on the march . On countless lips was Sir Edward Grey 's despairing cry of World War I that the lamps were going out all over Europe . Many genuinely feared that Europe would next be illumined by the fires of Hitler 's rage . But a great number of the citizens of the Democracies , nervous though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Grey had sounded . They were able to bolster themselves with a variety of illusions . <P> It was not in poor Poland that they placed their faith . Poland 's dictator . General Edward Smigly-Rydz , bravely declared : " We shall win by the Holy Passion of our Lord . He will lead us to victory . ' ' Poland 's passionate Catholics and her skull-capped Jews , marked by tens of thousands for Nazi execution , resolutely dug in for the defense of their country . But the world outside felt in its bones that Poland was digging its own grave . <P> France , however , was another story . As it had during many months of facile prophecy , the democratic world looked to France to provide the first mighty upset to Hitler 's calculations . Did not France 's spruce , civilized generals , packed with the lore of St. Cyr. command the smartest army in the world ? Was it not based on the impregnable subterranean bastions of the Maginot Line ? Furthermore , in these early days of September 1939 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterpiece alone , but also as an ideal point of departure for an invasion of Germany . Amateur strategists pointed out that France 's possession of the escarpments of Alsace-Lorraine , jutting east toward Germany , made her invasion chances vastly superior to those of 1914 . The democratic world waited for General Maurice Gamelin to start . Few detected any symbolic menace in the frivolities of Paris , continuing despite blackout and mobilization . The city 's latest dither was occasioned by an attempt by the couturier Mainbocher* to bring back the Victorian wasp-waisted corset , as ill-adapted to modern habits as was the French High Command to the blitz technique that Berlin was perfecting over the French horizon . <P> Lost Umbrellas . Buttressing the keen military insight of France , of course , was the dogged valor of Britain . Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , who had just refused to lend his umbrella to a London exhibition of notable walking sticks , did public penance for the appeasements of his past . To Parliament he stated : " Everything I had worked for , hoped for and believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only one thing left for me , and that is to devote what strength and power I have to forwarding the victory . "
