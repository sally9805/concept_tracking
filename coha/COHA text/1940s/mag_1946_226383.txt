In the early ' 20s , it was German shepherd dogs . Then came wire-haired fox terriers ( 1928-36 ) , then cocker spaniels ( 1937-45 ) . Last week , at dogdom 's No. 1 indoor spectacle , the Westminster Show in Manhattan 's Madison Square garden , another dog was having its day-the boxer . <P> Boxers , 139 strong , outnumbered every breed . Kennels specializing in the square-rigged , pug-ugly German dogs are selling them as fast as they breed them . <P> The boxer 's biggest asset is a boisterous personality . He looks like a cross between a Great Dane and a bulldog , weighs about 70 pounds , makes a lot of noise . A thoroughbred pup sells for about $150 ; full-grown , he eats about eleven pounds of horse meat a week . Though he looks like a troublemaker , he is generally regarded as " good with children . " Just what causes trends in dog buying is a question that kennelmen answer by asking another : " Why do women wear funny hats ? " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two prize boxers . White-pawed Warlord of Mazelaine had met Gentleman Jim of Ryetop twice before ; each had won a decision . This time Warlord won easily , despite his one fault-lighter than usual bird-dog eyes . He went on to be chosen best in the working-dog group ( over the collie , Doberman , Great Pyrenees ) . As far as the crowd was concerned , the dog he had to beat was a striking , woolly-haired Afghan , best of the hound group . The four other finalists : a Boston terrier , an English setter , a Pekingese , a wire-haired fox terrier . Judge William Prescott Wolcott , however , picked sassy , six-year-old wire-haired Champion Model Rhythm . It was victory No. 26 for terriers in the last 40 Westminster shows ; and the boos almost drowned out the applause . But even with Warlord 's defeat , the boxer fans went away confident that the future was theirs .
