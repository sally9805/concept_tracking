LABOR It 'd Better Be Good <P> Along the creek runs , the hollows and slate hills where they take coal from the ground , the hard-bitten and taciturn West Virginians were confused and worried . " That John , " said an Irish-born shot-firer in the Kanawha coalfields , " he be the greatest man of the 20th Century , but I be damned if we'uns can figure him out this time ... I think John be a thinkin ' o'hisself . " <P> The men sat restively before their weather-seamed shacks , slicing their tobacco thin , and talking . Eight weeks of strike had been too much for the 380,000 United Mine Workers . Almost three months of the wizened pay of the three-day week had been uncomfortable enough , but the strike that followed had nearly emptied the flour sack and gobbled up the last flitch of bacon . The kids went off to school with scrimpy breakfasts . <P> Despite all the suffering , John Lewis was still king of the coal miners . " All we got , we owe to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago we worked 20 hours for $2 ; now we get $15 for eight , that 's what . " But the king , it was plain , was no longer above timid , hesitant reproach . It was n't too safe to criticize him openly : the old men did n't dare risk being blackballed by the union ; they were too near pension time . And a coal miner 's wife in Cinderella , W. Va. , who wrote a letter to the editor protesting that John Lewis was " far too old and power mad , " had bricks and rocks thrown through the window of her company bungalow last week . <P> White Flag . But never in his 29 years of imperious reign had John L. Lewis fumbled so badly , and the miners knew it . His three-day work week and the strike had won them nothing-not even a crisis in the nation 's coal supply . He had methodically bullied and insulted the coal mine operators into hard and adamant opposition to his demands for higher pay and a bigger slice of royalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindled until it was necessary to cut off all but emergency benefits-at the worst possible time . He had alienated the public and angered most officials in Washington . And the Supreme Court , in an ironically timely decision , had reaffirmed the $1,420,000 fine imposed on him and his union last year . <P> In Chicago last week , where he held a hastily called " yes man " meeting of his union policy committee , John Lewis raised the white flag . Without warning , he ordered his coal diggers back to work immediately on the same terms that he had haughtily rejected . But he served notice that the strike would be on again Dec. i unless the " arrogant and brutal " mine owners came to terms . At a news conference , where he tried to look ferocious but looked instead like a tired and harried hoot owl , John L. tried to explain that it was not a retreat but simply a gesture of good will .                   @ @
