( See Cover ) <P> In an apartment in Manhattan 's highceilinged , eminently respectable Hotel Ansonia , 20-odd massive , military-looking Danes sat one evening last fortnight around a barrel of Danish beer . The warriors were at ease . They toasted King Christian X , and many another , in glass after glass of clear , burning aqvavit. * After every glass of aqvavit , they downed a chaser of beer . <P> At one point in the evening someone produced a rifle , suggested that they celebrate the good old days with a good old-fashioned shooting match . Carried by acclamation . The hotel corridor made a fine shooting gallery , with a homemade target set at one end of it . It was all carried out in military style . One Dane stood sentinel at the elevator door , warning back passengers with a white flag . As the rifle banged , horrified hotel guests cowered in their rooms , bellhops scurried for cover . Several bullets hit the target . Nobody got shot . It was one of the most successful meetings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Next morning , the jovial host , a 225-lb. onetime Danish Guardsman named Lauritz Melchior , felt that things had perhaps been carried a little too far . His wife took pieces of cake and candy to the neighbors , assuring them that such a thing would never happen again . The neighbors allowed themselves to be placated . For Mrs. Melchior is very persuasive . And Lauritz Melchior is the world 's No. 1 Wagnerian tenor . <P> Tenor Melchior is not averse to wassailing , but he takes his Wagner straight . After dinner on Wagner nights he calls for his roomy Cadillac and is driven with his wife , Kleinchen ( Little One ) , to the stage door of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . He climbs the creaky stairs to the primo tenore 's dusty dressing room , * fumbles around among the costumes of Tenors Richard Crooks and Giovanni Martinelli for his own raiment of deer skins and knightly robes . He washes himself in an antiquated , marble-topped washstand , glowers at the dead flies in the basin-shaped chandeliers , and applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed as the young Siegfried , his noble paunch encased in a deer skin , his stubby grey hair covered with a luxuriant blond wig . Thus accoutred , he lights a big black cigar and trundles down to the wings , where the waiting Kleinchen inspects him from top to toe , sees that his massive legs are properly powdered and that his hunting horn is in place . At the murmuring strains of Wagner 's prelude , Melchior throws away his cigar and clears his throat . Kleinchen smiles and murmurs her parting salute : " Hals-und Beinbruch " ( an old German good-luck greeting meaning " May you break your neck and your legs " ) , and the great Lauritz Melchior bounds youthfully on to the Metropolitan 's aged stage .
