txt ARMS COUNT LOSES IN U. N. AS TRUMAN BARS ATOMIC DATA Council Rejects Soviet Demand That Big Five Account for AU Troops and Equipment PRESIDENT 'S REFUSAL FLAT He Declares That Number of Bombs in U.S. Should Not Be a Matter for Discussion By A. M .. ROSENTIL9.1 . Special to TELE Now Toxic Trtass . LAKE SUCCESS , Feb. 1O  --  Russia 's demand for a Big Five accounting of all troops and arms was rejected today by the United Nations Security Council . President Truman refused Thursday to disclose the number of atomic bombs stored in the United States , declaring that this should not be a matter for public discussion . Only the Soviet Union and the Ukraine voted for the resolution , and the nine other members of the Council joined in solid abstention to defeat it . A few minutes earlier , the Council killed a Soviet move to pass the motion along to the Commission for Conventional Armaments for study . Before leaving the Council chamber , the delegates approved a United States resolution handing on to the commission a General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the commission to continue planning eventual arms reduction but declared that there can be no real disarmament unless world confidence exists . Attack on U. S. , Britain The balloting came after the Council had listened to a long attack against the United States and Britain by the Soviet Union 's delegate , Jacob A. Malik . Mr. Malik . joined enthusiastically by his Ukrainian colleague  --  revived all of the Soviet Union 's " warmongering " charges against the Western powers , and complained that they were " blackmailing " the world into a ' mad armaments race . The United States , said the two Russian delegates , was using its stockpile of atomic weapons as a sword hanging over the rest of the world . And at the same time , he went on , the United States was using all kinds of " pressure , demo. , gogy and open slander " to hide the Soviet Union 's true desire for peace . The Soviet resolution , in effect , would lave been a substitute for the Assembly 's motion . Its mkt spectacular provision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council to draw up a plan for a one-third arms cut and meanwhile to submit an inventory of troops and arms  --  including the atomic bomb  --  by . March 31 , 1949 . Mr. Malik 's resolution was a catch-all affair that included 4 the Soviet demands on atomic enJ ergy and disarmament . IZ would have instructed the Atomic Energy Commission to draw up bit , . June 1 , 1949 , a draft convention for outlawing atomic bombs and controlling atomic energy . Reaction from the Western pow // ers came quickly . Warren R. Austin of the United States called it a " succotash " of rejected ideas . He complained that one part of the resolution was an attack n the Western Hemisphere 's defense arrangements and on the proposed North Atlantic defense pact . As soon as the meeting opened today Mr. Austin introduced his own resolution . It was a simple one , merely referring the Assembly 's resolution to the conventional arms group , but its effect would have been to ignore the Soviet resolution . Mr. Malik had put his resolution before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Assembly resolution on disarmanent , which had been fought hard by the Eastern European countries in Paris , at the last meeting of the Assembly . Mr. Malik then told the Council that all of Russia 's attempts to further the cause of disarmament had been blocked by the " AngloAmerican bloc . " The United States , he said , was particularly guilty. ? Mi ? . Malik later made a surprise parliamentary move . He introcluced a new resolution , passing his own proposals and the Assembly 's motion on to the commission , and asked for a vote on that . Sir Alexander Cadogan of Britain and other delegates , however , insisted on voting on Mr. Malik 's original proposal as well . Although the Soviet and Ukrainian delegates voted alone for the original resolution , Egypt joined them in support of the motion to refer everything to the commission . The eight other countries abstained . On the United States resolution , nine delegates voted in favor , Russia and the Ukraine abstained .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
