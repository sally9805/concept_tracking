Full of the eager anticipation which all playgoers ( except dramatic critics ) share , Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt taxied up to New York 's Mansfield Theater . With her were her secretary , Malvina ( " Tommy " ) Thompson and a onetime youth leader , pinko Joe Lash . The play they had come to see : In Time to Come . As Mrs. Roosevelt stepped out of her cab , to her horror she came face to face with a picket line . <P> The President 's wife would no more cross a picket line than Queen Victoria would have painted her fingernails. * She marched to the box office , turned in her tickets and got her money back . To protests that the pickets were unfair , Mrs. Roosevelt answered firmly : " Fair or not fair , I can not cross a picket line . " Pausing to point out to Band Leader Meyer Davis ( who also arrived full of anticipation ) that the play was being picketed , she skittered across the street to a musical , show , trailing Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the White House , got his money back , too . <P> The picket line which about-faced Mrs. Roosevelt belonged to the A.F. of L. musician 's union , of which James Caesar ( " Mussolini " ) Petrillo ( see p. 42 ) is boss . Because In Time to Come has two minutes of off-stage band music played on a phonograph , the musician 's union demanded that four musicians be hired , to sit in the wings . Pay of the four do-nothing musicians would have cost Producer Otto L. Preminger $337.50 a week . Mr. Preminger tried to settle for one musician , at $112.50 a week , but the union would not agree . <P> The cast , all members of the A.F. of L. , petitioned Mrs. Roosevelt to come back and see their play , pointed out that the wrangle had been going on for ten days and that the picket line had materialized only a few minutes before she was due to appear . The producer offered to give a " command performance " in Washington or at her home in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " seeing his play , later . But she made it clear that she also counted on not having to cross a picket line . <P> <P> * Not so her husband-as the irreverent New York Daily News pointed out : " Mrs. Roosevelt 's eminent husband has crossed picket lines . He crossed them with soldiers in the North American Aviation strike in California last June , to keep the warplanes rolling out . He crossed picket lines with sailors of the Navy last August to end the Kearney , NJ. shipyard strike which was holding up ship production . "
