MEN IN MOTION-Henry J. Taylor-Doubleday , Doran ( $3 ) . <P> Henry Taylor is a successful business man ( pulp and paper ) , a newspaperman ( correspondent in North Africa ) , an author ( Time Runs Out ; TIME , May 11 , 1942 ) , an individualist , the offspring of Ohio pioneers , and an ardent disliker of much in contemporary U.S. life . In his autobiographical Men in Motion these qualities are abundantly manifest . An uneven , unprofessional book , packed with good stories ( though his fellow correspondents dispute their novelty ) and with vehement personal opinions , it is well worth reading for its picture of the mood of the people from whom Taylor and many another American springs . <P> No Labels . Taylor is fed up with collectivism in all its forms . He believes that in 1932 the depression was all but conquered and " we were on our way up " when the New Dealers stepped on the prepared ground and planted the Europeanized seeds of reactionary bureaucracy . They substituted " an unplanned economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of their thinking , says Taylor , are apparent in the present plight of the U.S. and the world . " History , ' ' says Taylor , " will never forgive them . ... I have refrained ever since from saying I am a liberal . I answer that I am an American . " <P> Contemporaries . The scenes in Men in Motion range from Air Chief Marshal Tedder 's garden in Cairo to Nazi Hans Dieckhoff 's quarters in the German Foreign Office in Berlin . ( Said Dieckhoff , the last Nazi Ambassador to the U.S. , " Russia opposes Germany 's destiny . " Said Taylor , " Who does n't ? " ) They include an interview with Sir Robert Alexander Watson Watt , developer of radar . " Forget the impossible , " Watt said . " Few things are impossible . " They include a vivid picture of Woodrow Wilson shortly before his death , when young Henry and his father visited the stricken ex-President . " He was not feeble . Often his right arm struck the air in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he would be done with his enemies forever . . . . I want some scalps , ' he said to Father time after time , ' and when I am well I am going to get them . ' " <P> Ancestral Portraits . America , says Taylor , is now in spiritual liquidation . When Taylor 's great-great-grandfather Robert Taylor built the first house in Columbus , Ohio , enterprise was not some thing people argued about . They had it , or they did n't . Robert Taylor had it . His wife Mehitabel and their children - five of the eleven were less than twelve years old - followed him by wagon . Mehitabel drove the wagon . Before she left New York she made the maiden trip up the Hudson on Fulton 's Clermont . When she reached the Ohio wilderness the first thing she told Robert was of the wonders of the first commercial steamboat.
