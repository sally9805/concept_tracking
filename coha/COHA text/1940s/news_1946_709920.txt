txt Vlastimil Kybal 's criticism of official American foreign policy to cancel credits to Czechoslovakia was refuted by Secretary Byrnes in his news conference on Oct. 22 . The gist of the United States Government 's charge was that Czechoslovakia turned over the first $10,000,000 received from $50 , - 000,000 credit to Rumania and charged Rumania an " administrative fee " of $700,000 plus 6 per cent interest . In relating events at the Paris conference , Mr. Kybal couples two unconnected matters . He states correctly that the Czechoslovak Communist Under-Secretary of State , Dr. Vlado Clementis , protested against the charge that Czechoslovakia is a satellite of Soviet Russia . Everybody who watched these two countries vote together in Paris in the familiar line-up of 15 to 6 is free to form his own opinion on this subject . It is this consistent support of the Soviet charges against the United States by Czechoslovakia that the State Department has in mind . The same Dr. Vlado Clementis and his chief , Jan ' Masaryk , Czechoslovak Foreign Minister , supported and applauded the Soviet Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States seeks the enslavement of foreign countries by granting loans to them . Mr. Kybal feels " sure that the refusal of credits to Czechoslovakia will be regretted by American business " and continues " that Czechoslovakia is known as an excellent commercial partner . " Czechoslovakia used to have that reputation prior to 1939 , but Czechoslovakia of 1946 , unfortunately , is not the Czechoslovakia of 1938 , as Prague would like us to believe . American business has found out the difference , to its chagrin , when investments valued at $150,000,000 by the State Department in 1943 became , through " nationalization , " worthless overnight . To contend , as Mr. Kybal does , that the economic reasons for the suspension are no longer valid , because Czechoslovakia has " decided " to satisfy fully foreign investors , can be accepted only if we confuse a vague promise with its fulfillment . Not until deeds have backed up the " decision " will it be time to consider a change . There is one highlight in Mr. Byrnes ' declaration that deserves some elucidation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovakia is not in so bad a financial position , as the United States has been led to believe . " This opinion has been supported by independent observers : from ex-Mayor La Guardia 's stein-ofbeer incident to ex-President Herbert Hoover 's statement after his return from Europe . It has been confirmed by THE TIMES ' own John MacCormac in an UNRRA dispatch . The fraud implied in Secretary Byrnes ' words is clearly visible in the Czech UNRRA deal . Czechoslovakia asked for UNRRA help on the basis of her pre-war population of 14,300,000 But she withheld the aid from 3,500,000 Sudetens and 700,000 Hungarians , who have received the infamous " Jewish " rations originally introduced by the Nazis . Thus , Czechoslovakia received about 40 per cent more UNRRA aid than she was entitled to . On the other side of the ledger appears the minorities ' property , expropriated without any compensation . The farm property alone is estimated at more than slx acres and valued at more than $1,200,000,000 . This Czechoslovak loot from its minorities ought to be compared with the $300,000,000 former satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total reparations . To this former figure should be added the value of the Sudeten glass , china , textile and other industries . They contributed 4i ) per cent to Czechoslovakia 's pre-war export and made her the good financial risk Mr . Kybal claims her still to be . There should further be added the value of the property of 3,300 Sudeten cities , towns band villages . These are the facts that support Secretary Byrnes ' contentions . H. F. MARCH . New York , Oct. 28 , 1946 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . The Jim Crow restrictions in the theatres in Washington , D. C. , are an- ' achronistic and scandalous . As one of ? my Washington friends said to me the other day , " They are relics of the time when Washington was considered a , sleepy old Southern town . Nobody seems to have informed the theatre ; owners that this has become a great , cosmopolitan capital . " There is no local law or ordinance imposing these restrictions . It is a mat. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The situation is compli- , cated and confusing but , as I under- , stand it , the following policies prevail : , In the National Theatre Negroes are , permitted on the stage but not in the ; audience . In Constitution Hall they are permitted in the audience but not the stage ( except occasionally at benefits ) . At the Uline Arena Negroes are admitted to prizefights but not to suel. ' intellectual entertainments as the " Ice- : Capadea . " Billy Rose recently canceled ; an engagement of " Carmen Jones " this arena because of this policy . The Lisner Auditorium of George Washington University is a modern ; well-equipped theatre which has recently become available from time to time for commercial productions . Th - first play booked there is the Play wrights ' Company production of Max- , well Anderson 's " Joan of Lorraine , ' starring Ingrid Bergman . There was no question in the minds of the Playwrights ' Company of an : , racial discrimination in the sale of tickets and , undoubtedly , a proportion-. ate number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the university decided that the Lisner Auditorium must conform to the general practice in Washington theatres and refuse admission to Negroes . Washington is an important unit the economy of the theatre . It is what is known as " a great show town . " The audiences are exceptionally intelligent and the press generous in the support it gives to the theatre as an institution . However , the revenue to be derived i poor compensation for the injury done to the conscience of American citizenby this continuance of injustice in our national capital . I believe that only a small minority , of the people of Washington want this , to continue . And there is surely no law compelling that minority to go to the , theatre if they object to the presence of Negroes under the same roof . Therefore , I believe that it is the duty of all of us who work in the American theatre  --  actors , playwrights , producers  --  to protest against this intolerable situation by agreeing that shall keep our productions out of Washington until the ban against Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 26 , 1946 . Meeting Veterans ' Housing Needs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent editorial entitled " Th , Census . of Housing " hits the nail the head . Every veteran I know agrees1 with you that " if the Government ! wants to see veterans housed at al monthly rate they can afford it should devote its policies in the New York area almost entirely td encourage ) large-scale building of new apartment house developments with small livingi units . " The four young men in my family who served overseas regard a one-family house as a luxury . They are intelligent enough to know that a two-family : house will enable them to live practically rent free and shelter another : veteran . They think the Wyatt plan is ' selfish , as it does not go far enough . But veterans are too young to tie themselves to one spot for years . If a better job calls them to another city they wish to be free to accept it . They - do not want to mortgage their futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known who originated the Wyatt plan to construct several million one-family units at $9,000 each and tie up the entire building industry . All it has done is to make confusion worse confounded . Like most of the Democratic planning , the idea has missed fire . Certainly the veterans did not originate it . MAe.roms D. RIVERS . Brooklyn , N. Y. , Oct. 28 , 1946 . Autumn Woods To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Today , after a long summer in more northerly latitudes , I walked through a favorite woods as I had done some six months earlier in the year . At that time the delightful place was wrapped luxuriantly , almost extravagantly , with dogwood bloom soft as silk banners . The trees , gleaming with new leaves , were loud with the songs of birds . Underfoot countless woodland flowers were flaunting bright colors in the warm spring sunshine . This area , I thought , can never again be so enchanting until a full year has passed over it . But during my walk this afternoon I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether a medieval illuminated manuscript is or is not more beautiful than a Renaissance tapestry ? Each has details of excellence and beauty . So it is with the brilliant spring and the less colorful autumn in this section of the land . What I was seeing today as I scuffed through the brown- crispness that littered the forest floor , spotted here and there by mellow south-slanting October sunlight , and passed under those same dogwood trees , now covered with bronzed leaves and red-lacquered berries , was the fullness that attends the end of a definite cycle of growth , a maturity in amber , gold and purple that impresses the senses , less emotionally perhaps , but just as powerfully as do the gayer scenes of springtime . We have in this area of the East two seasons at least about which there can be no argument . One , in point of fact , derives from the other . Autumn , after , all , is merely the distilled essence of ' spring buds , summer rain and sunshine and the current frosty starlit nights. : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrenceville , N.
