txt Dr. Harold C. Urey , the Nobel prize-winning natural scientist who helped to perfect the atomic bomb , must have got bigger and blacker headlines than he counted on when he sat down to write for Air Affairs an article quietly titled . " Atomic Energy , Aviation , and Society . " One headline screams : " Expert Hints U. S. War for World Rule " ; another says Dr. Urcy belie v es " ' Necessity ' May Force U. S. to Control World . " And so on . Now , perhaps . Dr. Urey is so accustomed to the detached seclusion of nuclear research that he thought he could set out the theoretical , possible , conceivable . conjectural . hypothetical , speculative , suppositional " necessity " of a War of conquest as a last alternative to effective international control of atomic energy without starting a misleading debate . A A A If Dr. Urey thought so . he now has discovered that he started a useless controversy which can only have ill effects he did not intend . He draws attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by directing attention to an alternative . the American people never would sanction . He feeds the propaganda mill of those who are opposing in , ternational control of atomic energy by giving semblance to the charge that the United States is planning to use the atomic bomb against the world . Dr. Urey , it is safe to say , never intended to create that impression . He knows , and most of the world knows , that the American people never would set out on a war of world conquest . He knows , and most of the world knows , that the United States Government never would dream of taking such a course of action . In logic detached from human affairs , an American war of conquest is one hypothetical alternative consequence of the failure to reach an atomic agreement , but it is not an alternative which is ' anywhere on the agenda of the United States Government or anywhere in the desires of the American people . A A It is necessary , of course . 10 face the consequences of Russian refusal to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid control . but an American war for the purpose , to use Dr. Urey 's words . " of conquering the world and ruling it as we desire " is not one of the consequences . Thus far . four of the five big powers and 10 of the 12 members of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission are prepared to make atomic energy a world public utility and vest in an agency of the United Nations full authority to control the mining , ' production , and inspected use of atomic power . Russia  --  and Poland  --  are opposing international con ' . rol and international inspection . The issue is not on disputql points merely between Russi and the United States . The issue is not between alternative methods of atomic control . The issue now has become a simple choice between international control and no control . So far . Russia chooses the latter ; so far . Russia chooses not to join with the rest of the world in putting atomic energy on leash . No alternative to world control of atomic energy is pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Russia refuses to co-operate , the overwhelming majority of nations . in the common defense , will act to pool their atomic resources . Only world atomic control can avert a world atomic-armament race , and if Russia insists upon keeping atomic energy on the loose , the world outside Soviet dominance undoubtedly will ' join in an atomic alliance of its own . This alliance will not be an alliance against Russia ; but it will be , in all candor , an alliance against Russia 's refusal to join the world in common ownership and control of atomic power . A A A This alternative is not the choice of four of the five- big powers , nor is it the choice of 10 of the 12 members of the U. N. Atomic Energy Commission . Thus far , it is the choice of Russia  --  and Poland . Four of five of the big powers and 10 of the 12 members of the U. N. Commission choose world control in the common good . The choice still is Russia 's to make . The world earnestly hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to secede from , the world . If Russia has faith in the United States , it will join . If hussia has distrust of the United States , it should join . There could be no better protection ; against the United States ? if protection is needed .
