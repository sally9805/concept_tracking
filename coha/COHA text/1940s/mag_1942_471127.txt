A GROUP of sailors are drinking beer at a bar called George 's in Greenwich Village . The juke box is playing " Deep in the Heart of Texas , " and every time it stops someone puts another nickel in and it starts up again . A little man with curly hair and bushy eyebrows turns and glares fiercely at it . " Ca n't that machine play nothing else ? " he roars . He looks tough enough and mad enough to eat it , record , needle , and all . " Stop beating your gums , brother , " drawls the tall sailor with the black jersey . " I like it . It 's catchy . " " I just come back from Texas , " adds a third whose face is a complete pink circle , illumined by twinkling blue eyes and a cherubic grin . " How was it ? " " Oh , dandy ! " says Cherub , sarcastically . " Just dandy . Fine trip for your health . A Nazi tin fish chased us for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole time . Saw one destroyer going hell-bent for election into Charleston one afternoon about dusk , but we all figured she was trying to get safe home before dark when the subs come out . " We was carrying fifty thousand barrels of Oklahoma crude and fifty thousand of high-test gasoline . It sure gives you a funny feeling . I thought we 'd get it any minute . Man , those nights are killers ! You sleep with your clothes on . Well , I do n't exactly mean sleep . You lie in bed with your clothes on . All of a sudden the old engines slow down and your heart speeds up . Someone knocks on the door , and you rise right up in your bed and seem to lie there in the air . So it turns out it 's only the watch . You settle down again and try to light a cigarette if your hand do n't shake too much . Not that you 're scared of course . Oh , n000h ! " The others laugh . " Who ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows . " A torpedo connects with one of them tankers and it 's just like lighting a match to cellophane . You ai n't got a chance . Boom ! and you 're in the hero department . Just like that . And the next thing , all the guys you used to know are going around saying , ' Well , he was n't such a bad guy after all . Poor old Joe Bananas ! He lowered the boom on me for ten bucks the last time he was in port and he never did get a chance to pay it back . Let 's have a beer to his memory . ' " Well , let 's have a beer anyway , " says Slim , in the black jersey . " Here , Cherub , it 's on you . You just got paid off . How about springing for another round ? " " Okay , " says Cherub . " Might as well spend it now . It do n't do you no good when you 're floating around in a lifeboat . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights like that . You ca n't believe it . The next morning you come out on deck , and the sea 's Pan-Mass carried 100,000 barrels of gasoline , oil , and kerosene . ( A barrel is 53 gallons . ) Many of the men burned to death as they stood on the deck of the ship ; others died struggling in the blazing sea which was on fire for a mile around the tanker . " The bo'sun was in charge , " said George Lamb , survivor of the Pan-Mass . " He did everything possible to save the lives of all the men . He cut a raft Loose after the men said they were ready . It burst into flames as soon as it hit the water . . . Although I could n't swim I decided to go overboard . I figured it was better to drown than to be burned alive . I said , ' Let 's go , Ingraham . ' He was the steward . He was standing there beside me in his shorts , the skin peeling off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Remember me , Red ! ' I said , ' OK . If I make it , I 'll remember you . . . . ' He was burned to death . . . . " On his final trip Fitz wrote a letter to a man I know . In it he said : " No fooling though , it 's a queasy feeling to be shadowed by those bastards . One of them tried to decoy us off St. Augustine by flashing P , ' which means show your lights . The Old Man zigzagged to hellandgone , and most of us were kidding each other about the false alarm when the Pan Amoco reported sighting a sub at 6 A.M. off Jupiter . ( Our incident had occurred at 11:30 the previous night , 60 miles away . ) We quit kidding then . " He went on to report an incident on his previous trip : " Just as the moon was going down the second mate happened to make the big circle with his binoculars and spotted a sub in perfect silhouette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on watch giving me the shake . There 's a Jerry on our tail , ' he said . All hands get dressed with lifebelts and stand by . ' I got up all right but nothing happened . Later that day the same sub got the India Arrow and the China Arrow , just a few miles from where we were . What burns you up is no guns . You ca n't fight the bastards MAGAZINE back . Luckily this crate is fast , so we can get going ; but on some of them there is n't a damn thing you can do except call the U-boat commander an old meanie ? or something ! Later it comes as something of a jolt to discover that fellows you once knew and were shipmates with are gone for good . Worse yet , without a fighting chance . " Hundreds of other American seamen have had to stand by and watch enemy subs sink their ships from under them without guns to fight back . " You ca n't fight submarines with potatoes , " as Bo'sun Walter Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Carolina coast . The law to arm the merchant marine was signed by President Roosevelt on November 1B , 1941 , but most of the ships which have been sunk have been unarmed . A few which were armed have fought off submarines and either damaged them or frightened them away . Guns are being put on the ships now as fast as possible , but some of the ships are so old and broken down that a gun is almost more of a liability than an asset . As one sailor says , " That rust-pot I just come off , they must of got her out of the Smithsonian Institute ! Sure , we had a gun on her . But Holy Mackerel ! if we 'd ever of had to fire it the whole ship would have fallen apart . " At the insistence of the National Maritime Union , special fireproof lifesaving suits have been approved by the Maritime Commission and are being purchased by all tanker companies . On many of the ships new types of life rafts are being installed , and lifeboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blankets . When the Lahaina was sunk , 34 survivors spent ten days in a lifeboat with a capacity of 17 . Two of them became half-crazed with hunger and thirst , jumped overboard , and were drowned . A third lost his mind completely , had to be lashed to the bottom of the boat , and dicd the next day . A fourth died from exposure . Dan James , nineteen1940 dealt with it : many Americans are familiar with the exploits of Lowell Yerex , who went to Honduras and established an air freight line . But now the pressure of the war and the extraordinary feats of the Germans in transporting both supplies and troops in large numbers by air , have forced the United States into this new development on a great scale . Mr. Sheehan shows how powerful the impetus and how far advanced the sky truck is . The Cessna Aircraft Company and two other aircraft manufacturers have contracts for the manufacture of plywood gliders , intended to be used in tow in air freight trains in the near future . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plains in the Midwest . In a recent address before the Foreign Commerce Club in New York City , Grover Locning , the aviation engineer , predicted that after the war great inroads into rail and ship traffic would be inevitable . It would take only between four and five thousand planes to absorb all the rail passenger traffic in the United States and all the express and mail business as well . " This amount would represent merely a few months of delivery , " said he . " It is clear that to keep the 300,000 pilots that we are going to have at the end of the war at work and the million mechanics also , and in order to use some of the thousands of aircraft that we are going to inherit from this war as well as to keep the factories going in some way after the war ? air will have to invade the heavy freight field of the railroads and the heavy cargo field of the international shipping companies right away . " As for gliders : " We can visualize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train of six gliders in the very near future . " Mr. Sheehan is a graduate of both Harvard College and the Harvard Law School . After practicing law for a stretch he went in for aeronautics . He studied for and obtained a mechanic 's certificate and spent some time working on the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation 's assembly line . After that he worked independently , investigating air freight problems , and then became air cargo expert for the Pan-American Grace Airways . When Pan-American took over the former German air lines in Bolivia and Peru and Ecuador , Mr. Sheehan was closely connected with the operation . He has written numerous articles for the Journal of Air Law and Commerce , American Aviation , and other aeronautical journals . DRAFT BOARDS AT WORK " D RAFTING This Army " is by Frederick Lewis Alden , the Editor of this Magazine ; in April , 1941 , we printed another article by him called " I 'm on a Draft Board , " but because he was then working himself as a board member Mr. Allen used the office pseudonym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer making life and death decisions ? no reference here to the feelings of contributors over rejected manuscripts ? this camouflage is unnecessary . Reasons for the article are numerous . In the first place , the operation of the Local Draft Boards has been one of the big successes of the war effort and small recognition has been made of the fact ; in the second place the amount of work now piled on them is enormous and some assistance is called for in a hurry . Before writing the article Mr. Allen circularized a number of Board members in various parts of the country , urban and rural , East and West . There was a striking unanimity of ( 1 ) criticism of the superabundance of complicated , legalistic , and contradictory bulletins and interpretations from national headquarters ; ( 2 ) objection to the strain and delay caused by the lack of sufficient clerical help ; and ( 3 ) condemnation of the system ( now being abandoned ) of inducting men immediately upon their passing the only effective physical examination . Readers will be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an over-all proposition I am definitely of the opinion that the law is being honestly administered here , that the intent - of the law is being observed , and that although the mechanics of administration suffer from the usual delays and stupidities of any government agency , it is functioning well . After all it was a law designed in peacetime and meant to operate on democratic procedures ; probably no other kind of a law could have passed Congress . Democratic procedures never do too well in wartime and perhaps as the months advance and the need of men grows more insistent , we shall have some curtailment of Local Board authority and a consequent increase of National Headquarters ' authority . I know of no serious charges against us here in the matter of favoritism or graft . Now and then we get an anonymous letter , usually from an indignant neighbor who believes that Joe Doakes next door is escaping service .
