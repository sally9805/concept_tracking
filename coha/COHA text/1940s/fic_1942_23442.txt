THE GREAT FOG A STORY BY GERALD HEARD T HE first symptom was a mildew . Very few people have ever looked carefully at such " molds " ; indeed only a specialized branch of botanists knows about them . Nor is this knowledge except rarely of much use . Every now and then a low growth of this sort may attack a big cash crop . Then the mycologists , whose lifework is to study these spore growths , are called in by the growers . These botanists can sometimes find another mold which will eat its fellow . That closes the matter . The balance of life , which had been slightly upset , has been righted . It is not a matter of any general interest . This particular mildew did not seem to have even that special importance . It did not apparently do any damage to the trees on which it grew . Indeed , most fruit growers never noticed it . The botanists found it themselves ; no one called their attention to it . It was simply a form of spore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did not seem to do any harm to any other form of life . But it did do amazingly well for itself . It was not a new plant but a plant with quite a new power of growth . It was this fact which puzzled the botanists , or rather that special branch of the botanists , the mycologists . That was why they finally called in the meteorologists . They asked for " another opinion , " as baffled doctors say . What made the mycologists choose the meteorologistsfor consultation was this : Here was a mildew which spread faster than any other mold had ever been known to grow . It flourished in places where such mildews had been thought incapable of growing . But there seemed to be no botanical change either in the mold or in the plants it grew on . Therefore the cause must be climatic : only a weather change could account for the unprecedented growth . The meteorologists saw the force of this argument . They became interested at once . The first thing to do , they said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a machine , an indicator . " You know , " said Sersen the weather-man to Charles the botanist ( they had been made colleagues for the duration of the study ) , " the astronomers have a thing called a thermocouple that will tell the heat of a summer day on the equator of Mars . Well , here is a little gadget I 've made . It 's almost as sensitive to damp as the thermocouple is to heat . " Sersen spent some time rigging it up and then " balancing " it , as he called it . " Find the normal humidity and then see how much the damp at a particular spot exceeds that . " But he went on fiddling about far longer than Charles thought an expert who was handling his own gadget should . He was evidently puzzled . And after a while he confessed that he was . " Queer , very queer , " said Sersen . " Of course I expected to get a good record of humidity round the mold itself . As you say , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here unless the extra damp was here too . But look here , " he said , pointing to a needle that quivered near a high number on a scale . " That is the humidity actually round the mold itself ? what we might expect , if a trifle high . That 's not the surprise . It 's this . " He had swung the whole instrument on its tripod until it pointed a foot or more from the mold ; for the tree they were studying was a newly attacked one and , as far as Charles had been able to discover , had on it only this single specimen of the mildew . Charles looked at the needle . It remained hovering about the high figure it had first chosen . " Well ? " he queried . " Do n't you see ? " urged Scrsen . " This odd high humidity is present not only round the mold itself but for more than a foot beyond . " " I do n't see much to that . " " I see two things , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's damned odd . The odd one anyone not blind would see . The other one is perhaps too big to be seen till one can stand well back . " " Sorry to be stupid , " said Charles , a gentle-spoken but dose-minded little fellow ; " we botanists are small-scale men . " " Sorry to be a snapper , " apologized Sersen . " But , as I suppose you 've guessed , I 'm startled . I 've got a queer feeling that we 're on the track of something big , yes , and something maybe moving pretty fast . The first odd thing is n't a complete surprise : it 's that you botanists have shown us what could turn out to be a meteorological instrument more delicate and more accurate than any we have been able to make . Perhaps we ought to have been on the outlook for some such find . After all , living things are always the most sensitive detectors  --  can always heat mechanical instruments when they want to . You know about the mitogenetic rays given out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yeast-cells  --  which multiply rapidly when exposed to therays , thus giving an indication of their range and strength . " " Umph , " said Charles . Sersen 's illustration had been unfortunate , for Charles belonged to that majority of conservative botanists to whom the mite-genetic radiation was mere moonshine . Sersen , again vexed , went on : " Well , whether you accept them or not , I still maintain that here we have a super-detector . This mildew can notice an increase in humidity long before any of our instruments . There 's proof that something has changed in the climate . This maid is the first to know about it  --  and to profit by it . I prophesy it will soon be over the whole world . " " But your second discovery , or supposition ? " Charles had no use for prophecy . These weather-men , he thought ; well , after all , they are n't quite scientists so one must n't blame them , one supposes , for liking forecasts  --  forecasting is quite unscientific . Charles was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said defensively , " that 's nothing but supposition . " And yet , he thought to himself as he packed up his instrument , if it is true it may mean such a change that botany will be blasted and meteorology completely mistified . His small private joke relieved his temper . By the time they returned to headquarters he and Charles were friendly enough . They agreed to make a joint report which stuck severely to the facts . Meanwhile botanists everywhere were observing and recording the spreading of the mildew . Before long they began to get its drift . It was spreading from a center , spreading like a huge ripple from where a stone has been flung into a take . The center , there could be no doubt , was eastern Europe . Spain , Britain , North Africa showed the same " high incidence . " France showed art even higher one . The spread of the mold could be watched just as well in North or South America . Such and such a percentage of shrubs and trees was attacked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific coasts ; but everywhere the incidence was rising . On every sector of the vast and widening circle , America , Africa , India , the mildew was advancing rapidly . Sersen continued his own research on the mold itself , on the " field of humidity " round each plant . He next made a number of calculations correlating the rapid rate of dispersal , the average increase of infestation of all vegetation by the mold , and the degree of humidity which must result . Then , having checked and counter-checked , at last he was ready to read his paper and give his conclusions at a joint meeting of the plant-men and the weather-men . Just before Sersen went up to the platform he turned to Charles . " I 'm ready now to face the music , " he said , " because I believe we are up against something which makes scientific respectability nonsense . We 've got to throw caution aside and tell the world . " " That 's serious , " said Charles cautiously . " It 's damned serious , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he came down the audience was serious too ; for a moment as serious as he . He had begun by showing the world map with its spreading , dated lines showing where the mildew in its present profusion had reached ; showing also where in a couple of months the two sides of the ripple would meet . Soon almost every tree and shrub throughout the world would be infested , and of course the number of molds per tree and bush would increase . That was interesting and queer but of no popular concern . The molds still remained harmless to their tree hosts and to animal life  --  indeed , some insects seemed rather happy about the botanical change . As far then as the change was only a change in mildew reproduction there was no cause for much concern , still less for alarm . The mold had gone ahead because it was first to benefit from some otherwise undetectable change in climate . The natural expectation would then be that insects , the host-plants , or some other species of mold would in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was only the first part of Sersen 's lecture . At that phrase " balance of nature " he paused . He turned from the world map with its charting of the mold 's growth . For a moment he glanced at another set of statistical charts ; then he seemed to change his mind and touched the buzzer . The lights went out and the beam from the stereopticon shot down the darkened haIl . The lighted screen showed a tree ; on its branches and trunk a number of red crosses had been marked . Round each cross was a large circle , so large that some of the circles intersected . " Gentlemen , " said Sersen , " this is the discovery that really matters . Until now , perhaps unwisely , I have hesitated to communicate it . That the mold spreads , you know . That it is particularly sensitive to some otherwise undetected change in the weather , you know . Now you must know a third fact about it  --  it is a weather creator . Literally , it can brew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in each of these circles  --  and I am sure they are spreading circles  --  the mold is going far to create its own peculiar atmosphere  --  a curiously high and stable humidity . The statistically arranged readings which I have prepared and which / have here permit , I believe , of no other conclusion . I would also add that I believe we can see why this has happened . It is now clear what permitted this unprecedented change to get under way . We have pulled the trigger that has fired this mine . No doubt the mold first began to increase because a slight change in humidity helped it . But now it is  --  how shall I put it  --  co-operating . It is making the humidity increase . " There has probably been present these past few years one of those small increases in atmospheric humidity which occur periodically . In itself it would have made no difference to our lives and indeed would have passed unperceived . But it was at this meteorological moment that European scientists began to succeed in making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perhaps the most remarkable of all the war efforts , perhaps the most powerful of all the new defensive weapons  --  against a human enemy . But in regard to the extra-human world which we live in , it may prove as dangerous as a naked flame in a mine chamber filled with fire-damp . For , need I remind you , molds are spore-reproducing growths . Fungus is by far the strongest form of life . It breeds incessantly and will grow under conditions no other form of life will endure . When you play with spore life you may at any moment let loose something the sheer power of which makes dynamite look like a damp squib . I believe what man has now done is precisely that  --  he has let the genie out of its bottle and we may find ourselves utterly helpless before it . " Sersen paused . The lights came on . Dr. Charles rose and caught the chairman 's eye . Dr. Charles begged to state on behalf of the botanical world that he hoped Dr. Sersen 's dramatic remarks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semen had spoken of matters botanical . Dr. Charles wished to say that he and his colleagues had had the mildew under protracted observation . He could declare categorically that it was not dangerous . Sersen had not left the platform . He strode back to the rostrum . " I am not speaking as a botanist , " he exclaimed , " I am speaking as a meteorologist . I have told you of what I am sure  --  the balance of life has been upset . You take for granted that the only balance is life against life , animal against animal , vegetable against vegetable . You were right to call in a weather-man , but that 's no use unless you understand what he is telling you . " The audience shifted offendediy in its seats . It was n't scientific to be as urgent as all that . Besides , had n't Charles said there was no danger ? But what was their queer guest now saying ? " I know , every meteorologist knows , that this nature-balance is far vaster and more delicately poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its environment . Cyclones are brought on , climate can change , a glacial age be begun with atmospheric alterations far too small for the layman to notice . In our atmosphere , that wonderful veil and web under which we are sheltered and in which we grow , we have a condition of extraordinary delicacy . The right  --  or rather the precisely wrong  --  catalytic agent can send the whole thing suddenly into quite another arrangement , one which can well be desperately awkward for man . It has taken an amazing balance of forces to allow human beings to live . That 's the balance you 've upset . Look out . " He studied his audience . There they sat , complacent , assured , only a little upset that an over-excitable colleague should be behaving unscientifically  --  hysterically almost . Suddenly with a shock of despair Sersen realized that it was no use hoping to stir these learned experts . These were the actual minds which had patiently , persistently , purblindly worked the very changes which must bring the house down on their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what might be the general and ultimate effects of their burrowing . We 're just another sort of termite , thought Sersen , as he looked down on the rows of plump faces and dull-ivory-colored pates . We tunnel away trying to turn everything into " consumable goods " until suddenly the whole structure of things collapses round us . He left the rostrum , submitted to polite thanks , and went home . A week later his botanical hosts had ceased even to talk about his strange manners . Hardly anyone else heard of his speech . The first report of trouble  --  or rumor rather ( for such natural-history notes were far too trivial to get into the battle-crammed papers ) ? came from orchard growers in deep valleys . Then fruit growers began to gossip when the Imperial Valley , hot and dry as hell , began to report much the same thing . It was seen at night at the start , and cleared of in the day ; so it seemed no more than an odd , inconsequent little phenomenon . But if you went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every tree seemed to have a sort of iridescent envelope , a small white cloud or silver shroud all of its own . Of course , soon after that , the date growers had something to howl about . The dates would n't stand for damp  --  and each silver shroud was . for the tree about which it hung a vapor bath . But the date growers , all the other growers decided , were done for anyway ; they 'd have made a howl in any case when the new Colorado water made the irrigation plans complete . The increase in humidity would inevitably spoil their crop when the valley became one great oasis . The botanists did n't want to look into the matter again . Botanically it was uninteresting . The inquiry had been officially closed . But the phenomenon continued to be noticed farther and farther afield . The thing seemed then to reach a sort of saturation-point . A new sort of precipitation took place . The cloud round each tree and bush , which now could be seen even during the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join up with the other spreading and swelling ground-clouds stretching out from the neighboring trees . Sersen , who had thrown up his official job just to keep track of this thing , describes that critical night when with a grim prophetic pleasure he saw his forecast fulfilled before his eyes . His last moldering papers have remained just decipherable for his great-grandchildren . " I stood , " he said , " on a rock promontory south of Salton Sea . The full moon was rising behind me and lighted the entire Valley . I could see the orchards glistening , each tree surrounded by its own cloud . It was like a gargantuan dew , each dew-globule tree-size . And then , as I watched , just like a great tide , an obliterating flood of whiteness spread over everything . The globules ran into one another till I was looking down on a solid sea of curd-white , far denser than mist or fog . It looked as firm , beautiful , and dead as the high moon which looked down on it . ' A new Deluge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask who has been right ? Did I not foretell its coming and did not I say that man had brought it on his own head ? ' " Certainly Serscn had been justified . For the morning after his vigil when the sun rose the Fog did not . It lay undisturbed , level , dazzling white as a sheet of snow-covered ice , throwing back into space every ray of heat that fell on it . The air immediately above it was crystal clear . The valley was submerged under an element that looked solid enough to be walked on . The change was evidently so complete because it was a double one , a sudden reciprocal process . All the damp had been gathered below the Fog 's surface , a surface as distinct as the surface of water . Conversely , all the cloud , mist , and aqueous vapor in the air above the Fog was evidently drained out of it by this new dense atmosphere . It was as though the old atmosphere had been milk . The mold acted as a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only this hard curd and the clear whey . The sky above the Fog was not so much the deepest of blues  --  it was almost a livid black ; the sun in it was an intense , harsh white and most of the big stars were visible throughout the day . So outside the Fog it was desperately cold . At night it was agonizingly so . Under that cold the Fog lay packed dense like a frozen drift of snow . Beneath the surface of the Fog conditions were even stranger . Passing into it was like going suddenly into night . All lights had to be kept on all day . But they were not much use . As in a bad old-fashioned fog , but now to a far worse degree , the lights would not penetrate the air . For instance , the rays of a car 's headlights formed a three-foot cone the base of which looked like a circular patch of light thrown on an opaque white screen . It was possible to move about in the Fog , but only at a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a matter of groping about , with objects suddenly looming up at you  --  the kind of world in which a severe myopic case must live if he loses his spectacles . Soon of course people began to notice with dismay the Fog 's effect on crops and gardens , on houses and goods . Nothing was ever again dry . Objects did not get saturated but they were , if at all absorbent , thoroughly damp . Paper molded , wood rotted , iron rusted . But concrete , glass , pottery and all stone ware and ceramics remained unaffected . Cloth too served adequately provided the wearer could stand its never being dry . The first move in the areas which had been first attacked was naturally to move out . But the Fog moved too . Every night some big valley area suddenly " went over . " The tree fog round each tree would billow outward , join up with all its fellows , and so make a solid front and surface . Then came the turn for each fog-submerged valley , each fog-lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of these lakes then rose . Instead of there being , as until now , large flooded areas of lowland but still , in the main , areas of clear upland , this order was now reversed . The mountain ranges had become strings of islands which emerged from a shining ocean that covered the whole earth 's surface right up to the six-thousand-foot level . Retreat upward was cut off . For when the Fog stabilized at six thousand feet it was no use thinking of attempting to live above it . Even if the limited areas could have given footing , let alone feeding , to the fugitive populations , no hope lay in that direction . For the cold was now so intense above the Fog that no plant would grow . And worse , it was soon found to the cost of those who ventured out there , that through this unscreened air  --  air which was so thin that it could scarcely be breathed  --  came alsosuch intense ultra-violet radiations from the sun and outer space that a short exposure to them was fatal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-thousand-foot level stood gaunt as the ribs of a skeleton carcass under the untwinkling stars and the white glaring sun . After a very few exploratory expeditions out into that open , men realized that they must content themselves with a sub-surface life , a new kind of fish existence , nosing about on the floor of a pool which henceforth was to be their whole world . It might be a poor , confined way of living , but above that surface was death . A few explorers returned but , though fish taken out of water may recover if put back soon enough , every above-the-Fog explorer succumbed from the effect . After a few days the lesions and sores of bad X-ray burning appeared . If after that the nervous system did not collapse , the wretched man literally began to fail to pieces . Underneath the fog-blanket men painfully , fumblingly worked out a new answer to living . Of course it had to be done without preparation , so the cost was colossal . All who were liable to rheumatic damage and phthisis died off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pull down the atmosphere-roof which had hung so loftily over his head , but he never learned again how to raise a cover as high , spacious , and pleasant as the sky 's blue dome . The dividing out of the air was a final precipitation , a non-reversible change-down toward the final entropy . Man might stay on but only at the price of being for the rest of his term on earth confined under a thick film of precipitated air . Maybe , even if he had been free and had had power to move fast and see far , it would have been too great a task for him to have attempted to " raise the air . " As he now found himself , pinned under the collapse he had caused , he had not a chance of even beginning to plan such a vast reconstruction . His job then was just to work at mak-ing lurking livable . And within the limits imposed it was not absolutely impossible . True , all his passion for speed and travel and seeing far and quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just begun to feel that it was natural to fly , now was confined not even to the pace of a brisk walk but to a crawl . It was a life on the lowest gear . Of course great numbers died just in the first confusion , when the dark came on , before the permanent change in humidity and light swept off the other many millions who could not adapt themselves . But , after a while , not only men 's health but their eyes became adapted to the perpetual dusk . They began to see that the gloom was not pitch-dark . Gradually increasing numbers learned to be able to go about without lamps . Indeed they found that they saw better if they cultivated this " night-sight , " this ancient part of the eye so long neglected by man when he thought he was master of things . They were greatly helped also by a type of faint phosphorescence , a " cold-light , " which ( itself probably another mold-mutation ) appeared on most surfaces if they were left untouched , and so outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decentralized life worked itself out , men found that they had enough . War was gone , so that huge social hemorrhage stopped . Money went out of gear , and so that odd strangle-hold on goods-exchange was loosed . Men just could n't waste what they had , so they found they had much more than they thought . For one reason it was n't worth hoarding anything , holding back goods , real edible and wearable goods , for a rise in price . They rotted . The old medieval epitaph proved itself true in this new dark age : " What I spent I had : what I saved I lost . " Altogether life became more immediate and , what people had never suspected . more real because less diffused . It was no use having a number of things which had been thought to be necessities . Cars ? You could not see to travel at more than four miles an hour and not often at that , Radios ? Theyjust struck ; either insulation in the damp was never adequate or the electric conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely altered . A wailing static was the only answer that came to any attempt to reestablish wireless communication . It was a low-built , small-housed , pedestrian world . Even horses were too dashing ; and they were blinder in the Fog than were men . As for your house , you could seldom see more than its front door . Metal was little used . Smelting it was troublesome ( the fumes could hardly get away and nearly suffocated everyone within miles of a furnace ) and when you got your iron and steel it began rusting at once . Glass knives were used instead . They were very sharp . Men learned again , after tens of thousands of years of neglect , how to flake flints , crystal , and all the silica rocks to make all manner of neat , sharp tools . Man 's one primary need which had made for nearly all his hoarding , the animal craving to accumulate food stocks , that fear which , since the dawn of civilization , has made his granaries as vast as his fortresses , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freak botanical by-product of the Fog . The curious sub-fog climate made an edible fungus grow . It was a sort of manna . It rotted if you stored it . But it grew copiously everywhere , of itself . Indeed it replaced grass : wherever grass had grown the fungus grew . Eaten raw , it was palatable and highly nutritious  --  more tasty and more wholesome than when cooked ( which was a blessing in itself , since all fires burnt ill and any smoke was offensive in the dense air ) . Man , like the fishes , lived in a dim but fruitful element . The mean temperature under the Fog stayed precisely at 67 ? Fahrenheit , owing evidently to some basic balance , like that which keeps the sea below a certain depth always at 36 ? , four degrees above freezing . Men , then , were never cold . They stayed mainly at home , round their small settlements . What was the use of going about ? All you needed and could use was at your door . There was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no use in trying to seize someone else 's territory . You all had the same : you all had enough . Art too changed . The art of objects was gone . So a purer , less collectible art took its place . Books would not last ; and so memory increased enormously and men carried their libraries in their heads  --  a cheaper way and much more convenient . As a result academic accuracy , the continual quoting of authorities , disappeared . A new epic age resulted . Men in the dusk composed , extemporized , jointly developed great epics , sagas , and choruses , which grew like vast trees generation after generation , flowering , bearing fruit , putting out new limbs . And as pristine , bardic poetry returned it united again with its nursery foster-brother , music . Wood winds and strings were ruined by the damp . But stone instruments , like those used by the dawn cultures , returned  --  giving beautiful pure notes . An orchestra of jade and marble flutes , lucid gongs , crystal-clear xylophones grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean of sand , had had no plastic art , but , instead , a wonderful aural art of chant and singing verse , so the creative power of the men of the Umbra ' Epoch swung over from eye to ear . Indeed , the thick air which baffled the eye made fresh avenues and extensions for the ear . Men could hear for miles : their ears grew as keen as a dog 's . And with this keenness went subtlety . They appreciated intervals of sound which to the old men of the open air would have been imperceptible . Men lived largely for music and felt they had made a good exchange when theypeered at the last moldering shreds of pictorial art . " Yes , " said Sersen 's great-grandson , when the shock of the change was over and mankind had accustomed itself to its new conditions , " yes , I suspect we were not fit for the big views , the vast world into which the old men tumbled up . It was all right to give animal men the open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either they had to be shut up or they would have shot and bombed everything off the earth 's surface . Why , they were already living in tunnels when the Fog came . And out in the open , men , powerful as never before , nevertheless died by millions , died the way insects used to die in a frost , but died by one another 's hands . The plane drove men off the fields . That was the thing , I believe , that made Mind decide we were not fit any longer to be at large . We were going too fast and too high to see what we were actually doing . So then Mind let man fancy that all he had to do was to make food apart from the fields . That was the Edible Mold , and that led straight , as my great-grandfather saw , to the atmospheric upset , the meteorological revolution . It really was a catalyst , making the well-mixed air , which we had always taken for granted as the only possible atmosphere , divide out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're safer as we are . Mind knew that , and already we are better for our Fog cure , though it had to be drastic . " Perhaps one day , when we have learned enough , the Fog will lift , the old high ceiling be given back to us . Once more Mind may say : ' Try again . The Second Flood is over . Go forth and replenish the earth , and this time remember that you are all one . ' Meanwhile I 'm thankful that we are as we arc . "
