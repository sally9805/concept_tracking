" Through your experience in Libya you have gained a knowledge and understanding of military and strategic considerations which will greatly enhance your usefulness to the country as a United States Senator . I can not but feel that you will render more service to the American people by performing the important duties of a Senator rather than devoting your energies to the purely military phases of the war as a junior officer . " <P> Thus wrote precise old ( 73 ) Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to handsome young ( 40 ) Major Henry Cabot Lodge . Senator from Massachusetts , just returned from Libya , where he observed* the first U.S. armed forces that made actual contact with the Germans on land . Long ( 18 years ) a reserve officer , energetic Henry Cabot Lodge has a peacetime history of preparedness . Under a directive issued by the President , Major Lodge-and all other legislators in the armed forces-had to resign either from active duty or from their Congressional posts . Last week Senator Lodge , up for reelection , made the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his press conference that no politics were involved . <P> On the day he returned from Africa , the Army released a communiqu on American participation in the Libyan battle , which Lodge later described to the officers and men at Fort Knox . Said he : " The men who went over from this force were the equal of anything they encountered in the desert . They came out with three tanks , and they left nine less to chase them . The tank that you call the M-3 is the match of anything in the world . " <P> The officers and men at Fort Knox cheered Major Lodge 's news from the front . Then Senator Lodge looked to Massachusetts where , even with the inadvertent pat from Henry Stimson , he has a tough fight ahead to save his Senate seat from aggressive young Representative Joseph E. Casey ( TIME , July 13 ) . <P> <P> * Major Lodge was not in one of the three tanks which actually fought .                @ @ @ @ @
