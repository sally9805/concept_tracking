Britain Can Pay THE PRESIDENT 'S PROPOSAL that we lend arms to Britain may sound strange to a nation bemused by the symbols of money and debt . But , before We pass judgment on it , let us stop to see just what those symbols mean . The job is not easy ; it is like translating from a dead language . But those who like to think in realities rather than in empty phrases may find the task entertaining as well as instructive . Britain started this war with large financial resources in the United States . She now is near the end of her money rope . Though she has not yet spent all she has , the necessary commitments ahead ( it often takes eighteen months or longer between orders and deliveries ) have nearly exhausted her available purchasing power . Britain might borrow from private sources in this country , if it were not for the Johnson Act , which forbids our citizens to lend money to governments in default on former debts . The United States government might legally lend the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Johnson Act , and Secretary Morgenthau has rightly said that he will not act without congressional authority . Ways might be found to finance arms-manufacturers by domestic loans to them . But eventually somebody would have to furnish the cash to repay such loans . Under the Neutrality Act , cash must be paid when the goods are delivered . There was good logic in the Johnson Act . It was not mere stinginess that prevented most of the belligerents in the last war from paying their debts . The money we lent them was spent , not for additions to their national wealth , but for instruments of destruction . After receipt of all these expensive goods , their capacity to produce for peace was not increased one iota . What capacity to pay they did have , we chose not to permit them to exercise . A creditor nation can not get its loans repaid unless it is willing in the long run to accept a surplus of imports . Our economy was adjusted to a surplus of exports ? especially of agricultural products like cotton , wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods necessary for payment , we added enough new courses to our tariff wall to make it higher than ever in history . The Johnson Act was therefore a sign erected which read , " Railroad Crossing . Stop , Look and Listen . The next time any nation wants to borrow to make war , remember that it wo n't want to pay and we may not want it to pay . The best plan is not to make the loans in the first place . " That was , and is , sound common sense . The cash-and-carry provisions of the Neutrality Act were based on a correct analysis of what happened between 1914 and 1917 . The law was , of course , misnamed . It had little to do with traditional legalneutrality , and should have been called , " An Act to help keep us from being drawn into wars that we do not want to enter . " The allied nations in the former war began by eking out their purchasing power in this country through borrowing from private sources . The time came when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our citizens had bought their bonds and would lose heavily if the Allies were defeated . And our industry and agriculture had built on their loan-financed purchases a war boom which would collapse if they could not go on buying . As Ambassador Page pointed out at the time , the only way out was for the United States government to lend the Allies what was necessary . It was assumed it could not do this without entering the War . That was not the only reason we declared war on Germany . But the Neutrality Act , by its cash-and-carry policy , seeks to prevent the unforeseen pressure of trade alone from dragging us into a new war . It does not even try to prevent us from helping another nation at war whenever we shall decide that it is to our national in which terest to do so . It is but another signpost wnicn says , " Before you help again in this way , stop and decide where the national interest lies . " At the beginning of this war we had already gone so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Britain and France enough to repeal the embargo on munitions . It was rightly said at the time that this need not embroil us . Since then , our partisanship in the struggle and the requirements of Britain have increased . But we are on the brink of denying Britain the arms she needs and has been buying , for the irrelevant reason that her means of payment are drying up . Now is the time to make the decisions which the Johnson and ' neutrality laws have defined for us . Most of us suppose that Britain has been " paying " for what she has bought . But what payment have we received ? First of all , gold . Of what use is it ? ' We do not eat it or build houses of it ; or even make it into wedding rings or watch cases . We bury it in Fort Knox . Precious materials and labor hours ? which might have gone toward increasing the welfare of our people ? have been shipped abroad in exchange for something we have to dig cellars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great worry , for it increases bank reserves to mountainous heights and threatens us with a potential uncontrollable inflation . The gold might be of use in the future if there were anything of real value abroad which we wanted and for which foreign- , ers would accept gold in payment . But Hitler won'i. accept it . If Britain loses the war ; the gold standard will go too . Our energies will then have been poured down a rat-hole in Europe , while South African gold , dug and shipped with great pain , will have been poured down a rat-hole here . We are fools to believe that in taking gold we are getting value received . We shall be economic lunatics as well if we allow Britain to be defeated after she has paid us so much of it . We are also being " paid " by bank balances and securities owned in this country by Britishers . Do not the Americans who receive these checks or bonds or other bits of paper acquire titles to solid wealth ? They can buy other bonds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radios or butler-hours . But no international payment is involved unless somebody , sometime , uses an equivalent amount to buy goods from Britain . And that is where the rub comes . Disposal of this British property does just as much to make this nation a larger creditor as if we lent Britain an equivalent amount of money . It does just as much to alter the balance of payments , and of trade . It is as difficult to bring about an excess of imports arising from an international transfer of ownership as it is to bring about one arising from foreign loans . The Johnson Act , to be complete , ought to have forbidden Americans to buy foreign-owned securities in order to help foreigners make war , as well as forbidding them to extend war loans . The chances are that we shall never receive from Britain enough imports to pay the interest and dividends on the certificates of wealth with which some of our citizens are now being " paid . " Such usable goods as we are now importing from Britain , or such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , may be regarded as a real " Your objective will be Tilleygate-on-Sea , Major Bet-tadorf . The natives are said to be unfriendly . " though partial payment for the munitions we are sending her . In so far as we want to buy Scotch , or English woolens or leather , or insurance from Lloyd 's or cargo space in British ships , we can collect . But the simple truth is that in so far as the ordinary signs and symbols of wealth are concerned , we have not been paid anything we want for the war supplies Britain has bought so far , and probably never shall be paid for them . We have been able merely , by going through the proper rituals , to give these things away without troubling our tender business conscience . International trade , say the textbooks of economies ) is fundamentally an exchange of goods and services . Our eye lights on the word services and questions what it may include . The loan of capital is a service . Insurance is a service . Perhaps Britain is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes , ships and tanks . What about the services of the British Navy and Royal Air Force ? What about the Britons who , by fighting and dying in their own interest , also keep Hitler on the other side of the Atlantic in ours ? In furnishing Britain some of the means to do that , we need ask for no other payment . In any event we shall not get any other . The real question burns large and direct , behind all deceptive monetary smoke-screens of a business economy . Is it worth the real cost of munitions-making to strengthen Britain 's hand ? If so , why should we desist simply because she can not return worthless counters ? We might , by tacit consent , adopt some old or new ritual in which we do not believe , just to make things easier for the stupid , or to avoid giving Hitler technical excuse for declaring war on us . We could even put a money value on so much resistance by British sailors and airmen , and match it against the money value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we liked , " lend " Britain money , provided enough , of us were willing to acknowledge in advance that it would not be returned . Or we could adopt Mr. Roosevelt 's simple formula of lending the ships , planes and guns themselves . Any ritual will do , provided we really know what we are about and have weighed the consequences . There is a curious superstition that if we depart from the ordinary business routine Hitler will recognize us as a belligerent and then we shall really be " at war . " This superstition clings to the old world that Hider long since has abandoned . He is smarter than that . He does not split technical hairs about belligerency and non-belligerency , about neutrality and declarations Of war . He knows perfectly well what we are doing . He does not hesitate to attack any nation that is in the way of his purposes , no matter how pure and innocent of intent to offend it may be . If it has furnished no provocation he invents one . If we aid Britain legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is ad one to him . So long as we give any aid to Britain at our
