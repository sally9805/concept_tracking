txt Preventing Railroad Accidents Recent wrecks of passenger trains on two important Eastern railways bring up the question of the importance of careful supervision of roadbeds . The railways have had a long siege of poor earnings and severe losses . According to recent reports , even under present high traffic business , ten Class I roads failed to earn expenses and taxes in the first six months of this year . During the long period when financial losses were suffered by the railroads they reduced their inspection and maintenance staffs to skeleton organizations . There were very few other sources from which savings could be made . The organized labor section of the railway workers have continued to get high pay and are making demands for increases . The unorganized sections of labor generally comprise the maintenance divisions . The maintenance engineering staffs have also been depleted . Now , with heavy traffic resumed on the roads and with sixty to one hundred car freight trains pounding around the curves , there will probably be more serious accidents , unless a way is found to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lean periods .
