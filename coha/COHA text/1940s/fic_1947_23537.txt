SHE 'LL TALK LATER A STORY BY RALPH McGILL Woodcuts by Hans 7elinek H E WAS thinking to himself , " This is not what I thought it would be like , " when the call came through to the Sergeant 's desk . The officers ran out and he followed . They got into the radio patrol car and started . The officer beside the driver was chewing tobacco . Every time he wanted to say more than a sentence he spat out the window . The car was going quite fast into a steady wind . Every time the officer spat , the reporter on the back seat behind him cringed toward the middle and then sat again . He was completing his first week on the job . It was n't corning off , at least not as he had expected . Back in the days when he was in Italy he had trained himself to be quiet under mortar fire by thinking very intently on going back to college and taking journalism . He would think very hard on the details of loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In time he developed a reputation as a fellow who was n't worried under mortar fire , which was something one never got used to . " We always break in our cubs on police , " the city desk had said . He had been filled with instructions about making friends on his beat . But , sitting there on the back seat , cringing away from tobacco juice , the reporter was listening with a deep , sullen resentment to the older officer talk . He was always around the press-room , chewing and talking about himself . " What 's the call about ? " the reporter asked . " It 's a killin ' , a nigger killin ' , " said the older officer . " At least it 's a nigger address . There 's some white trash out there , too . But it 's a dead nigger . You can bet on that . A good nigger , " he added , laughing . " What was that damned street number ? " he asked of the driver . " 9812 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , " we 'll see the crowd in front of the house before we see the number anyhow . " He spat hard and the reporter cringed away , silently cursing himself and the officer . They were going to a shooting . It was very ridiculous , in a way , to be riding in an automobile fast as hell to get to a dead man . It was a quiet afternoon and here they were driving quite fast , with housewives halting their sweeping of porches to peer at the police car speeding by . Motorists pulled into the curb at the sound of the siren . Small boys stopped their play to yell and wave at them and their shrieking noise . " One damned dead man , " thought the reporter . He remembered how , with flooding bitterness , in north Italy , they had cursed the radio and newspaper correspondents for giving the impression that only in France and Germany were there men dying , planes crashing , and guns shooting . It certainly seemed silly to be in the back of a well-cushioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the killer . He found himself trying to remember the sound of one bullet being fired on so quiet an afternoon , but all he could remember was mortar fire . His mood changed and he grinned wryly to himself . If this keeps up , " he said , " I will have to go and get myself adjusted to civilian life . " right on through the gate as the crowd opened up for them . The house was brand new and unpainted . It somehow reminded him of the big , white pine shipping boxes the new motors and parts arrived in at the docks and the supply dumps . T HERE was a woman screaming some- where in the house . He stepped up on the porch . He could smell the pine smell of the new boards , warm in the sun . They went on into the house . Going through he noted , in the front room , two heavy , overstuffed chairs and a table . " Grand Rapids , " his mind said to him , " or High Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a bright rug . It all smelled new . They walked right on through into the next room which was kitchen and dining room . A small new cookstove , a kitchen table with a red-checked cloth on it , and two straight chairs furnished the room . He saw , too , what he had seen through a door in the first room , that there was a door opening into a bedroom . He could just see a double bed covered with one of those tufted bedspreads with a peacock woven into it . The woman screaming turned out to be a Negro girl , about twenty-three . She was n't in the house , but on the small back porch . Two Negro women were standing with her , their eyes big with apprehension . She had on a tan house dress that fitted a bit tightly . She was light yellow and well built . Her face , in the moments between screams , was a good one , with excellent features . When she screamed she would throw back her head and arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her features would relax and she would stare at the floor , crying softly . The reporter realized he was staring at her . He could smell the hot pine smell of the new house , and the unwashed sweat smell of the woman . He had heard wounded men scream and he had seen agony but somehow this seemed to him the most agony he had seen , and something in him resented that , too . There was agony in the sound of the screaming and there was agony in the whimpering sobbing and in the look on her face . Then he remembered . Someone had been killed . He looked around . The two officers were in the back yard . The Bermuda grass was uncut and high ; There was the sprawled figure of a Negro man in the grass . He had on khaki pants and a skivvy shirt . His long-muscled arms , shoulders , and the pillar of his neck looked very brown there in the green of the grass . The reporter went down the steps and out to the two officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a nigger shootin ' , " said the older officer . The dead man looked as if he had died trying to crawl . There was blood on the grass by his body . He did n't look asleep . He just looked dead . The reporter looked back at the girl on the porch . He realized she had stopped screaming . There was a sudden reality of silence . She was looking at them , but with no more of consciousness on her face . " I killed him , " she said , quietly . Then she turned to the two women and said , with a sort of incredulity in her voice , " I killed him . " Two or three white men had come around the house . One of them said : " A nigger out front says they just got married a few months ago . " The older officer turned to the reporter . " Just like I said , they are curious . Once they get killin ' in their heads they got to get it out . She caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill her , too , if she ai n't already done it . I know niggers , son , if I do n't know nothing else . Youpolice as many years as I have , son , and you learn that anyhow . " All about him there was the smell of things hot in the sun , the grass , the people , and the clean smell of the pine . Only the dead man had no smell to compete with the others and that was , he thought , queer . It was odd , too , how the dead man seemed so enormously dead , deader than all the men he had seen flung down by death along the roads and in the fields of Sicily and Italy . The garrulous officer broke away and went up on the porch to the girl . The two Negro women who were with her stood back . He took her by the shoulder and shook her . " Shut up for a minute , " he said . She looked at him dumbly , her throat moving convulsively . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan dress . The young driver came up . " Well , " he said , " you sure as hell shot him dead . Was it another woman ? Did you catch them here at the house ? " The girl was crying again , deep down in her chest . She did n't answer . " She 'll talk later , " said the older officer . " Let 's get going . They got too much animal in ' em , " he said to the reporter , who was watching . " They always got to cheat . " H E TOOK the girl by the arm and they walked back through the hot air of the house . The driver had the pistol . It had been in the grass near the body . They went on out into the small front yard . No one looked back at the house , not even the girl . The reporter wondered at it . The girl seemed to have changed . She was not crying audibly , though her eyes were red and spilled tears slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her face . They halted outside the gate . The crowd fell back a few steps , talking in Iow tones to one another . One of the white men said something to those about him and there were some low chuckles . " Has someone called an undertaker for that boy in the backyard ? " asked the driver . " Yes , suh , " said an old Negro man . " He oughtta be here by now , " " Always a hell of a race between nigger undertakers , " said the elder officer , spitting against the pine fence , directing his explanation to the reporter . He turned to the crowd . " Anyone to look after the house ? " " I got the key . Fm her sister , " said one of the women who had been with the girl on the back porch . " You know something about this shootin ' ? " " No , suh , not exactly , " she said . " Well , you lock up , and come on down to the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . The officer took down the names of the neighbors . " Be sure and lock up or these niggers will steal everything in the house , " he said to the sister , taking the silent girl by the arm and walking her to the car . " Is there a telephone around here ? " asked the reporter . " Mary Jones , up at the corner , she got one , " said the sister . " You go ahead , " said the older officer . " We got ta wait a minute till that undertaker shows . There may be two of them and if there is the sons of bitches will fight sure as hell . You go ahead . But they wo n't want much . They do n't bother much about nigger killin 's . " He went , cursing silently the smug coarseness of the officers . When he came out of the house the car was waiting . He got into the back seat with the older officer and the girl . The girl was between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young driver , laughing , and starting off at high speed , hitting the siren a hard lick . T HE girl sat very still , looking down at her knees . She was not crying and she did not seem to be thinking about anything at all . She was just there . The fat bulk of the older officer caused all three bodies to make contact . He could feel the girl breathing and he suddenly realized she was tense , breathing rapidly and shallowly like a boy in his company whom he had watched die of pneumonia . The reporter asked , quietly : " Why did you kill him ? " She looked at him , thoughtfully , as if weighing him more than his question . " You would n't understand , " she said , finally . " It was something that built up for a long time . " " Was it another woman ? " She looked at him again , weighing him and his question . " No , " she said , " there was no other woman . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was something that I had to do . A little learning is a dangerous thing , " she said , as if originating the axiom . " Learning ? " he asked . " Well , " she said , weighing him again , searching for any sign of condescension , " this was a nigger tragedy in the Greek framework . " She was speaking slowly , spacing her sentences . The older officer was looking and listening , forgetting to spit . " Yes , " said the reporter . " I was a teacher with a B.A. degree , " she said . " We went to school together . He went off to war and he was a good soldier . When he got back we got married and he made me quit teaching . " It was then , " she said , " it started building up . It went on for months . When he came home he was a man with an honorable discharge and the Bronze Star . He was going to stay in the South and show the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it kept building up . There were porters ' jobs and waiters ' jobs and all the while I watched him change from a man to a nigger . Today he came home and cried . A man had hit him and he had just come home and cried . He got up , finally , and took out that German Luger gun . I knew what he was going to do . I sat there until he started out in the yard . Then something came over me and I walked out there . I walked out to him and I took the gun out of his hands and I shot him . He was a race horse with a broken leg , and I shot him . I had to get up out of the chair and do that for him . I could n't let him do it . It had been building up for months and months and I knew , when I saw him walk out , what there was to do . It just built up to that . All the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the curious feeling he was listening to a story he already knew . The officer leaned over . " There ai n't no use trying to figure out niggers , son , " he said . " I know ' cm . You ca n't make no sense out of that . " The reporter did something then that released something in him . Her left handwas down beside her , between her thigh and his . He reached down and squeezed her hand . The girl began to cry again , quietly . Then he did something else . " If you will pardon me , " he said , very politely , leaning across the girl to the officer , " you do n't really know a Goddamned thing . About niggers or anything else . " The officer 's face was flooded with red . He spat out the window and turned , his eyes almost closed shut in his fat , sagging red face . " Okay , nigger-lover , " he said , fighting to hold back his anger , " ohhhhli-kay . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good pavement by now and were going quite fast . The reporter realized he felt fine . It was a good job he had and it had a future . And he knew a GI lawyer and he had plans . He began to whistle a low tune , laughing out loud once as he remembered the look on the officer 's face when he had let him have it .
