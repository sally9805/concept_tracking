txt If ever you wander into the tiny 10 by 29 foot bank building in Point Arena , Calif .. and the man in the teller 's cage tells you that his is the world 's largest bank  --  do n't laugh . The gentleman is telling the truth . For that is a branch  --  the smallest of more than 500 branches  --  of giant Bank of America . And Bank of America . since December . 1945 , has carried on its books more deposits and has made more loans than any other non-government bank on the globe . Now that it has reached the pinnacle , Bank of America has no intention of tumbling down . Although It $5.4 billion deposits now top those of its nearest rivals  --  Chase National and . During this year of reviving competition , how arc the biggest businesses doing ? The Wall Street Journal here examines the largest hank- From trine to time big corporations in other industries will be discussed . National City banks  --  by about $1 billion each , it is digging new footholds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to dote on competition It scrambles against the large eastern banks for loan accounts of industries far from its domain . It vies with Federal agencies for farm loans of all types . It bends its huge stature to compete with small , walk-up loan shops for the patronage of clerks and dishwashers . The result Is an impressive post-war record : In 1946 the bank 's private loan accounts increased 70,0 . It has made over 6070 of all G.I. loans in California . Last year it was successful bidder , alone or in syndicates. on $88 million of California 's $192 million state , county , district and municipal bond offerings Its total loans now exceed $1.9 billion , about $800 million larger than those of either Chase or : National City . That 's not happenstance . Bank of America executives dote on innovations m made them both feared and envied by rival banking brethren . Precedents are Commonplace Bank of America . tor example , claims to have been the first to advertise for loans , the first to send out salesmen to solicit loans it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell to the public a complete consumer loan program ( " Timeplan " ) ; first to exploit the F H.A . loan : first to actively solicit and develop school savings accounts . It has been financing movies since the days when that industry 's product was rightfully called " the flickers ? ' And the bank 's new idea hatchery today is as busy as always . Several months ago , for instance , it inaugurated a new term loan plan for small businessmen  --  on the butcher , baker and candlestick maker level  --  whereby they can get secured or unsecured loans of $500 to $10.000 , with maturities of one to five years . As Goes California Even more important to Bank of America 's growth than the tools it has forged for itself has been the tide of people and industry which has flooded across California 's borders since 1940 The state 's population has climbed from around seven million to nearly ten million , and people still are coming ? at the rate of a quarter million a year . In the crossroads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle CallfornIa 's " second gold rush ' Be  --  ause the bank sprawls over the length and breadth of California . scarcely a citizen lacked the opportunity to be exposed to the bank 's invitation to * ? come do business with us " So for three consecutive years 1042 through 11945 ? deposits grew at the rate of almost $1 billion annually , However , doting the war years , the only major use to which those deposits could be put was in low-intere , t government securities But when the end of the war brought a renewed borrowing demand , Bank of America began swiftly converting its earning assets to loans . In 1916 , first full peacetime year , loans ro " e from $1 billion to 31.7 billion They are still expanding , and now exceed $19 billion . And for e.mti't'te , l loon in , Hank of America officers see two other fields reopening . One is the F 11 A. loan , a pre-war mainstay for this hank that all but disappeared in the war years A low point of $232,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1943. but today F H A. 's are being made at the rate of more than $2 6 million a month . Another is the instalment loan . The Federal Reserve 's Regulation W. which curbs consumer Instalment buying . is expected to be repealed within months This will bring back a field in which Bank of America was preeminent before the war The bank s moist impressive post  --  war performance has been its 0.1 loan business . The bank lest year made more than 60.000 0 I. loans , nearly 00% o. which were for purchases of real estate . Bank of America is proud of Its agility . Before most other banks had made up their minds *shoat policy and action on 0.1 loans it had trained 1.000 men in its branches in the intricacies of the G I. program , had set up a veterans ' counselor in each of its branches , and was launching a broad promotional and advertising program . Bank of America 's G I. loans have been a big factor in boosting its volume of real estate ! Hans sharply In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .7 nitillnn In 1916 , to a total of $730 million  --  or about 42 , - , -a of all loans . The bank has always been known for its liberal lending policies on real estate . Frequently other banks and national banking authorities have complained that it has been too liberal . Especially was that true in the depression of the thirties . The bank constantly is busy drumming up new businesses and industries for California ? which , in the long run . means more business for itself . Its business extension department specialists roam the country , selling companies on the glories of California as a market place for their products . The bank 's tellers watch payroll checks . If they notice an eastern firm paying its California branch employes with checks on an eastern bank , a Bank of America representative will call at the head office and suggest that since the manufacturer is making goods and money In the West , some of his business should go to western banks . The bank 's salesmen scour backwoods farming areas , offering the bank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to town , so the best way to get their Dueness is to go out to the farm . In the auto and appliance fields . Bank of America salesmen help dealers handle and display their goods , and . incidentally , try to install the " Timeplan " program for financing consumer instalment buying . Each branch manager is the local head of the bank 's sales department He is exteee ted to go out and sell loans to businessmen before they even realize their need to borrow . Tellers are expected to sell travelers checks to the client who casually mentioned he is going on a trip . Little Things Into Big There 's still another factor  --  a big one  --  in the bank 's growth ; Its ability to profitably build little things into a big whole Its success with small loans puzzles rivals One grudgingly acknowledges " Bank of America can lend a stenographer $100 and make money on it . " The answer lies somewhere in the complex structure of the bank 's organization . Despite its ponderous hulk . Bank of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made possible by tight organization . swift communications , standardized forms and procedures . and complete , up-to-the-minute fact control . For example , the bank 's pulse is taken constantly . Every day each branch submits a current statement of condition . These are fed into an electric tabulator which swallows them and regurgitates a composite statement . This gives officers a fresh daily reading on the bank 's condition . The bank also keeps a health chart on the individual branches by requiring each manager to submit a monthly profit and loss statement Nerve center of the Bank of America system is the 11th floor of its block-long. 12-story edifice on San Francisco 's Montgomery Street . In a large , walnut-paneled wing the policy makers  --  the executive vice presidents  --  are clustered in the open within easy shouting distance of each other Here all but one or two of the bank 's ruling hierarchy have their desks . Their collective title is " senior management " : employes use the war-coined " top brass " It is here that policy decisions are made and swiftly passed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior management is divided into two committees  --  the managing committee and the general finance committee . The first directs bank operations ; the second directs bank credit policy . These twin spheres of authority extend all the way down to the smallest branch , where is found a branch manager , in charge of lending , and an operations manager , who sees that records are kept , files maintained , and floors are swept A Bank of America branch manager is rarely in doubt about policy or procedure . He has within easy reach the encyclopedia of Bank of America methodology  --  the stAdard practice manual . This beefy , indexed tome outlines pr  --  ctices to be followed in almost strengthened . The bank declared the dividend anyhow . Later , though , it sold $35 million of preferred to Transamerica which turned the stock over to the R.F.C. as collateral . This stock since has been retired . Through most of its history , especially when it was expanding its branch network , Bank of America has been attacked often and bitterly by independent bankers , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Criticism of the bank and its policies probably was greatest during the depression of the thirties . Transamerica stockholders , who were also depositors in the bank . became disgruntled when Transamerica stock dropped from 67 to 2 . By the thousands they closed out their deposit accounts . After the 1933 banking holiday the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco refused to license reopening of the bank , but Mr. Giannini at the last minute appealed the district decision to Washington and succeeded in getting it overruled . Today Bank of America 's ownership is widely scattered . Some 155,482 people own its 8,531,710 shares . Although the bank refuses to disclose percentages of holdings , it says that directors , including the Giannini family , own only a bare fraction of the total .
