The battle was fought in the undulating countryside just west of where the Rhine divides ( into the Waal and Lek ) for its final course to the sea . Here the rich burghers of Utrecht , Rotterdam and Amsterdam once had summer villas and liked to call its pleasant hills and forested hummocks " Little Switzerland . " Here there were three fine towns : Eindhoven , Nijmegen and Arnhem , rich in the histories of ancient wars and in the traditions of peaceful living . And here Allied parachutists dropped behind German units like pieces on a checkerboard hopping over their opposition . <P> But in war , unlike checkers , the enemy pieces that have been hopped over are not thereby swept from the board . They have to be removed by force . It was the job of Lieut . General Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey 's British Second Army to push through on the dotted line traced by the chutists , first to the airborne pioneers who dropped near Eindhoven , next to those at Nijmegen ( the crossing of the Waal ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lek ) . <P> The safety of the paratroopers depended on the Second Army 's speed . And the Second Army 's speed depended in part on the paratroopers seizing bridges so that its tanks and big guns could roll ahead without interruption . The whole was a fine calculation of military risks to gain a foothold across the Rhine . In the first surprise the Second Army pushed to Eindhoven . Thereafter , as often happens in war , the stroke did not go according to plan . <P> Across the Waal . To take Nijmegen ( pop . 95,000 ) and its modern ( less than ten years old ) five-span , mile-and-a-half-long bridge was the task of American paratroopers who were landed south of the town . They found the Germans in command of both the north and south ends of the coveted bridge . Close by the bridge was open space-the tree-lined Hunerpark . Commanding its sweep was a red-brick tower : old Fort Belvedere , a relic of Charlemagne 's reign . The lower floors of Belvedere had in peacetime housed a tea room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belvedere was a fort again . Out of its doors and windows stuck the ugly snouts of German antitank guns . Atop the tower were more guns , snipers , and lookouts . <P> Frontal assault on the tower was impossible for the light-weaponed Americans . Like Indians around a blockhouse they harassed it with fire from trees , doorways , windows . At last three British tanks rumbled up after their 20-mile spurt from Eindhoven . As they arrived the Belvedere 's guns spoke-and all three tanks were knocked out . <P> Not much more time could be wasted on the tower . The U.S. paratroop commander decided to send his men across the river in small , rubber assault boats , to storm the long bridge from the north . <P> The Americans had only 26 boats . They gathered their craft half a mile downstream while British artillery raked the Germans across the river . But when the first force of Americans pushed off , the river splattered around them with machine-gun and mortar fire . Each of the 26 boats carried a dozen men , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bailed with their canteen cups . This time only eight boats returned ( one carried back three dead and four wounded ) . After the third trip there were only five boats . They kept going .
