txt President Roosevelt confirmed reports today that Administration officials were drafting a new anti-inflation campaign , which is reported to include still higher taxes , wage controls , profit restrictions , additional credit controls and a more general exercise of price-fixing powers . The purpose , it was stated authoritatively , is to absorb the $12 , - 000,000,000 to $15,000,000,000 in excess purchasing power which Federal economists estimate will remain from a national income of $110,000,000,000 in 1942 , even if the Treasury 's pending request for a $7,610,000,000 general tax increase and $2,000,000,000 more of Social Security taxes is adopted without reduction by Congress . A note of urgency was sounded in the Office of Price Administration 's statement that " we are in the early stages of a serious inflationary spiral , " which can be stopped " in only one way : an effective , wide-scale government program to stabilize prices . " Sees Higher Living Costs Leon Henderson , Price Administrator , was reported to have esti mated that the cost of living , already up 15 per cent since the war began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 per cent this year unless vigorous steps are taken . The President declined to discuss details of the new effort , declaring that the program has not jelled , but even while he was talking with reporters five officials were meeting in another room of the White - House Executive Offices to , discuss the campaign . The officials attending the meeting were Vice President Wallace , Secretary Morgenthau , Mr. Henderson , Marriner S. Eccles , chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and Harold Smith , Federal Budget Director . They entered and left the White House by side entrances , but one correspondent who caught up with the Vice President and asked him several questions got only the repeated reply : " Not a word , not a word , not a word . " When Mr. Smith was asked to " give us the bad news on taxes , " he smiled and replied : " It will be bad enough . " Skeptical of Present Weapons In the general discussions among officials the primary consideration has been the general feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and price , wage and profit controls . OPA officials have said that inflation added $13,500,000,000 to the cost to the United States of the First World War , and they have estimated that " in this war , if unchecked , it may add $100,000,000 , - 000 . " In discussing plans for channeling aside another $12,000,000,000 to $15,000,000,000 of the national income , officials have been debating first whether the Treasury 's present tax program should be increased materially and , if so , how much the increase should be . It was said that all of the top Administration group except Secretary Morgenthau now favor an increase in the tax bill . Consideration also is being given , it was said , to forced savings and to greater restrictions on credit , which will in themselves have a deflationary effect . The OPA in a question and answer release on " What Is Inflation ? " argued , in effect , for labor support of wage controls , which , in all probability , will be a part of the general Administration campaign . OPA Warns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise more rapidly than prices ? " the OPA replied : " In every inflation in history , wages and salaries have lagged behind the general rise- . That is the deadly danger . Wages seem to be more ; there is actually more money in the pay check . But that increase is more than offset by the rise in prices . So in reality the wage-earner 's standard of living is lowered . " Who suffers most from uncontrolled inflation ? " Every one except the very few . Hardest hit are those who depend for their livelihood on returns from insurance policies , annuities , pensions , money in the bank , bonds , etc . " While their costs go up , up , up , up  --  their income remains fixed . That means less food , no new clothes , a step down in living quarters ? affecting , in many cases , widows , old people , the disabled and others who are unable to work for a living . Wage-earners themselves , as we have seen , are pinched by a rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our children and our children 's childrc ? ? they would suffer , too . " The joint A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . " Combined Labor War Board , " which has opposed Mr. Henderson 's proposal that general wage increases be prevented as an anti-inflationary measure , met again for an hour with the President today , but William Green , president of the A. F. of L. , denied that wage controls had been discussed , although he I said there had been general discussion of the inflation situation .
