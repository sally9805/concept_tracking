Many people know that most of Germany 's army trucks , armored cars , gun carriages and motorcycles roll on synthetic rubber . Fewer people are aware that throughout U. S. industry for some time synthetic rubbers- ; expensive but highly resistant to oil , acid , sunlight , water- ; have been doing many small jobs better than natural rubber can do them . Last week in the U. S. synthetic rubber made news on both these fronts when Standard Oil Co . <P> of New Jersey announced it was ready to make " buty rubber ; B. F. Goodrich Co . <P> announced it would make tires of a new synthetic named " Americanpol " ( see pg . 69 ) . <P> In 1860 a British chemist named Greville Williams broke down natural rubber by distillation , obtained a hydrocarbon compound called isoprene . In 1882 William Tilden , also of Britain , made isoprene by . racking turpentine vapor in a red-hot tube . <P> The Germans , blockaded from the natural rubbers of Malaya and Ceylon , made some solid tires of synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linking molecules together in long chains ) is the key to successful artificial rubber . In natural rubber such molecular chains hold the substance together when it stretches . When chemists stopped trying to duplicate natural rubber 's chemical composition , and set out to duplicate its structure and mechanical action , results followed . <P> Nieuwland &; Neoprene . In 1900 the late Julius Arthur Nieuwland , Belgian-born chemist , Catholic priest and longtime teacher at the University of Notre Dame , made a poisonous black tar by treating acetylene with metallic chlorides. - At a scientific meeting in 1925 Nieuwland described one of his experiments producing acetylene rubber . A Du Pont chemist heard him , started his company on the trail . With Nieuwland 's collaboration Du Pont workers made a good rubbery material first called DuPrene , now neoprene , which is highly resistant to oil . Its dozens of uses include hose linings , gaskets , conveyor belts , rubber gloves , printing plates , refrigerator seals , hospital sheeting , sink scrapers . <P> Butadiene . Germany 's butadiene rubber ( better known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make commercially in 1936,15 versatile . Treated with one chemical , it becomes impervious to oil and heat ; with another , it makes a tough , durable rubber for tires . Like neoprene , it is made from acetylene ( a product of coal and limestone ) . It costs less than neoprene . <P> Goodrich 's " Ameripol " is a butadiene rubber , but it is made by cracking petroleum , of which the U. S. has plenty , Germany hardly enough . Cracking yields a gas , which liquefies to give butadiene under pressure . Standard Oil 's butyl rubber is also a butadiene from oil-cracking . Last year Chicago 's Universal Oil Products Co . <P> announced development of a process by which it expected to make butadiene rub ber from butane for only 20 a pound .
