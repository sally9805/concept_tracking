In a driving rain , at Britain 's seacoast town of Deal , the Mayor and a handful of raincoated freemen gathered to pay solemn tribute to a conqueror . The occasion : the unveiling of a memorial tablet to Julius Caesar on the 2,000th anniversary of his invasion . <P> The London Times also delivered itself of some occasional thoughts : " Britain , as much as any nation of the modern world , has learned the Roman lesson and followed in the Roman path . It may be fanciful to imagine that any afflatus of high statesmanship passed from Caesar to his noble and valiant adversary Cassivellaunus , or that by any mystical communion a spark of the Virgilian light of empire was tended through the centuries in Merlin 's cave . Yet somehow the grand ideals of Roman dominion have not been lost in the modern world : jus , the conception of a law that should transcend the limitations of the small people who first conceived it , and become at last the guarantor of justice to all sorts and conditions of men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all manner of races , languages and faiths to live together within the bounds of a single system of ordered rule , and of a citizenship that , though it may begin as the privilege of a governing race , will gradually be extended until it is enjoyed by all ; and pax , the product of the other two , the belief in the mission of imperial government , based evenly upon the foundations of justice and national authority , to bring in the golden age when war shall cease from the earth . <P> " Jus Romanum , Imperium Romanum , Pax Romana-by changing the adjective Britain has given to each of them a changed flavor and connotation . But that is only because the tradition at the heart of them is a living thing , and grows continually . After two thousand years an imperial people can with a clear title claim its spiritual ancestry . "
