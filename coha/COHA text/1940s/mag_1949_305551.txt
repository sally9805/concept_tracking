( See Cover ) <P> Last week " Former Naval Person " Winston Churchill spat angry words against a high wind . The Labor government , said he , " has forced the British people to live in a fool 's purgatory upon the generous grants of free enterprise , capitalist America . . . If we are to earn our daily bread in the world , it can only be through the strongest possible individual effort and ingenuity arising from conditions of freedom and fair play . " <P> As broad prophecy , this last might turn out to be true . Churchill , however , had designed the statement for use in a by-election at Sowerby . Presumably , it was intended to win votes for the Tories . It was not likely to do so . <P> If Socialist Britain was a " fool 's purgatory , " millions of Britons were the fools . They liked it-at least they liked it better than what they thought the Tories would give them . As the anti-Socialist Economist recently said : " Instead of standing forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have allowed themselves , by talking in generalities about abstract principles such as ' freedom ' and ' enterprise , ' to be represented as the captious remnant of a bygone social order . . . They have treated the rise of Socialism as an aberration from the normal British way of life , instead of recognizing that the Socialist ideal of the welfare state is very closely in tune with the ideas of a frustrated and war-weary nation . " <P> Not in Britain alone , but throughout the world , the welfare state was on the rise . Even the U.S. , which had a more or less undeserved reputation as the last great citadel of individual independence , was entering a new phase of its long debate over socialized services . One of the warmest issues in the U.S. at the moment was socialized medicine . <P> Long Way from Locke . A few weeks before Churchill 's blast , Britain 's new socialized medicine scheme had survived its first major test in the House of Commons . Its champion , Aneurin Bevan , Minister of Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of the House ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . This did not prove that Britain 's socialized medicine plan was good medicine or good social organization . But the debate 's results did prove that socialized medicine was what the British voters wanted . <P> In Britain , at least , there was no longer any point in warning citizens that they were selling their birthright of freedom for a mess of pottage . Bevan , the bulldog breed 's new vet , could reply that Britons could eat tastier , tougher fare than pottage now that they had got new false teeth from the health service . As TIME 's London Bureau Chief Eric Gibbs cabled : <P> " For too long ' free enterprise ' seemed to mean only that the British employer was free from responsibility for his employees ' welfare . Now the state comes to these undernourished men &; women , provides their children with orange juice , cod liver oil and milk , sends the doctor when they are sick . These people wo n't listen to any man who tells them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of their initiative by all this coddling . They will look at their healthier children and will call that man a liar .
