Everybody seemed to want a U.S. visa . In 14 U.S. consulates , from Halifax to Vancouver , hard-pressed clerks interviewed Canadians , laboriously filled out long forms , took fingerprints of prospective new Americans . Last week consular officials paused to look at the record . In the last six months of 1945 they had okayed permanent visas for 8,767 Canadians , turned down thousands of others . If the present pressure continued , 20,000 Canadians will migrate to the U.S. in the 1945-46 fiscal year . Not since 1931 had so many Canadians pulled up stakes and moved south . <P> Officials did not have far to look for the reasons behind the increased emigration : 1 ) relaxation of the wartime Canadian law requiring a labor permit to leave the country ; 2 ) easing of exchange restrictions on taking money out of Canada ; 3 ) increased urban unemployment in the Dominion ; 4 ) continuation of rigid Dominion wage controls , and higher prevailing pay scales south of the border . <P> What worried Canadian authorities most was the sharp increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional , clerical and other white-collar categories had shown the biggest rise of any group , 2,232 issued in the last six months of 1945 , compared with 1,770 in the year 1944-45 . <P> For Canada this posed a major problem .

Now the stream was rising again .
