Mrs. Riggs &; Mrs. Wiggs <P> Sirs : <P> I have long wondered why the average person thinks that Kate Douglas Wiggin wrote Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch . Now he legend has got into print ( TIME , July 15 ) . ... <P> It is true that Wiggin suggests Wiggs , but this coincidence does not constitute authorship . Wiggs , in turn , is very like Riggs , which was Kate Douglas Wiggin 's name in later ife . But she certainly did not live in ... Alice Hegan Rice 's Cabbage Patch . <P> RUTH WILCOX <P> Cleveland <P> TIME 'S National Affairs editor was momentarily woolgathering on Kate Douglas Wiggin 's Sunnybrook Farm . - ED . <P> Greetings from the Southland <P> Sirs : <P> ' Buttinsky Damyankees " ( TiME , July 15 ) That is just what re-elected Senator Bilbo to another term in the Senate . He may be all that you say he is or say is not , but it is none of the business of ... damnedyankees . <P> You should keep in mind the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 80 years of our national life , Southern men were the leaders of the nation . You think you are better than anybody who lives in the South , and you never lose an opportunity to " rub it in " on the Southern people . <P> If you had any political sense and had stayed out of the campaign in Mississippi , Bilbo would have been defeated . . . . <P> E. E. PATTON Knoxville , Tenn . <P> The Human Animal Differs <P> Sirs : <P> As a psychologist , I can not refrain from commenting upon " The Carrot and the Stick , " the article from the London Economist which you quote approvingly ( TIME , July 15 ) as " some simple , understandable words to the British people . . . . " <P> Besides being vulnerable upon other counts this folksy little essay is hard to surpass as an example of the oversimplification that passes for psychology among so many economists and political scientists . It is an impeccable discussion of the motivation of the donkey , but used in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to make jackasses of themselves . <P> Certainly man is motivated by fear of hunger and desire for gain-by the stick and the carrot if you will . But the oversimplification and the error is the assumption that these are the necessary motives to human social action as they may be for donkey biological action . <P> When will it be understood that the human animal differs from other animals-notably the donkey in this connection-in that perhaps his strongest motivation is desire for prestige , status , the approval of his group ? Is the businessman who gives up a $50,000 a year job to become a college president at $15,000 motivated primarily by fear of hunger or desire for material gain ? . . . Are college professors motivated by the carrot ? The truth is more nearly that they labor for ego-satisfaction in spite of a paucity of carrots in their chosen academic course . . . . Whatever is the case for the donkey " , the incentive for human behavior need not be material gain . . . . <P> LEO P. CRESPI Assistant Professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> . . . Concerning your interesting article on Manuel Acuna Roxas , somebody took too big a puff for me . TIME ( July 8 ) stated that Roxas smokes five packs of cigarets ( Camels and Kools , no less ) a day .
