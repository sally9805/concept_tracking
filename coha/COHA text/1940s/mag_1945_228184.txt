It has an unorthodox five instead of four movements , but is shorter ( 25 minutes ) than most symphonies . Shostakovich , who wrote it in ten weeks after three false starts , was afraid his frail little Ninth would not stand up against Beethoven 's great Ninth ( " a frightening responsibility " ) or the critics .
