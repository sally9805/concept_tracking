Good-By , Bootleggers By DAVID G. WITTELS and J. FRANK BEAMAN TANISLAUS ORION has quit bootlegging . It S took a global war , a critical shortage of fuel oil , some common sense and many sticks of dynamite to break him of the habit . But at last Stanislaus is back in the company mines in the turbulent Pennsylvania anthracite fi . his , working six days a week to produce anthracite for more than 6,000,000 homes and an increasing number of war factories . The bootleg-coal problem  --  one of the most fantastic episodes in American economic history  --  seems over . This is fortunate , important news not only to the coal companies and the 1,000,000 people directly or indirectly dependent upon anthracite for a living . Anthracite must now take up the heating-and-power gap left in New England and the Middle Atlantic Staters by the oil shortage . " Anthracite is a lighting fuel , " says the WPB , and Donald M. Nelson recently declared , " We could lose the war without coal . " Stanislaus Orion , whose bootlegging for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an important war worker . Stanislaus was for eleven years the strangest kind of bootlegger . He went out into the back yard and dug a bole in the ground . He kept digging until he struck avein of coal  --  hard , shiny anthracite  --  the kind they call " black diamonds . " He dug out that coal and he sold it . The cohl companies called him u " thief , " his neighbors called him a " coal bootlegger , " and he called himself an " independent miner . " Legally , it was not his coal and he had no right to mine it or sell it . But the power of public opinion triumphed over the letter of the law , as it did in prohibition , and Stanislaus Orion and 1-1.000 others got away with it until they were selling 7,000,000 tons a year in competition with the coal companies which owned it . The industry , already tottering under the competitive blows of fuel oil , gas and coke , was in desperate straits . How could such a preposterous situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a mole in the ground , seriously endanger so great an industry ? There are two major reasons , and they also explain why it took eleven years of name-calling , bloodshed and near disaster before Mark W. James , then Pennsylvania State Secretary of Commerce , was able to cajole and bludgeon both sides into a sensible solution which he figured out for them . One reason lay in the pigheadedness , suspicion and quickness toward violenceon both sides . The other was that the roots of the problem lay deep in the history of the anthracite empire , which was born when nature placed 90 per cent of all the anthracite on this continent in a 984-square-mile area of folded valleys in Northeastern Pennsylvania . Legend says the use of anthracite was discovered by Necho Allen , a hunter , who noticed the ground glowing with steady heat where he built his campfire one night near what is now Pottsville . The first violence and suspicion that were to mark its history for nearly 150 years came when traders freighted it on barges to Philadelphia and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foist " black rocks " on the public as fuel . After a while , however , it caught on . The " black diamonds " became the nation 's major fuel and shaped our industrial future . Later , moat of the industrial market went to softer , more widely available bituminous , but anthracite 's domestic market grew until production hit 100,000,000 tons in 1917 . When people spoke of King Coal , they meant anthracite . But King Coal was a despot , and not even a benevolent one ; and so he lost his throne . The industry , figuring it had a monopoly , treated the customers shabbily . The coal operators made no concerted effort to sell their product or even to make it easy to get and use . There was no advertising to speak of , and no research fur better , more convenient ways fur the cue-turners to burn the product . Prices fluctuated wildly and sometimes soared outrageously . Long-drawn-out strikes caused shortages in the dead of winter and spread serious suffering from Maine to Washington , 1 ' D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it or it was too high . There may be an object lesson for other industries in the result . The door was opened wide to trouble , and trouble , never bashful , walked right in . It came primarily in the form of oil . There was a surplus of oil in this country shortly after World War I. The oil people promptly waged an aggressive campaign to sell the surplus oil as heating fuel . They advertised extensively and spent money developing oil burners . The shortsightedness of the anthracite industry in the face of this threat is almost incredible . It did nothing to combat it . Instead it raised the price of its product . The price rase 70 per cent from the wartime high of 1917 . The small-home dweller , who was the major user of anthracite , cut his consumption . The price was so high that the cost-to-consumer differential between anthracite and oil almost disappeared . The oil people exploited this situation thoroughly . They plowed back a good bd. of their revenue into a further campaign of selling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cut deeper into anthracite 's market . To top thin ai lauition , the United Mine Workers Union , eying the high prices rather than dwindling sales , went on strike in 1922 and 1925 . These strikes were titanic clashes between equally pigheaded giants  --  John L. Lewis and the coal operators .. As usual , the public got hurt . But in the long run hut h the miners and the operators were hurt most , for more customers were driven into the eager arms of oil , gas and coke . By 1932 production and sales were less than half their 100,000.000-ton peak . Of the more than 150,000 miners whu had worked five and it half days each week , now only half were employed , and these only part time . Desolation and distress settled upon Lhe region worse than in any comparable section of Lhe country . And that 's how coal bootlegging was born . In the winter of 1931 , a few unemployed miners began digging coal on their own . They peddled it in carts , in burlap bags stowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have reached 200.000 tuns that year ; nobody knows . And nobody cared much , Then a bolder soul got hold of a big truck . Instead of peddling the coal in the region For less than half price  --  freight charges are a big part of the cost of cool  --  he began taking it to Philadelphia . Underselling the retail yards by Lwo , three and more dollars a ton , he found a ready market . Soon there were men who never had worked in coal mines , but who could beg , borrow or make a down payment on a truck , busily hauling bootleg coal . As these truckers widened the bootleg market to include New York , . Jersey City . Newurk , Trenton , Wilmington , Delaware . Baltimore and places between , more unemployed miners begun to dig in their brick yards and near-by coal binds . The whole southern section of the area , where the coal lies comparatively close to the surface , became pitted with gupherlike holes in which men risked their lives and laboriously scrabbled out coal By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , many close to bankruptcy , became seriously alarmed . This new threat . they tackled vigorously . They tried to prosecute the bootleg miners for trespassing and larceny . In coal regions , leases and titlea specifically state that mineral rights arc not included when a man buys a piece ul Land to build a home . The company owning the mineral rights may dig coal right under his house if it wants . and if this causes his house to sink into the ground , that is his hard luck . Hundreds of homes have been destroyed or damaged this way , and whole parts of anthracite-region cities have sunk from six inches to six feet without any redress . On Lhe other hand , even if a man dug coal from the back yard of his own home , he could be prosecuted for larceny . That is , theoretically he could . In actual practice in this situation , it did not work out that way . The local police , who were neighbors and friends of the coal bootleggers , refused to act . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , magistrates let them go . In the rare cases where the companies could prevail on magistrates to hold bootleg miners for court , juries refused to convict . The region made it plain where its sympathies lay . ' Phis mass shift in ethical viewpoint merits serious study by sociologists . These ( Continued on Pape 441 GOOD-BY , BOOTLEGGERS ( Continued from Page U ) people were , in the main , as hard-working , law-abiding folk as any in the country . They knew this coal belonged to the coal companies and that the bootleg miners were breaking the taw in taking it and selling it . Yet they not only condoned but encouraged . That they felt sorry for all these unemployed miners and their families is only part of the answer . Another part is that these miners felt they had a vested right in the coal . fields . Their neighbors agreed with them . Coal mining is not only is dirty , arduous trade but a highly skilled one . Coal miners are proud of their craft , and , as often as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these miners had their roots deep in the region . Their ancestors had been imported by the coal companies to do this work . First there were the English and the Welsh , with a smattering of Scots , brought from the coal pits of England and Wales . where coal mining was an ancient occupation . Then there were the Irish hz the many thousands , and a few Germans and Swedes . And finally the Poles and Slays , and a dash of Italians . They had learned their trade , a great many of these men , from their fathers , who had learned it from their fathers before them . Born in that region , they had married and built their homes there , and sent their sons into the same mines . They knew no other trade , no other place . They did not try to comprehend cost sheets or lost markets . They knew only that here were they . ready to work ; and there were the mines , with coal to be dug . And suddenly no work for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer one afternoon in 1935 . His part of the Heckscherville Valley was one of the few spots that did n't look as if the Battle of the Marne had been fought over it . Its greenness was a rare sight in this desolated region of monstrous heaps of discolored culm , refuse of decades of wasteful mining ; of outraged earth . gouged and torn by strip mining , wherein gigantic , nightmarish steam shovels bite open the surface to get at the coal lying from 20 to 200 feet below . Patrick Maloney 's face was grimed with coal dust . The black failed to hide completely the blue scars of a powder explosion deep in a mine many years ago . His hands were gnarled and horny , with the black of coal driven deep into and under the skin during the years . The back door of his weather-beaten frame home ! looked out toward a mine on the mountain two miles away . Maloney had spent forty of his fifty-four years working in that mine , and his father had worked there an even fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no work for him . And so . not twenty paces from his back steps , he dug a bootleg coal hole . Coal From a Back Yard And what is a man to do ' " asked Maloney , the brogue thick upon his tongue despite his birth here . " Ts he to starve ? Are his wife and children to starve ? " The bootleg mine he and his two boys built was a crude , primitive affair . Two stout saplings sunk into the ground , braced by two-by-fours and topped by a hefty crosspiece , supported a hand-operated windlass arrangement . A rope descended into a hole in the ground . When the older son was ready to go down , he clung to the rope and was lowered . His tools went down after him , 000 living there whose income did not depend , one way or another , in whole or in part , On anthracite . The people realized this , and paid proper tribute to King Coal . Anthracite was the major topic at the luncheon clubs . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing of a mine , the number of tons mined per day , per week , per month , per year ; the price of coal , the approach of cold weather , the threat of warm weather  --  all these were front-page news . They still are . There used to be an Anthracite Lingerie Shop in Tamaqua . A dozen movies in the region proudly proclaim themselves The Anthracite Theater . There is an Anthracite Candy Shop in Pottsville , and a Black Diamond Food Store in almost every town . In the lobby of one of the best hotels is a ton-and-ahalf chunk of coal , displayed on a ped ( tidal . The swankiest cocktail room in the region is a startlingly realistic imitation of the interior of is coal mine , The taxes levied on the mines and lands and breakers of the big coal companies paid for the biggest part of the Coat of the schools , the roads and sewers and civic buildings , and in many cases the companies justifiably complained that the communities built extravagantly with their tax money . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the region flowing . The stores , the service businesses , the movies , the churches and even the banks depended upon money going into and out of the miners ' pockets . With half the miners out of work , and the other half working only part time , the business of the region was dying . Black-Caunfry War When some of the unemployed miners turned to bootlegging coal , they brought new money into their communities . Business immediately felt the transfusion , pitifully inadequate as it was . The businessmen , the municipal authorities , and even some of the smaller banks , therefore , quickly lined up in defense of the coal bootlegger . The region 's concept of ethics swung so sharply that in one community a pastor and his flock dug coal back of the church not only to heat the church but to get money to repair the church and feed the pastor . The coal companies tried seizing the holes forcibly and dynamiting them shut . The bootleggers , by now numbering thousands , set up an alarm system whereby the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest fire siren sounded , at the approach of the company police . The alarm would bring hundreds of bootleggers crawling from their holes and clambering over the mountains and ridges . There was bloodshed , thoiigh surprisingly little . The companies asked the governor for state troopers , and a couple even demanded martial law . The governor sounded out sentiment , appointed a commission to make a study . then decided to keep hands off . The situation was too loaded with dynamite , politically , figuratively and literally . Dynamite is something a tamer uses every day in his work , and so it has become his natural weapon in brawls , strikes and against his enemies . The companies were stymied . All efforts by thoughtful men of the region and by cool-headed outsiders to settle the problem by peaceful negotiation and compromise failed . The operators stood pat on their declaration that these men were simply thieves . The bottleggers remained bitterly stub- born . Thus this fantastic situation  --  an illegitimate industry within an industry  --  grew swiftly and flourished . The roads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night with trucks hauling bootleg coal . Many were emnshed and dozens of drivers killed , and many bootleg miners died trapped in their primitive holes . One year seventy-four of them died thus . The picture grew worse and worse , with no end in sight . But the character of coal bootlegging changed . After a while it became a big business . By 1939 the scene was far different from the sprinkling of small holes in the ground like the one dug by Patrick Maloney . One bootleg bole was so big it employed fifty-five men . It . utilized heavy machinery and modern methods , and was really a regular mine on a smaller scale . Though the overwhelming majority were still small , with from one to six men scrabbling n bare living from them , quite a few employed ten or more . Worse , the " ownership " of these holes passed in many cases from the men who dug them to men with no other qualifications than that they had hank rolls . There was a case of a man who owned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven trucks which he rented out to the WPA , and three bootleg holes which unemployed miners operated for him . A survey directed by R. Y. Williams , ( Canrenaeci from Poo , 44 ) famous mining engineer , revealed an undertaker , a high-school teacher , a football coach , a woman , and a German seaman from a Nazi ship interned at New York working in bootleg holes . Worse still was the rise of big bootleg breakers , financed almost entirely by men who had no previous connection with coal , and who included a few former liquor bootleggers . The Patrick Maloneya and the Stanislaus Orions no longer broke their bootleg coal by hand . They sold it in the rough to big bootleg breakers which did the job mechanically . Often the men who owned the breakers also owned the trucks which took the coal to market . The real money in bootleg mining was now going to men who did not have even the excuse of following the only trade they knew , and of joblessness and hunger . There was a tale that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootleg coal . Others blossomed out in new cars , diamond rings and mink coats for their wives . Coal bootlegging began to take on an aura of racketeering even to most of its original defenders . Meanwhile the coal industry was having further troubles . Harassed from all sides , the operators turned to suicidal price-cutting , each trying to grab from the others what was left of the legitimate market . Most of the price-cutting was out of desperation due to overproduction . At a bitter , brawling meeting in Wilkes-Barre , the operators agreed something had to be done . The result was a production-control plan . This was to be a means for the rehabilitation of the industry , and , although the operators did n't realize it then , it was to furnish a framework for the solution of the bootleg problem . Under this plan , a commission was to set weekly production quotas and allocate to each producer a percentage of that quota . Over the plan , however . hung the shadow of Thurman Arnold and the antitrust laws , for the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 7 , 1941 , the governor of Pennsylvania signed a bill which put the plan under the wing of the state , on the theory that the purpose was conservation of mineral resources . Thurman Arnold , if he ever intended to do anything about it , was balked . The fact that the major anthracite operators recently were indicted as violators of the antitrust laws does not stem from or affect this production-control plan . The indictments accused them of more direct price-fixing tactics at secret meetings in New York The production control brought Mark James , as Secretary of Commerce , officially into the scene . He sat as chairman of the Anthracite Committee , which set the quotas . Ho had been struggling for a solution of the bootleg problem for months , but now , as the prime minister of the empire of King Coal , his arguments carried authority . Himself a miner in his Kentucky boyhood , and afterward an industrial engineer and businessman , he approached the problem with a level head and real objectivity . His solution and the campaign he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " to sell a man something , you first must make him want it . " The solution he set out to sell ran something like this : 1 . If the operators promised to hire bootleggers with legitimate mining experience as fast as possible , each operator would be allowed two and a half tons per day above his allotted quota for each bootlegger he hired . 2 . The bootleggers promised to police coal bootlegging themselves , by seeing to it that no new holes were opened and no new bootleg breakers erected . 3 . Bootleg holes to be dynamited or otherwise destroyed as soon as the men working in them were hired by the coal companies , or the holes were abandoned for other reasons . 4 . The coal companies agreed to buy bootleg coal from the bootleggers pending job openings , and the bootleggers promised to sell their coal to the company breakers . The last point was the first to be ac-cepted . This was because some of the marginal operators were already buying bootleg coal on the sly , since they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate mines . The bootleggers liked the idea because it gave them semilegitimate status and because the bootleg breakers had been cheating them . At one blow this virtually smashed one of the major props of the racket ? the big bootleg breakers . But to put the ICenrinead from Page 461 whole plan over required many long months of cajoling , arguing and bludgeoning . When James first approached the operators , they promptly demanded that the state close the bootleg holes forcibly . You ca n't go in there with the Army , " James told them . " You ca n't force people . The whole United States Government could n't put prohibition across . You must make them want it . " At long last he wrangled Points I and 4 from them on a Limited-trial basis . James ' next step was In undercut the bootleggers ' hacking among the businessmen and civic leaders by showing that bootlegging was keeping new industry away . At various meetings he revealed that a large company refused to start a plant in the region even when offered a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He read them a letter from a big manufacturing company which flatly refused to build a plant employing 5000 in the region because " we would n't dare make such an investment in a section where conditions such as stealing coal are permitted . " The businessmen , realizing that the future of the area depended considerably on attracting new industries , swung away from the bootleggers and behind James They began to clamor for an end to hoot legging . The bootleggers were hardest to reach . James ranged the area , preaching and proselyting among the bootleg miners themselves . He called meetings and climbed the mountains to seek out the men in their holes . He pleaded and threatened . The major break came at an almost all-night session in Shenandoah . He addressed a group of grim-faced , suspicious bootleg leaders , urging them to swing their groups behind his plan . " Think of your children , " he pleaded . " After all , what are you working for ? What am I working for Primarily for our children . Your sons and daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanks there will be many questions . ' Where do you come from ? ' And when they answer Shenandoah , or Shamokin , or Pottsville , the employers will know they come from bootleg sec ? lions , and wu n't want them . What does year father do ? ' Do you want your sons and daughters to have to answer : He is a coal bootlegger " ? " James won his fight . He made all concerned want to end bootlegging . Over from Shemokin , Joseph Agor , emaciate editor of the Shamokin News-Dispatch and one of the most thoughtful and beet-informed men in the region , brought a delegation of bootleg leaders to Harrisburg to confer with James and the operators . The men trusted Agor . He wrote out a brief memorandum embodying the substance of James ' proposals . Finally , the men signed it . Anthracite Armistice There were 3000 active holes when that memorandum was signed late last summer . By the end of 1942 , some 2000 had been dynamited shut or otherwise made useless , and more . than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output of the remainder was going to company breakers . Some 2000 bootleg miners had been hired by companies in the southern section alone . No new holes or breakers had been opened . Barring a worse collapse of the industry , the bootleg problem seems solved . Legitimate production in 1942 leaped to 57,000,000 tons . Fuels Co-ordinator Ickes says he wants 65,000,000 in 1943 . A comparative prosperity now pervades the anthracite region , which , during the worst years , had the highest percentage of people on relief and the WPA in the country . WPA rolls were down last fall to one third of what they were in the fall of 1938 . The number of people on relief went down from about 80,000 at the end of 1936 , to fewer than 6500 , of whom 87 per cent were unemployables , last December . Bank clearings were up sharply , recent Christmas sales were the best since 1929 , and it is hard to find parking space on coal-city main streets on Saturday afternoons and nights . Paradoxically , the problem now is experienced manpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coal lies too deep for bootlegging. and where more miners . therefore , gave up and left during the lean , bitter years . In the southern section there still are unemployed miners , but it is next to impossible to get them to move a few miles north . This is because the coal miner , though among the most ingenious and handy of workmen , is a man sot in his ways when it comes to his native trade . The miner in the southern section , where the coal veins pitch sharply , averaging forty degrees , looks down his nose at the fiat mining in the northern section , where the veins Lie almost level . And he wo n't do fiat mining . In the northern section the shortage is so serious that the powerful United Mine Workers Union relaxed its rules to permit a six-day week . An Anthracite War Production Board is at-aging an intensive campaign to coax greater production by means of movies , pep talks , ads , posters and even star-studded lapel pins for minem chalking up twenty-five , fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Army has staged War Shows and sent soldier , sailor and marine heroes into the mines to convince Stanislauss Orion and Patrick Maloney that they are as important to the war effort as the men on the firing lines . King Coal 's Convalescence King Coal is sitting up and taking nourishment again , despite a relapse such as the recent outlaw strike which was ended by President Roosevelt 's intervention . How long will the recovery last ? Will anthracite regain its markets ? No sound man in the region will venture a prediction , though the industry is now engaged in research to aid the consumer , and both the operators and the union say they have learned their lesson . James is taking no chances , He and the levelheaded men of the region are going after new industries , so that , even if King Coal has a relapse after the war , the economic structure of the area will not collapse with such a sickening crash again .                  @ @ @
