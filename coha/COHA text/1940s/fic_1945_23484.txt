The Stag said , " How much money you got ? " " Nine pounds , I think . " " May not be enough . You gave her a free hand , you know . You ought to have set a limit . She 'll sting you now . " " I know , " Stuffy said . They went on drinking for a little while without talking . Then Stag said , " What you worrying about , Stuffy ? " " Nothing , " he answered . " Nothing at all .

Now , in the bedroom , he sat down on the edge of the bed with his hands still in his pockets and said , " Look , Stag , I 'm not very keen on this Rosette deal any more . It may cost too much . Ca n't we put it off ? " The Stag sat up . " Hell no , " he said . " You 're committed . You ca n't back out . " " I may not be able to afford it , " Stuffy said . " Well , wait and see .

" Another pause ; then the Stag said the same thing over again and that went on for quite a long time , until he must have got tired of it because in the end he put down the receiver and lay back on his bed . He was roaring with laughter . " The lousy old woman , " he said , and he laughed some more . Stuffy said , " Was she angry ? " " Angry , " said Stag . " Was she angry ? You should have heard her .

We 'll do a Gyppi pub-crawl . " HEY had one more drink , then they went out . They went to a place called the Excelsior , then they went to a place called the Sphinx , then to a small place called by an Egyptian name , and by ten o'clock they were sitting happily in a place which had n't got a name at all , drinking beer and watching a kind of stage show . At the Sphinx they had picked up a pilot from thirty-three squadron who said that his name was William . He was about the same age as Stuffy but his face was younger , for he had not been flying so long . It was especially around his mouth that he was younger . He had a round schoolboy face and a small turned-up nose , and his skin was brown from the desert . The three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a long wooden room with an unpolished wooden sawdust floor and wooden tables and chairs . At the far end there was a raised wooden stage where there was a show going on , and the room was full of Egyptians , sitting drinking black coffee with the red tarbooshes on their heads . There were two fat girls on the stage dressed in shiny silver pants and silver brassieres . The one was waggling her bottom in time to the music , and the other was waggling her bosom in time to the music . The bosom-waggler was most skillful , and the Egyptians were spellbound and kept giving her a big hand . The more they clapped the more she waggled , waggling with the music , never losing the tempo , never losing the fixed brassy smile that was upon her face , and the Egyptians clapped more and more and louder and louder as the speed increased . Everyone was very happy . When it was over William said , " Why do they always have those dreary fat women ? Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Gyppies like them fat . They like them like that .

If you got someone fat you could n't go wrong ; she was bound to be high-class . " " Ridiculous , " said Stuffy . William said , " I do n't believe it either , but we 'll soon find out . I 'm going to ask those Gyppies . " He jerked his thumb toward two middle-aged Egyptians who were sitting at the next table , only about four feet away . " No , " said Stag . " No , William .

None of them was drunk , but they were happy with a fair amount of beer and whiskey and William was the happiest . His brown schoolboy face was radiant with happiness , his turned-up nose seemed to have turned up a little more and he was probably relaxing for the first time in many weeks . He got up , took three paces over to the table of the Egyptians and stood in front of them , smiling . " Gentlemen , " he said , " my friends and I would be honored if you would join us at our table . " The Egyptians had dark skin and podgy faces . They were wearing the red hats , and one of them had a gold tooth . At first , when William addressed them , they looked a little alarmed . Then they caught on , looked at each other , grinned and nodded . " Pleess , " said one .

" Have a coffee , " he said . The one with the gold tooth grinned broadly , raised his hands , palms upward , and hunched his shoulders a little . " For me , " he said , " I am accustomed . But for my frient , " and he spread out his hands toward the other , " for my frient  --  I can not speak . " The Stag looked at the friend . " Coffee ? " he asked . " Pleess , " he answered .

" The Egyptians seemed to understand , and they lifted their coffee cups . " Plecss , " said the one . " Thank you , " said the other . They drank . The Stag put down his glass and said , " It is an honor to be in your country . " " You like ? " " Yes , " said the Stag . " Very fine . " The music had started again , and the two fat women in silver tights were doing an encore . The encore was a knock-out . It was surely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed . The Egyptians all stamped their feet and screamed with delight . Then it was over . The applause gradually died down . " Remarkable , " said the Stag . " You like ? " " Please , it was remarkable . " " Those girls , " said the one with the gold tooth , " very special . " William could n't wait any longer . He leaned across the table and said , " Might I ask you a question ? " " Pleess , " said the Egyptian with the gold tooth . " Pleess . " " Well , " said William , " how do you like your women ? Like this  --  slim ? " and he demonstrated with his hands . " Or like this fat ? " He demonstrated again . The gold tooth shone brightly behind a big grin . " For me , I like like this  --  fat , " and a pair of podgy hands drew a big circle in the air . " And your friend ? " said William . " For my frient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Pleess. " said the friend . " Like this . " : He grinned and drew a fat girl in the air with his hands . Stuffy said , " Why do you like them fat ? " Golden Tooth thought for a moment , then he said , " You like them slim , eh ? " " Please , " said Stuffy . " I like them slim . " " Why you like them slim ? You tell me . " Stuffy rubbed the back of his neck with the palm of his hand . " William , " he said , " why do we like them slim ? " " For me , " said William , " I am accus-tomed . " " Yes yes , I know , " Stuffy said . " So am I. But why ? " William considered . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't know why we like them slim . " " Ha , " said Golden Tooth , " you do n't know . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And me , I do not know either . " But that was n't good enough for William . " The Stag , " he said , " says that all rich people in Egypt used to be fat and all poor people were thin . " " No , " said Golden Tooth . " No , no , no . Look those girls up there . Very fat ; very poor . Look queen of Egypt , Queen Farida . Very thin ; very rich . Quite wrong . " " Yes , but what about years ago ? " said William . " What is this , years ago ? " William said , " Oh all right . Let 's leave it . " The Egyptians drank their coffee and the noise was like water running out of the bathtub . When they had finished , they got up to go . " Going ?

" PrHE three of them sat on drinking hap- pily until midnight when thel waiter came up and told them that the place was closing and that there were no more drinks . They were still not really drunk , because they had been taking it slowly , but they were feeling healthy . " He says we 've got to go . " " All right . Where shall we go ? Where shall we go , Stag ? " " I do n't know . Where do you want to go ? " " Let 's go to another place like this , " said William . " This is a fine place . " There was a pause .

But who is she ? " They told him who she was . They told him about their telephone calls and about Colonel Higgins , and William said , " Come on , let 's go . Let 's go and rescue all the girls . " They got up and left . When they went outside , they remembered that they were in a rather remote part of the town . " We 'll have to walk a bit , " said Stag . " No gharris here . " It was a dark starry night with no moon . The street was narrow and blacked-out , and it smelled strongly with the smell of Cairo . They walked on , the three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark Stuffy , and tall young William who went barehead because he had lost his cap . They headed roughly toward the center of the town where they knew that they would find a gharri to take them on to Rosette . Stuffy said , " Oh , wo n't the girls be pleased when we rescue them . " The Stag said , " It ought to be a party . " " Does she actually keep them locked up ? " William said . " Well , said Stag . " Not exactly . But if we rescue them now , they wo n't have to work any more tonight anyway . You see , the girls she has at her place are nothing but ordinary shop girls who still work during the day in the shops . They have all of them made some mistake or other which Rosette either engineered or found out about , and now she has put the screws on them ; she makes them come along in the evening . But they hate her and they do not depend on her for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got the chance . " Stuffy said , " We 'll give them the chance . " They crossed over a street . William said , " How many girls will be there , Stag ? " " I do n't know . I suppose there might be thirty . " " Good God , " said William . " This will be a party . Does she really treat them very badly ? " The Stag said , " Thirty-three squadron told me that she pays them nothing , about twenty akkers a night . She charges the customers about a hundred or two hundred akkers each . " " Good God , " said William . " She must be a millionaire . " " She is . Someone calculated that she makes the equivalent of about fifteen hundred pounds a week . That 's , let me see , that 's between five and six thousand pounds a month . Sixty thousand pounds a year . " Stuffy came out of his dream . " Good God , " he said , " the filthy old Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Stuffy said , " We do n't know the ad-dress . " " He 'll know it , " said Stag . " Madame Rosette , " he said to the driver . The driver grinned and nodded . Then William said , " I 'm going to drive . Give me the reins , driver , and sit up here beside me and tell me where to go . " The driver protested vigorously , but when William gave him ten piastres , he gave him the reins . William sat high up on the driver 's seat with the driver beside him . The Stag and Stuffy got in the back of the carriage . They went off at a gallop , with the terrified driver shrieking directions to William and the gharri careening round corners , until at last they pulled up in another of those narrow , dark streets . " How much ? " said William to the driver . " Pleess , twenty piastres . " William gave him forty and said , " Thank you very much . Fine horses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gharri , and drove off . He was in a hurry to get away . Though the street was narrow , the houses , what they could see of them , looked huge and prosperous . The one which the driver had said was Rosette 's was wide and thick and three stories high , built of gray concrete , and it had a large thick front door , which stood wide open . As they went in the Stag said , " Now leave this to me . I 've got a plan . " icsIDE there was a cold gray dusty stone .1l. hall , lit by a bare electric light bulb in the ceiling , and there was a man standing in the hall . He was a mountain of a man , a huge Egyptian with a flat face and two cauliflower ears . In his wrestling days he had probably been billed as Abdul the Killer or The Poisonous Pasha , but now he wore a dirty white cotton suit . The Stag said , " Good evening . Is Madame Rosette here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said , " Madame Rosette top floor . " " Thank you , " said Stag . " Thank you very much . " Stuffy noticed that the Stag was being polite . There was always trouble for somebody when he was like that . They went up the bare stone steps which had iron railings . They went past the first landing and the second landing , and the place was as bare as a cave . At the top of the third flight of steps , there was no landing ; it was walled off , and the stairs ran up to a door . The Stag pressed the bell . They waited a while , then a little panel in the door was slid back and a pair of small black eyes peeked through . A woman 's voice said , " What you boys want ? " Both the Stag and Stuffy recognized the voice from the telephone . The Stag said , " We would like to see Madame Rosette . " He pronounced the Madame in the French way , because he was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the voice . She had a voice like a broken board . " Yes , " said Stag . " We are officers . " " You do n't look like officers . What kind of officers ? " " R.A.F. " There was a pause . The Stag knew that she was considering . She had probably had trouble with pilots before , and he hoped only that she would not see William and the light that was dancing in his eves , for William was still feeling the way he had felt when he drove the gharri . Suddenly the panel closed and the door opened . " All right , come in , " she said . She was too greedy , this woman , even to pick her customers carefully . They went in and there she was . Short , fat , greasy , with wisps of untidy black hair straggling over her forehead ; a large , mud-colored face , a large wide nose and a small fish mouth , with just the trace of a black mustache above the mouth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the office , boys , " she said , and started to waddle down the passage to the left . It was a long , wide passage , and all the way down there were doors , about eight or ten of them on each side . If you turned right as you came in from the stairs , you ran into the end of the passage , but there was one door there too , and as the three of them walked in , they heard a babble of female voices from behind that door . The Slag noted that it was the girls ' dressing room . " This way , boys , " said Rosette , and she turned left and slopped down the passage , away from the door with the voices . The three followed her . They got about halfway down the passage when there was a yell from the dressing room behind them . Rosette stopped and looked around . " You go on , boys , " she said , " into the office , last door on the left . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back toward the dressing room door . They did n't go on . They stood and watched her , and just as she got to the door it opened and a girl rushed out . From where they stood , they could see that her fair hair was all over her face and that she had on an untidy-looking green evening dress . They heard Rosette say something angry and quick spoken and they heard the girl shout something back at her . Rosette raised her right arm and they saw her hit the girl smack on the side of the face with the palm of her hand . She hit her twice . The girl put her hands up to her face and began to cry . Rosette opened the door of the dressing room and pushed her back inside . " My God , " said the Stag , " she 's tough . " William said , " So am I. " Stuffy did n't say anything . Rosette came back to them and said , " Come along , boys . Just a bit of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the passage and into her office . It was a medium-sized room with two red plush sofas , two or three red plush armchairs , and a thick red carpet on the floor . In one corner was a small desk , and Rosette sat herself behind it , facing the room . " Sit down , boys , " she said . The Stag took an armchair , Stuffy and William sat on a sofa . " Well , " she said , and her voice became sharp and urgent . " Let 's do business . " The Stag leaned forward in his chair . His short ginger hair looked somehow wrong against the bright red plush . " Madame Rosette , " he said , " it is a great pleasure to meet you . We have heard so much about you . " Stuffy looked at the Stag . He was being polite again . Rosette looked at him too , and her little black eyes were suspicious . " Believe me , " the Stag went on , " we 've really been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His voice was so pleasant and he was so polite that Rosette took it . " That 's nice of you boys , " she said .

" Stuffy said , " The Stag says that you 're a filthy old Syrian . " William said quickly , " The Stag says that you 're a lousy old bitch . " " And I know what I 'm talking about , " said the Stag . Rosette jumped to her feet , " What 's this ? " she shrieked , and her face was no longer the color of mud ; it was the color of red clay . The men sat quite still , leaning forward a little in their seats , watching her . Rosette had had trouble before , plenty of it , and she knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem drunk , it was n't about money , and it was n't about one of her girls . It was about herself and she did n't like it . " Get out , " she yelled . " Get out unless you want trouble . " But they did not move . For a moment she paused , then she stepped quickly from behind her desk and made for the door . But the Stag was there first , and when she went for him , Stuffy and William each caught one of her arms from behind . " We 'll lock her in , " said the Stag . " Let 's get out . " Then she really started yelling , and the words which she used can not be written down on paper , for they were terrible words . They poured out of her small fish mouth in one long unbroken high pitched stream . Stuffy and William pulled her back by the arms toward one of the big chairs , and gave her a quick push so that she fell backwards into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and jerked the telephone cord from its connection . The Stag had the door open and all three of them were out of the room before Rosette had time to get up . The Stag had taken the key from the inside of the door , and now he locked it . The three of them stood outside in the passage . " My God , " said the Stag . " What a woman l " " Mad as hell , " William said . " Listen to her . " They stood outside in the passage and they listened . They heard her yelling , then she began banging on the door , but she went on yelling and her voice was not the voice of a woman , it was the voice of an enraged but articulate bull . HE STAG said , " Now quirk . The girls . Follow me . And from now on you 've got to act serious . " He ran down the passage toward the dressing-room , followed by Stuffy and William . Outside the door he stopped . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stag said , " Now do n't say anything . Just act serious as hell , " and he opened the door and went in . There were about a dozen girls in the room . They all looked up . They stopped talking and looked up at the Stag who was standing in the doorway . The Stag clicked his heels and said , " This is the Military Police . Les Gendarmes Milltaires . " He said it in a stern voice and with a straight face and he was standing there in the doorway at attention with his cap on his head . Stuffy and William stood behind him . " This is the Military Police , " he said again , and he produced his identification card and held it up between two fingers . The girls did n't move or say anything . They stayed still in the middle of what they were doing and they were like a tableau because they stayed so still . One had been pulling on a stocking and she stayed like that , sitting on a chair with her leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the stocking . One had been doing her hair in front of a mirror and when she looked round she kept her hands up to her hair . One was standing up and had been applying lipstick and she raised her eyes to the Stag but still held the lipstick to her mouth . Several were just sitting around on plain wooden chairs , doing nothing , and they raised their heads and turned them to the door , but they went on sitting . One or two of them were half clothed , but most of them were in shiny green or shiny blue or shiny red or shiny gold evening dress , and when they turned to look at the Stag they were so still that they were like a tableau . The Stag paused . Then lie said , " I am to state on behalf of the authorities that they are sorry to disturb you . My apologies , mesd'moiselles . But it is necessary that you come with us for purposes of registration , etcetera . Afterwards you will be allowed to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , please . I have conversed with Madame . " The girls stared . The Stag stopped speaking , but still the girls did not move . " Please , " said the Stag , " get your coats . We are the military . " He stepped aside and held open the door . Suddenly the tableau dissolved , the girls got up , puzzled and murmuring , and two or three of them moved toward the door . The others followed , and the ones that were half-clothed quickly slipped on a dress , patted their hair with their hands , and came too . None of them had coats . " Count them , " said the Stag to Stuffy as they filed out of the door . Stuffy counted them aloud and there were fourteen . " Fourteen , sir , " said Stuffy , who was trying to talk like a sergeant-major . The Stag said , " Correct , " and he turned to the girls who were crowded in the passage . " Now , mesd'moisellcs , I have the list of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away . And do not worry . This is merely a formality of the military . " William was out in the passage opening the door which led to the stairs , and he went out first . The girls followed and the Stag and Stuffy brought up the rear . The girls were quiet and puzzled and worried and a little frightened and they did n't talk ; none of them talked except for a tall one with black hair who said , " Mon Dieu , a formality of the military . Mon Dieu , mon Dieu , what next ? " But that was all , and they went on down . In the hall they met the Egyptian who had a flat face and two cauliflower ears , and for a moment it looked as though there would be trouble . But the Stag waved his identification card in his face and said , " The Military Police , " and the man was so surprised that he did nothing and let them pass . And so they came out onto the street , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little way , but only a very little way , " and they turned right and walked along the sidewalk with the Stag leading , Stuffy at the rear , and William walking out on the road guarding the flank . There was some moon now . One could see quite well , and William tried to keep in step with the Stag and Stuffy tried to keep in step with William , and they swung theirarms and held their heads up high and looked very military , and the whole thing was a sight to behold . Fourteen girls in shiny evening dresses , fourteen girls in the moonlight in shiny green , shiny blue , shiny red , and shiny gold , marching along the street with the Stag in front , William alongside , and Stuffy at the rear . It was a sight to behold . Miff . GIRLS had started chattering . The Stag could hear them , although he did n't look round . He marched on at the head of the column and when they came to the crossroads he turned right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block when they came to an Egyptian cafe . The Stag saw it and he saw the lights burning behind the blackout curtains and he turned around and shouted " Halt I " " Mesd'moiselles , " said the Stag , " listen to me . " But there was mutiny in the ranks and the girls were talking and the tall one with dark hair was saying , " Mon Dieu , what is this ? What in hell 's name sort of a thing is this ? " " Quiet , " said the Stag . " Quiet ! " and the second time he shouted it as a command . The talking stopped . " Mesd'moiselles , " he said , and now he became polite . " With the military there always has to be formality . It is something unavoidable . It is something that I regret exceedingly . But there can be chivalry also . And you must know that with the R.A.F. there is great chivalry . So now it will be a pleasure if you will all come in here and take with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military . " He stepped forward , opened the door of the cafe and said , " Oh for God 's sake , let 's have a drink . Who wants a drink ? " Suddenly the girls saw it all . They saw the whole thing as it was , all of them at once . It took them by surprise . For a second they considered . Then they looked at one another , then they looked at the Stag , then they looked around at Stuffy and at William , and when they looked at those two they caught their eyes and the laughter that was in them . All at once the girls began to laugh , and they moved forward and poured into the cafe . The tall one with dark hair took the Stag by the arm and said , " Mon Dieu , Military Police , mon Dieu , oh mon Dieu , " and she threw her head back and laughed and the Stag laughed with her . William said , " It is the chivalry of the military , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather like the one that they had been in before , wooden and saw-dusty , and there were a few coffee-drinking Egyptians sitting around with the red tarbooshes on their heads . William and Stuffy pushed three round tables together and fetched chairs . The girls sat down . The Egyptians at the other tables put down their coffee cups , turned around in their chairs and gaped . A waiter came up and the Stag said , " Seventeen beers . Bring us seventeen beers . " The waiter said " Pleess , " went away and returned with the beer . William raised his glass and said , " To the chivalry of the military . " The dark girl said , " Oh mon Dieu . " Stuffy did n't say anything . He was busy looking around at the girls , sizing them up , trying to decide now which one he liked best so that he could go to work at once . The Stag was smiling and the girls were sitting there in their shiny evening dresses , and once again it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls were sitting there sipping their beer , seeming quite happy , not seeming suspicious any more because to them the whole thing now appeared exactly as it was and they understood . The Stag put down his glass and looked around him . " My God , there 's enough here for the whole squadron . How I wish the whole squadron was here ! " He took another drink , stopped in the middle of it , and put down his glass quickly . " I know what , " he said . " Waiter , oh waiter . " " Pleess . " " Get me a big piece of paper and a pencil . " " Pleess . " The waiter went away and came back with a sheet of paper , and he took a pencil from behind his ear and handed it to the Stag . The Stag banged the table for silence . " Mesd'moiselles , " he said , " for the last time there is a formality . It is the last of all the formalities . " " Oh mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing , " the Stag said . " You are required to write your name and your telephone number on this piece of paper . It is for my friends in the squadron . " One could see that the girls liked the Stag 's voice . " You would be very kind if you would do that , " he went on , " for they ton would like to meet you . It would be a pleasure . " " Wonderful , " said William . " Crazy , " said the dark girl , but she wrote her name and number on the paper and passed it on . The Stag ordered another round of beer . The girls were writing their names down on the paper . They looked happy and William particularly looked happy , but Stuffy looked serious because the problem of choosing was a weighty one and it was heavy on his mind . They were good-looking girls , young and good-looking , all different , completely different from each other because they were Greek and Syrian and French and Italian and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all good-looking . The piece of paper had come back to the Stag now and they had all written on it , fourteen strangely written names and fourteen telephone numbers . The Stag looked at it slowly . " This will go on the squadron notice-board , " he said , " and I will be regarded as a great benefactor . " William said , " It should go to headquarters . It should be mimeographed and circulated to all squadrons . It would be good for morale . " " Oh mon Dieu , " said the dark girl . " You are crazy . " . Slowly Stuffy got up to his feet , picked up his chair , carried it round to the other side of the table and pushed it between two of the girls . All he said was , " Excuse me . Do you mind if I sit here ? " At last he had made up his mind , and now he turned toward the one on his right and quietly he went to work . He began to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning toward her and leaning his head on his hand . Watching him , it was not so difficult to understand why he was the greatest pilot in the squadron . He was a young concentrator , this Stuffy . Meanwhile the Stag was thinking . He was thinking about the next move , and when everyone was getting toward the end of their third beer , he banged the table again for silence . " Mesd'moiselles , " he said , " it will be a pleasure for us to escort you home . I will take five of you " ? he had worked it all out ? " Stuffy will take five , and Jamface will take four . We will take three gharris and I will take five of you in mine and I will drop you home one at a time . " William said , " It is the chivalry of the military . " " Stuffy , " said the Stag . " Stuffy , is that all right ? You take five . It 's up to you whom you drop off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Oh yes . That suits me . " " William , you take four . Drop them home one by one ; you understand . " " Perfectly , " said William . " Oh , perfectly . " They all got up and moved toward the door . The tall one with dark hair took the Stag 's arm and said , " You take me ? " " Yes , " he answered . " I take you . " " You drop inc off last ? " " Yes . I drop you off last . " " Oh mon Dieu , " she said . " That will be fine . " Outside they got three gharris , and they split up into parties . Stuffy was moving quickly . He got his girls into the carriage quickly , climbed in after them and the Stag saw the gharri drive off down the street . Then he saw William 's gharri move off , but it seemed to start away with a sudden jerk , with the horses breaking into a gallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that William once again was perched high up on the driver 's seat with the reins in his hands . The Stag said , " Let 's go , " and his five girls got into their gharri . It was a squash , but everyone got in . The Stag sat back in his seat and then he felt an arm pushing under and linking with his . It was the tall one with dark hair . He turned and looked at her . " Hello , " he said . " Hello , you . " " Ah , " she whispered . " You arc such goddam crazy people . " And the Stag felt a warmness inside him and he began to hum a little tune as the gharri raided on through the dark streets .

White in a dispatch to the New Turk Times , May 9 , 1945 . C Kurt Steel ( otherwise Rudolf Kagey , assistant professor of philosophy at New York University ) is not only a popular author of mystery novels but a journalist with a Corn Belt background . REVOLUTION IN THE CORN BELT KURT STEEL F OUR and a half million American farmers have put 13 million bushels of seed corn into the ground this year . if all of it were planted in one field , that 95,000,000-acre field would be about the size of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers will harvest a crop of some three billion bushels  --  enough to fill a freight train stretching half way around the world . It is our greatest crop by any measurement ? acreage , bulk or value . The corn crop is usually worth about as much as our cotton , wheat and oats crops combined . But the story of our corn crop is richer and more exciting than any mere list of statistics . To ' begin with , it is a mystery story . No one knows for certain how corn originated or whi.t its botanical ancestors were . Corn is an orphan among grains , belonging to no known family . As if to make up for this , corn has attached itself so devotedly to man that for unnumbered centuries it has depended on man 's help for its very survival . No corn has ever been found growing wild . Wherever explorers have come upon corn , anywhere in the world , that corn has been planted and tended by men . Somewhere in the mysterious past , corn lost the ability to re-seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ear of corn , its kernels tightly packed together and wrapped in many layers of husk . When an ear of corn falls to the ground , this wrapping prevents the individual kernels from sprouting . Or if by accident they do sprout , there will be so many in a hill that they will starve each other out until even the strongest will fight its way up as a straggling runt , incapable of bearing seed for a second generation . The only thing we know with any certainty about the history of corn is that its birthplace was somewhere in North or Central America , probably in Mexico or Guatemala . Some authorities believe that corn has been continuously cultivated in the Western Hemisphere for 20,000 years . At least there is nothing to show that men in the Americas have ever been without corn  --  or that corn has ever been without men . But if corn has had an exclusively New World origin , it has proved to be hardy and adaptable to other climates , as adaptable , indeed , as man himself . Taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself at home all over the world and today it is the only grain that can be grown in every land where man carries on agriculture . Corn is the one global plant . Thus a revolution in corn culture should be of incalculable value in feeding and rehabilitating a war-shattered world . And here the story of corn begins to read like a thriller . For just such a revolution is taking place in our own corn belt . The cyclonic center of this revolution is " hybrid " corn . Ti Ntaxe most scientific revolutions , this one can actually be seen taking place . It can be watched from a train window  --  in all but four states , that is . In those four , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , and Ohio , the change has already been so complete as to leave almost no traces of the old order . In the other eight states of the corn belt , and to a lesser degree in the rest of the 48 ( for every state grows corn ) , this revolution is still going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first a field with the same ragged , unbarbered look that cornfields have had for thousands of years . Two hundred yards beyond lies a second field whose tasselled crest is as neat and trim as a crew haircut . In the first field some stalks are lofty and spindling , others short and stocky . In the second field the plants arc like identical paper dolls cut with the same strokes . The ears in the first field grow high , low , and middling . In the second field a single rifle shot , it seems , would clip all the ears down an entire row , so uniformly do they hang at waist height . In the old-fashioned field hundreds of stalks have been broken and uprooted by wind and hail . In the neat , tidy field not a single stalk is bent over . At harvest time , since no machine can reach high and stoop low to gather ears , the first farmer must bring in his crop by hand . It will take a man of skill and stamina to husk as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field any two high school boys able to drive a tractor can bring in the harvest with a machine , which picks and husks as it moves down the rows , at the rate of 1,000 bushels a day . Machine-pickers were in use as early as 1924 . But as long as a large proportion of the stalks in every field were broken down , harvesting by machines was inefficient . Today in many sections of Illinois and Iowa 90 per cent of the corn is husked by machinery . In 1923 every acre of corn grown in the Midwest required at least 14 man-hours of hard work . Today , with the increased use of tractors and machine-pickers , an acre of corn in the most productive districts takes only a little over six man-hours of labor . Last fall the old-fashioned farmer laid out no cash for seed ; from his own crop he sorted out the most likely-looking ears and hung them up to dry . The progressive farmer bought hybrid seed from a commercial producer . He paid about $80 for enough to plant his 60-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per acre more than that of his conservative-minded neighbor  --  or enough to bring him an additional cash income of $900 on the one 60-acre field . Abundance , absolute uniformity of appearance and yield , declining labor costs , ballooning cash income  --  these are only a few of the advantages offered by hybrid corn . There are scores of others , less apparent but even more important in the long run . For example , the University of Illinois , from work started in 1897 , has produced corn strains containing twice as much protein and three times as much oil as ordinary corn . With these strains , hybrid seed is being developed to yield corn of tremendously increased nutritional value . Other strains of hybrid corn especially rich in certain minerals have been turned to the mass production of penicillin . By the use of corn steep liquor  --  a by-product of starch making  --  the rate at which penicillin can be turned out has recently been increased 1,000 per cent . Today this steep liquor from hybrid corn is an indispensable ingredient in penicillin production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in ten short years traditions have been upset which had remained unchanged since long before the day of the Aztecs . In Illinois , for instance , as recently as 1935 less than one-half of one per cent of the corn planted was hybrid . This year 98 per cent of Illinois corn will come from hybrid seed , while in Iowa , where the revolution got a slightly faster start , the proportion is just a shade under 100 per cent . UT the amazing thing is not that in one decade a revolution has occurred in a grain culture thousands of years old . The amazing thing is that it waited those thousands of years to happen . The discovery of hybrid corn required no modern machinery or intricate scientific knowl-edge . All it took was patience and end-pretties herself up to meet him at the train .

They should be condemned , it seems to me , to ride high bicycles instead of a railroad train or an airplane . Give me a Brave New World ; I have had morethan enough of the Cowardly Old World . And , speaking of the Bad Old Days , I counsel a reading of George Fort Milton 's The Age of Hate : Andrew Johnson and the Radicals . That is , if possible . Published in 1930 . Of course the Roosevelt haters -- what with tremendously augmented communication and the fact that Roosevelt 's tenure tripled Lincoln 's  --  were more numerous than the Lincoln haters . But there were those in the Senate who openly accused Andrew Johnson of complicity in Lincoln 's assassination . And among the things that the Ben Wades and the Bert Butlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single vote , would have convicted  --  the President for was Johnson 's request that Edwin M.

CAO The publication last spring of a book about Charles Lutwidge Dodgson , the Lewis Carroll who wrote about Alice , aroused  --  I aroused it  --  some discussion .

And though the right good crew , and the ruler of the Queen 's navy and his feminine relatives , were shocked , lyrically and actually , by such profanity , and its user was banished to his cabin , Carroll wrote Gilbert that he no longer could witness any operetta of Gilbert 's writing .
