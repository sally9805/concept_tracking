THE HOLY MAN IN BLUE SNEAKERS A Story SEYMOUR FREEDGOOD ALT HOUGH I had often boasted of Dasgupta , a Hindu monk I had once known at the University of Chicago , his actual and quite unexpected visit to our central Indian airbase was a great shock to me . When the sergeant of the guard called up to announce him I realized what a difficult spot I was in . So grandly had I spoken of our prewar friendship , when the monk and I had been students in America , that its very existence had long been discounted by my fellow MP 's . As for our possible reunion in India , it had come to seem beyond belief . Dasgupta , however , arrived prepared for surprises . He had a little surprise himself . The sergeant at the main gate that morning was an ex-New York detective , Millaney by name . When he called me up at the guardhouse I knew he was excited . " Hey , " he said , " there 's a couple of Hindus out here , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's wearing a skirt and sneakers . Should I throw him out ? " " What color sneakers ? " I asked dazedly . " Blue , " said Millaney . " Could this be the one you 've been talking about ? " There was utter disbelief in his voice . " He 's about nine inches tall ! " " That 's Dasgupta ! " I shouted . " Hold him until I get there ! I bought him those sneakers myself ! " I rushed out of the guardhouse and into the first available vehicle . " Dasgupta ! " I was saying . " What will the fellows think ? " T HERE was reason for my distress . En route to central India from Bombay in a British troop train in the spring of ' 44 , my companions had become so upset by their first sight of the Indian countryside , the dismaying poverty , the enormous heat , that I thought it my duty to cheer them . " Buck up , fellows . " I said as our train was nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago . He returned to India five years ago . He 'll help us out . " Although it was fanciful to suppose that he might be of any comfort during our stay in India , it was true I had known Dasgupta at the University of Chicago . A well-educated monk from a Hindu monastery near Calcutta , he had come to the midwest in 1932 to attend an international religious conference and had remained for seven years . The latter stages of this visit he had spent as my private property . Finding him enrolled as a graduate student in Chicago , I had bought up his option from a girl student who had been keeping him in turbans and sneakers , and had brought him to New York , For two unforgettable summers I had lodged him at my parents ' home on Long Island . Since his dietary habits were peculiar we had fed him on fruit . Such recollections of Dasgupta , by the time we arrived at Chandrapore , had become part of the imaginative life of my company . He would help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for themselves in India that such imaginative props were no longer necessary . A barrier of science and Western amenities protected us from the East and we soon discovered a routine which made life , if not pleasant , at least bearable . With time my accounts of the heroic Dasgupta , who had walked the streets of New York in his skirts and sneakers , who had fallen in love with my grandmother , and who once at Jones Beach had even been mistaken for my girl friend , enjoyed a decreasing vogue . Although I wrote him a letter shortly after we got there , I had begun to disbelieve in his existence myself . Besides , India is said to have seven million professional holy men , many of whom wear skirts and sneakers . And his monastery near Calcutta was a long way from the Chandrapore airbase . I never supposed we would meet . A BSDRBED in these reflections I made the distance to the main gate in record time . As I came charging up I saw that Millaney , his face almost purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them , his hands raised high above his turban , I faintly recognized . The other was cowering behind the MP 's leggings , which obscured my view . " Millaney ! " I yelled , grabbing at the sergeant 's shoulder . " What 's wrong ? " " This wog claims he knows me from the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan ! " the ex-New York detective said hysterically . He pointed at the small Indian , outfitted with the saffron robes , the beads , and the begging bowl of a Hindu sadhu , who was standing in front of him . " Dasgupta ! " I said unbelievingly . " It ca n't be true ! " " Of course it is n't true ! " the monk said angrily . Arrayed as I was in an army uniform he had thus far failed to recognizeme . " What would I be doing in the Roseland Ballroom ? I ca n't dance . All I said is . . . . " " I mean it ca n't be true you 're really in Chandrapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a torrent of Bengali , with a few English words . Belatedly recognizing me , the monk flung his arms around my throat . " How is your grandmother ? " he cried , between tears and laughter . " What are you doing in that uniform ? Where is Margaret ? Did you bring your folks ? " " First things first , ' I said to Dasgupta . Even now , in the immediacy of his presence , I could hardly conceive our meeting . " I gather you received my letter . How did you come ? " " By rail , " the monk said jubilantly . " I was in Delhi , attempting to raise funds for my charities  --  did I tell you I am now abbot of a large chain of monasteries in Bengal ? ? when I received your letter . It was forwarded to me from Calcutta . I came right down . Oh , " he said , grasping me by the elbows , " I have been hoping you would come to India . Ever since the war I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you bring your folks ? " CROWD of Indians , many of them wearing the nationalist cap of the Ghandi movement and a tiny swatch of the Indian tricolor on their ragged vests , had sprung up from nowhere and were regarding us curiously . " How could I bring my folks ? " I asked , laughing at my old friend . " I 'm a member of the American Army , remember ? We 're fighting Japan . " " The British bring their folks , " the Hindu said reasonably . " Where is your grandmother ? Did you bring her , too ? " " Such questions , " Millaney grumbled . Abashed by the vigor of our reunion he had decided to re-enter the conversation . " All I ask is , what was he doing in the Roseland Ballroom ? " " Not in the Roseland Ballroom , " the monk said coldly . " In the street outside . This man , " he said , pointing an accusing finger at Millaney , " once accosted me in the vicinity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe he was a New York detective . He thought me a spy ! " Millaney paused , evidently struggling with the idea . " Now I remember , " he said in dismay . " There I was , cruising around as usual , when I see this fellow come running down the street , his head in a turban and skirts around his shoes . It was midnight , too ! " " I was returning from a YMCA lecture , " the monk said with dignity . " I resent that allegation . " " And now we meet in India , " I said consolingly . " Sergeant Millaney , this is Hem Chandra Dasgupta , the Hindu monk I told you about . We must get together for a talk . " " And this character ? " asked Millaney , pointing to Dasgupta 's companion , who was now getting to his feet . " Was he on Broadway too ? " I looked at the second Indian  --  tiny he was , with the took of the jungle about his face  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dasgupta explained . " I have been teaching him Western philosophy . Ramsheram Das , " he said introducing us to his little dragoman , " these are Sergeants Baxter and Millaney , my American friends . " Ramsheram Das simpered and then covered his mouth with his hand . " Jefferson , " he said shyly . " Tom Paine . " " Ramsheram Das is an expert on the American Revolution , " my friend said proudly . " However , his English is bad . " " Dasgupta , " I said , " it 's a pleasure to have you with us . Are you staying long in Chandrapore ? We must have a talk . " " The pleasure is mine , " said the monk just as formally . " I am a guest at the house of Dr. Gopal Chakravorti , a prominent physician of Chandrapore City . It is Dr. Chakravorti 's wish that you join us for tea tomorrow . My stay , unfortunately , will be short . " " We 'll be there , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both Dasgupta and his body servant were wearing the Indian nationalist tricolor on their vests . " Tea at Dr. Chakravorti 's tomorrow ? " Millaney returned my look and shrugged . " Bring Margaret , " said Dasgupta as he and his servant were about to depart . " Bring your folks . " So confused was I by this initial encounter that / almost agreed . II p ERHAPS I was wrong to be anxious but it was so long since I had last had word of Dasgupta that his unexpected arrival at Chandrapore , together with his admitted association with Dr. Chakravorti , a local physician of somewhat embarrassing prominence , put me rather on edge . The fact is , Dasgupta and I had almost lost touch since we had parted in New York five years before . From his occasional letters I had been led to believe that because of his privileged religious position he wanted for nothing , except possibly food , but I had only the haziest notion of what he had been doing with himself . What did it mean to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of holiness , I realized , had lately undergone changes in India . All sorts of people were doing business under the guise of a sadhu , or religious mendicant . Just the other day , for example , a tout had accosted me in Lucknow and suggested I lay fifty rupees on Lord Krishna in the fifth . He had it , he said , on the word of a reputable holy man . One heard other stories . In certain charges and countercharges of graft among British officials , one of the accused complained of severe persecution on the part of the Indian government . Everywhere he went , he said , he found himself followed by teams of religious mendicants . Since this reminded me of an old friend who for a period during the thirties had felt himself always followed by WPA workers , and afterward did suffer a nervous collapse , I could n't take the official 's statement seriously . It was apparent , nonetheless , that under the stress of wartime circumstances even the Hindu sadhu had risen from his bed of nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The physician , it appeared , was known as a violent nationalist . An admirer of Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army , an underground band which was fighting the British in Burma and which hoped in conjunction with the Japanese to free India from the imperial yoke , his outspoken attacks on the Allies had brought him into considerable prominence with the local police . Since Dasgupta had left us with no knowledge of his host 's whereabouts I had consulted with Major Dempsey , the British police commissioner , who had afforded me this intelligence , together with the doctor 's address . " Sorry to appear stuffy , " the major had said over the telephone , " but I thought it best to warn you . I would n't be surprised if they chucked you out of the house . " Our visit , to be sure , was irregular . Garrisoned in southeast Asia to prosecute the war against the Japs , we had been told by our generals that it was no part of our military policy to be involved in the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Indian national aspirations was apparent among the troops , it was expressly forbidden by theater order for any American to concern himself with Indian affairs . As this proscription applied to Indian religion and local custom as well as to politics , I thought it wise to let the police commissioner know what we were about . " The sadhu and I were friends in America , " I explained over the telephone . " Besides , Millaney 's coming along for protection . We 'll watch our step . " A untouort Millaney was uneager to assume this responsibility it was he who led the way into Dr. Chakravorti 's compound the next evening . " How are you , Ramsheram Das ? " he said as Dasgupta 's body servant came forward to greet us . Except for a gang of coolies  --  sullen , half-naked men who were painfully loading three bullock carts  --  the compound seemed tranquil enough . We returned the philosopher 's salaam . Ignoring the surprised glances of the coolies , whose efforts he presumably had been directing when we came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where four unpainted chairs had been set up in front of a ramshackle stucco house . " Friedrich Nietzsche ? " hesaid , reaching desperately into his Western vocabulary . " How 's that ? " my companion asked . Concerned about the contents of the bullock carts I had fallen slightly behind and could not apprise Millaney of the Indian 's friendly intentions . The coolies , I noted , each of whom wore a Gandhi cap , had been wrestling a number of packing cases into their bullock carts . " William James , " the Hindu said with an apologetic grin . " I 'm acquainted with Harry James , " the ex-New York detective said moodily . He too had noted the Gandhi caps . " Great favorite at the Roseland Ballroom . " The house door slammed and down the stairs came Dasgupta , his forehead freshly painted with the sacerdotal V , an emblem not of Victory but of Vishnu , lord sustainer of the Hindu pantheon , which had been appropriated by his religious order . He was accompanied by a fierce old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moustache , the darkness of whose face was accentuated by a spotless white toga which fell gracefully from his shoulders to his sandaled feet . I gathered the two had been quarreling . " But your holiness , " I heard the old man complain as they came out of the house , " is it wise to permit Americans in the compound ? " Evidently Dasgupta had reassured him . " Not so loud , " I heard him whisper . " These are not ordinary Americans . / think they can help us out . " Fixing a smile I came up to be introduced . " This is Dr. Chakravorti , " Dasgupta said cordially , taking both our arms . It was apparent that the aged physician had no love for the American uniform . " Dr. Chakravorti is a retired professor of medicine from Bengal University . He now devotes his time to my charities . " Surreptitiously they had been glancing over my shoulder as he said this and I too turned to look at the bullock carts . " Medical supplies , " Dasgupta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are acquainted with famine conditions in eastern India ? We have been establishing clinics in Bengal . " " A worthy enterprise , " I said , offering the doctor my hand . " The war has done appalling things to India 's economy . May I add how great a privilege it is to be a guest in a patriot 's house ? " Ramsheram Das laughed nervously and went over to join Millaney . " A privilege indeed , " the doctor said harshly . Although his voice was reminiscent of the English universities he seemed to speak the language with distaste . He had also ignored my hand . " Why did you consult the British police commissioner before taking advantage of it ? " The doctor had attacked so abruptly that I almost jumped . " My dear Dr. Chakravorti ! " I began , but Dasgupta anticipated me . " We must forgive the good doctor his suspicions , " he said , taking a fresh grip on our arms . " Considering the disordered state of India he has a natural fear of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained to the physician . " I forgot to give it to him . " The little monk was bobbing up and down in front of us and seemed forcibly to be holding us together . " I 've been telling Dr. Chakravorti how close was our friendship in America , " he said , his voice getting shrill . " It is his hope we can continue it here . " " It is my hope also , " I said , still glaring at the physician . " Shall we join our friends ? " Together we walked down the path and into the garden , where Millaney and Ramsheram Das were drawn up rigidly beside the chairs . The conversation , I gathered , had again veered to the Western philosophers , the mere mention of whose names threw Millaney into a panic . " This is wonderful , indeed , " I vociferated . The situation seemed in need of a sweeping statement . " A house in Chandrapore , a house on Long Island  --  of what effect are geography and history on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been telling Dr. Chakravorti , " Dasgupta agreed . " How often since I returned to India have I thought of your house on Long Island ! How kind your family was , how much I learned ! I often think of your beloved grandmother , " he said , smiling carefullyand motioning us into the chairs . " Where is the dear old soul ? " T T rats mention of my grandmother Millaney left off his scrutiny of Dr. Chakravorti and turned startled eyes on the monk . ? " Dead , " I intoned . " She died three years ago . " " How sad , " grieved the monk . " She and I were very close . And your parents . . . ? " He was about to continue when Millaney could no longer restrain himself . " You mean it 's true ? " he shouted . " This Hindu and your grandmother . .. ? " " Shut up , " I said , wishing to God I had never brought him . " My parents are well , " I answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chakravorti had been following this conversation attentively . " Why did n't they come themselves ? " he asked . We looked at him inquiringly . " Sergeant Baxter 's parents , " Dr. Chakravorti repeated . " Why do they send their compliments ? Why not come themselves ? " " How could they do that ? " I asked . " Why are they hiding on the airbase ? " demanded Dr. Chakravorti . " Is Chandrapore so odious a city that they prefer to stay on the base ? " Millaney was staring at him openmouthed . " I still do n't get it , " I said , considerably upset myself . " Who are you talking about ? " " Your parents ! " thundered Dr. Chakravorti , " Your wives and your parents and your sweethearts ! Do you think we are unaware of what has happened ? How long can you keep it a secret that America has taken India from the British on a ninety-nine-year lease ? " " As in the case of Iceland , " Ramsheram Das suggested . Responding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . " Not to speak of the Bahamas and Trinidad , " he called back with his steadily growing vocabulary . " Why not Hindu-stan ? " " Now wait a minute , " I exclaimed . Mullaney was already on his feet and going after the suddenly articulate dragoman . " Sit down , Jim , " I said . " Let 's have it again , " I demanded . " Our families arc hiding on the airbase ? . America has India on lease ? " " Is it not the gossip of every coolie in the market place ? " the old man said wildly . " Has not word of this treachery spread from Madras to Assam ? " The physician had jumped from his chair and was running toward the bullock carts . " A weapon ! " he screamed to an astonished driver . " Where are my arms ? " He turned and faced us dramatically . " In the name of Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army I demand to know the truth ! " Millaney looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone nuts . " I turned incredulously to the monk . " Is this why you came to see me , Dasgupta ? You should know us better than that ! " " But my friends do n't , " the monk said earnestly . " They have not had the benefit of an American sojourn . They find it hard to believe . Tell me , " he said , smiling and calling me by my family name , " Margaret and your parents , they really are not in India ? " " Certainly not ! You should know us better than that ! " " Is it not as I told you ? " the monk said triumphantly . " Consider the matter , Dr. Chakravorti . If the Americans had leased India from the British would they have hesitated to bring their folks ? " T ins demonstration struck us as so preposterous that Millaney and I began to laugh . " No kidding , " my colleague said weakly , " you really thought we brought our folks ? " But Dr. Chakravorti was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laughing matter , " he shouted . " As a reward for your defense of the British empire I find it entirely reasonable that you should get India on lease . " I had had enough of this . " Listen , " I said just as wrathfully , " we 're not fighting for anybody 's empire . The reason we 're stationed in India is to supply armies that are beating the Jape Himself no lover of the British , Millaney was vigorously applauding this explanation . " Really , Dr. Chakravorti , " I said , smiling at my colleague 's enthusiasm , " I 'm sur-MAGAZINE prised to hear this propaganda . Americans have every sympathy for your national aspirations . I hope you do not forget we revolted against the British ourselves . " do n't believe it , " the old man said stubbornly . However , he returned to his chair . " Those who are not with us are against us . " I turned in desperation to Dasgupta . " How are things at the monasteries ? " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in need of funds ? " But the monk refused this distraction . " I hope you wo n't judge my compatriot too harshly , " he said , avoiding my glance . " India has fought so long for her independence that it is hard for us to be objective about a foreign war . I looked at the two of them helplessly . " What do you expect us to do ? " / asked . " Considering our position in Asia you can hardly suggest we fight alongside the British in Burma while stirring up trouble in their rear ? " " Revolt ! " shouted Dr. Chakravorti . " Cut their bloody throats ! " " Really , " I said to Dasgupta , who seemed undisturbed by his colleague 's patriotism , " what can you expect us to do ? " " We expect you to honor our national aspirations , " the monk said carefully . " And once the war is over we expect you to get out . " " Good enough , " I said , willing to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , Millaney looked up to snort at Ramsheram Das , who was bringing the tea . " Ah , " said Dr. Chakravorti , who also seemed to welcome the diversion , " scones and tea . " " I had hoped you would tell us about your monasteries , " I said to Dasgupta . Still concerned about our position in India , I thought I could make amends . " If you 're really on a countrywide begging tour perhaps we can help . " I was gratified by the response to this offer . Dr. Chakravorti perked up at once and began to drink his tea with a sucking noise . Even Ramsheram Das was impressed . " The Rockefeller Foundation , " he said softly and with his new-found vocabulary went on to list the contri-butions of that fund to charitable enterprises in the Far East . Dasgupta also was pleased . " I hesitated how to approach you on this matter , " he said gratefully . " The fact is , conditions in eastern India are desperate . Several of our branches are located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others , in Assam and across the Burmese border , are already in Japanese hands . It is for their relief that I am traveling over the whole of India . Whatever you give will be appreciated . " " Why , nothing could please me more , " I said heartily . Here , I imagined , was an opportunity to make amends . I dug deep in my money-belt and came out with an appreciable sum . " There , " I said once this transaction was completed , " I hope this will prove that although we are members of a visiting army we have the best interests of India at heart . " " I would not have thought it possible , " Dr. Chakravorti said enthusiastically . " What munificence ! What sterling friends ! " He waited until the monk had counted the money and then suggested , " Your holiness , is n't it time to go ? " " Co where ? " I asked the monk . " I thought you 'd stay for a bit . " " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have an appointment in Agra tomorrow . " Millaney and I looked at each other . " That 's a hell of a note , " I said indignantly . " We 've scarcely had a chance to talk . There are a hundred things you were going to tell us , Dasgupta . What have you been doing with yourself ? Where have you been ? " " Such stories can wait , " Dasgupta said . He arose and embraced me affectionately . Despite his protests Ramsheram Das did the same with Millaney and afterwards knelt in front of Dr. Chakravorti and kissed his feet . " We will keep in touch through Dr. Chakravorti , " said my old college friend . " Perhaps there will be additional requests . " " Do you think so ? " I asked , upset by this sudden departure . " I hope not . " " Jai Hind , " said Dasgupta , gravely saluting us . " Forward India . " He took in Millaney with his smile , " Send my love to your folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the New Delhi trials , a series of criminal proceedings brought after the war by the British Raj against members of the Indian National Army . By then , of course , it was so apparent that the British would evacuate India that for the sake of future relations between the two countries most of the patriots , Dasgupta among them , were released . Meanwhile , through Major Dempsey , the local police commissioner , I did hear from Dr. Chakravorti . It was a difficult scene . Some time after my visit with Dasgupta I had a summons from the British police commissioner to stop by at his office in Chandrapore . When I arrived he was already closeted with Millaney . The two of them looked very grave when I came in . " I told you no good would come of it , " my partner said bitterly . " You and your college chums ! " " Ah , " I said , " you 've heard from Das-gupta ? " " You damn fool ! " Millaney shouted . " We 're liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as bad as that , " Major Dempsey said deprecatingly . " I do think you should put an end to this correspondence , however . " He motioned to a small pile of letters on his desk . " When the time comes to arrest them it might prove incriminating . " " What correspondence ? " I asked . " I have n't been corresponding with anybody . " " You 're going to be in a minute , " Millaney snapped . " You 're going to answer those letters right now ! " " Am I ? " I said . I confess I was impressed by their seriousness . " What are they about ? " I picked up the stack of letters and glanced at them in astonishment . All were signed by Dr. Gopal Chakravorti and had evidently been intercepted by the British censors before they could be delivered to me . " Dear Sergeant Baxter , " said the first of them . " The situation of the Bengal monks continues difficult . His holiness requests you deliver to my compound six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bullock cart . " " Six hundred army blankets ! " I looked guiltily at the police commissioner . " Where am I to get that many blankets ? Besides , there ca n't be six hundred monks . " " What makes you think they 're monks ? " Millaney said scornfully . " Did you ever hear of the Indian National Army ? They want to free India for the Japs ! " I read on among the doctor 's curiosities . " Dear Sergeant Baxter , " said another letter . " I can not understand why you have not answered my first request . Perhaps there is a shortage of blankets ? In that case we could use atabrine , sulfa drugs , bandages , and any type of small arms . For the sake of our unnamed comrade I am sure you will honor this request .

P. , on which the followingmessage had been typed in triplicate : " Please inform his holiness I am entirely unsympathic with Japanese-inspired policies of Indian underground movement . I consider our association terminated . " " Sign here , sergeant , " the major said politely . " All right , " I said . So frightened was by this predicament that I would have agreed to anything . " Where is the little devil ? " I asked . " Somewhere in Chittagong , " Major Dempsey informed me . " We 'll catch up with him before Tong . Meanwhile we 'd better send this telegram .
