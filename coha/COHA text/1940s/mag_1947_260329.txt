THE MEMOIRS OF DOCTOR FELIX KERSTEN ( 288 pp. ) - Translated by Ernst Morwitz-Doubleday ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> This is history told by a masseur who sometimes snooped . The late Heinrich Himmler believed that his frequent , gnawing stomach pains could be relieved by massage . He went to a masseur named Felix Kersten , who now , through Himmler 's **27;9339;TOOLONG , tells what the peace might have been had Germany won . <P> Claiming to have been always firmly anti-Nazi , Dr. Kersten is a Finnish citizen who now lives and practices in Sweden . He declares that he treated Himmler ( also Ribbentrop , Hess , Ley , et al. ) simply to protect his own family . He was also instrumental , he says , in sending thousands of victims of German concentration camps to safety into Switzerland and Sweden . Documents reproduced in his Memoirs , and an introduction by Biographer Konrad ( Hitler ) Heiden , indicate that his claims are true . So also may be his reports of tall Nazi ambitions . Samples : <P> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of Europe . English and Russian would be outlawed promptly ; Danish , Dutch , Polish , French , Norwegian and Swedish were to be tolerated for a decade . <P> West of Germany , Hitler and Himmler intended to set up a new state called Burgundy , which would sprawl across parts of France , Belgium , Luxembourg and Switzerland . The capital city : either Ghent or Dijon . Its chancellor would be Lon Degrelle , Belgian Fascist leader. * <P> The entire Dutch nation was to be herded east to Poland and settled along the Bug and Vistula rivers , as punishment for its pro-Allied attitude . All Dutch real estate and capital goods would be forfeited to the Reich and distributed among deserving SS men , who would then establish an " SS Province Holland . " <P> All the aristocrats in Europe were to be hanged . German princes &; princesses would lead the way at a mass execution held in front of Berlin 's Imperial Palace . The charges : sexual perversion , espionage , high treason . <P> Dr. Kersten says that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that he discovered others for himself by peeking through documents in SS headquarters . One day Himmler showed him a medical case history covering " 26 typed sheets of paper " and asked Kersten if he would be willing to take the patient . Dr. Kersten says he refused , when he saw that the man 's troubles included vertigo , insomnia , laryngeal polyps , latent tuberculosis , progressive paralysis , impotence and syphilis . The patient 's name : Adolf Hitler . <P> <P> *One of the biggest fish who got away . Belgium 's arch-collaborator fled the country in the last month of the war , in a plane which crashed in Franco Spain . After he had been interned for 15 months , the Spanish Government announced that he had mysteriously escaped . He is now believed to be either in South America or still in Spain .
