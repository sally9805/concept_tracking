Santiago Luis Cardinal Copello , Primate of Argentina , last week gave Catholic Argentines some advice on the forthcoming ( February ) elections . <P> No Catholic , said the Cardinal in a pastoral letter , should support parties or candidates who would reverse Argentine law by : 1 ) separating the church from the state , 2 ) taking religious teaching out of the public schools , 3 ) legalizing civil divorce . <P> Cardinal Copello said not a word for or against the candidacy of Juan Domingo Peron . But it was notable that Peron 's military government had decreed religious instruction in all Argentine public schools . <P> The Communist , Socialist , and Progressive Democrat parties , which make up a strong sector of the democratic united front against Peron , would take religion out of both school and state , permit divorce . <P> The Copello letter , and the subsequent row over just what it meant , fanned a smoldering feud between Argentine liberals and the church . The liberals , mostly good Catholics themselves , think the church too powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still enjoys medieval prerogatives in Argentina , is loth to give an inch . <P> Copello was supported by the many pro-Franco Spanish priests who have emigrated to Argentina since the Spanish Civil War . But there were dissidents , even within the church . One was famed Bishop Miguel de Andrea , who did not sign the pastoral letter . Instead , he took a slap at Peron demagoguery . To a group of graduating nurses , the Bishop gave a solemn warning : " It is a tragic error to sell liberty for a few social and economic advantages . "
