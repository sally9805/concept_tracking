The 1948 election was the greatest possible tribute to the secret ballot , which is the heart of democracy . It is true that the vote was low ; * there was considerable evidence that many had voted reluctantly . But a reluctant vote counts just as much as an enthusiastic one . The election was a decision , perhaps some day to be amended ( as democracy can and does amend its choices ) , but an affirmative decision nevertheless . <P> In the main , the people had voted for no change in a social concept which had been pretty well formulated by Franklin Roosevelt in the years between 1933 and 1937 . They had also voted against Republicanism . On the basis of still incomplete returns this week , Dewey in 1948 received but a scant 200,000 votes more than Herbert Hoover in 1928 ( the last time the Republicans had won ) . <P> Since Hoover 's day , a Roosevelt , or New Deal , generation of voters has grown up . The voters of this generation voted , in 1948 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TVAs , AECs , SECs and EGAs ; for Government help for farmers and labor ; for Government supervision of banks and business practices ; for federal aid in housing and education . The people , in effect , had voted for themselves . <P> Dewey had made some handsome promises . In some instances he had out-dealt the New Deal . But as Russell Davenport , who had brain-trusted Willkie 's campaign , pointed out : Dewey 's interest was " in the manipulation of political machinery and in saying the right thing just before it was too late to say it . " <P> So the people had voted for the men who seemed to have their interests at heart , including Harry Truman and Alben Barkley , who were the oldest team of victorious candidates on record . The New Deal had become an old and comfortable thing , too , a currently accepted part of America . In prosperous 1948 , the people , did not want a change . <P> * It was also the closest in 32 years both in popular and electoral votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood : <P> Harry S.
