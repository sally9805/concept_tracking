THE . SIEGE A Story NICCOL6 TUCCI Illustrations by Corrado Cagli F ox three full years , from 1915 to 1918 , at nine o'clock every morning , we had waited for the postman , right before breakfast ; or , if he was late , during breakfast . At times , my sister Sonia , my brother Vieri , and I went all the way to the gate to look for him on the big road , but then , if he was not in sight , we preferred to wait in the garden for him to " ripen " from around the corner of the gardener 's house . This idea of his ripening was our invention ; we had coined the word and it described the situation very well . He brought news of the war , or rather of our brother Kostia , who was in it . When the newspaper he delivered was spread open , we glanced rapidly , all of us , and in secret , and sideways , at the casualty list . There was no reason why Kostia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been informed , but that casualty list was like a precipice into which all our hopes might fall in one , two , three or God knows how many days . We hoped that his life would continue after that precipice was closed , that there would be peace and him again with us after that peace . But nine o'clock was an hour from another life : in fact , one could be seen idling around the house at that hour , vsthich in itself was a crime , and even doing such terrible things as scratching one 's head or putting one 's finger in his nose , and rarely a word of reproach would be spoken . If then there was a letter from Kostia we had another half-hour of joy and vacation before going up to the library , but if nothing arrived , then all the irregular things one had done right before nine were remembered and loudly criticized , often with sanctions , too , One day in November 1918 , almost together with the news of the armistice , came a short letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may begin to wait for me . Should my plans change , I shall get in touch with you again . " Just dry and short like that . No mention of the great event , the hard-won victory , none of the vivid tales of what had happened to him ; it was almost a letter from a stranger . But of course this meant that the written word was abandoned for good as a means of conveyance . Words were now free again to go where they were needed : we had no use for them ; we would soon see him , touch him , know that he was there . The postman too was no longer the sovereign of the day . This letter was his abdication . And that was how we graduated from the calendar to the clock . Two weeks , just waiting for the right to wait . The big clock in the dark corner of the dining room , hidden by the heavy curtains between the two windows , would have a lot of work to do now , mincing away slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it for a strong clock to do a little extra work when it has remained idle for three years , marking fictitious hours that no one filled ? Our father was the first one to break up the joyful meeting . He had nodded to his good luck , smiled , touched his little white beard with two nervous fingers , and that seemed enough to him . " No sense in waiting now , " he said . " This is just another day of work . Go to the library and do your lessons , all of you . " He put on his shapeless old hat and we saw him walking angrily as usual down the main path of the park , to go and find out how much damage had been done him by the peasants , the administrator , and the wind . When his staggering form , his hat , and his white hair had disappeared behind the last tree , mother smiled at us , we smiled at her , we did not leave , she did not tell us to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to someone , and for that reason we were made grown-ups by her royal decree , just as a chair is " made " an airplane by a child . And we knew that we would hear the secret story of what had happened to us these three years . " You know , " she said , " the only thing one must be careful to avoid is dreams . There are little devils , microbes of dreams , around us all the time . They know our hopes and feed on them . They always come and offer us the things we want , and we are always fooled by them . We say , for instance , this is a dream , but he is not , because I see him . Kostia is here . So then we start leaving the dream with him , and then ... ( she smiled ) I have a word for it . I call it landing on the deserted shores of the morning . " She was crying now . Adrian , our younger brother , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensing that this was a moment for great revelations , but he was stopped by Clorinda , the white-haired maid who had exercised spanking powers on our father when he was a child , and now retained , nominally at least , the same privileges on us . She was carrying the scaldino , a clay fire-basket which mother held in her hands all day . " All of you : out of here , " she said . " And you , " she said to mother , " do n't sit there and cry like that . Do somethinginstead . You are a fine lady who knows so many things : read , keep busy , fill this time with something else but your im-patience . " " I promise , " said mother , who in normal times would not have allowed Clorinda to address her that way . We went upstairs . and of course did not do our lessons at all , and we could hear that mother was not doing anything either . We knew it from the noise of her rings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Father sat I with his head bent over his dish as if he were reading . His bald head , surrounded by white hair , looked like a wooden model for a face as it protruded against us . And when Vieri began to talk about dreams again , he said , " Do n't you have anything more intelligent to talk about ? Dreams are dreams and reality is reality . It has always been that way . " This seemed very stupid to us , but his voice had the right of way , no matter what he said . He had taken his option in the conversation and now he did not know what to do with it . So , without lifting his head , he fixed his small blue eyes on us through the white curtain of his eyelashes and coughed his ill-humor into the napkin until he became red as a lobster . Then he ate his soup until he saw the blue pattern of the arms in the middle of the dish , cleaned it carefully with bread and gave the dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread is for the cat . Do n't forget . " The slow , heavy afternoon was again working its way up the naked hills of Spazzavento , and dragging the old house with the peasant houses around it toward another night . At Spazzavento the sun went down at two-thirty in November , but even in June it never stayed on the horizon later than four , because the villa was built on the north slope of the stony Calvana , facing the Bisenzio valley and the northwester that always came down that way . Only from the big window on top of the stairs one had a glimpse of the distant hills around Florence and of the railroad some three miles away and the wide , dusty new road that had been built quite recently , only forty-five years before , to link the station with the village . Mother had not yet inaugurated her watch but she gave orders that very day to have a chair placed near the window on top of the stairs . For the next few days the maids were forever stumbling into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning , but they did not seem to mind . That chair had a meaning , like the wooden platforms they used to build in the village square a week before the procession of the patron saint . And the maids knew that the chair would stay there until after Kostia had had a chance to see it and to understand how much his mother loved him . The house was always silent in the afternoon , or rather , the family quarters were silent . Nobody raised his voice in the corridors , in the bedrooms , in the library , or anywhere else . If father was at home , he either snored for an hour in some dark corner , under a portrait of someone who had snored there before him ( I still see his white beard defiantly facing the opposite wall ) ; or he was in the small office near the oil-mill down in the basement , where his administrator used to receive the peasants and tell them day in day out that they were thieves . The silence of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Silence , was cut out of the eternal silence of death to which it belonged , and lifted on a pedestal made up of the various sounds that came from the kitchen , the pantry , or the fields . The sad linear song of a maid surged from the cellar and went all around that silence ; out in the fields , the scissors of the peasants binding and cutting the vines for the winter broke the air like distant gunshots , and often this noise too was underlined by stripes of shapeless chanting . But when the wind moaned through the valley ( indeed the name " Windswept " was appropriate for the place ) , then the Main Silence became so high , so monumental , that it scared everyone in the house . MIDDAY the wind had suddenly awakI ened from the air and was in one of its moods . We all felt depressed . Little Adrian , who took orders from everybody and passed them on to his toys or to chairs or imaginary people , had finished his daily battle against the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen to talk to ( dreary place that kitchen , with the huge smoky pot hanging from a black chain in the fireplace and simmering all day ) . So he must have decided to go and see whether his beloved hero and brother , Kostia , was coming home , as he had heard in the morning , because he climbed all the stairs , stood in front of the rattling window and looked and looked . And as he saw a carriage , without thinking what he was doing , he shouted joyfully : " Kostia is coming . . " Doors were flung open , the maids appeared from nowhere , we came from the library , and mother advanced on the stairs , pale , and with wide open eyes . He saw us all come toward him and began to cry : " It was n't Kostia , no , no , it was n't . " " To scare me like that , " shouted mother , trembling . " You have no business standing here , " shouted Clorinda , shaking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you idle child , you . " We all gave him our part of the general indignation , and mother ordered that no one should start waiting like that until two full weeks had passed . But another wall had been broken down : the fact that someone had begun to look at the street had a strange effect on her . She went downstairs , " to prepare everything . " Then twice she climbed a few steps and compelled herself to go back to the dining room . But the third time she had another reason . She wanted to see whether the servant quarters were in good order ; a thing she had not done for years because she knew that Clorinda would have resented this lack of confidence in her . As she reached the window , accompanied by Sonia , she said that after all it was unnecessary because Clarinda knew better than anyone else , and besides , three flights of stairs were already too much for her ; she was no longer young . " Let me test this chair , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sat down and she looked . Just for one second . And the siege of the road began . Sonia tried to protest , but she said , " What difference does it make , whether I wait here or downstairs ? Bring me my needlework and the green book from the mantelpiece in my room . " When Clorinda called to her not to be unwise , she answered that she was not used to carrying on a conversation from one floor to the next . It was sheer good luck that she was able to restrain herself and not add " especially with a maid . " She would have been sorry , because Clorinda came right upstairs and took her kindly by the arm like a child , saying , " Now you come with me . " Mother answered that she was used to doing as she pleased in her own house , but could not help laughing because she felt weak in front of this determined old woman . Finally she broke into tears and said she MAGAZINE would go downstairs in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , this time with all her ancient pride burning in her eyes , and Clorinda must have understood from the rhythm of her rings on the handle of the scaldino that this was not the day to speak a word . Sonia began to pay her long visits up there , but she did not want us boys near her because we startled her with tactless questions , such as : " Do you see that man coming down from there ? Who could it be ? " Or we said : " There , a carriage slows down on the curve . It will certainly stop here . " " Barbarians , " she used to tell us in an angry voice , just as she did when she was playing the piano and someone The wheel passed through the table , through all of us. dared talk aloud in the room . But Sonia knew how to behave ; she let mother do the waiting , the guessing , everything . She saw , of course , trains and carriages and people on foot , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had passed and nobody had accepted to bring him or to be him , she found something interesting to say , so that mother would not have to feel ashamed of the " defeat . " Then also Clorinda began to accept the siege . At times she stopped near mother for a second and threw a glance into the street as one throws a glance at a canvas , trying not to disturb the painter at his work . W E SPENT our mornings in the library as usual , then , every other day , we went to the nearby town of Prato with the carriage for our Latin and arithmetic lessons , and every time we crossed the hall we walked on tiptoes and tried to hear whether any carriages were rolling on the road . That dark figure against the glaring light of the window up there made us feel better . It was the only sign that a new era would begin . It was an assertion of our right to hope , a right that everything in that old house seemed to deny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon , that people were in the habit of coming along that road , seemed a hopeful sign : they were all part of his return ; they kept the stream running . Thus at the end of the two weeks , when the real expectation began , we were already a little too impatient , all of us . The first disappointment was that he did not appear in the first hour of light the first morning , a Tuesday it was , I remember so well . And then the second hour and then the third , and fourth , and then a whole morning full of hours , and then lunch-time too . The conversation stopped , as if by common understanding , every time the noise of a wheel was heard . It no longer passed on the road , it passed through the dining room , through the table , through all of us , and we resumed our talk in a state of weakness , as if we had been tramped upon by a real carriage . How the entire third week managed to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , geared to such a high note , was the only true thing ; the house , the people in it , our own actions and bodies , were all way behind . The only thing that took place in our world was mother walking up the stairs , determinedly , stepping on each step as if that obstacle had been subdued , and then sitting majestically on her throne , fixing both eyes on the top of the horizon from where the road flowed down to her like a dry stream . The road was hers , she was besieging it ; it must produce her son . Nothing could happen in that empty space that did not fall into her eyes . When people crossed the road , it bothered her , and if they stood on it for any length of time , she made impatient gestures with her hand . Because he was to appear from there like a small point and ripen slowly into the dear figure we knew . And once he had adopted every form we had guarded so jealously in our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we would all be free . No more stopping to ask ourselves : What is he really like ? How does he act ? Have we forgotten him ? Oh , to be able to say : " These lines , this voice you take back now , for they are yours , and see whether we kept them well . " We knew we must have kept them much too well , for time brings change , and time was dead in us . Our time flew all around that point : his face , as we remembered it ; that was our watch . For us it was just then and always then , and it continued to be then all day . On the night he had left , three years before , mother had put a photograph of him into the wooden frame of her small desk-watch . Now that the clock downstairs had done its work , this was the new impediment : nothing had really happened since that image had been put there . But he would come and set us free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those small points came down the road in the afternoon . They always seemed to accept the gifts at first : Kostia 's stature and way of walking ; then , half-way or so , they would begin to shake them off and show that they had nothing about them even to start pretending they were Kostia : such people as old men , even women , all sorts of trespassers . Every single time we felt like shouting at them , " We are going to extract him from the unknown , even without your help ! " After eight more days of this mother began to feel that we were all abandoning her . She was alone now on the rampart . All the doors were closed , all the hearts were closed , too : the old Nothing ( another of our familiar images to describe the atmosphere of the house ) was taking hold of us again like a bad winter . Now it was as if she were trying to conjure a dream in the midst of reality and plant it there . She had unfurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted on it , which was to cover everything  --  the stony countryside , the trees , the people . If there could only be a conspiracy of hope , if people helped , if they began to hold the canvas down with their feet , it would perhaps stick to the ground . If they could only fasten it under the houses , she could finish her work . If only the postman would bring that decree , empowering her with the exercise of rights she had already taken days ago , she might manage to win , but this way , all alone , it was too difficult . We continued to work as usual in the library , and although we were too oppressed by the silence to open our hearts to any hope again , we felt defended by her faith . God , or Whoever or Whatever there was , that stood behind the curtains of the world , would find his , its , their match in the aspect of this mother who had the dignity of a queen and could want things like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another during those days . It was all right to be crushed inside , but the air should not vibrate with dangerous words of doubt , or really the happiness it was so hard to evoke would feel offended and not come at all . Saying anything sad was like opening the doors to the old Nothing . So we all waited in her shadow and somewhat also in the shadow of the house door . Every time the big hand-bell rang , there was such a sinking of hearts , and the familiar faces that appeared were so disliked ! We felt like saying : " Did you have to come ? Only one person has the right to come , these days and you are not that one . " T HEN an incident occurred which , al- though we understood that it meant nothing , made it even harder for us to interrupt our anguish . One day I saw my father come home with a face that was not only angrier than usual , but which said clearly : stay away , everybody . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called downstairs for tea . I heard him go through all the rooms . He was obviously looking for something and I knew what : something wrong , something on which to hook his anger . He found it . A chair had been displaced . He called Clorinda three times in a voice that was almost desperate with anger , and in the silence that followed , Sonia asked me stupidly : " Is there any news ? " ( Why oblige people to answer " No , " when they would give anything in the world to answer " Yes " ? There is a code of mutual respect in such situations . ) " You fool , " I said , " if there were any news , do you think I would wait to tell it until you asked me ? " Again father called Clarinda , and again his steps were heard , and they changed from the heavy hammering of stairs being mounted to the lighter scuffling on the same surface . He must be in the hall now . Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And then , to call Clorinda that way , Clorinda , who had brought him up , spanked him , used strong words with him until he was fifteen ! The fourth time he called , one note pierced the volume of his voice , and came out in a falsetto tone . Finally she arrived ; and it was as if she had been guilty of everything that had ever happened in the world , when he asked : " Have you pushed this big chair against the frame of that picture again ? Ca n't you see that it has left a mark ? . . . I . . . this precious painting . . my orders disobeyed . . . " etc . It was so awful that Clorinda cried , and they both went downstairs together and way to the end of the corridor , and then a door was banged and their voices died down like thunder in the hills . And mother continued to sit there at the window , away from all this , indifferent to the loudest expressions of reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to drown . Then , for three days , father was ill , and Clorinda was ill , too , and mother hardly asked about Clorinda or why she was staying at the house of her brother , the gardener , instead of in her own room upstairs . And we hardly asked about our father 's health , and everybody was alone in his anguish , like a dog . Then father recovered , that is , he got up and looked so old , so terribly old , that Sonia cried one day for hours on her books , while my brother and I insulted her by way of consolation . T HEN another incident , meaningless of course , utterly meaningless , but there are moments in which everything creates an atmosphere of tragedy , even though there is no reason for it . Father went up to mother 's ramparts , and at first it seemed as if he , too , were interested in the road . He dragged a newspaper behind him as a child would drag a piece of cloth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the paper that there is going to be a League of Nations to keep the world at peace . The President of the United States of America is coming to Europe . " Strange for him , with his cynicism , to make such a remark . Mother nodded without looking at him , then he said ( his voice was very quivery after his illness ) : " Peace . Yes , peace for a great many years to come . At least our sacrifices will be rewarded , all of them . " And this must have seemed strange to mother , because she screamed : " What do you mean ? " And then she was out of breath and screamed again : " What sacrifices ? We are beyond that and we have forgotten . Our sacrifices are being re-warded . " He was pale and trembling and said nothing . " But what is it ? " she said . " Why do you look so disturbed ? " He did not answer , and mother rose from her chair , and asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away ! Why do you tremble so ? " And he said : " Why . . . I only thought I saw someone there , on the road . " And she sank back in the chair , crying : " Oh , I know . I know that . It happens to me all the time . " That evening I spoke to Sonia at length . Especially now that Clorinda was ill and no one dared scold our parents , it was necessary that we do something , because it was no longer human . Waiting had become a malady , a family epidemic , a strange fever . And we talked and talked and reached no conclusion , and the next morning she told me that she had had a dream : the wind had been so strong against the house all night that in her dream she had seen the house sailing toward non-existent shores ; and it was mother 's fault , because her eyes had melted down the mountains and the road , and everything had been made into a sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she told me that dream . She said : " You see ? Even I am all upset by these silly ideas now . Kostia will laugh at this when he comes . " " I think that he will not have the time to laugh , " I said , " because in this state of affairs they will start quarreling with him because he did not get here on time . " " You are right , " she said . " And it 's so silly . Let 's do something . This spell must be broken . " And I said , " Yes , it must be broken . " The trouble was , however , that the house held our anguish so well , just as it held the silence , and then ( it was about three o'clock in the afternoon ) , while I was having another conversation with Sonia about it , one of the maids came and said , gasping : " The Signora is talking . " We could n't help smiling at such a silly statement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is talking , " she said at last , " alone , by herself . " Sonia began to tremble ; she was afraid for mother 's health , and I felt my heart bang against my bones so that I almost resounded from it ; but Sonia , who was always courageous , said : " That 's nothing , " and began to go upstairs . She found Adrian who was climbing step by step , slowly , in the hope that nobody would notice him , and she had a quarrel with him . He called mother to his defense : " Mamma , may I come upstairs ? " And mother shouted with a voice full of hate : " Quiet there . Go away . " We all left . Doors were closed again , one in the face of the other , all along the hall , and there was silence , a high silence , the highest silence that ever was in Spazzavento : silence mounted on a monument of roars , moans , and cries that the wind brought from somewhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mother and we slowly opened the door to the library , and she was saying , as if she had a fever : " Go away , go away . It is not true . " And then she said : " If you are true , then I must be your dream . You reflect my desire . . . " And then she said : " Thank you . You are offering it back to me , for it must ache up in the air alone , detached and naked ; it must suffer up there as it does here . " And we all walked to the middle of the hall and I had to lean against the wall so as not to faint . Then we began to walk downstairs , away from her , and stepped along the stairs and saw in the middle of the hall father with his red bald head , standing , as one stands at Mass during Elevation . And then mother again spoke : " Who makes this wind of light ? " ( This was one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who detaches the paper from the faces , the mountains , and the houses ? " " 0 , my God , " murmured Sonia , " she is ill . " " Who puts that cup there , on a hill ? " said mother again . " Go away ! " she shouted . " Go away . I know you , devils of dream . These things do n't happen THE here . . . I know I am waiting . You do n't have to tell me . " Then , in a tired tone : " I know I have waited much too long . " And she cried quietly , like a sick child . Sonia walked up the stairs , knelt beside her , and said : " You are right , mother . " She said it so gently , so well , sneaking into the unreality of the situation , feigning herself unreal too ; and mother looked at her and said : " The dreams were coming again . But do n't be afraid . Let me alone . " Sonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden mother had lost her battle , because she greeted him with so much strength in her voice : " Oh , here you are , " she said . " And tell me now : how are you ? " Then she whispered : " Did you come from downstairs ? Tell me , " she repeated , " did you ? Through the garden ? . .. Did you batter the ground with your own feet ? You are expected to do that , you know . . .. And did you see the maid ? She must have Iet you in . " After a silence , she said , a little louder : " No , go downstairs first and ring the bell before we sit and talk . " Then she seemed scared by something and asked with great anguish : " Oh , but you have forgotten ! How could you just be here , without a trip behind you ? Kostia , " she said , " my darling ! How did you manage to avoid that ? The trainman must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the train , to get here slowly , with permission from them all . " Here she laughed , and then spoke again , in a weak voice : " That 's right ; you are coming to see your mother . But we mothers are the last ones to see you . First must your soldiers see you leave for home , then many other people . . . oh , so many , so many , you can never count them all . " At this point , luckily , the dream seemed to be over , for she coughed a little , then spoke cheerfully although still in a dreamy voice : " Because you see , my dear , " she said , " between you and us there is this road . Yes , this road . Then that mountain . 0 yes , a high mountain . Your mountain . Then . . . other mountains . " She stopped to listen , as we were all crying aloud . But she went on . " Then , " she said , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. And then . .. mountains again . That 's right . Mountains again . And then . . . and then . . ? " ( We could hear her breathe with difficulty . ) And then she screamed , oh , how she screamed : " I know ! I know ! .. . " and ran downstairs ranting so terribly that we all fled as if a wild , wounded beast were after us.
