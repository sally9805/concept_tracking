METE remarkable thing about paper is , j. not that for centuries it has been used as a material for writing letters and printing books , but that during the past hundred years it has been found to be a cheap and adaptable material for use , accessible to anyone for experiment . Women have used paper for patterns ; inventors have used it to make models ; soaked in vinegar , it has been usefully applied to a black eye . Because of this adaptability one of the oldest of industries has flowered out with an infinite variety of consumption goods ? paper bottles , paper handkerchiefs , paper cups , and more than ten thousand articles of daily use ? and then has produced the packages to put them in . The refinement and elaboration of the business of distribution was made possible because of paper . Now the waste itself of paper manufacture is discovered to be the source of raw material for still other consumption goods . Paper , an evidence of civilization , seems to have been discovered by the Chinese more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workman devised a way of turning into paper the fibers from the scraps of silk discarded in the preparation of writing and picture rolls . Later on , in the second century of the Christian era , the secretary of one of the Chinese Emperors introduced a method of making paper from mulberry bark . The Arabs carried some Chinese papermakers back to Samarkand as prisoners of war and set them to work . Since the mulberry did not grow there , these artisans were forced to experiment with linen fibers . As the Arabian conquests were pushed westward , paper-making was carried along and brought in turn to Egypt , Morocco , Spain , and southern France ; during the migration cotton was added to the stock of materials , and by the time papermaking had become common in Europe , cotton and linen rags were the principal materials . The base process of making paper is about what it was in the days of the early Chinese : it consists in separating the fibers , soaking them until they are a gelatinous pulp , and then simultaneously squeezing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strictly , paper is a felt . Improvements since the Chinese days consist in finding new sources of fiber and in the substitution of chemical processes and machinery for hand labor . II In the early days papermaking was always done near towns , the chief source of rags , and the first paper mill in America was set up just outside the most populous center , Philadelphia , by William Rittenhouse in 1690 . Part of his mill still stands in Fairmount Park . By 1776 the industry was firmly established in the colonies and thereafter grew rapidly ; where there were a hundred mills in the country in 1800 , by 1810 the number had doubled and the search for rags was incessant . This demand provoked an intensive search for other materials and attempts were made to utilize the fibers in cattails , burdocks , thistles , grasses , cabbages , cornstalks , nettles , cornhusks , and ferns . ( Paper can be made of any of these materials ; the problem is one of storage and supply . ) The reason for this intense demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were swelling the population , literacy was increasing ; the circulation of newspapers was expanding , and from the forties on , the market for school books and self-help literature developed enormously . The first practical response to the rag shortage was a process for making paper from straw , started shortly before 1830 by William Magaw of Meadville , Pennsylvania . The possibility of a large-scale expansion of papermaking , however , did not come until about the time of the Civil War when , as a result of a series of inventions by Germans , English-. men , and Americans , it became possible to make wood pulp . Until this time the demand had been almost entirely for what is sometimes called " cultural paper " ? paper for books , writing materials , periodicals , and newspapers . " Mechanical papers " were scarcely used at all and , despite the fact that paper bags were gradually coming into use , and though shoe manufacturers were cxpe : imenting with strawboard boxes , par er as an industrial raw material was practically unheard of . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making packages , and through the accidental discovery by the Robert Gair Company in 1879 of a way to make a folding carton , a few companies built up a paper-package monopoly that lasted through the 90 's ; but even here the growth was not extraordinary . The United States was still a rural country and the idea of a systematic exploitation of this huge native consumption-goods market was scarcely thought of . When this exploitation began the consumption of paper expanded also . It is with this market and its future and the discovery of new paper uses , ratherthan with cultural papers , that this article is concerned . Last year ? in 1940 ? the production of paper in the United States divided this way : ? Where did this market for mechanical papers come from ? When in 1879 Robert Gair made his first carton the whole process of distribution and retailing was a hit or miss confusion . Paper found its great opportunity when a start was made in putting distribution on an organized basis . Until the Civil War the South had exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not , were taken directly from the port of entry to the plantation warehouse . Now that whole economy had been destroyed and a new one was being pieced together . The South was a raw-material producer and so was the West , even though protection was a national policy . Most of the money and energy were being poured into railroad building , but the roads themselves were least concerned with efficient service and delivery , as every reader of railroad history knows . The organization of this primitive distribution was in the hands of the wholesaler . For the most part he sold anonymous goods in bulk ? sugar , coffee , oatmeal , kerosene , yard goods , hardwares ? and goods continued to be sold in this way for many years . Among the first to study methods of distribution were the patent-medicine manufacturers . The lever was paper : almanacs , testimonial advertising , and the paper box . * 70% of *hie was recovered from waste paper . Proprietary medicines were well established before 1860 ; when the war was over the discharged armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . This additional market was seized upon and in the late 70 's the familiar boxes made their appearance . They showed Dr. Munyon pointing at " You ! " They showed the luxuriant side whiskers of Dr. Kilmer , the Swamp Root king , and the benign face of Lydia Pinkham . The portraits of Dr. Miles and Colonel Hostetter and Father John and scores of other medical wizards were introduced to America on the side of a paper box . There was so much more room there than could be found on a label ! After the snake-oil men came the boom in patent breakfast cereals which began in the 90 's . It started off with a revamped oatmeal and a handsome paper box . To promote the product , Quaker Oats passed out a million sample boxes in New York City alone in 1898 . Along with Quaker Oats came Shredded Wheat , Force , Cream of Wheat , and numerous other breakfast foods , all in boxes . A year later , in 1899 , the National Biscuit Company determined to wrap its crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , named them Uneeda Biscuit . But the biscuit makers and soap men and the cereal makers were still prospectors in a wilderness . Most of the people in the United States still bought their goods at the general store . This fabulous institution , now embalmed in sentimental amber , was one of the clumsiest means of distributing the goods which man wants . The heart may warm at the memory of political argument , of small-town gossip , but the phrase " cracker barrel philosopher " was very apt . Most crackers , like everything else , came in a barrel , despite the labors of the National Biscuit Company . Until the First World War the general store held its own ; then paper helped to smother it . III We give the example of the general store because it is the most familiar example of a distribution machine , because the change in distribution methods from the general-store days is so closely tied to the growth of paper uses . A generation ago , outside of the big towns , people still " got ready " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellar and apples bought by the barrel ; a provident housewife was one who had a dozen flitches of bacon hanging from the cellar beams . The kerosene can returned from the store with a potato stuck on the spout to keep the oil from leaking ; molasses and vinegar were carried home in jugs . The store itself was most often a dark tunnel with windows at either end ? the front windows a jungle of carabao buggy whips , a pile of white plates from the Syracuse potteries , a stand of Burpee 's garden seeds , a coil of rubber hose , a wooden pail of Heide 's hard candy , and a dozen other articles . Getting past this undergrowth , you found yourself before a counter , much nicked and scarred , and waited until the storekeeper , who was also a Federal official , finished putting up the mail for the 3:40 . Beside the egg stove Will Atherton and Frank Gardiner could be found from morning till night , settling the affairs of the country , and getting occasional sustenance from an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a worn fly-screen hood . Spices were weighed out of tin canisters ; string licorice was carried raw . Few sales were made for cash ; the grocer laboriously entered each item in a pass book and at some time or other ? " / presume when the book is full , " Colonel Carter said ? he was paid . Just before the War things showed signs of change . During the years when Montgomery Ward and Sears , Roebuck and others were developing the mail-order business , the first of the chain stores ? led off by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company ? were organized . Many of the present-day chains ? Woolworth , McCrory , Kress , Kresge , Kroger , James Butler , Bohack , and others were started well before 1900 . But in number and stock in trade they were limited . Most of them confined themselves to tea , coffee , flavoring extracts , notions , knickknacks , and small hardwares . In 1912 the A &; P changed its policy . It went into the grocery business on a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no telephone orders , made no deliveries , and cut prices . The use of packages and wrappings was essential . Already manufacturers had succumbed to the blandishments of the advertising men and were promoting brands . Simultaneously the paper-bag companies began the manufacture of bags with special printing and design , using colored paper and other new materials . The year before , in 1911 , there had been an entirely new development in papermaking when Edward Mayo first successfully made kraft wrapping paper out of Southern pine at Orange , Texas . Introduced as a wrapper by Marshall Field , the use of kraft grew very fast and was promptly taken over by the mail-order houses who were profiting by the establishment of the Parcel Post rate in 1913 . At the moment when wrapping papers were beginning to boom , paper boxes were entering upon a period of expansion . In 1912 the corrugated-paper box manufacturers appeared before the Interstate Commerce Commission and petitioned that the east-bound transcontinental rates for goods shipped in fiber be lowered until they were equal with rates charged for wooden packages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly for years , awoke in alarm and , rounding up the lumber interests and those railroads which had timber holdings , began a strenuous agitation . They were too late ; on April 6 , 1914 , the paper-box men got their rate . The truth was that the fiber box appealed to too many people . Freight handlers liked it because it was easy to deal with ; there were neither nails nor splinters to gouge the hands . Shippers liked it because its lighter weight meant a saving and , since it came folded , it required only a fraction of the storage space . Wooden-box manufacturers could n't afford the best woods and had to make their boxes twenty-five per cent heavier to allow for safety because of knots . A curious example of wooden-box propaganda of thirty years ago was an expensive book of half-tones ? with no identification of publisher or sponsorship ? called The Wooden Box vs . The Substitute . The photographs showed torn and damaged fiber boxes on express trucks and freight platforms , ripped with hook gashes , mashed from transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , shoe polish , and cleaning powder . Missionary work of this character was singularly unsuccessful . Handlers quickly learned to " Use No Hooks " and discovered that the containers could n't be allowed to get wet . A chronologically arranged list of articles accepted by the I.C.C . for shipment in fiber boxes shows exactly when this box expansion began and what happened to wooden containers . ( In 1913 , the year after the paper-box case was filed before the Commission , the production of paper board exceeded that of newsprint , which had previously exceeded any other paper in tonnage . ) Crackers , glass lamp chimneys , fruit jars , and cereals had been accepted in 1907 ; canned goods were admitted in 1914 , cigars and cigarettes in 1916 . Crockery and furniture were not shipped in fiber until after the War , and wood containers held on to textiles , dry goods , and paints and varnishes until the late 20 's . About all that wooden boxes now have left are raw fruits , vegetables , works of art , pianos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fiber containers for use in these remaining fields . Even the United States Army , which insisted upon deliveries in wooden boxes long after everybody else had discarded them , is now giving way ? perhaps because the British have insisted on fiber containers for Lease-Lend shipments to economize in weight and space in shipping . What the expansion of the chain stores and improved methods of distribution did not do to paper and paper board , the War did . ( Automobile transport also is involved here , but a consideration of it must be postponed until later in the series . ) The shortage of many foodstuffs completely changed the buying habits of the public ; people no longer got ready for winter because many of the articles ? one-hundred-pound bags of flour , for example ? were not to be had . Food prices rose to unheard of heights and consumers accustomed themselves to hand-to-mouth buying . They have never given it up . The change from private dwellings to apartment houses in the cities made storage impossible . Houses gave up their dining rooms ; kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what happened in food packing . During the shortage it was sold in amounts as small as a pound at a time . To save time clerks weighed out sugar in pound- and two-pound bags , tied them up and stowed them under the counter . At about the same time-1915 ? the American Sugar Refining Company hired a package specialist from the National Biscuit Company and , where previously they had packed only Domino tablets and a few other sugars , now they began to market the entire line in cardboard . A comparison of figures clearly shows what was happening to paper . In 1913 the per capita consumption of paper and paper board in the United States was about 65 pounds ; by 1927 it had more than doubled itself in a jump to 136 pounds , and by 1940 had almost doubled again , rising to 250 pounds , far exceeding consumption in any other country in the world . The use of paper in newsprint , periodicals , and books has increased prodigiously , but the greatest growth has come with improved methods of distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the War ended , the paper industry had before it the accumulated domestic demands which had been put off during hostilities ; there was another set of demands which had grown out of changed buying habits and methods of distribution ; there was a long series of products made out of paper which had mostly been in the experimental stage and which were awaiting exploitation . The boom in all three began immediately and rocked the industry on its balances . In this post-war boom the manufacturers of paper commodities had better luck than the papermakers . The investment ratio in paper manufacture is very high ? $1.6 in value of product to $1 in land , buildings , and equipment ; contiguity to wood supply , transport , and water ( water is an absolute essential in paper manufacture ) makes the selection of a mill site a difficult and often expensive problem . Furthermore , competition in the industry is intense , price cutting common ; the result was that while the consumption of paper was racing along , few of the papermakers were showing much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsprint ? Maine , New York , and Washing- ton ( most of our newsprint is imported ) Writing paper ? Massachusetts and Pennsyl-vania Book paper ? Ohio , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , and Michigan Tissue paper ? New York and Pennsylvania Wrapping and other papers ? Wisconsin , New York , Massachusetts , Michigan , and the Southern States from Tevng to Georgia The extraordinary expansion of paper manufacture in the South was one of the chief developments in the industry after the World War . Paper was made from Southern pine almost a century ago and , until the mill was destroyed by Sher-man 's army , a number of Confederate newspapers were printed on newsprint made from Georgia pine . Thereafter the manufacture lapsed and there grew up a hardy belief ? no one seems to know how it got started ? that because of its resins Southern pine was useless for paper manufacture . In 1909 the use of pine was revived at a mill in Roanoke Rapids , North Carolina ; two years later , in 1911 , Edward Mayo made kraft paper out of pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments of Dr. Charles Herty at his laboratory in Savannah , which proved all over again that newsprint and fine papers could be made of pine . By 1940 there were about 60 mills in various parts of the South making pine-wood pulp for wrapping paper , rayon yarn , cellulose film and other plastics , and for towels , toilet paper , and a dozen other paper products . But the prospects before the South as a paper-making region have an advantage that other parts of the country have never had . There is less pressure to get in , cut , and get out ; for the faster growth means a better chance for sustained yield . The increasing use of pine is transforming the economy of the South . Rayon made from Southern pine is taking the place of cotton as a material for tire fabrics . Multiwall bags ( as many as six bags may be placed one within another in bags of this type ) are displacing cotton and burlap bags for packing chemicals , fertilizers , cement , salt , flour , sugar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsprint prospects may not be so rosy since the consumption of it in the United States is slackening , owing to the competition of the radio as a disseminator of news and as an advertising medium . But out of Southern pine are made many of those articles ? paper napkins and paper towels for example ? which came into common use after the First World War . Nobody seems to know when toilet paper was invented . A patent was granted to one Seth Wheeler in 1871 for putting toilet paper up in rolls , but consumption was small and confined to cities . Its use first became common after 1900 , when the demand for plumbing increased and the possession of a bathroom , like the possession of an automobile , became an evidence of success . By 1919 toilet paper was an important commodity in the paper market and since then production has risen from 79,000 tons to 285,000 tons in 1939 . Paper napkins first appeared in this country in the 90 's as an importation from Japan ; they seem to have been manufactured here first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over a period of years but the real boom did not come until after 1920 when the quality was improved and folding machinery was devised which made them easier to pack and use . In 1940 thirty-five billion paper napkins were sold in the United States . Paper towels are such a recent development that the Department of Commerce did not bother to list them before 1925 . The Scott Paper Company introduced a paper towel in 1911 , intended primarily for use by workmen in industrial plants . Despite all the arguments about economy , many of the early towels were unsatisfactory because they carne apart while you wiped your hands . As soon as towels were devised that would not tear , their popularity became enormous . Production is now four times what it was in 1925 . One important by-product of the paper industry ? the sanitary napkin ? was a direct consequence of the War : it resulted from the use of cellulose wadding , made from wood pulp , for surgical dressings . It was introduced in 1920 , and facial tissues were brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plywood in the September number we spoke of the conflict between machine technology and the ideals of conspicuous waste , the persistent attempt of the manufacturer to imitate something else ? generally a luxury ? instead of exploiting the material 's own merits . For years rayon was an artificial silk and it only recently escaped this bondage ; for years plywood was regarded as a cheap substitute . The history of paper is littered with similar examples and none more apt than " the Third Avenue paper suitcase . " Everyone has seen this suitcase . Made of pasteboard , covered with pebbled black paper that imitates leather and deceives no one , equipped with a handle guaranteed to come off and with straps of scrap leather , this article ranks high in the list of shoddy goods . It has been made and sold for years , a cheap substitute for the expensive leather case that alone was socially acceptable . The leather might be heavy , it might crack , it was always expensive ; let it be imitated . Meantime the manufacture of laminated plastic luggage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape ? was creeping along on hands and knees . Finally the salesmen were converted to it and airplane travel with its necessity for light-weight luggage made it acceptable . Many waste baskets and other household articles are now made of plastic and laminated paper ; it is used in industry as a material for cams , bushings , gears , gaskets , and in many other ways . Paper bottles were not hindered by notions of conspicuous waste but Boards of Health were dubious about them , and glass manufacturers were very sympathetic with the doubts . A paper milk bottle was made in Dayton as early as 1915 and paper containers for other liquids were manufactured in Michigan at the same time . None was satisfactory . A paper milk bottle seems to have been made in Milwaukee even earlier . There were complaints because the cream line was not visible , as it is in a glass bottle . In the early 20 's Florida orange growers tried out paper bottles as containers for orange juice , but they did n't work either . The first successful liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dairy Company adopted the Sealcone milk bottle . In 1935 a number of oil companies began to use quart containers of paper for lubricating oil . Since then paper bottles have come on with a rush . Last summer a Chicago dairy decided to fight a Board of Health prohibition and got a favorable court decision ; now paper bottles are being adopted by milk companies all over the country . Because it costs too much to ship paper empties full of air , some dairy companies have installed fabricating machinery that will make the bottles at the creamery out of scored " blanks " supplied them by paper manufacturers . Some dairy companies are experimenting with the idea of a machine to make the bottle from a roll of paper at the bottling works . V The effects of the present war and the defense program on paper are difficult to foresee . The demands of the Army are enormous , and the paper industry is expanding as rapidly as possible to meet these demands . What will this oversized plant be used for when the war is over ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new consumer uses . For experiment is constant . Paper raincoats and windbreakers are already on the market . Du Pont was recently granted a patent on a process to make a noiseless waterproof paper suitable for lining garments . Paper sheets and pillow cases have been given a short trial , though they are still too expensive to offer competition to cotton . Seventy per cent of laminated plastics are made with paper ; there are paper thermometers that change color with changes in temperature . The recovery percentage from waste paper is very high and promises to be even greater since the recent introduction of vegetable inks . Old Chicago telephone books have their ink removed and are repulped to make new ones . A can manufacturer is now experimenting with a paper container for cooked fruit and vegetables . Another can company is trying out a beer can of reinforced molded paper . A very recent development is a paper bag lined with a transparent rubber derivative to replace vacuum pack cans for coffee . The bags are filled with coffee and before the bag is sealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide . Coffee in these bags is said to be marketable for sixty to seventy days . Not only does the bag cost less than tin but it also requires less space and weighs a third of an ounce , where the tin can weighs more than six ounces . And what next ? Here are two examples ? one concerned with the utilization of paper waste and one that has no connection with the industry at all . Many types of paper are made with a filler of clay which gives the paper body , opacity , or a smooth surface . To-day active experiment is being carried on to make a paper substitute from clay alone . This clay is called Bentonite and from it it is possible to make papers as clearly transparent as cellophane ; it may be used as a liner for containers and for hook paper that is " everlasting . " So far most of this so-called paper has been used in place of mica for insulation , but it has possibilities for other uses . Finally , there is the work being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of separating the wood fibers . This liquor promises to supply the raw materials for still another long list of consumption goods . Its chief constituent is lignin , the substance which glues one wood fiber to another and holds the tree together . For years the chief interest of chemists in lignin was not in what might be done with it but in how quickly and how cheaply it might be separated from the fibers that would be used for paper . The lignin itself , as a part of the waste liquor , was discharged into the nearest creek . Some years ago the conservationists became aroused about this and started a vigorous agitation to have the liquor diverted . In Wisconsin , for example , trout and bass fishing brought a considerable income into the State , and paper-mill waste did not help the fishing any . The Izaak Walton Clubs enlisted the help of the resort proprietors and succeeded in getting a law passed to restrict waste dumping . Forced at last to act , the paper makers hired research staffs and enough progress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may emerge . The chemical range of lignin is the same as that of coal and we may presently see drugs , colors , and other familiar coal-tar products coming from trees . As a result of successful manufacture in Finland and Canada , a company was organized recently to build a chain of plants near American paper mills to extract yeast of various types from waste liquor , " notably baker 's yeast , pharmaceutical yeast , and animal feed yeast . Plans include development and manufacture of glue , plastics , and fertilizers as by-products . " Already half the vanilla flavoring sold comes from paper-mill waste . Another by-product is used to tan leather ; still another is an activated carbon used for filtering sugar and beer ; a liquid resin is used in the manufacture of soap , ink , textiles , and in mineral flotation . So wide is the prospect which the byproducts offer that eventually they may be more valuable than paper itself . Meantime paper , having largely displaced wood as a container , is pushing glass and steel . To-morrow the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit in a museum of household arts .
