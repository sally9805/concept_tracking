The Jap still held the vital coastline of southeast China , but in the interior the offensive was falling from his hands . Tokyo had its explanation . It was that troops were being withdrawn from Chekiang and Kiangsi Provinces " to secure a . . . position for future action . " <P> Perhaps Tokyo was telling the truth . Perhaps troops were being moved out of China for the Manchukuoan or the Indian front . All China 's dauntless , underarmed soldiers knew was that wherever they met the enemy , he took a beating . <P> Last week , while the token U.S. Air Force in China blasted at Japanese-held objectives , ground forces of the Chinese took two pearls of potentially great price . They pushed the enemy back through Chekiang Province and retook two of the finest military airdromes in China ; one at Lishui , only 700 miles from the great naval base at Nagasaki ; another at Chuhsien , only a few bomber steps farther . China knew what could be done to Japan from there . <P> To hold such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary airdromes built with plodding care , and not to be able to use them for lack of bombers , was tough . But the Chinese fought on , took great cuts of the eastern railroads , pressed south as well as east . This week Chungking reported that its troops were only 40 miles from Canton , home of the revolution . The enemy was not as tough and strong as he used to be . <P> Immediately , that fact was encouraging . But in the long view it might be the portent of disaster . If , with the troops moved from China , the Jap took India , shutting off U.S. aid , China 's glory might become China 's woe , might upset all the United Nations ' long-range plans .
