txt AWED DEAL LOOMS ON WORLD MARKETS FOR OIL AFTER WAR Negotiations About to Begin Rere-on an Agreement With Britain and Russia MIDDLE EAST IS INVOLVED Control of 95 Per Cent of the Petroleum Resources Viewed as Peace-Making Weapon By J. H. CARMICAL Involved in the program for the development of the vast oil resources of the Middle East is a contemplated agreement among the United States , British and Russian Governments with respect to the sale and distribution of petroleum products in the world markets in the post-war period . Controlling more than 95 per cent of the known oil resources , such an agreement would be an effective weapon at the peace conference as well as in international trade and politics . With an understanding in principle of the over-all scope of such a plan reported to have been reached at the Teheran and Cairo conferences last fall , it is understood that the details will be worked out here in a series of bilateral conferences along the lines of the prewar trade treaties conducted by the State Department . The British Government already has officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the proposed plan , and a British delegation is expected to arrive in the next week or two . It is understood that the Russian mission is scheduled to follow immediately after the conclusion of the conferences with the British . Secrecy Over Agreement Much secrecy has surrounded the negotiations in the proposed agreement . So far the only official announcement by any public official has been that by Harold L. Ickes , Secretary of the Interior . This was to the effect that a pipeline costing $130,000,000 to $165,000,000 would be built across Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean by the Petroleum Reserves Corporation , a Government agency . However , to process the oil to be moved through the pipeline , a refinery of 260,000 barrels daily capacity would be needed at its Mediterranean terminal , and this probably will be built by some arrangement with PRC . Among the details expected to be worked out with the British delegation is the construction of two pipelines and an additional refinery capacity of 350,000 barrels daily at Haifa , Palestine . One of these lines would run from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other // ALLIED DEAL LOOMS ON CONTROL OF OIL // would parallel the present line from Kirkuk , Irak , to Haifa . Recently there has been much discussion in the oil industry relative to the settlement of the British-Mexican oil dispute which grew out of the seizure in 1938 by ' the , Mexican Government of - all the , foreign-owned oil properties in , that country . . A settlement already has been made with the United States nationals , and it is considered likely that the British delegation while here may also take up the question of the Mexican settlement . The United States Government ' has not heretofore participated directly in oil operations either at home or abroad . However , the en- , tire oil resources of Russia , are owned by the government , and Great Britain , through the ownership of a majority of stock in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company , also is a large operator . Thus , in order to compete on more favorable ' terms with these governments , the United States last July formed the PRC with power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge oil resources of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , the American owners of these concessions several months ago were asked to sell them to the PRC . When they said they were not interested in disposing of them , the PRC wanted to buy a part interest . When this proposal was turned down , the question of building a pipeline from the concessions to the Mediterranean was broached and an agreement in principle for the construction of such a line recently was reached . Previously , however , the United States and British Governments had arranged to finance the Arabian Government . Since Saudi Arabia was under the influence of the British , the financing arrangement was carried out through an advance made by the United States Government to the British with the understanding that $25,000,000 would go to King Ibn Saud . The oil reserves of Saudi Arabia are believed to be the largest in the world . Although exploratory drilling has been done on only a very few of the many oil structures in that country , it is estimated Mr I the oil industry that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of consumption this would be enough oil alone to supply the world for fourteen to fifteen years . The oil reserves of Iran and Iraq also are among the world 's largest and it is quite possible that com billed they may prove to be as large as those of Arabia . Development work there preceded that in Arabia by several years and the actual known proved reserves of , these two countries at present are greater than . those in Arabia . Under the present plans the development and operation of Iran and Iraq would be entirely British . However , the United States Government would make a loan to the British to facilitate their development , including the construction of additional refineries and also the extensive pipeline facilities . The large amount of steel needed for the project would be shipped from the United States . The groundwork for the partici-1 pation of Russia in the oil picture of the post-war world has been . mostly completed . When sounded out on what participation it wanted in. the export markets , it is understood that the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about 150,000,000 barrels . This is at the rate of a little better than 400,000 barrels daily . In the pre-war period , Russia 's production amounted to only about 250,000,000 barrels yearly , or around ** barrels daily . Like the Middle East , the oil re- , serves of Russia are huge and it1 is understood that further developments have taken place in- the , last two years . Through lend-lease ' operations around a dozen re- ' fineries have been shipped into the Soviet Union in the past two years and it is understood that most of these now or soon will be in oper ation ; In addition , Russia for years has been the second largest oilproducing nation . A network of pipelines has been in operation between the Caspian and Black Seas for a long period . For these reasons it is quite possible that Russia could be a formidable factor in the world markets , immediately after the cessation of hostilities . The only other two important oil-producing areas are the United States and the Caribbean regionWith oil reserves here being depleted rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the domestic producers to supply home needs . In fact , it is quite likely that it will be necessary to import large quantities of oil from the Caribbean area . As present plans are shaping up , it is intended that the postwar markets in Europe , Asia and Africa will be supplied almost entirely with oil produced in Russia and the Middle East , while the oil resources in the United States and the Caribbean will be used virtually exclusively in. the Western Hemisphere . The Caribbean production already is under the control of privately owned British and American oil companies .
