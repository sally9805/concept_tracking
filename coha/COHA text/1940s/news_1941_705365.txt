txt CITY ASKS ALBANY TO VOTE DIVERSION OF ITS RELIEF TAX Measure Sent to Legislature Permits the Excess to Go to Other Welfare Uses NO LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT Powers Delegated to Council for Three More Years Add New Purposes to Levies By WARREN MOSCOW Special to Tax Myr YORK limas . ALBANY , Feb. ** the heels of the bus bill introduced yesterday the La Guardia administration sent to Albany today its longawaited measure to permit the city to divert excess revenues from its unemployment relief taxes to other social welfare purposes , thus relieving part of the strain on the normal city budget . The bill will be introduced tomorrow by Assemblyman Moffat and Senator Coudert , who said in a joint statement that they were not committed to the details or the form of the measure , which they have not had time to study . The bill differs from previous legislation dealing with the city 's emergency taxing powers , first granted in 1934 , in that it asks that these powers be delegated to the City Council for a three-year period . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , and the Legislature renewed the grant of powers annually thereafter . Last year , after the Legislature took $4,500,000 of revenues from the bank tax which the city had received up to then , the Legislature gave the city the right to use $4,500,000 of the relief tax surplus to make up the deficit . It was the first deviation from the rule that the emergency taxes , headed by the sales tax , were to be used for emergency purposes only . The $4,500,000 was earmarked for old-age assistance in last year 's measure . No Limit on Fund Diversion This year the bill sets forth that the city may use the money collected under the emergency taxes , extended for three years , for relief , veterans ' relief , old-age assistance , aid to dependent children , assist ' ance to the blind , care and support lof destitute and neglected children and aid to charitable institutions . The measure thus puts no limit on the amount that ? gay be diverted , but generally extends the purpose for which the emergency 1 . taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the depression brought on vastly increased social services , apart from home relief , and that these will continue . The city 's normal revenues from real estate can not carry the additional burden , the city declares . The present cumulative surplus from relief taxes is $14,000,000 , according to the figures presented to the Legislature last week by Controller . Presumably , the greater part of it , if not all , would be used during the coming fiscal year , and the city would count on a recurring surplus in future years , due to decreased home relief costs and increased revenues from the taxes . The attitude of the legislative leaders toward the bill as introIduced did not manifest itself today . In the early part of the session there was a definite tie-up between the extension of the relief taxing powers and the proposal by the real estate interests for creation of boards of assessment review to cut down realty assessments in New York and many up-State cities . Enthusiasm for the boards of assessment review has lessened somewhat , although the leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . lip-State cities as well as New York would be badly hit by a reduction of realty assessments through an easier method of assessment review than now exists . Realty interests probably would back the La Guardia diversion bill if a guarantee of realty tax cuts could be incorporated in the proposal in some manner , but the city is against this . It argues that it will get no relief and no money for its increased welfare activities if the diversion is accompanied by a forced cut in revenues from real estate . One argument against the La Guardia bill is that giving the city blanket taxing power for items now covered in the normal city budget would not be conducive to economies and that cities have habitually spent up to their statutory limits . The city 's argument is that economies have been made and the city has absorbed many new items of expense , forced on it , in its regular budget . No one takes seriously the time I limit in the bill . Extension of the city 's emergency taxing powers is expected to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since 1934 , when there was a two-year limit , and 1936 , when the one-year limit was imposed . Council Must Re-enact Taxes Enactment of the bill would not automatically continue the taxes , since these have to be re-enacted by the City Council . The bill does specify , in accordance with the new provisions of the State Constitution , what types of taxes the city , may and may not impose . The Legislature last year prohibited thei city from levying a cigarette tax under the tax bill and this prohibition is carried on in the current measure . The bill also re-enacts the $4,500 , - 000 diversion proposal of last year , but this is for technical purposes , so that it will not be deemed repealed in the interval - between passage of this measure and the start of the city 's new fiscal year on July 1 . It is not possible to estimate just how much the city would be able to divert each year from the present taxes to the welfare purposes now covered by the regular city budget . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fiscal year 1939-40 , but this included $5,500,000 from the cigarette tax , now banned , and it fails to compensate for the $4,500,000 in bank tax revenues taken from the city for State purposes . The minimum figure can be set , on this basis , at $5,000,000 profit , with the probability of it doubling or trebling as relief costs drop and revenues rise due to increased business activity . Bus Bill Chances Improve . The report showed that the city received $12,000,000 from the tax on unincorporated businesses ; $55,000,000 from the sales tax ; $9,000,000 from the utility tax ; $1,700,000 from the personal tax , a variation of the sales tax ; $425,000 from the conduit tax , and $1,318,000 in interest and penalties during the fiscal year 1939-40 . The bill to be introduced tomorrow would permit the levying again of all of these taxes . It became apparent today that the chances of passage of the bus bill sent up yesterday have increased materially , due to local Brooklyn pressure for it . This will swing Democratic support to the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The objections are likely to weaken under the pressure . Irwin Steingut , Democrat minority leader of the Assembly , sponsored a bus bill similar to the Crews bill sent up by the city , and amended it today so that it is exactly the same as the Crews measure . This may result in some jockeying as to who gets local credit for the measure , since the City Council has to send a message requesting passage .
