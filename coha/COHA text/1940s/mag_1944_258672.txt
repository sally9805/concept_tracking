General Charles de Gaulle had won Parisian hearts . He had also won a practically unchallenged right to rule France . His hour of triumph , ticked off by snipers ' fire at him , was one for history . Eyewitnesses recorded it : <P> At 18 minutes past 3 on the afternoon of Saturday , August 26 , General de Gaulle bent his tall , awkward body below the Arc de Triomphe and laid on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier two bunches of flame-colored gladioli . The flame at the tomb still burned . De Gaulle laid a Cross of Lorraine , fashioned of white roses , beside the gladioli , and stood at attention while a bugler sounded Aux Marts ( taps ) . <P> As the General turned to start his march down the Champs Elysees , the person closest to him was a Negro in a dirty white shirt , his arm in a sling made of a dirty towel . He was one of the bravest fighters in Paris ' week-long battle for liberation , and there was something significant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common man 's France . <P> Not Since Bastille Day . De Gaulle stepped out on his long legs . Behind him were General Joseph-Pierre Koenig , commander of the French Forces of the Interior , and General Jacques Leclerc , the commander of France 's Second Armored Division . On each side rumbled Leclerc 's tanks . Behind the Generals marched leaders of the motley bands of the F.F.I. , and behind them the most bizarre parade that ever trod this historic avenue . <P> There were cars of every kind but new ones , piled high with people . They waved flags and handkerchiefs , saluted , made the V sign . One girl sat on the hood of an old car , her arm aloft , her eyes burning with joy and pride . A captain sat on a tank , his hand held stiffly at attention , tears streaming down his face . <P> The crowd that packed the avenue from buildings to nearly midway of the road was a crowd of every kind of people . One woman , at least 70 years old , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed trees , peered out from windows and roofs . Perhaps not since Bastille Day had the people of France celebrated such a victory . <P> Then , the Shouting . Down the Champs Elysees into the Place de la Concorde went the procession , at the pace of De Gaulle 's brisk walk . There he and the dignitaries got into cars and the procession proceeded down Rue de Rivoli at 40 m.p.h. to the Hotel de Ville . There the Committee of Liberation received De Gaulle as head of the Provisional Government . Then the procession crossed the river to lie Saint-Louis and Notre Dame . <P> In front of the Hotel de Ville the shooting started . Dozens of cars and jeeps jamming the square were suddenly slowed by a narrow street . A machine gun let go from the top story of a high building across from the Hotel de Ville . Then other machine guns and rifles fired from above . Everything stopped . People dived under cars , trucks , jeeps , while every man who had a gun or a pistol-and hundreds had-started firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered , fell flat , piled three or four deep in places . <P> <P> The shooting spread . Soon there was shooting all over Paris .
