As Tom Dewey ended his western trip last week , Bob Taft 's speech resounded in his ears . Taft had said a lot of the things Dewey himself expected to say in due time . It would be a little galling if , on some national issues , e.g. , taxes , labor , the Truman Administration , he could only say " me , too . " <P> But looking back over his trip ( in four weeks he had traveled 6,200 miles and talked with the Republican leaders of 15 states ) , he was well pleased . He knew that he had handled himself well . He reckoned that of the 547 convention delegates needed for nomination , he had lined up some 420. * By his own calculation he was a good one-to-five bet to capture the U.S. presidency . <P> Nothing Doing in Owosso . In his native Michigan , on the last lap of his trip , he had encountered a distinct coolness among Republican state leaders . To be sure , they came to visit him at Owosso , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey ( whom he calls " Mater " ) . With Arthur Vandenberg on their minds , Michigan Republicans were noncommittal about even a second-or third-ballot vote for Dewey . But Dewey was confident they would come to him in the end . <P> The only excitement in Owosso was when the porch swing fell down . Tom Dewey himself had made the swing in a manual training class 30 years ago . It was high-backed , narrow and uncomfortable , but Mrs. Dewey was proud of her son 's handiwork and she hung it on the front porch of the white clapboard house on Oliver Street . She made a pad for it , and whenever it came apart , she patched it up with wire . One afternoon last week the wire gave way . Down in a heap went 165-Ib . Tom Dewey , 210-lb . National Committeeman Arthur E. Summerfield , 180-Ib . State Committee Treasurer Ben 0 . Shepherd . No casualties . <P> Work Undone . The Dewey boys , Tom Jr . and John , also found Owosso dull . They spent most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with New York State Troopers Ed Galvin and Joe Micklas . Tom Dewey was hard put to find anything else for them to do . <P> He did take them to Ann Arbor to see the University of Michigan campus . Tom Dewey , ' 23 , hoped that some day 15-year-old Tom Jr . would also go to Michigan . When newsmen asked Tom Jr . what he thought of the university , he snapped : " No comment . " Tom Sr. spoke to his son in private . Later Tom Jr . announced that he thought the university was " wonderful . " Dewey made no bones about wishing he had left the boys at home . " They got too much attention , " he said sadly , " and much of the good work Mrs. Dewey and I put in on them was undone . " <P> <P> * Not including Pennsylvania , however . Said Republican Governor James ( Big Jim ) Duff as Dewey finished his western tour : " For the Republican Party to tie itself up to a single candidate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the party a pig in a poke .
