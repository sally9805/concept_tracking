Fivn years ago the United States was an isolationist power . It is true that the American people never actually voted for isolationism , whether in 1920 , 1940 , or 1944 . Yet the doctrine was always in the offing . It was a powerful factor in our national life ; it influenced our policy-makers ; and it entered into the calculations of other nations in our regard . With the possible exception of Russia ? which had , however , favored collective security during the thirties ? we were more withdrawn into ourselves than any other major power . Today that situation has been completely reversed : there has been a bloodless revolution as dramatic as any in history . No longer is America isolationist in comparison with other nations : rather , other nations are isolationist in comparison with us . It is no exaggeration to say that the American people as a whole are now the most world-minded on earth . Even the average'Britisher seems to be less keenly aware of his involvement in the affairs of the world ? especially those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are , of course , a number of obvious reasons for this profound and dramatic change . The war itself taught us lessons for which no amount of oratory could be a substitute . And the explosion of the atomic bomb , which was not only heard but felt all around the world , reverberated most particularly in American hearts , to the advantage of the internationalist thesis . The revolution in attitude can be credited to no one thing , no one man . It has its roots in millions of humble homes , whose sons went forth , many at the cost of their lives , to repair the errors and misconceptions of the past . It is profoundly democratic in nature . Yet if we look back with the historian 's eye , we can see that in the process of their change the people were represented pre-eminently by two spokesmen , who saw things very differently , but who were in fundamental agreement concerning the international crisis of their time . These two leaders , who died within six months of each other , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our bloodless revolution , the historian of the future will have to understand both of those men . He will , however , find that they represent very different historical problems . The record of Mr. Roosevelt is basically official , and will certainly be supplemented by copious memoirs and documents from the files of his advisers . Mr. Willkie also made an official record as the Republican candidate in 1940 ; yet this was in fact only supplementary to his basic contribution . Mr. Willkie played his historic role primarily as a private citizen . As Archibald MacLeish has so poignantly pointed out , he never succeeded in winning election to a major public office ? never even held such an office ? yet he achieved world-wide influence . Ho exercised power , not through victory , but through defeat . And just because the Willkie record is primarily that of a private citizen , there is danger that its significance will be lost . This danger is not merely ' sentimental . Naturally Mr. Willkie 's friends want him to get full credit for his historic task ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the time . Wendell Willkie was a product of his time in every sense of the word , and any historian who fails to understand him will fail to understand the crisis out of which he emerged . If the people of the future do not know him , they will not know us ; and they will not know how the revolution came about . Wendell Willkie was a striving American who began life in a small Midwestern town . He believed ? as Americans congenitally must ? in growth , development , " progress . " And he practiced what he believed . The great truths that he represented so forcefully at the end of his life had always lived within him in potential form , as many who knew him in his younger days will affirm ; yet their expression as practical political doctrine required a kind of unfoldment of character , like a tree developing from a seed ; and this unfoldment was born of- long ? but successful ? struggle . In this sense he was traditionally American . Yet Mr. Willkie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordeal . He was the protagonist of a gigantic drama . The dynamic of this drama was that he would not accept , would not stoop to represent , a status quo ? whether this was a Hoover statue quo or a Roose-/ volt status quo . Those have been two phases of ' American history , both of which have failed ? and seriously failed ? to answer the questions of human ' freedom pushing up through the bloody soil of the i. twentieth century . These questions of freedom ? of freedom , specifically , in a technological age ? were ' Wendell Willide 's questions . But they were fatal ; questions to ask and answer honestly , because so ' many of the answers lay beyond the political under , standing of the American people in the critical years from 1988 to 1944 . And just because people were not then ready for , those answers , Wendell Willkie is a tragic figure . His tragedy can be understood not in the secondary sense of sorrow ( for he was the most buoyant of men ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Abraham Lincoln , he represented a struggle in the American soul , a conflict which Americans had not yet resolved in his lifetime . He represented unfulfilled aspirations involving certain decisions that the people I had not yet dared to make . Because he faced these aspirations ? because he embraced them as his own his leadership could not materialize in political office in his time . It was his task to be faithful to 1 realities which we , as a nation , were as yet unable to grasp . But his enormous influence lay in the fact that he lived up to that faith that he was faith , ful to the unfulfilled . 2 liVERYWHERE you turn you hear the comment that Wendell Wand() was not a " practical politician . " ! Yet this impression of him is wholly false . To speak personally , I have worked with a good many politiI cians ; I have taken instructions from them , and have in some cases even ventured to advise them ; and I will say without any reservation that Mr. Willkie was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known . Those who think him " impractical " forget the incredible political feat that I he accomplished : to emerge from the public utility industry ( the most hated of that day ) and capture the nomination of a party which he had only recently joined ; to roll up the biggest popular vote in the history of that party ; and thereafter , in defeat , to use that party as an instrument for holding the nation on its course through its most perilous crisis . None but the most astute and realistic of politicians could have accomplished that . It is the record , not of a dreamer , but of a shrewd and practical man . What do people mean , then , when they call Wendell Willkie " impractical " in politics ? They mean , essentially , that he was not making the right moves to win office in his time . This was in large measure true . But it was not because he was " impractical " ; it was because he did not want to hold office , except on certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be willing to face those questions of human freedom which they had failed to face , and which their leaders had failed to face . They must be willing and able to vote for the unfulfilled answers to those questions . And Wendell Willkie did not want to be voted into office on any other basis . And for that matter , by 1944 , he did not even want a nomination , he did not even want a chance to run , unless this proposition was first made clear to the politicians who wielded power in the name of the people . He could not appease those politicians ? - not one of them ? and still adequately represent the unfulfilled truths within the people which the people wanted him to represent . And since those politicians were seeking a status quo , Mr. Willkie , and with him the American future , was frustrated . The same point is illustrated in the riddle of the Wisconsin primary . Almost everybody wonders why Willkie chose to run that race , in which he failed to win a single delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the riddle is not so simple as that . Plenty of politicians had warned Mr. Willkie of defeat ; the risk was large and he knew it . The riddle can be understood only if we recognize that there was one indispensable move he had to make in 1944 : he had to meet the isolationists head on . He had to show that the isolationists could be defeated , or else ? which is what he actually did show ? that they were capable of defeating , through the international issue , everything we cherish for the future of America . It is doubtless true that if Mr. Willkie could have predicted his defeat with certainty , he would have shrewdly devised some other , less costly way to meet his issue . But he had to meet it somewhere , somehow ; and he had to meet it , not just with words , but at the risk of total loss . Wisconsin is a riddle if we think of Wendell Willkie as a man seeking office . But it acquires meaning ? tragic meaning ? when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man engaged in the development of political truths , which the people , and more especially their politicians , were not yet ready to grasp . The principle also emerges ? to take a third and final illustration ? from his attitude toward the New York gubernatorial election of 1942 . There was a concerted move to draft Mr. Willie for governor of New York in that year . Great pressure was brought to induce him to seize the Republican nomination . But he rejected the idea . There were , of course , certain political risks involved , and many people suppose that his rejection was based on these . But this was not the case . The proposition had almost no political appeal for him . Instead , he chose to take a trip around the world . It is difficult , even to this day , for many of his friends to understand this ; they think he was mistaken . But the idea that he was mistaken is begotten , again , of the fallacy that Wendell Willkie was seeking office . He was indeed seeking office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ambitious man ; yet the office had to have meaning in terms of those inner and unfulfilled aims for which he was working . The governorship of New YOrk , however useful as a means of reaching the White House , had no such meaning . Mr. Willkie could in fact see two roads to the White House in 1942 . One road led through Albany ; the other , through Moscow and Chungking . And the Moscow-Chungking route was of necessity his ; not because it was the shortest , or the easiest , or the surest  --  for it was none of these ? but because it involved the future ; because it dramatized , and so hastened , the arrival of that inevitable time when Americans would think in terms of all the peoples of the earth . Maybe you could not get to the White House that way in 1944 . But if you were faithful to the hidden potentialities of America , you could go there no other way . 3 WHAT were these hidden potentialities which thus dominated the career of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , but an exceedingly difficult one to answer . Wendell Willkie was not a systematic philosopher . His vision of America is nowhere wrapped up in a package ; it is embedded in speeches and papers dealing primarily with the practical issues of the time , and only secondarily or by inference with the future . I should like , however , to take the license of a friend who had the benefit of many long and intimate conversations with him . With a little interpolation for the sake of brevity , I think that the kind of world he looked forward to can be made . clear . There exist on earth today three dominant ideas affecting the political and economic outlook of mankind . These ideas are : the idea of organization , as developed especially by Germany ; the idea of community , as developed especially by Russia ; and the idea of individual liberty , as developed by Great Britain and the United States . Each of these ideas contains truth ; yet each , carried to extremes , isproductive of evil . The idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis carried it to such an extreme that it reared itself against us as the anti-Christ . Russia has carried the idea of community to an extreme which excludes individual liberty . And we ourselves have sometimes carried individual liberty so irresponsibly far as to endanger the economic security of millions . If we visualize these three ideas at issue in the world , we can understand much of what Wendell Willkie was striving to accomplish . He understood all three . But more than this , he understood the interrelation of all three . He knew that an industrial society can not survive as a democracy if any one of these ideas is lacking . Hence the great task , the task of the future , is to find a kind of synthesis by which they can operate , not only simultaneously , but in combination . It was because he could see the necessity for combination that Wendell Willkie was so misinterpreted by the politicians . One of the reasons he appealed to Republicans was that he understood industrial organization . But he also baffled Republicans ? who accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as clearly that an industrial society can not survive unless the requirements of the community are met , and that these requirements ? of security , of stability , of health and education ? involve us inescapably in a strong and extensive Federal government . But at the same time Wendell Willkie knew that both the idea of organization and the idea of community must be modified by the concept of individualism . He knew that if this modification is not made , our civilization will fall a prey to the state . It is scarcely necessary to stress the intensity of his belief in liberty . Privately , it took the form of an impassioned insistence on personal independence . Publicly , it molded his every policy . " Freedom , " he was fond of saying , " is indivisible . " He hated the word " tolerance . " " If men are equal , " he would ask , " why should one group talk about ' tolerating ' another ? " He took positive joy in the defense of minorities , and was never afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one field this logic led him to the equality of the Negro ; in another , to the limitation of the powers of government , however large ; in still another , to an insistence on real competition in industry , real enterprise . He never forgot that somewhere along the line , individual liberty involves individual risk ; that , without risk , men are not free . Now , clearly , this idea of individual liberty is m conflict at many points with the other two dominant ideas of our time . The conflict exists , not only beyond our shores , but right here in our midst . Mr. Willkie was deeply involved in it , and he sought constantly for a way to resolve it . The conclusion that he finally reached , which very few of his contemporaries have understood , was that , as between the three ideas I have sought to outline , there is no necessary conflict at all . There is no necessary conflict , for example , between a broad social security program ( the community idea ) and the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the Republican Old Guard has based most of its campaigning , is not inherent in the ideas themselves : it is created by men . And it is created , for the most part , by one particular evil : the effort of some men to exclude other men from the benefits of their resources and their labor . In domestic affairs , this exclusion takes the primary form of monopolistic practices ? riot merely economic , but also political and sociaL Among nations it takes the form of nationalism . Wendell Willkie knew deep in his bones that the evil of exclusion is the great eurse of our time . He knew that only by breaking down artificial barriers , whether economic or political , whether national or racial , can we hope to satisfy the basic requirements of an industrial age ? work , security , and freedom , for every individual . 4 HAD the world been at peace , Mr. Willkie 's main attack might have been directed at monopolies whether private or governmental . But with the world in chaos he swung the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make good note of the fact , however , that his attitude toward nationalism was no sudden realization , born of an emergency ; he had battled nationalism all his life . The theory of One World , for example , was the fruit of a lifetime of effort to express , in concrete political form , the universal laws of freedom . There was , however , one special discovery that he made on the One World trip . He discovered , tangibly , the enormous influence of America . It became overwhelmingly evident that if national barriers are to be broken , America must take the lead . The United States , he found , possessed the resources , the good will , and the traditions of political and economic freedom requisite for leadership , and no other nation did . This discovery clarified his life 's work . We in the United States were taking the idea of individual liberty for granted . But it can not be taken for granted . We must seed it and cultivate it ; we must encourage it ; we must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice it . The aim of our foreign policy must be an unfoldment of our national will , to spread and strengthen the idea of liberty . For if we do not spread and strengthen it , no one else will ; and if no one else does , it will be overcome and superseded elsewhere by other ideas ; and if elsewhere , then also here . A friend of Mr. Willkie 's recettly said : " The very phrase ' One World ' has entered into the language and is no longer even used in quotes . It is used as a kind of sluirthand for a whole set of ideas and a whole way of thinking . " That is correct . One World is a completb philosophy . Like all the great conceptsof the human mind , it has applications on many levels . It applies to the maintenance of peace , because war anywhere in the world means war for us . It applies economically , because depression anywhere in the world means eventual depression here . And it applies politically , because the maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World philosophy is thus exceedingly complex ; yet its central idea is divinely simple ? that one man anywhere in the world is related to , is tied in with , all men everywhere in the world . The political purpose of mankind , with America taking the lead , is to make this inescapable relationship productive of work , security , and freedom , equally and universally . This doctrine , therefore , envisions a world in which the so-called sovereign powers of ' nations shall be limited , the absolute power to make war curtailed , the absolute power to levy unilateral tariffs modified , the absolute power to harm other nations denied . It envisions a world that is open to trade and expansion , education and the franchise . It envisions a world in which peoples of all colors and creeds will be guaranteed equal rights and opportunities , free franchise , free speech , and free education . One World is a free world . To the " realists " among us , all this may seem hopelessly idealistic . But to the man who collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it evidently did not seem hopeless at all . For in pursuit of it he gave his life . We can not , indeed , regard Wendell Willkie 's death as a mere failure of the physical heart . His heart failed ; yet the ancients , when they used the word " heart , " had a more profound concept than ours . For them , the heart represented the soul : when it was broken , an inner element of a man 's being was broken , and a physical collapse could well follow after . Wendell Willkie 's heart was broken in this way . It was broken by his own friends ; by the desertion , after Wisconsin , of associates who had been sharing the load ; by the discovery that only a handful were willing to go the long , hard road with him all the way . This was no mere sentimental indulgence : it was a question of his own human resources . In the years between 1940 and 1944 ? the years of Wendell Willkie 's international unfoldment ? he reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1940 ? that grim and terrible year , with democracy in full retreat before Hitler 's armies . This was a crucial time for the United States , with a Presidential election in the offing and Pearl Harbor just around the corner . The isolationists , growing stronger by the hour , were planning to seize the Republican Party as their political vehicle. , In this they had made substantial progress . Many Republicans , of course , were fighting isolationism . But most of the party 's official leadership was following the isolationist line on the lifeand-death issues of foreign policy . Mr. Willkie 's rivals for the Republican nomination at Philadelphia were isolationists . And the Roosevelt administration , which also had its " practical politicians , " was moving with a caution that at times seemed like appeasement of that dangerous doctrine . In casting up the account for that period , the future historian should ask himself what would have happened had Senator Taft or the then almost frankly isolationist Thomas E. Dewey been nominated at Philadelphia . What would have happened on such issues as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titular Republican leader followed his " advisers " in manufacturing negative criticism of all Administration policies ? The answer is not to be found in the size of the Republican vote . The realistic answer is that the Roosevelt administration itself would have been afraid to push those measures , or even ( in some cases ) to propose them . Wendell Willkie 's leadership was different . On November 11 , 1940 , less than a week after his defeat , he went on the air with what has already become a historic speech . " A vigorous , loyal and public-spirited opposition , " he said , is vital to the " balanced operation " of democracy . But such opposition must be constructive and responsible ; it must be a " loyal opposition , " working primarily in the interests of the country , rather than in the supposed interests of party . It must be free to agree with the Administration as well as to disagree . The great test of this theory came a few months later , Would the " loyal opposition " support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There were many crises in Mr. Willkie 's brief political career , but I am satisfied that this one was the most critical of all . During the weeks immediately following the introduction of the bill , he emerged as one of the truly great American statesmen ? a citizen of the world . He was never in doubt , of course , about his stand on Lend-Lease ; but he did nourish a forlorn hope that the Republicans would not make an issue of it . If they did , he would have only one course ; and as a shrewd and practical politician he knew that that course would split his party wide open . While he waited for the situation to develop , his switchboard was jammed with telephone calls ; his after-dinner conversations , always brilliant , became tempestuous . Then Dewey and Hoover came out against the bill , and the issue was drawn . Wendell Wilkie brushed aside the politicians and came out for it . The result was exactly what he had expected . The Republican organization , blind to the overriding issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateurs who had fought so frenetically for him six months previously were split apart . But his course was now clear . During the campaign he had devoted much of his energies to domestic issues ; now the international issue absorbed almost all of them . He flew to London to see for himself whether Britain had any chance of surviving ; hurried home to testify before the Senate and to stem the rising tide of Lend-Lease opposition within his own party , which the New York Times described as " more and more a strictly party stand . " Today Wendell Willkie 's testimony in the gloomy atmosphere of February , 1941 , reads like inspired prophecy . Britain , he said , was not beaten . And democracy would survive . 5 Ira BlY perhaps prejudiced opinion , the " loyal opposition " theory saved this country . By breaking up partisan opposition to a series of absolutely critical measures , it gave the Administration its opportunity to mobilize the nation for war . Many observers ? and I am one of them ? believe that the mobilization was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , it is clear that from 1940 to 1943 the cause of democracy depended on the American war measures , which in turn depended very largely on opposition support . Had there been no Lend-Lease it is doubtful whether the Germans could have been stopped at Alamein or at Stalingrad . And it is well to remember that the Congress came within one vote of demobilizing our army four months before Pearl Harbor ( re-newel of the Selective Service Act ) . Through the " loyal opposition " Wendell Willkie set himself up as a kind of immovable fulcrum on which the Administration could set its wartime levers . There was never any " alliance " between Franklin Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie ? rumors of this were fabrications of a hostile press . Nevertheless , while attacked by the Willkie people on his foreign policy , Mr. Roosevelt astutely understood that Mr. Willkie would fight the isolationists at any political cost , and he learned to lean heavily on his shaggy opponent whenever the life-and-death issues of the nation were involved . The result was that from 1940 through 1944 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government than in any of the other major crises in its history . Lincoln had McClellan to cope with ; Wilson had Lodge . Franklin Roosevelt 's opponent , however , undertook to combat the destructive forces which always do appear in a crisis , and against which Mr. Roosevelt could have battled only at the risk ( which Wendell Willkie took upon himself ) of losing all . That this struggle cost Mr. Willkie his life , there can be no reasonable doubt . Almost nobody really knows the magnitude of the load that he had to carry . Some people know the load that he carried at the office ? the intense interviews , one pushing against the other ; the incessant telephone calls ringing in from all parts of a continent ; letters at the rate of thousands a day ; requests for speeches at the rate of five or six hundred a month . Still others know the story of his mind , the probing of the future , the weighing of issues ? the load of responsibility that his leadership entailed . Still others are familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting of his support here , the raising of his opposition there , the rallying of forces at some fardistant point to undermine an intrenched isolationist . Each of his associates knows that particular part of the load he or she helped to carry . Almost no one knows it all . But of course the biggest single load was the load of the party . On issue after issue he was forced to oppose his own people first . The list is long and massive : the destroyer deal and aid to Britain ; Selective Service ; Lend-Lease ; the occupation of Iceland ; the extension of Selective Service ; the revision of the Neutrality Act ; increased aid to Russia and China , and a better understanding of those essential partners ; the definition of war aims ; the drive for an international organization with power to act . On all these , and more , he had to overcome the Republican " leaders " before he could challenge his official opponent , Franklin Roosevelt , on the real , the far-reaching issues of America 's destiny . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto for his life might be " Et tu , Brute " ; for it was the desertion of self-styled friends and associates that hastened , if it did not actually cause , his death . He was not " disillusioned " by these desertions ; he was shrewd enough to know that few men are capable of sacrificing their own interests for the principles that they profess . But he was practical enough to see that each defection from the cause merely added to the impossible load that he was carrying . Immediately before and after the nomination of Thomas E. Dewey , when hundreds of professed One Worlders were yielding to the forces of political expediency , the tragic little scene was re-enacted almost every day : " Why , so-and-so was one of the best friends I had in the world . He Went all-out for the limitation of sovereignty . How can he do this now ? " The complaint was not merely personal . It was the complaint of a giant dedicated to a cause which he recognized as greater than himself : a cause that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILnans has won more since his death than he won during his lifetime . The San Francisco Conference convened ? as he advocated , and as the Administration promised in the campaign of 1941 before the end of hostilities . A United Nations organization has been created and is now offered to the peoples of the world for their ratification . Above all , the spirit of America has changed . We are no longer hanging back . The power of public opinion in the United States has become ? as Wendell Willkie always believed it would  --  the greatest single force working for international action . Yet this is after all only the first battle of the peace . The real objectives of One World lie far ahead of us , and the constant danger is that we shall fall short of those objectives without realizing it . There is here involved a point that gave Mr. Willkie endless difficulty . Because both Roosevelt and Willkie had aninternational view , people carelessly assumed that they were in agreement on foreign policy . The assumption was encouraged by the isolationist press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of One World is very different from the foreign policy promulgated by the White House in the critical years . The Roosevelt administration was internationally-minded : it was not One World-minded . And in this regard the Truman administration is still a question mark . The difference lies in a definition of American interests . The Roosevelt administration always tended to fall off in the direction of power politics , or what Mr. Willkie called " expediency , " with the idea that our interests could best be served by entering into the old game of balance and control . As a practical man , Wendell Willkie knew well enough that power politics can not be entirely excluded from the affairs of mankind , whether at the personal , the occupational , the national , or the international level . He believed in strong men ? and strong nations . Yet he insisted that the United States must rise above the level of power politics , as the term is generally understood , in those critical situations in which the future destiny of men is at stake . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a dpctrine . Specifically , it must represent the doctrine on which this nation was founded , in which we have always believed , and through which alone our long range interests can be served ? the doctrine of indivisible freedom , the very core of One World . The weakness of our present position in world affairs is that the other great powers are far more certain of their aims than we . But why are they more certain ? It is because we have failed to declare , because we have failed strongly to assert , this doctrine of freedom ? the only doctrine in which we , as Americans , can believe . In a game of power politics the American people will never have clear aims , because they seek no goal that power politics can win . That game is merely a means of evading the fundamental issues of the world , which Americans must eventually meet if they are to survive on their own terms of freedom . In so far as we indulge in it , we fail to work for our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Mr. Willkie 's death we have made great progress , have indeed won the first battle in the struggle for One World , we must be careful not to make the same error that so many made during his lifetime . We must be careful not to confuse a well-meaning internationalism , based on " cooperation " between wholly sovereign powers , with the great vision embodied in the doctrine of One World . The former was achieved to the credit of all concerned at San Francisco ; the latter still lies before us , demanding the lifelong labor and devotion of those who understand what it means . But what was merely a hope when Wendell Willkie was alive has now , with the atomic bomb , become a necessity . The danger is that , having achieved so much , we shall lapse into self-satisfied contemplation of our own progress . This danger was well illustrated in the recent Syrian affair . In that unhappy incident we permitted ourselves to be dragged down to the level of sheer power politics by giving our unqualified backing to Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And simultaneously , by refusing to back de Gaulle in his demand for an international conference on Middle Eastern affairs ( to include both Russia and the Arabs ) , we failed to represent the doctrine of freedom as Americans know it .

Yet we had similar reasons for setting up the appeaser Darien in 1942 ? and against that move Mr. Willkie thundered with all his might . The fact is that , in Syria , we muffed an opportunity to take a first step in the formulation of an American world policy that would work to our interest . As a result , we still stand before the world without any real policy of our own . One World is a proposed world policy , and it is genuinely American .

Yet he would surely have pointed out the danger of leavingfurther progress to the Senate . For this we have his own words : " Unless . . . the people . . . of all the United Nations fundamentally agree on their purposes , fine and idealistic expressions of hope such as those of the Atlantic Charter will live merely to mock us , as have Mr. Wilson 's Fourteen Points .
