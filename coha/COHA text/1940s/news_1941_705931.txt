txt Incredible as it may seem , the Yankees can be defeated in a world series game and , at a few minutes past 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon , Brooklyn 's dazzling Dodgers completed the demonstration by pinning the mighty Bronx Bombers down on their own mat and keeping them there . Putting them down , in fact , did not prove half as nerve-racking to 66,248 astounded onlookers at the Stadium as was the monumental task of keeping them there . But a long and lean fellow named John Whitlow Wyatt , whose rambling Georgia cotton plantations overlap the battlefields of Chickamauga and who doubtless felt himself spurred on by hereditary instincts , completed the performance . By the sheer wizardry of his pitching skill , he downed the Yanks and he did it by a score of 3 to 2 . Thus with Brooklyn 's suddenly revivified and refurbished ' Beautiful Bums " winning the second game of the current series , the belligerents will switch to Ebbets Field in the heart of Flatbush today with honors even at one victory apiece . For " them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from behind with a rush to tie the ' score in the fifth inning . They took advantage of one Yankee slip by Joe Gordon , stellar second baseman , to rout Spud Chandler in the sixth and , once in front , though only by the slender magic of a single rum , they clung to the lead with a tenacity that the mightiest efforts of Joe McCarthy 's vaunted Bombers simply could not break . It ended a string of Yankee world series victories that had reached the amazing total of ten games in a row . Not since Oct. 9 , 1937 , when Carl Hubbell , the lefthanded screwball maestro of the Giants , turned them back had the McCarthymen known defeat in a series conflict . Small wonder , then , that the Brooklyn horde went thundering out of the arena , singing the praises of Muscles Joe Medwick and Mickey Owen , whose double and single helped in the scoring of those two vital fifth-inning tallies ; of Billy Herman , whose single com- pleted the rout of Chandler in the sixth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell , greeted Relief Hurler Johnny Murphy with a one-base blow in the same round to send home the run that eventually carried the day . But the mightiest toast of all was the one which all Brooklyn last night drank to the quiet , unassuming Whit Wyatt , who last week pitched the Dodgers ' pennant clincher , then blinked his eyes and remarked : " I ca n't believe it yet . " For it was just a matter of four years ago that Silent John of Buchanan , Ga. , thought his baseball career was all behind him and his days of plantation life all before him . But by a tremendous persuasive effort he was induced to change his mind and perhaps no more momentous decision ever affected Brooklyn 's fondest baseball hopes . t The Yanks raked Wyatt for nine blows , one of them a two-bagger by Tommy Henrich . Charley Keller , the redoubtable King Kong of the Bombers , lashed into him for two singles , the second one helping the American League champions to run up a 2-0 lead inside of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their man in front in the sixth , he became a piece of pitching mechanism that for the remainder of the distance was practically invincible , and not even the Yanks ' renowned Joe DiMaggio could do a thing about it . Jolting Joe , drawing one pass , went hitless for the second successive afternoon . It was a tense , nerve-throbbing struggle , with perhaps neither the Yanks nor the crowd ever appreciating the exact moment when the tide of battle swung definitely from the one side to the other . It Is even possible that the Yanks on this occasion allowed themselves to become engaged in that rarity of losing a ball game they should have won . Usually they win the one which perhaps they should n't , and almost invariably they bag the one they should . But yesterday Leo Durocher 's Dandy Dodgers , alert and keen at every step , confused them , lulled them to sleep with a feeling of false security and overconfidence and then , once on top , literally stifled them into submission . Certain it is that the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's record attend- ance and which paid $260,204 , considered game No. 2 all tucked away for the infallible Bombers when the Yanks , behind Chandler 's four innings of super-hurling , opened a two-run gap . Most every one smiled with indulgence when DiMaggio closed a promising first-inning Yankee threat by hammering vigorously into a double play . Jolting Joe , they felt , would certainly take care of the situation in his own forceful and inimitable manner later . In  --  the second came the first rift in the battle when Keller unveiled his first hit of the series , a loud single to center . Bill Dickey was called out on strikes , but Gordon , whose home run made him the hero of the series opener , drew a pass . Phil Rizzuto 's infield grounder to Herman merely advanced the runners to second and third with two out , and as Chandler came to bat nothing very serious loomed here . But Spud sent a topped ball bounding high in the air to Third Baseman Cookie Lavagetto , and before Cookie could get it away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit . Keller , of course , scored on the play and as Lavagetto decided to throw the ball to first any way , futile though it was , Gordon , called the Flash , elected to streak home too . But the Dodgers were playing heads-up ball yesterday . Camilli rifled the ball back to Catcher Owen at the plate and Gordon 's abortive dash ended in an easy third out . Certain of More Runs It seemed like a waste of opportunity , but while the Brooklyn cohorts roared their delight , ' the Yankee enthusiasts merely chuckled . More runs would follow . Of that they were certain . Another one did come and without , much loss of time . With two down in the third inning , Henrich rammed a double into right . Wyatt , pitching to DiMaggio with great care , finally passed him , but the move failed to avert trouble . Keller crashed a single . into right for his second successive hit and Henrich scooted home with the Yanks ' second tally . The Bombers might have increased their margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again tossed away a scoring opportunity with an abandon wholly out of keeping with their customarily efficient , flawless play . Gordon had opened the round with a single and , though Herman brought cheers from the Flatbush fans with a one-handed catch of Rizzuto 's low liner in short right and Chandler forced Gordon at second , more trouble appeared in store for Wyatt when Johnny Sturm dropped a single in short center behind second base . As Pete Reiser , Peewee Reese and Herman seemed to be all in a knot around the ball , Chandler , all ready rounding second , thought this an excellent time to keep right on dashing for third . But again those Dodgers were not to be caught napping . Reiser , the centerfielder , scooped up the ball and , with a perfect throw , nailed Spud as the latter came sliding into third . Just as Experts Figured Still , it seemed to be nothing alarming . The Yanks were in front . The Dodgers were behind and that is the way most of the experts figured it would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely looked to have his fellow Southerner on the hip . Spud 's blazing fast ball and sharp sinking curve fairly snapped and zoomed through the Summery air . Only twelve men faced him in the first four innings . Medwick singled in the second , only to wind up in his customary fielding position in left a moment later when Lavagetto slapped into a double play to retire the side . But in the fifth trouble engulfed the Yankee right-hander with such rapidity that , before the Bombers ' general staff seemed aware of what was going on , the Dodgers had the bases filled and nobody out . The assault began with drawing a pass . In the wake of this came a resolute two-base smash off the bat of Muscles Medwick . Camilli pulled up . at third and Chandler pulled up on his belt as he faced Lavagetto . The latter ran the count up-to three balls and two strikes . Then he walked , filling the bases , and the Brooklyn contingent set up a fearful din . On the firstbase coaching lines , Manager Durocher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed a grounder at Rizzuto and as the latter flipped it to his second-base colleague , Gordon , a double play seemed certain . But Gordon 's hurried throw to first went low , Sturm could not hold it , and only Lavagetto was out at second . Still more important was the fact that Camilli had scored and the Dodgers needed only one more run to draw even . They got it almost on the instant when Owen blasted a single to left , Medwick scoring . The battle was deadlocked , though that was all for the present , as Wyatt ended the round by slapping into a double play , on which the Gordon-Rizzuto-Sturm combination made no slip . In the sixth the Dodgers swept Chandler to the clubhouse and pushed themselves into the lead amid an ear-splitting din . Dixie Walker , still hitless in the series , punched a hard grounder at Gordon , who , playing the hop none too well , wound up with a bad throw to first that pulled Sturm off the bag . A moment later Herman singled to left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , advanced out of the Yankee dugout as a signal that Chandler 's efforts for the afternoon were at an end . Spud had allowed four hits and eventually was listed as the losing pitcher . Out of the Yankees ' bullpen came the familiar figure of their renowned relief specialist , affectionately known as Grandma Murphy . The'latter struck out Reiser , but Camilli , still smarting under the sting of those three harrowing strike-outs in Wednesday 's game , smashed a single into right . Walker streaked across the plate and the Dodgers were in front for the first time in the series . Presently Murphy restored order , as he invariably does . He checked the Dodgers from doing any further damage in this round and kept them firmly shackled the rest of the way , allowing one more hit , to make Brooklyn 's total for the game six . But the Yanks were behind and , though they may not have realized it at the time , they were destined to remain behind for the remainder of the struggle . Pinch Hitter Seems Indicated In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw even , when , with two out , Gordon walked and little Rizzuto singled . A pinch hitter for Murphy at this point might have been indicated . But McCarthy must have felt extremely confident that if the desired run did not fall into the Yankee lap in this round it certainly would come later . The manager permitted Murphy to bat for himself . Fordham Johnny struck out and presently it was to develop that the Yanks were never to get any closer than that in their efforts to wrench the battle away from Wyatt a second time . More than a couple of Brooklyn hearts must have skipped a few beats when , with two out in the eighth , Reese , the Dodgers ' sometimes slightly erratic shortstop , committed two errors on one play to put a Yank on second . First he fumbled Dickey 's grounder . Then he fired the ball wide to first and into the stands , Dickey pulling bp at second . But Wyatt was not letting victory slip away even though the Yanks , now thoroughly aware of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frenchy did not have a chance to run very far . Wyatt judiciously gave Gordon an intentional pass and Rizzuto ended the round by drilling into a force play at second . The last faint threat came in the ninth . George Selkirk , batting for Murphy , singled to right . But Sturm 's attempt to sacrifice ended in a force play on Twinkletoes at second . Red Rolfe banged into another force at the vital keystone sector and Henrich ended the game with a high fly to right .
