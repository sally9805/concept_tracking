txt During the war years , when American colleges and universities were virtually depleted , many thoughtful educators feared that the loss to this country in trained personnel would create a dangerous . shortage that might possibly take a generation to make up . This was particularly true on the graduate and professional levels , where the supply of college men and women decreased drastically . We had virtually stopped training badly needed engineers , physicists , chemists and other professional workers . It is now apparent , however , that higher education has bounced back with miraculous speed . A breakdown of the college graduates of the 1948-49 academic year , made public last week by the United States Office of Education , shows that record numbers of undergraduate , graduate and professional degrees were awarded by the nation 's colleges and universities . Degrees were granted to 423,000 students , an increase of 95 per cent over the peak pre-war year of 1939-40 , and 50 per cent above the number conferred in 194748 , This is an unprecedented jump hn any single academic year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor 's degrees . But on the graduate and professional levels the increases were even more significant . A total of 50,827 master 's degrees was conferred , and 5,293 were granted on the doctorate level . Every profession was included , with business , engineering and education leading the list . Within a few years , at the present rate of college attendance , this country will once again have an adequate supply of competent , well-trained men and women who will be in a position to serve this country better in peacetime or , if the need ever again arises , in time of war . The large number of graduates is a di ? rect result of the unprecedented influx of veterans on the nation 's campuses during the last four years . Currently , the colleges have an enrollment of more than two million students . The graduate and professional schools are crowded beyond capacity , with SRO signs out in almost every important institution of higher learning . For the next two or three years , at least , even though undergraduate enrollment may dip slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many are convinced that this will prove , in the long run , highly beneficial to the nation 's educational standards . Impact of Veterans According to present indications , the number of degrees to be granted on all levels will be higher during 1949-50 than last year 's record . The impact of the veterans on the colleges and universities will continue for at least another two years . When the GI Bill has run its course the total enrollment may take a slight drop , and with it , of course , a decrease in degrees to be conferred . However , educators believe that the registration on the master 's and doctoral level will continue to remain high for a number of years . Although there are far more private than public colleges in the country , the number of degrees granted by each category is just about the same . Last year the privately controlled institutions of higher learning conferred 218 , - 874 degrees and the public institutions 203,880.                 @ @ @ @
