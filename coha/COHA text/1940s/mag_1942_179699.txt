OWI pressure on the 14 short-wave stations in the U.S. was fast becoming a bear hug last week . At the war 's start , the Nazis had 68 short-wave stations ; the Axis-in-Europe now controls an estimated 100 . Great Britain has about 50 . The U.S. has 14-privately owned , loosely synchronized , a poor match all around for the close teamwork of radio Berlin-Rome-Tokyo . If the overseas branch of the OWI intended to jump with both feet into the global propaganda war , it had to do something about short-wave stations and do it quickly . <P> So the OWI made plans : it would lease the lion 's share of the 14 short-wave stations ' time for the war 's duration ; it would build 22 new transmitters , sell them to licensees after the war . The War Communications Board has already nodded approval and final action now awaits only WPB and Army &; Navy clearance on materials needed to build the new transmitters . <P> Whatever the owners of the 14 shortwave stations might think of the plans , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible reasons for hogging shortwave time . A number of stations , beamed to Axis and neutral nations , are said to have innocently hired foreign-language announcers who had slyly angled scripts into Axis meanings . Also , private operators like to beam their stations to the most thickly populated areas , while the OWI wants to spread a worldwide blanket evenly . Emergency funds should cover leasing of the 14 existing stations . Another need : Official propaganda directives . But OWI brains are seething with a ferment of heady plans .
