On other matters the Presbyterian General Assembly heard some gloomy , some heartening statistics : <P> &gt;Since 1929 there has been a net gain of only 9,000 Presbyterians ; congregations have had to put six members on the suspended list for every seven received . <P> &gt; Church debts , however , have been reduced by over $6,000,000 in the last four years , now total about $21,000,000 . <P> &gt; Presbyterian foreign missions have been hard hit-307 missionaries are in Jap-controlled areas . But the Assembly voted to recruit 500 new missionaries to send to areas now war-blocked the moment peace comes . Meanwhile Presbyterians are doing more in Latin America . <P> &gt; Presbyterian ministers are dying faster than they are being trained-in the last decade , for every four ordained , five pastors died . <P> &gt; Like other churches that require their clergy to have full college and seminary training , Presbyterians are now faced with the possibility of getting no more ministers for the duration because the draft will get them first . The Assembly pointed out that Presbyterians are handicapped " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptists and Methodists are able to ordain ministers at an earlier age than our own ; and because some other churches e.g. , Roman Catholics are able to segregate men as seminarians before they reach draft age . " Presbyterians were told to back their ministerial candidates in applying for deferment , if necessary to appeal adverse local-board decisions . Certified pre-seminarians were told to register at their prospective theological schools as early as " sophomore year in college . "
