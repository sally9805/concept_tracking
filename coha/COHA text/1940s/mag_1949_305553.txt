As wife of an admiral who is also cousin to the King , handsome Lady Mountbatten cuts a dashing figure and runs a big house . She has never lacked cash ; as granddaughter of Banker Sir Ernest Cassel , she is the life beneficiary of a 1,406,250 ( about $5,600,000 ) trust fund . Last week her solicitors let it be known that Lady Mountbatten was broke and would shortly ask the House of Lords to pass a bill permitting her to break Sir Ernest 's trust . <P> Like others among Britain 's newly poor , Lady Mountbatten is a victim of crushing taxes , which each year take 65,000 ( $260,000 ) of the 70,000 ( $280,000 ) she receives . But what really did her in was last year 's " capital contribution , " which raised her tax bill to 100,000 ( $400,000 ) - 30,000 ( $120,000 ) more than she took in . Unless the Lords permitted her to dip into capital or borrow on future income , Lady Mountbatten would become a tax delinquent .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
