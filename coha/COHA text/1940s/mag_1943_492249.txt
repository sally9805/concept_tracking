FRED HITCHCOCK , the 300-pound English director . was a warning voice during the 30 's . Coming into fame just as Hitler was coming into power , he devoted himself to exposing the Nazi menace in a aeries of brilliant spy-mystery pictures . Hitchcock prophesied this war in his films as vividly as E. Phillips Oppenheim forecast the First World War in his novels . The two great masters of meludrama seemed to have a near monopoly of the statesmanship of their times . Their warnings , however , were received with amusement , tempered by the feeling that they were slandering the well-meaning Nordics . After Hitler took over Germany , Hitchcock lived a dream life of international intrigue . From general reasoning and imagination , he calculated what German agents and fifth columnists would do in England . The British government had starved its secret service so that counterespionage hardly existed . Hitch-cock 's The Man Who Knew Too Much , The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes were textbooks on the subject , but , unfortunately , they were not studied as such . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as responsible and Hitchcock as irresponsible . The director learned to think like a spy . What he imagined the Nazis would do . they did . In The 39 Steps , for example , he placed a Nazi espionage headquarters in a lonely house in a remote part of Scotland . Shortly after the picture was released , a spy-conscious postman reported that he had been delivering an extraordinary quantity of mail with foreign stamps to a lonely house in a remote part of Scotland . A roundup of spies in England and the United States resulted . Important Nazi agents were caught by the FBI in America , but were considerately released on low bail in the Federal court and allowed to return to Germany . As nature crept up on Whistler landscapes , history crept up on Hitchcock pictures . In his first American spy film .

Several months before the Nazis landed spies on the Atlantic Coast in rubber boats launched from submarines , Hitchcock predicted they would . In the days before Munich , the thriller king received little support in his efforts to wake up England . National slumbers were promoted by writers who dipped their pens in chloroform . One of the must popular whodunits was written to show that the Nazi menace was a hoax invented by merchants of death to liven up the munitions business . The best American melodrama of the period proved that the real international menace was the armament industry . Hitchcock came to America in 1938 to direct Rebecca fur David 0 . Selznick . On his arrival he was taken by surprise by the enthusiasm of his New York fans . James Thurber , for example , saw The Lady Vanishes thirteen times . Orson Welles saw it eleven times . It was only par for a genuine Hitchcock maniac to go to The Lady Vanishes nine times and to The 39 Steps seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered a Hullywood frost . Because the stars of his English mysteries were little known at the time the pictures were released , his films had never been aggressively exploited in America . Hollywood regarded him as merely a good cops-and-robbers man . Hitchcock 's physique made a greater impression on the film capital than his English reputation . Three hundred pounds distributed around five feet , nine inches of height are not to be ignored . The newcomer was a sensation , with his cycloramic torso , setting-sun complexion , round , wonder-struck eyes , and cheeks inflated as if blowing an invisible bugle . People reacted to him like children at sight of balloon giants in Macy 's parade . Against the 300-pound background everything relating to Hitchcock attracted attention . He drove about in a tiny Austin which fitted him like a bathing suit . He was reported to have the appetite of a lion farm , although , in reality , he is not an immoderate eater . As a practical joker , he became known as the leading Peck 's Bad Boy of Hollywood . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other merits . Like the Fat Boy in Pickwick or the dormouse in Wonderland , he sleeps in any company . PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE LESTER He has slept on a high stool at the bar of a restaurant while waiting for a table . It would be hard to end another man as much in love with his work as Hitchcock is . He is fat because his mind is too wrapped up in the cinema to give attention to incidentals like diet . He is an aggressive sleeper because nearly everything except picture making bores him . The late Moffat Johnston . leading man in the stage play , Twentieth Century , had the supreme gift of fainting when bored ; if anyone started to tell him a story he had heard before , he keeled over , unconscious . Hitchcock is not so abrupt about it ; it takes him an appreciable number of seconds to achieve a profuund stupor . Awake or asleep , he iy a stupendous ornament to a drawing room or .. estaurant .

With Gabriel 's trumpets blasting in his ear and the temptations of Saint Anthony swarming around him , the director slept like an infant . White meat was as narcotic to him as conversation . George Arlias once drowsed in somewhat similar circumstances and apologized with the statement that he was a vegetarian ; Hitchcock never apologizes . Hitchcock sleeps fair . He slept through the opening of his own 39 Steps . He went to sleep when Thomas Mann was talking to him ; he went to sleep when Louis Bromfield was talking to him , but he goes to sleep in the middle of his own sentences .

When Mrs. Hitchcock roused him and suggested that they go home , he exclaimed , " Would n't it be rude to leave so early ? " ( Carainusd on Page 56 ) One of the biggest figures in the field of mystery-melodrama . People react to him as children react to the balloon giants in Macy 's parade . 300-POUND PROPHET COMES TO HOLLYWOOD ( Continued from Pegs 12 ) When he was sleeping at Hit the Deck in London , he was roughly awakened by his neighbor , who said , " Your snoring keeps me awake .

Hitchcock is a little bewildered by the taunts of the Kowalaky faction . He claims no records and never sleeps in a competitive spirit . He sleeps for recreation , not glory . By dozing in public , he is sure to be fresh and alert at the studio next day . Hitchcock is so camera-minded that words annoy him . They fog up his mental pictures . The drone of conversation anesthetizes him . Regarding language primarily as a system of cues , signals , hints and pointers for the cinema , he ca n't read for pleasure . When he dips into a novel , his mind automatically starts casting actors , designing sets and inventing action . It is hard work instead of relaxation , and he tosses the novel aside . He sometimes forgets his vendetta against words . He can be extremely entertaining on occasions when he is suffering from after-dinner insomnia .

Practical jokes , according to the director . should be aimed chiefly at the villains and suffering heroines . The heavies should be kept in a gay mood , but the comics should be irritated and mortified , so that they concentrate better on the grim business of getting laughs . One of Hitchcock 's devices for keeping his performers in the right frame of mind in , the repetition of the statement , simple statement " Actors are cattle . " This is generally accepted as flattery , the idea being that the director is a paradoxical fellow who goes to great lengths to conceal his adeairations ; at worst , it is a promotion from ham . Hitchcock is one of Pharaoh 's fat kine himself ; he appears in a small part in every picture he directs , The cattle metaphor has traveled widely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign from Quito , Ecuador . When Robert Montgomery , Carole Lombard and Gene Raymond were being directed by Hitchcock in Mr. and Mrs. Smith , they had stalls built on the set and put three calves in them with signs around their necks reading " Carols , " - Bob " and " Gene . " When it was reported a few months ago that David 0 . Selznick , who has Hitchcock under contract , had sold him to another producer , Joseph Cotten , the star of Hitchcock 's latest picture , Shadow of a Doubt , said , " I see they 're selling directors like cattle . " Hitchcock has perpetrated practical jokes for his own cinematic education . When he was stopping at the St. Regis Hotel in New York , he wanted firsthand information as to the behavior of people on discovering a murderer in their midst . He and a friend entered a half-full elevator on the tenth floor and started to descend . The director was trembling . His eyes were popping more than usual . " I did n't think one shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was all over the place . I was on a spot . If I stayed to fix things up , the police would catch me . I was afraid to move her body because The elevator reached the main floor and the other occupants hurried about their business . They had stiffened slightly at the first gory detail and then affected not to hear . When Hitchcock wanted to make a field test of the behavior of people in the presence of n strange social error , he obtained an elderly lady from a casting agency for $17.50 for an evening 's work and seated her at the head of a long table at a party he was giving at Chasen 's Restaurant . She was there alone when the first guest arrived . After having a drink with Hitchcock at a small bar near the table , the guest asked who the old lady was . " I 've been wondering myself , " said Hitchcock . ( Conlinood on Pogo 59 ) ( Contimuld from Pogo 5o1 Two more guests came , had cocktails and inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the director . " Maybe she thinks this is some other party . " Chosen was asked to clear up the mystery . The restaurateur brought word that the lady said she was with the Hitchcock party . " One of my other guests must have invited her , " said the director . The Last person to arrive was an agent . With an agent 's impartial camaraderie , he joyously hailed the people at the bar and then joyously hailed the white-haired sphinx at the head of the table . " Who is she ? " the agent was asked . " I do n't know . I never saw her before , " he said . The guests seated themselves and chattered nervously . The most nervous was a shy young man from New York , the authentic guest of another guest . He stuttered and vibrated because of a guilty feeling that he did n't belong . The stately dame at the head of the table was the only self-possessed person present .

Of course she 's a gag . " Then he pointed at the shy young man and shouted , " And you 're a gag toot " Some of Hitchcock 's practical jokes were protests or moral lessons . He put a dray horse in the dressing room of Sir Gerald du Maurier in a London theater as a rebuke to the patronage of actors and actresses by the aristocracy . This particular dressing room had become a social shrine . Dukes and duchesses had visited it . Hitchcock resented this sort of thing because he had seen so many promising young professionals spoiled by the attention of stage-struck Lady Man-slaughters and Lord Killdaytights . His object was to purge the dressing room of its snobbish atmosphere by turning it into a stable . . Hitchcock 's early hobbies and pastimes contributed to his cinema education . He was born forty-two years ago in London , where his father ran a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where the London basses went . As soon as he was old enough to board them alone , he traveled to the end of every line to see what the destinations were like , Later he obtained a wall map of the world and traced the movements of liners and freighters with colored pins . Lloyd 's Register came out once a week with news of the progress of nearly every ocean-going vessel . After each issue the boy reorganized the thousands of pins . He had no curiosity as to the cargoes or the ports which the ships touched ; the fascination was in motion from one point to another . It would be hard to discover a more useless activity , unless it is Osbert Sitwell 's pastime of drawing complex road maps of imaginary regions . Even the curious recreation of the late Grover Jones , the noted Hollywood scenarist , is more understandable . Grover collected discarded newspaper engravings , After a hard day inventing motion-picture fiction at the studio , he would go home , select an engraving , invent a story to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proof of the engraving and text , read the story , laugh heartily and go to bed . Hitchcock later transferred his hobby froM sea to land . He studied the train schedules of the principal railroad lines in Europe until he knew , not only the hour and place of each stop but the equipment and service on each train . He sent for Bullinger 's Guide and memorized the schedules of the main American lines . Every time his train is late at a station he has to know the reason why . Stops in the night wake him up and cause him to consult his watch ; if the atop is unscheduled or at the wrong time , he ca n't go back to sleep until the affair is cleared up The steamship hobby has not produced any direct results . Hitchcock has never made a successful sea picture . His railroading mania , however , has worked its way into many of his films . Nine tenths of the action in The Lady Vanishes takes place on u train . At the slightest excuse Hitchcock throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bus to it plane . The director was American-educated , as far as pictures were concerned . His cinema training started at the age of twelve , when he accidentally picked up an American film magazine . From that time on , he was a devoted student of American fan periodicals . He read them religiously at a Jesuit school and later studied them . along with economics , art // and engineering , at London University . He had been working for a few months with an engineering firm when he read that an executive of the Famous Players-Lasky Company was on his way to London to film The Sorrows of Satan . The day the executive arrived he received a visit from a fat youth of nineteen with a portfolio of suffering devils . But we 're not going to make that . We 're going to make The Great Day , - said the executive . Hitchcock returned with designs for great days . His persistence won him a job writing subtitles and drawing fancy borders for them . Within a few years he had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first pictures he directed , In the Pleasure Garden , he learned everything there was to know about economy in directing . The chief scenes were laid in Italy . His purse , containing all his budget money , was stolen from a hotel in Genoa . It would have ruined him with his employers to explain what had happened . By getting a salary advance , borrowing small sums and stalling his cattle in flophouses on the pretext that they were more convenient to railroad stations , he made the Italian scenes , winding up with one cent in his pocket . Most of his pictures during the next few years were made on Poverty Row budgets . He loses the sense of thrift only when he wants to get special photographic effects . In making The Girl Was Young , Hitchcock wanted the camera to photograph exactly what a man would see as he descended the staircase of a hotel , strolled through the lobby , walked into the dining room and came face to face with one of the characters seated at a table . Costly new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a continuous route . Demands by Hitchcock for elaborate mechanical devices to enable the spectator 's eye to follow uninterruptedly a long aerie ; of actions are frequently vetoed as impossible , but are always executed . Unconventional Villains He has progressed in realism since his early days . The hero of The Ring , one of Hitchcock 's first pictures , fought thirteen desperate rounds without losing any of the rouge from his cheeks or getting his eyelashes uncurled . In later years the stout director 's constant aim has been to shake himself free from cinema conventions . His villains , for example , are not standardized devils or hypocrites . The ruthless killers and torturers of his espionage mysteries are usually normal people , good family men , sensitive humanitarians , who kill or torture from a sense of duty . Hitchcock makes violent attacks on the convention that the outside world tunes itself to the mood of the cinema . He would rather have his lovers bill and coo to the accompaniment of a riveting machine than a nightingale . He reserves love music for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of a boy who has been murdered ; the conversation is drowned by boogie-woogie music from a radio in an adjoining apartment . The killer in the director 's current picture is known as the Merry Widow murderer because of his weakness for the lovely waltz music of that operetta . Hitchcock does n't use screwballs or jesters in order to get laughs ; his idea of comedy is the behavior of normal people preoccupied with their own affairs ; he thinks all men , women and children are funny when they are unconscious of being observed . His most radical break with tradition is his antagonism to Hollywood clinches . He does n't believe that flying tackles . headlocks , half nelsons , scissors and flying mares are necessary to suggest that boy likes girl . He says love , like horror , should be indicated , rather than lavishly illustrated . A Bow to Punch In making his British films , Hitchcock put authentic detail into scenes laid in far-off localities . He distrusted research departments because of their conviction that peasants wear gorgeous holiday costumes at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give special attention to this subject . The comic weekly ran five cartoons in color showing different races as they are thought to be , followed by one cartoon in black entitled How IT REALLY Is . The color cartoons showed the American in cowboy costume riding into a saloon and shooting it up , the Spaniard in toreador costume playing a guitar under a balcony , the Frenchman with a tapering opera hat and the usual accessories , the standard John Bull and the standard beer-garden German ; the one cartoon in black pictured them all alike in regulation twentieth-century store clothes . When he was getting ready to make Balkan scenes for Secret Agent . Hitchcock was torn between the Punch idea and the National Geographic pictures which the research department submitted , so he went to the Balkans to settle the matter . He was surprised to find that the truth lay in between . In Greek towns he found the natives National Geographic up to the waist and Punch above ; the upper half of the costume was ordinary London or New York , the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Albanian wardrobe was part native , part chain store . - Travel has always been Hitchcock 's cure for brain fag . When he and his staff showed signs of staleness , he would tnke them to small towns in France , Holland or Belgium where there was nothing to remind them of London and to put them back in old thought patterns . He once flew them to Switzerland and held a story conference on a scenic train as it was hauled up a mountain by cable . When pressure of time prevented foreign travel , he has taken them away from the studio in search of new taverns . One day he and four associates chartered a 2$0-passenger steamer and held an all-day session on the Thames . Hitchcock had bad luck at first in finding scenic cures for mental fatigue in America . Just as a landscape began to start a new train of ideas , a soft drink , gasoline or pill sign came along and threw him back into the rut . He has recently discovered that the billboard people have overlooked Death Valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hitchcock . The assistant director on Hitchcock 's first picture was Alma Reville . After they had been coworkers on several pictures , they were married in 1926 . They have continued ever since as a writing team . Their thirteen-year-old daughter Patricia won enthusiastic critical notices when she appeared on Broadway last year in Solitaire . The Hitch-cocks lead a simple home life , the complete opposite of legendary Hollywood existences . In England , Hitchcock gradually became the acknowledged leader in the most difficult department of the movies , the mystery melodrama . Masterpieces in this class are the rarest thing in pictures . The highest quality of cinema brains is needed for a thoroughly satisfying mystery , It calls for an almost impossible combination of action , horror , comedy and romance , plus an almost impossible blending of suspense and surprise with plausibility . Scores of directors can make good epics , but Hitchcock is the only proved master of the mystery , and he has reached the heights only twice  --  in The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes . The average mystery film is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easy to get the characters into hair-raising jams , but hard to get them out again . It takes infinite patience and ingenuity to keep the mystery from turning into a farce , burlesque or amateur theatricals in the last two or three reels . The mystery is the one branch of the art in which Hollywood has made a poor showing . Like the rider who cussed out the horse that bucked him off , Hollywood scoffs at mysteries . Spy and detective thrillers are generally turned over to the Grade B departments as material for quickies , on the theory that they are sure to be bad , so they may as well be cheap . The effort to keep a thriller plausible throughout is too brain-racking , and the usual recourse is to cover the holes in the logic by slapstick and rattling action . Even Hitchcock , who has made the closest approach to ideal mysteries , says life is too short for perfection in this field . A Weighty Personality " Perfection is the prerogative of writers , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectionist because of the cheapness of his materials , Flaubert could work on a novel for six years because it cost only a few dollars ' worth of ink and paper . A producer or director , with a cost sheet running into thousands of dollars a day , ca n't agonize forever over the fine points . Hitchcock is primarily a character creator . He contrives somehow to maintain the consistency of his characters while putting them through the intricate mazes of spy melodramas . It is easy to fit wooden men and dolls into complicated plots , but hard to fit highly de veloped characters into them . Hitch-cock 's task looks simple at the start , but the trouble begins when the creatures of his imagination become wayward , capricious and difficult . They get too independent for the plot . As the story is rewritten for them , the action is thrown out of gear , and climaxes refuse to come off . The director and his writers have a hard time arbitrating the quarrels between characters and incidents . Hitchcock 's greatest American success was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . Selznick , One of the director 's triumphs was the fact that it was generally called a Hitchcock picture . Pictures produced by Selznick are usually called Selznick pictures ; Gone With the Wind , for example , was never known as a film directed by Victor Fleming , but always as a Selznick production . The eclat of Hitchcock 's avoirdupois and personality had a good deal to do with making his name register above that of his famous employer . Rebecca began with a battle because the feelings of the two men toward literature were totally different . Selznick regards the author 's text as sacred ; Hitchcock regards a book as a source of vague hints for a picture ; he often winds up by throwing away everything but the title . Selznick was the boss and had his way . The director regarded himself as handcuffed and straitjacketed by enforced respect for the printed word , but he succeeded in illuminating the picture with some of his most brilliant directorial touches . Hitchcock and Selznick performed a rare feat of hypnotism in this picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier performances had lacked interest and animation . It took $80,000 worth of preliminary photography before the two Svengalis were able to develop the gifts the young actress had been concealing . Background for Horror The first spy melodrama that Hitchcock made in this country was Foreign Correspondent . Walter Wanger , the producer , had nothing to start with but the title and the idea of a spy thriller with en American newspaperman in Europe as the hero , Hitchcock mentally reviewed his travels in Europe and chose Holland for the scene of the picture . As he thought of Dutch-windmill landscapes , he said , " We 'll have the hero see a windmill turning against the wind . He 'll know that 's a Nazi signal . " The plot was quickly built around that idea . Foreign Correspondent was full of stirring scenes , though Lacking the finish of his British-made masterpieces . His other Hollywood productions were Mr. and Mrs. Smith , Suspicion , Saboteur and Shadow of a Doubt , recently made for Universal . Shadow of a Doubt , a psychological murder tale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H the town of Hanford . California . as the murderer 's lair . Hitchcock switched the scene to Santa Rosa , California , because Santa Rosa had the quiet and peaceful atmosphere which he likes as a background for horror . There was no joy in Hanford over the insinuation that it was not an ideal setting for a dark and bloody mystery . One Hanford newspaper threatened Hitchcock with bodily harm in revenge for the insult . For years Hitchcock has wanted to make a picture with all the action taking place on a lifeboat , starting with a dozen survivors from a wrecked ship and ending with two . Regarding the idea as unlikely to attract the public , he filed it away in his mind with other fascinating but uncommercial themes . The war , however , has made abrupt changes in public interests . Hitchcock is now working on Lifeboat as the first of a series of pictures which he is to make for the Twentieth Century-Fox Corporation .                  @ @ @
