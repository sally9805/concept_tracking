 | " Nonsense ! I 've slept on the ground many a night in my campaigns . Come . Nurse Marjory will stay until we send her relief . " They stepped outside the door . The rim of the sun was touching the horizon , casting its light on the hills . All was dark in the courtyard . A figure crouched against the wall , moved , detached itself from the darker shadows . " Let me sit beside him , " the girl Thomasine whispered . " Get to your bed ! " Sir Richard said harshly . " You 've caused enough of trouble . " " I did not lay a hot iron in his hand . " Words came out of the darkness  --  accusing words that hung in the air . Sir Richard took a step forward . The cobbles echoed to his firm footstep . The court-yard was empty . The girl had dissolved into the darkness . Mary Grenville made no comment . In her heart she knew Richard had added another grudge to the girl 's warped mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get past the hard , scornful shell . She sighed , " You are tired , " Richard said softly , " tired from good works . " He put his arm around her trim waist . " You must sleep , my sweet .

Did I neglect to tell you , my sweet ? Let Walter and Philip Sidney have the Red Room , the one where the Queen rested . Philippa will see that there is fair linen , and the new blankets woven from last year 's wool . " " You did not tell me there were to be many . Do you think I will allow Philippa to see to my guests ? " She quickened her pace . As she entered the long passage she rang the housekeeper 's bell . " I must consult with Mrs. Brooks . Richard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . " He yawned , covering his mouth with the back of his hand . " Ching has the lists of our guests . I 'm afraid you will think all Devon is descending on us . Can you manage ? " She looked up at her tall husband , smiling . " Have you forgotten the time two hundred men were lodged at Stowe for a fortnight ? Has ever a man or woman gone hungry from Stowe ? " He let his hand follow her shoulder to her breasts . " My little housekeeper , I vow you bear the name with more reason than my ancestor Sir Roger . "  | Lady Mary laughed aloud . " You will spoil me with praise , sir . Begone to your bed before the household arises . " He lingered a moment , a curiously uneasy smile behind his closetrimmed beard . " You have no harsh words for me , Mary ? " " Harsh words ?

I will make him my armour-bearer on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking after him until the tapestry curtain dropped behind him as he passed through the door . " The next journey . " She remembered then that he had not told her why ' Walter Raleigh was coming to Stowe . Walter never came now , as in the old days , to visit , to hunt , to hawk . Ile came to Devon only to intrigue , to get money for some scheme . A chill wind seemed to blow upon her . She moved slowly along the passageway , stirred by some unknown fear .  | " And Shall I Die , and This Unconquered ? " CHAPTER 6 BERRIES were ripening among the stones that walled the Cornish lanes . Thistle and wild tansy and yellow furze covered the moors . The furze grew rank , interlaced with bracken which had already turned to gold . Birds whirled above the stubble where the stooks of yellow grain stood in ranks , making a neat pattern in the hillside fields . Fat cattle grazed in the lush green meadow . Sheep were closed , ready for market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor does the yeoman who tills the soil . Sir Richard Grenville stood in the tower above the gateway of Stowe and surveyed the landscape with his glass . " The land is eternal , " he murmured when his wife remained silent . " It is eternal , and therein lies the strength and glory of England . Not in kings or princes , not in men who sit on benches and make the laws , but here in this good land that lies before our eyes . Here , the land , the , men who till the land  --  these are our bulwarks against time , against our enemies within and our enemies without . My dear love , you are not listening . Why do you stand looking down the valley with fear written on your dear face ? " " And fear is in my heart , my sweet husband . I look at the sea and I am afraid . " Sir Richard 's laugh rang out . Men working in the garden looked up , smiling as they mopped the sweat from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , even though they must work the harder . He brought them whips of apple and fig , or a new peach to plant ; a new berry or a squash that they had not seen before . " Save the seeds , " he would say . " We must keep abreast of the times in our garden and in our orchards . " It was the same in the stables  --  new stallions fine and strong , to put in the meadows with the brood mares . The best , always the best ; even the wines that came in tuns from Portugal or the Azores . Stowe cider was termed better than their neighbors ' ; more care was taken to keep the presses clean . No good trying to throw wormy apples into the  | press . He 'd have a man disciplined for that . A harsh master , his tenants held him , but just and strong . They must keep the land sweet and well manured or set with marl , so that crops would improve . " Give something to the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lips . " Why should you fear the sea , my sweet wife ? The sea is kind to the Cornish . Think of the pilchards ; think of the herring and lobsters and sweet crabs . " " Aye , and think of the wrecks that lic along the shore from the mouth of the Tamar and the Torridge to Land 's End . " " Well , think of them . Have we not pulled up many a stout timber from wrecks to strengthen our buildings at Stowe ? Like the timber from the Spanish galleons , all carved and gilded , which holds the roof of our summer-house , and the king-beam of our farm-house . " " I do not like the sea , " she repeated . " It puts fear in me . " " None in me , although my father lost his life in the sea . Come now , let us have a cheery face . " He raised his spying glass toward Kilkhampton village . The church tower was black against the intense blue of the August sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner fly . Yes , look , my dear one . In a moment you will see horsemen riding between the hedges . Presently they will be knocking at the gate below us . Let us go down . I will welcome my visitors with true Grenville hospitality at the gateway of my castle . " Lady Grenville followed her lord as he walked along the top of the high Norman wall to the stone stairs by the guard-house . She left her husband there with his old steward Ching , who had served him well through the years , and made her way to the great hall . One look about to see that everything was in place . Not that men would notice . Plenty for his stomach , plenty to drink , a bed to sleep on , were all a man wanted . She found Colin putting wine cups on a serving table . A bowl of late cherries to dip into the wine was placed beside the cups . She nodded approval . Colin made no sign of his hurt though there were lines of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them blue as the sea . " Is there no one else to do this work ? " she asked . " The master said I was to be tankard-bearer tonight , and so I will be tankard-bearer . " She listened for resentment in his voice . There was none . " The guests will be tired tonight . Those who rode in today from Exeter  | have ridden from London two days before . They will want sleep . " " What of those who come from Newlyn and Padstow and Tavistock ? They will not be weary . ' T is Londoners who are soft , Your Ladyship . London does something , even to Cornishmen , if they stay too long . " Lady Grenville smiled . " I hope Sir Richard will never stay too long in London then . " " No , madam , not he . Even London can not sap the great strength of him . " She looked up quickly , wondering . The lad set the silver tankards on a tray at the high table . He came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nurse Marjory told me my master stayed beside me the whole of the black night when my mind was out wandering on the moors . Did she say truth ? " " Yes , Colin . Yes . " He twisted a corner of the leather apron he wore as tankard boy . " Madam , do you think he would take it ill if I said a prayer for him and a thanksgiving that the kind God has given me such a good master ? " He looked at her anxiously , afraid perhaps that he had overstepped . " Do say a prayer for your master , Colin . I am sure the Lord will listen to you . " Ile touched his forehead with his fingers and made a stiff bow . ' Thank you , madam . " " He bears no ill will to Richard . " Mary Grenville turned at Philippa 's words . She had come in quietly . Now she stood beside the table . She wore a white coif and a petticoat of broidered Madras that floated out from a taffeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt dull and drab beside her in her sober grey and white . " No rancor , " she said . " I am astonished . Yet I know Richard will always have the admiration and devotion of men . . . and charm women . " She spoke flippantly enough , but Mary knew Philippa meant what she said . She changed the subject abruptly . " I am concerned about the girl Thomasine . She is so wild . It is difficult to understand her . " She glanced up as she spoke . Colin was crossing the room . At mention of the girl 's name a look of anger came over his face . His body stiffened and the hand that held the punchbowl trembled  | " There is one who hates the Cornish beauty , " Philippa remarked as he walked out of hearing . She lifted a cherry from the silver bowl , dipped it into wine , holding the long stem daintily . " And with cause , " she added . " I think that little wild one has made an enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . I think Colin could not hate anyone . " Philippa 's sharp white teeth bit into the cherry . " I have in my mind that it was not Colin who pinched her buttocks , as she so elegantly put it . I have an idea it was someone else  --  a young gentleman who was in his cups and whom Colin carried to his room that night . " Mary stared at Philippa . Was that the reason why Richard had stayed the whole night with the herd-boy ? Did he realize he had punished the wrong offender . One never knew with Richard . It was not his habit to admit himself in the wrong , no more than it was his habit to admit defeat . One never knew . She bunched her housekeeping keys in her hand and thrust them into the woven bag at her long pointed bodice . " I must go to the nursery . The children must have their rest . " She found them playing a game of hide-and-seek in the hallway and sent them to the nursery . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the great oaks . It put her in mind of her childhood at Annerly , when she begged one last circle of the great Hankford Oak . She little realized how deep wedged into her life that oak was to be . It was under the great oak that she first saw Sir Richard Grenville , when he rode over from Bideford to call on her father . It was under the Hankford Oak he told her that her father had given his consent to their betrothal . She sighed . The children crowded about her , their childish protest rising ; could they not go down to see the guests come riding along the lane ? The servants had told them there was to be a great banquet  --  huge joints and legs of mutton ; a hundred fowl had been killed ; pheasants too , with lobsters sent up from Bideford Bay . Could they not look on from the minstrels ' gallery ? Lady Grenville laughed . " No , no . Not a hundred fowl , my children , nor yet twenty . " Tomorrow they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and perhaps a pheasant or a game-fowl . No , they were too young to go to the minstrels ' gallery . They capered about the room , while the young nurse and Nurse Marjory looked on . " Did you take your rest , madam ? " Marjory inquired .  | Lady Grenville shook her head . " I forgot , really , " she said apologetically . " There was so much to be done , there was not time to rest . " Nurse Marjory eyed her severely . " You will look washed-out at supper and weary , while Dame Philippa will be beautiful and sparkling and gratify the eyes of all the gentlemen guests . " Mary smiled , and Nurse grumbled , " She slept all afternoon . Now she has had her woman sponge her with cool water from the spring , while you get hot stepping into the kitchen to see if the meat is properly turning on the spit . Why not leave cookery to the cook , madam ? " " I will rest now . Good-night , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tease . They came forward obediently for a kiss and went back to their luncheon . Lady Grenville really meant to rest , but on the way to her room she stopped at her daughter Mary 's door . She heard a muffled " Come in " and walked into the room . Young Mary was stretched full length on the bed , her face buried in the bolster . She sat up when she saw her ' mother , then burst into fresh tears . Lady Grenville asked with concern , " What ails you , my child ? " Mary buried her face deeper into the pillow , her shoulders shaking with the tempest of sobs . " What is wrong , my dearest child ? " She pushed aside the rose-printed curtains and sat down on the bed . After a time young Mary sat up . Her eyes were red , tears were running down her cheeks . " It 's that girl ! That terrible girl ! " " What girl ? " Lady Grenville was truly puzzled . " Thomasine . She has taken my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction little Mary pointed . A heap of clothes lay on the floor near the window . The black bodice , the red skirt Thomasine had discarded lay on the floor . " If it had been any other gown I would n't have cared , Mother , but my puce ! Arthur liked it so much . " Her mother withheld a smile . " It is really my fault , daughter . I told Thomasine I would find a proper costume for her out of your wardrobe . " " But she should n't have come and taken my puce without by your leave ' or any polite words . And she stripped right in front of me ? down to skin ! She did n't even have on her modesty garment . " Lady Grenville thought a moment . It was difficult to appease Mary and keep from showing her annoyance at Thomasine . " Listen my child . Let me explain about Thomasine . Then you will understand why she does strange things . " She repeated what her husband had  | told her : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the girl to her for training . " She is wayward , with no manners , but she has good blood in her veins . She is an orphan , without training of cultivated folk ; brought up by caretakers and a silly old aunt who died within the month . She has run wild like a moor pony , but she is courageous , without fear . There is the making of a fine woman in her , if we all help her and have patience . " Little Mary 's tears ceased to flow . " An orphan ? " " She never knew her mother . Her father she , barely remembers . He went away to Europe , to Maximilian 's wars , and never returned . " Mary 's sensitive face showed concern . " Come , miss . A young female about to be married has no time for tears . As for the puce taffeta , I always thought the colour a little old for you . Tomorrow I will go to the sewing room and I will show you the new material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the Countess of Pembroke selected . You know there is n't a lady in England who has more beautiful clothes than Mary Sidney . " " Not even the Queen ? " " Perhaps , but she admires Mary 's taste in clothes . Mary Sidney had a dress embroidered for the Queen as a present to give her at Christmas . A lovely thing : ivory brocade with pansies in colour , embroidered with seed-pearls . The Queen was delighted and wears it at her levees . " " Oh , Mother , am I to have a gown with a long pointed bodice , cut square , low to show my breasts , like the Queen ? " Mary sat up straight , pushing up her little round firm breasts until they were like to burst out of her neckerchief . Her mother smiled and patted her shoulder . " We will see , we will see . There is one piece of taffeta strewn with rosebuds which will become you . Your father has told me he wishes you to have suitable clothes , so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a country cousin . " " Oh , Mother , how wonderful ! " Little Mary jumped from the bed as her mother walked toward the door . " Will you thank my father for me ? And , Mother , about the puce taffeta  --  I think the taffeta with rosebuds would be nicer , much , much nicer . " She tossed one long braid of dark hair over her shoulder and pressed her slender waist even smaller with her clasped hands , while she stood trying to look into the mirror . " I think I can wear a long bodice to advantage , Mother , " she cried .  | A tender smile came over Mary Grenville 's lips . " Yes , my child , yes . " Little Mary threw her arms about her mother and kissed her cheek . " Do n't scold poor Thomasine , Mother . Let her be happy in the puce taffeta . " Mary Grenville walked down the hall to her room . She was thinking that perhaps Thomasine had no capacity for happiness , poor restless tormented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below to the great hall to greet her husband 's guests and make them welcome to Stowe . But she had a moment to think of little Mary  --  so quick to respond , so tender toward the unfortunate . What would life hold for her little daughter ? The housekeeper , Mrs. Brooks , was waiting outside Lady Grenville 's chamber . " A number of the gentlemen have arrived . Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Philip Sidney from London . " She handed a paper to Lady Grenville . " Sir Richard sent this list , Your Ladyship . He says he ca n't remember how many more are to come . " Mary smiled . Was it not like her husband to invite the two counties and never question how they were to be fed or bedded ? " How many have arrived altogether , Brooks ? " ' ' Thirty or thereabouts , madam . Clung has placed Sir Walter and Sir Philip ini the Red Chamber ; Captain Amadas and Master Stafford in the Oak Room . They asked to save the extra bed space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others are in the Long Room , with the screens all set so no one looks on the other . Each man has his privacy , just- as we used to have it in the old days at Annerly , madam . " " You have done well , Brooks . That leaves the chambers in the West Wing free for late-corners . " " And rooms iii the vacant cottages beyond the garden . Farmer Alsop says there arc four chambers at the farm cottage , if necessary . A matter of housing ten men or more . " Lady Grenville checked the list carefully . " We can easily care for a hundred guests . Canvas tents can be erected if more should come . You have done very well indeed , Brooks . " " Thank you , madam . We want to make everyone comfortable . " Lady Grenville slipped a key from a bunch she carried in her side pocket . " Here is the key to the emergency linen room . It is fortunate that the new blankets were finished in early summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wines ? You know how particular  | Sir Richard is about the wines he serves . Has the new shipment come ? " Brooks lifted her broad petticoat and abstracted her narrow housekeeping book . " I had this from your chamberlain Mr. Ching . The wine was brought in by positilion List week , well distributed so the horses were not overloaded : three tuns of white and two of claret , one tun of sack . There came also a hogshead of vinegar . " Lady Grenville was satisfied . " Please see if Sir Richard has given orders to his wine steward . If not , let Ching attend to it . " " Will you dine with the gentlemen tonight , madam ? " " Yes . Sir Richard has requested the ladies to dine with him . Dame Philippa will be at the high table . " " Miss Mary and the new young lady  --  will they dine at the table also ? " " They will be seated at the end . Miss Catherine has a sniffle from the weed blossoms and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Handsome young gentlemen are riding up every hour . Perhaps if I fill a pomander with ammonia salts she could manage . A pity to be deprived of seeing so many of the young Cornish and Devon squires . " She had a knowing look , a match-making look . " Stop by her chamber , Brooks , when you have settled about the wines . Perhaps you can persuade her . Let her hide her red nose behind a fan . " The two smiled and nodded , fellow conspirators that they were . Only one of the Grenville daughters had married thus far  --  Bridget , to Christopher Harris , of Radford . Lady Grenville sighed . A pity that Richard had taken such a dislike to Christopher . Richard was angered because Christopher had persuaded him to sell Buckland Abbey to him , and then straightaway resold it to Sir Francis Drake . One other thing to add to his dislike of Drake . It irked him to think of the Drakes living in the abbey which had so long been the seat of the Grenvilles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the money went into building new ships at the Chapman yards at Bideford . She had never liked living at Buckland Abbey . It was too conspicuously grand , and it still carried the monkish odour of old days . She liked Stowe best of all Sir Richard 's manors . It was home to her . Dinner was over next day . The ladies retired to walk in the garden or sit on the terrace , leaving the men to their toasts . The sun was hot but a little breeze stirred . The cattle that grazed on the hills along the  | edge of the wood were eating their way down toward the barns and the cow sheds ; fat and sleek , they made a handsome picture against the lush green of the meadow within the walled and hedged fields . Lady Grenville soon left the group to consult with Brooks about the lodging of new arrivals . Dame Philippa took her ease in the arbour. while Catherine , sniffing her pomander , watched Mary and two young girls from Stratton vie for leadership in archery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped toward the target , cut the still air , and through the open windows of the hall men 's voices rose and fell , some cultured. , drawling , others more harsh with the strong undiluted accent of the Cornish-bred . Dame Philippa listened idly , her lithe slim body , elegantly attired , relaxed against the marble bench . She listened to the voices but her eyes followed the girl Thomasine as she strolled across the greensward , where she stopped under a tree to watch the archers . Mary 's puce gown had had a sobering effect on Thomasine Throughout the meal she had sat quietly , not speaking , although Philippa noticed that the eves of many a young man were turned her way . She is honey , thought Philippa . She will snare men ; they will follow her , importune her  --  but not for marriage , my girl , not for mar riage ! A little wave of pity came over her . She called to her , " " Thomasine , Thomasine , I challenge you . Let us see who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came swiftly across the grass , her dark face alight . Did I ever imagine she was awkward ? Philippa asked herself . Philippa was an archer of no mean skill . She fancied herself in the pose , her arm raised holding the bow , her slenderness outlined against the ivy-covered wall . Archery and playing the harp gave the two most delicious of attitudes to set men 's hearts beating more swiftly . She practised both poses for their effect . In her heart she preferred galloping across the wild moors on a good mare , a hooded hawk on her wrist . The girls moved aside . They were outclassed by Philippa . " Give me a heavy bow , " she called to a lackey who was placing lanthorns on little iron tables on the terrace . The servant hurried away . " Perhaps you would like this bow , Thomasine , " she said kindly . " I find it much too light . " " I will use whatever bow you use , madam . It would not be fair otherwise . " The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a velvet smoothness.  | Philippa took the heavy bow from the servant , tested the pull , selected an arrow and took position . " Well placed ! " the girls called . " Within the circle ! " A thin smile passed over Thomasine 's lips . She glanced at Dame Philippa , who stood waiting , pleased with her shot . She hesitated a second , then placed the arrow , not in the heart of the target , but a little to the right , a shade farther from the center than Paine Philippa 's . The girls clapped half-heartedly , Mary with her eyes on her puce taffeta gown , the others reserved , withdrawn , waiting . " Ah , you could have beaten my shot ! " Philippa said with a laugh . " You ca n't fool me , Thomasine . You placed arrow too exactly . " Thomasine flushed . She was annoyed at being caught in an act of kindness . " The bow is heavy for me , " she lied glibly . She would not tell them she could hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wing . These females , so elegant , so satisfied , so universal in their perfection  --  she would show them one day . She glanced at Mars , the silly girl exuding sweetness and condescension . She had better look to her betrothed , who was already casting sheep 's eyes at Thomasine . Let Mary look to herself ! Some of the men straggled out of the hall . Two lackeys assisted a young squire of the county , whose head was not hard enough to drink with Grenville . Walter Raleigh , seeing Dame Philippa on the terrace , strolled toward her . Thomasine could not take her eyes from him and his elegant dress , the clustered pearls that ornamented his satin doublet , his trunks stiff embroidered of gold and silver , his silken hosen , his elegant soft shoes . His hands , soft and white as a woman 's , played with a brilliant locket hanging from his neck on a golden chain . The Queen had given him the locket , and it held her miniature on ivory . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one painted without shadows on her pale ivory face . Thomasine wanted to see that miniature . As Raleigh turned , she saw that he wore a great pendant pearl dangling from one ear . She giggled and clapped her hand across her mouth . " What amuses you , my lass ? " Raleigh had seen her . " Tell me . Do not run away . I like young laughter . " He caught her arm . Thomasine stood trembling , her dark eyes looking out from the darker curls that fell over her forehead . " Sir , no , I can not tell you . " " Indeed , yes . Speak out . You think me amusing . Now tell me why ? "  | " Oh , sir , no . " She glanced at Dame Philippa , a pleading , almost frightened look . Philippa surveyed her coolly . Let her extract herself from difficulties of her own making was her thought . " Conic ! A forfeit if you tell me . " Thomasine smiled suddenly . " A forfeit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath , fair damsel , " Raleigh said with an exaggerated bow " You were laughing at me . I must know why . My vanity demand it . " " Sir , I was not laughing at you . It was the ear-ring . I did not know that gentlemen wore ear-rings  --  only sea pirates . " There was silence for a moment , broken by laughter . Sidney had advanced behind them and overheard Thomasine 's words . " I swear . Walt , the maid has paid you off in your own coin ! What a story to tell the Queen ! " Raleigh joined the laughter . " Well spoken , maiden . Indeed , some of my friends have called me pirate more than once . But the forfeit . I promised you a boon . Ask it . " Thomasinc advanced a step . Philippa started to reprimand the girl for her audacity , but Philip Sidney raised his hand to silence her . Raleigh waited , a little bored at the turn his momentary impulse had taken . Thomasine said , " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wear . A change came over Raleigh 's face , his body stiffened . Refusal was on his lips , but Sidney insisted : " Your promise , Walt . A boon for the maiden . Allow her to glimpse the royal countenance of her Sovereign Oueen . " Raleigh snapped the locket and placed it in the girl 's hand . Thomasine gazed for a moment , and as she returned it to him she lifted her skirts and made a low bow , not to Raleigh but the likeness of the Queen . " By Apollo , a pretty gesture ! " said Raleigh and turned to Dame Philippa . " Who is this charming maid ? " he asked as they strolled toward the terrace . ' The girls who had watched the little play followed , leaving Thomasine confused , poised for flight . Philip Sidney detained her . " You are a witch , " he said , his eyes full of laughter . " You demand what is secret and most treasured . " " Oh , sir , was I so rude ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance . She became at once a frightened child . " I did not mean to be rude . "  | Sidney lifted her chin with his long , elegant fingers . " Continue being rude and audacious , my little one . It will take you far along this weary world in which we live . " She broke away , catching up her flowing skirts , and ran swiftly along the brick path that followed the wall of the upper terrace . Dodging along the verge of a high yew maze , she ran full against Arthur Tremayne . He closed his arms about her , half staggered at the impact of her body . " Why so hasty , fair one ? " Thomasine struggled to release herself from his arms . He held her close and after a struggle imprinted a kiss on her full red mouth . She struck at his face , her nails leaving a trail of red across it . " God 's death ! You vixen , you 've scratched me ! " " I should kill you . " Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rose trellis into the path that led to the beechwood . He watched her whirling flight , his face like a thundercloud . Then he took out a fair linen kerchief from the pouch that hung on his sword-belt , and mopped the blood from his cheek . " God 's death ! " he repeated . " Now I shall have to retire from the evening 's entertainment or I shall be the butt of all their laughter . " In the great hall the tables had been cleared , the remains of the banquet set aside . The guests wandered to the gardens and terraces or walked in the orchards . Some flung themselves on the greensward and slept , as men do who have eaten to capacity . Others went to their chambers and divested themselves of their outer garments , arranging themselves to sleep until late afternoon , when they would assemble again for games  --  bowls , archery , wrestling , each young man eager to show his skill with arms , in feats of strength . Sir Richard consulted his wife . " Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our guests would enjoy taking part in the harvest festival ? Or shall I have the harper sing ballads , and later a dance in the hall ? " Lady Grenville thought for a moment . " The harvest festival by all means . The Londoners will be entertained . But I thought you had business to discuss . " " Tomorrow will be soon enough . I am expecting other gentlemen ? Richard Hakluyt , Thomas Hariot and Ralph Lane , all from London ; and perhaps William Cavendish ; and from Exeter someone will come to represent the Earl of Devonshire . " She raised her evenly plucked brows . " You did not mention them before . Who is Mr. Lane ? "  | " An equerry of the Queen , a friend of Walt 's . Perhaps you can bed him with Walt if you are short of bedchambers . " " I was n't thinking of that . There are still some unoccupied rooms , Richard . I must have more food for supper . " Grenville threw his arms about her tapering waist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him , still laughing , and went off to the buttery to talk with housekeeper and cook . She found them seated at the long oaken table in the buttery , each with a mug of ale and a plate of spicecakes . They stood up quickly when Lady Grenville came into the room , a large grey cat falling off cook 's lap as he rose and made his bow to his mistress . He was a man past middle life with a face as lined as a map , a cross scar on one cheek-bone . He was as black-haired and black-eyed as a Spaniard , and he boasted that he had gone round the world with Drake . " Though bai n't see much as the galley was down below . I 'd ha ' died I would , the time we shot the Horn , were n't for Master Gorrell of Bideford who sewed up my wound with a sailcloth needle . " Lady Grenville told him now that other guests would arrive before nightfall , and asked what he would serve for supper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandelions mixed with young beet tops . " " Have you enough pasties , Cook ? " " Aye , enough . I always keep a roll of short-crust pastry by me ; then ' t is nothing to cut up the raw beef and raw Irish potatoes , throw in some chopped onions and a sprinkling of fine herbs . Then I rolls out my crust thin , cuts it in triangles , fills it with the mixture , folds over and nips together , bakes for an hour . There you have the best pasties in Cornwall . " " That they are ! " said Brooks , who had been silent until now . " Sit down and finish your ale , " Lady Grenville said kindly . " Do n't forget to have two more rooms opened , Brooks . " She walked out of the stone-floored buttery through the kitchen . Most ladies of the gentry never went near the kitchen , but she went often . It pleased the chef and the steward and kept the lesser servants on tiptoe to have the pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great fire-place . She noticed the shallow tins of rich cream in the brick oven . She called out , " Cook , your cream is in rings . " Two young girls rushed out from behind the brick oven . With the corners of their aprons they lifted the cream pans off the fire and set  | them on the long table . They had just placed them in front of the window to cool when the cook came running in , his face red , his eyes darting sparks . Lady Grenville left hastily , before he turned his terrible tongue upon the young girls . They stood close together , trembling with fear . Cook had the privilege of whipping if he liked , and not to watch his cream until it was properly clotted was a crime of first magnitude . In the great hall she came upon Colin . Ile was standing over two lackeys . One was polishing the silver tankards for the high table , while the other worked on the pewter for the lesser table . Vinegar and salt for the pewter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water were on benches , ready for the final bath . " Are you having ague again ? " she asked , seeing how fatigued he looked . Nurse Marjory had told her that his fever rose every afternoon . " Ma'am , thank you , Your Ladyship , not since Nurse Marjory went at midnight to the cross-road and buried a new-laid egg . The fever left me that very night and has not returned . " " I am glad , Colin . " " Thank you , madam , thank you . He was standing in front of her respectfully , with head bent . A slight noise behind her caused him to raise his head . Lady Grenville was again startled to see the dark look that crossed his face , and the hatred in his blue eyes . She turned and saw Thomasine running across the terrace and into the house . She was clutching the voluminous taffeta skirts as though they hampered her free movement , and her face was stormy . " You must not hold a grudge , " she said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive , Colin . The one who is right can afford to be generous . " Colin 's face had no expression . His blue eyes were without depth , were reflecting mirrors . She sighed . There were so many things that wanted righting here at Stowe ! Sometimes she felt as though she were drained of all feeling , flattened between the heavy conflicting passions of the stormy people about her . It weakened her and left her tired and weary . She walked slowly across the stone floor , her soft leather shoes making a swishing sound against the rushes . A little rest , perhaps , before supper , a little rest . Anxiety lay heavy in her heart ; fears beset her , fears for some unknown torment that lay ahead of her . Richard had said nothing more  | of Walter 's plans . Did they mean more days of anxiety in warring Ireland ? A new fleet to engage Spain ? She did not know . She dreaded the moment he would tell her he was leaving her again . Leaving her he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with Raleigh and Sidney . His full strong voice had floated lip from the garden where the three men were strolling . " ... and shall I die . . . and all this unconquered ? ' " Those were his words that lay heavy on her , a weight against her heart . She met Philippa on the landing as they went up the stone stairs together . Philippa 's room faced the sea , not far from the great Norman portal . Philippa said , " You look weary , Mary . Ca n't you take your rest now ? Surely your housekeeping chores are over for the day . " Mary smiled tiredly . " I thought they were until I saw Richard . He tells me other guests are arriving before nightfall . So beds must be sheeted and made ready . " Philippa leaned toward her and detached the bunch of keys from her belt . " Let me do that for you . I 'll find Brooks and we will atttend to it . How many more ? " " I 'm not certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be ready for six at least . " She stood at the door , waiting for Philippa to apply a bit of rouge . She wondered how much Philippa knew of Richard 's plans . She hesitated to ask outright . It seemed in a way disloyal to her husband to pry into affairs that he had not confided to her . Yet if she could be sure it was not war .. . How beautiful Philippa was ! Her body was slim yet rounded , almost like a girl 's body , yet she was twenty-eight , not so many years younger than she was . Mary caught sight of herself in the reflecting glass , a white face , thin , pale , almost lifeless . She turned away . Philippa 's eyes met hers . " You must rest , Mary , or you will not be fit to greet the new guests tonight . That would disappoint Richard . He counts so much on this . What is worrying you , Mary ? It must be something more than your housekeeping that pulls you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hastily . She must go . She would burst into tears if she lingered a moment . She went swiftly down the passageway , knowing that Philippa 's blue eyes were following her , wondering . Philippa had not left her chamber when she heard the clarion sound welcome . Her woman Mabsey , a sour-looking elderly female who  | had served her for years , bustled to the window and opened the diamond-paned casement . " ' T is a cavalcade , madam . Look , madam , a dozen gentlemen and their attendants . " Philippa went to the window . Horsemen were riding through the gateway , their horses ' hoofs making a great clatter . Banners were flying . She made out the swallows of Arundell ; the black banner with silver crescents of Harris of Radford ; the sable chevron of the Devon Prideaux ; the Courtenays , the Staffords , the Devonshires . There were others she did not recognize . " Run for Brooks , Mabsey . Tell her I will join her in the linen room . Stir yourself or the gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Run , woman ! Forget your dignity ! Run ! " Mabsey hastened away , her skirts rustling , the black velvet ribbons of her mob-cap flying . Her mistress had no sense of decorum . How could Mabsey , at her age , run down a flagged corridor ? She might slip and break her bones . She must be careful today , for last night she had dreamed of frogs and eels , a combination that could bring disaster . She slowed down as she turned the corner , and walked with stately measured tread . Suppose she should have had the bad fortune to meet Mr. Ching , Sir Richard 's chamberlain , while she was moving in such haste . He would think she had no sense of propriety . Brooks , in the linen room , was handing out sheets and bolster slips to four rosy-cheeked maids . " Hurry , Susie , the Grey Room ! Elfrida , the room next to the Red Chamber ! Mind , no wrinkles in the sheets . I 'll be by presently to baste the bottom sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find us as good housekeepers as city folk . Jeannette and Sara , to the North Wing with you ! Scamper ! " Philippa came into the room . " I counted twelve gentlemen and their servants , " she told Brooks . " Yes , madam . Sir Richard sent word to me . Master Lane , the Queen 's equerry , is here . He must have only the best , since he lives in the palace at Whitehall . " " Ah , " Philippa said , " Master Lane ! This meeting takes on official significance when Master Lane honors it with his presence . " Her voice had a little tinge of sarcasm that was lost on the bustling housekeeper . " Go with your maids , Brooks . I 'll see that Mabsey counts out sheets for the other rooms . " The housekeeper paused at the door . " I had hoped to catch ' Miss  | Thomasine to help . Lady Grenville told Inc to find her , but she van ishcd at once after the meal was over . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the last she saw of her was when she was in swift flight across the upper ter race . " The Lord only knows ! Beg pardon , ma'am , but the girl gets me all atwitter . She 's a queer one . It certainly upset me to see her running to the wood , wearing Miss Mary 's puce taffeta . Wherever she is , she is up to no good . " She sniffed audibly . " She is not the miss to weal any such fine clothes . A milkmaid 's dress would suit her best . " She hurried away , leaving Philippa smiling . Why did the girl cast such a shadow of distrust wherever she went ? She stood for a while watching Mabsey count the linen and check it against the list of rooms . " Ma'am , there 's no use of you standing here making yourself weary . Go take your little slumber , so you are in fettle tonight to meet the Queen 's equerry . " A little secret smile played over Philippa 's full red lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen him was at Kenilworth where the Queen had visited her good friend and faithful subject Robert Dudley . Lane had risen in the Queen 's favour since then . Lane and Raleigh friends ? She wondered at that , when both were striving for the Queen 's grace . Deep in thought , she did not sec Thomasine until the girl turned into the passageway that led to the North Wing . The girl did not glimpse Philippa . She was walking swiftly , looking to neither right nor left . At the cross hall she stopped abruptly . Colin , carrying a silver tray with a pot of cider , was approaching . The girl held out her hand , a conciliatory gesture , but he passed by without a glance . " It was not my fault , " the girl said angrily , her voice rising , " not my fault . I did not brand you . " Colin could not have missed hearing her , but he walked steadily on to the Red Room as though unaware of her presence . " May you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . " May you be eternally damned ! " Philippa shuddered . She slipped into her room  --  unseen , she hoped . The girl was strange ; a baleful light shone in her eyes when she spoke . What was it Nurse had said  --  that she lived in Merlin 's cave ? Philippa was sorry for Colin . It was not good fortune to have a curse set on one . It would have been better if he had listened to Thomas  | sine 's apology . He had ignored her , roused her anger . That was not good . Suppose that she did know some of the secrets of the sorcerer , no telling what spell she might cast upon him . Philippa entered her room and stepped to the window . The courtyard was crowded with guests who had come in from hawking , or cony chasing . She saw Grenville walk across the cobbles toward the Norman doorway almost directly under the window where she stood . He was talking to two men whom she did not recognise . As they were habited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Hariot . She began stripping off her clothes . Naked she got into bed and lay between cool linen sheets . She would sleep until dark , then wake refreshed . Somehow she felt as though portentous things were about to happen at Stowe . She heard the strumming of a lute , the harper 's golden voice , : " On a steep rock within a winding bay A castle stands surrounded by the sea , Whose frequent thunder shakes the trembling hill , Tintage of old ' t was called , Tintagel . " A little shiver went down her spine . The song was like an answer to her thoughts . The music went on : " Nor could the prince conceal the raging flame , But in false shapes to Tintagel he came , By Merlin 's art transform 'd from king to Duke .... " She recognised the old song of Uther Pendragon , that Welsh prince who fell in love with the wife of Garlois , Prince of Cornwall . It was through Merlin 's enchantment that he assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulterous ardour he begat King Arthur from the body of the Lady Igraine . . . . An old ballad known to everyone in Cornwall , yet now it had a sinister implication . What if that strange girl Thomasine knew the magic of Merlin ? She remembered how the eves of all the men followed her when she walked . Was evil born in her ? Philippa said aloud , " This is a foolish thought to which I give no credence . " But before she slept she repeated the Lord 's Prayer in Cornish , an earnest of her own pure thought . She drifted into sleep with the words on her lips : " Ny Taz ez Ny , ncau , bonegas , yw tha hanaw. "  | A Grenville ! CHAPTER 7 THE hawkers were straggling into the court-yard in twos and threes . Grenville rode in , accompanied by his two sons John and Bernard , each with a hooded falcon perched on his wrist . Hostlers and grooms were standing about , waiting to lead the horses to the stables . Colin , dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone trough where the horses were watered , the hawk hoop hung from his shoulder . Bernard came over first ; he transferred the falcon to his hand , placed it on the hoop . John followed ; he was in excellent humour . " We had luck this morning , Colin , " he cried . " My bird brought down a grey heron and made him disgorge a six-inch fish from his gullet . It was like the morning last week when we were out . Say , where 's Amos ? Why are you carrying the hawk hoop ? " " I 'm advanced from herd-boy , " Colin said with a grin . " I now carry cider jugs and hawk hoops and stand behind gentlemen archers to hand them their arrows . " " 1 say ! Do you like that better than shepherding ? " " Ca n't say I do , sir . " " Well , what would you like ? " Bernard drew near in time to ask the question . Colin hesitated a moment , gauging the distance between Sir Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . " I 'd like to bear armour for the master when he goes to the wars . " Bernard laughed , his merry eyes twinkling . " That is silly . You 'd have to work all the while , right under my father 's eyes . I thought you liked being off in the hills with the sheep , where no one could see you reading your books . " John , always more serious , said , " I thought you wanted to be a scholar , Colin . That is what Dame Philippa says . You should study hard ; maybe my father would appoint you to a living . Would n't it be wonderful if you were curate at Kilkhampton or Morwenstow or even Bideford ! " " You are teasing , " Colin said sullenly .  | John hastened to reassure him . " Indeed I 'm not . Dame Philippa says you are twice as studious as we are . " He laid his hand for a moment on Colin 's shoulder . " I know what you are thinking  --  that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are men in London not of the gentry or of the nobility who have come to high estate  --  merchants and seams$ . Sir Francis Drake , for one . Why , his father was a fisherman with only one small boat . Now he 's a knight and the Queen 's favourite navigator . " Colin shook his head and moved over to the gate to take a hawk from one of the guests who had just ridden into the court-yard . " Why did you put such ideas in Colin 's head ? " Bernard asked as the brothers went into the house . " Because I believe he can do what he pleases , once he makes up his mind . I do n't see any reason for him to wander over the hills with the sheep every day . Sometimes I think we have other servants who could be advanced and serve us better . " Bernard stared . " What strange ideas you have , John ! I believe you get them from reading Dr. Hooker 's books . " " That is not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought them by myself . Anyway , Colin is different . We 've always been fond of Colin . Ever since we were children he has been our companion . " " More like a body servant . " " Bernard , how can you say that ? Colin is too independent to be anyone 's servant . Maybe he was born to a condition of servitude , but in his heart he is as independent as we are . " " Better not let our father hear your silly talk , John . He 'd flog you ? or maybe you 'd ask for Colin for a whipping-boy . " Bernard grinned . impishly and ran up the steps two at 2 time . John , always slower for all that he was two years younger than his brother , followed more leisurely . A solemn-faced boy , darker than most of the Grenvilles and quieter , he had more the disposition of his mother , but fortunately none of the wild blood of the St. Legers . In the old days John might have been a monk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that the sea was in his blood . Bernard as heir of the Grenvilles had other work ahead of him . The management of Stowe and the twenty-odd other manors would be his . When the brothers approached the long room in the west wing , it was to find Richard Prideaux and John Arundell in the little ante-room . They had stripped off the clothes they had worn hawking . A bath had been laid in a round tub made of wood , held in place by straps of  | copper . Arundell 's manservant was busy sponging the young men with cool water from the spring beyond the stables . Their clean linen lav spread on the bed . John Grenville leaned out the window and shouted to his man to conic bathe him . The lackey , a strong husky lad from Somerset , was seated on a stone bench conversing with a group of servants who bclonged to the guests . The youth broke off in the midst of a talc of Cornish hawking and disappeared through the archway . A few moments later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . He unlaced John 's leather jerkin and dragged off his long boots . Two young boys brought up water buckets , swinging from yokes across their brawny shoulders . There were much splashing and laughter and talk about peregrine falcons and tercels . John 's young kestrel had behaved well , as well as some of the better-trained hawks . He flew easily , head in the wind , and checked at signal . Black John Arundell boasted that be had a hawk at Trerice that could outfly any he had seen at Stowe . Prideaux also boasted . A peregrine falcon he had trained could outfly any iii Cornwall . Wagers were laid , and plans made for a meet  --  each lad with his own bird , trained by himself . A gong sounded . Bernard Grenville jumped from the tub . " Hurry ! Hurry ! Fifteen minutes till dinner . You know our father . He demands punctuality at meals . " Long hosen pulled on ; trunks tied into place ; doublets snatched from bed and chairs ; wet locks coaxed into semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing . " I saw you making sheep 's eyes at the new girl , " Bernard Grenville whispered to John Arundel ! . " She 's a wild piece to my thinking . " John Arundell 's swarthy face reddened . " You never ! I did n't look at her . Besides , she 's a cousin of sorts , one of the lesser Arundells . There 's a pack of them in Cornwall . " " Do you acknowledge all your Arundell kin ? " Bernard queried , stretching his handsome legs and pulling at his hosen . " No , that I do n't , " Black John said , " particularly not the wild ones from Tintagel . Thev almost never come to Trcrice  --  maybe once a year on a feast day . " Richard Prideaux 's long Gallic face lighted with a slow smile . " If she were my cousin , I 'd chain her  --  on feast days and other days . Did you mark how she walked , moving her hips sinuously , like some great cat or tiger ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tremayne 's face last night ? " Loud laughter followed John Arundell 's question . " Did she so ? Scratch our brother-in-law to be ? " asked Bernard . " It might have been trouble in a brier patch , " Prideaux ventured . " But surely she spat at St. Leger a few nights ago . He pinched her when a lackey was carrying him to bed , the night he over-reached himself trying to drink as much as Sir Richard . " " No ? What did she do ? " " Ca n't say ; was n't there . But he boasted . " " The beast ! " John Arundell cried . " I 've a mind to call him out for his insolence . " " Listen to the firebrand ! Lad , your sword-arm has n't skill enough to challenge St. Leger . He 's famous for his sword in hand . " " I 'll teach him not to bother the girl . " " Ah , Johnny , are you sweet on the wench ? " " Her name 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl or ever spoke a word to her . " John Grenville said , " I do n't think we should be flippant about any of my father 's guests . " The others were silent . " Do n't be a prig , John . You sound like the curate . But let 's be off . Get away from the glass , Prideaux . Your curls are in order . Give us a chance . " Prideaux ran his hands through the waves of dark hair , cut close to his well-shaped head . " I think I 'll grow a beard when I go to Virginia . " " Virginia ! " a chorus of voices shouted at him . " Are you going to Virginia ? " " Why not ? They want young men , do n't they ? " The others drew close to Prideaux . " What do you know about Virginia ? Have you been asked to go ? What is this Virginia talk ? " John Grenville asked . Richard Prideaux said airily , " I have ears . Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to hawk or to harvest grain surely ? " John Arundell said , " I thought it might mean some plan to raid the Spaniards . " " No . It 's a Virginia venture . I heard Sir Walter talking to Captain Amadas today while we were waiting for the falcons to take off . A great venture to the New World . " A second gong sounded . " The last bell . We 'll be late to our  | places . " Bernard led the way , Black John and Richard Prideaux close on his heels . They raced down the long hall to the stone stairs . John Grenville , who was last out of the bath , found his hosen tied in knots . Ile struggled to untie them , but it made him late . He entered the dining-hall just as Sir Richard and his guests seated themselves at the high table . He stood at the door that gave on the serving pantry , his face red with embarrassment . How could he cross the room to the lower table without being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt a tug at his sleeve . Colin whispered , " Quick , along the wall ! There 's a seat saved for you under the minstrels ' gallery . Now , as the lackeys go in to serve the boar 's head ! " Taking the hint , John slid along the wall , mingling with the lackeys who were serving the tables below the salt . Colin followed , carrying the wine jugs on a tray . John gained a seat on the long bench below the gallery and stood with head bowed as the new Rector of Kilkhampton , William Tooker , said a short prayer to bless the house , its guests and the food and drink that graced the board . " Thank you , " John whispered as Colin placed a pewter wine cup on the table before him . " Thanks . " Colin moved on to serve the others at a near-by table . It was not the first time that Colin had stood between him and his father 's displeasure . He looked about him . New faces were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young son of the Earl of Devonshire  --  and Edward Stafford . Devon men were here to join the Cornish gentry . There was subdued excitement in the air . Broken sentences came to his ears : " Virginia " ? the word was spoken quietly ? " the New World ... how many ships ? ... The Spanish  --  may God damn them ! ? must be stopped , pulled from their high arrogance and ... Florida in Spanish hands . . . the Plate Route to the Spanish Main . . . treasure , gold , silver and pearls ... for the Queen and the Realm " ... all words whispered among the young squires as they ate the hearty food set before them ; words to capture a youth 's imagination and stir hot blood . John Arundel , sitting next to him , dropped his voice . " Lucky Grenvilles , you know what the plan is . You do not have to wait on tenter-hooks to find out what devices the great ones make for a voyage on the Virginia Sea . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance than to be caught in a lying boast of knowing more than he did . " Nothing . "  | The cheese board was passed ; cider and wine and ale were poured into mugs and tankards . A shuffling of feet ; the squeak of chairs on the stone-flagged floor ; a rustling of taffeta skirts and subdued laughter , thinly sweet , as the women and girls slipped into the minstrels ' gallery above them . Arundell nudged John with a sharp elbow . " Look upward , " he said softly . John glanced over his shoulder . Thomasine 's profile was visible , clear-cut below a mop of unruly dark hair . Beyond her was little Mary 's pale blondness . A glance upward , no more . Sir Richard , splendid in blue doublet and fine hosen , rose . Raising the great silver-gilt bowl , he cried , " A toast to our Sovereign and Gracious Lady ! " Every man was on his feet . The Grenville clarions sounded . " The Queen ! The Queen ! " Half a hundred voices took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to the next along the table . " The Queen ! " each man repeated as he drank . " The Queen ! " ... until it became , from repetition , like a chant , rising in volume as the lower tables lifted their mugs and tankards . " The Queen ! The Queen ! The Queen ! " John Grenville drank his cider with the rest , his heart pounding . How good it was to raise one 's glass to toast their Gracious Elizabeth , the peer of all women ! Other toasts followed rapidly  --  to the Lady of Stowe ; to Dame Philippa ; to the young ladies of the household . It was grand . Sure in all England there could be no more distinguished company of gentlemen than these in the great banquet hall of Stowe . No , nor another so gallant as Sir Richard Grenville . John 's heart throbbed with pride  --  proud that he was born a Cornish gentleman , knowing that he was born a Grenville , proud of the banners stacked against the wall behind the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Tears came to his eyes , prideful tears , to be brushed hastily away with the back of his hand . Out of the tail of his eye he saw Arundell 's eyes were shining . Was he , too , proud to be Cornish-born , an Englishman , living under the greatest Princess the world had ever known ? Was he proud to be born Arundell , as John was proud of his Grenville heritage ? They stood equal , men of equestrian stature since the days of Norman William , they and the Courtenays and the Godolphins , the Trevelyans and the Staffords . He lifted his cup to Sir Philip Sidney ... to my Lord Burghley .. . to Sir Francis Walsingham . ' T was cider of last year , and potent . The  | room grew hot and the figures of the men at the high table hazy . " To the Knights of the Shire ! " . . . " To the Warden of the Stannaries , Sir Walter , Sir Walter ! " Voices chanted the name . His cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How elegant he was , swarthy as Black John Arundell , in tight-fitting doublet of white with slashings of blue and silver ! How striking the contrast ! His pointed beard , thick and dark , fell over a white ruff . One long pearl dangled from his ear , a court fancy of court dandies . His words came swift , easy words , graceful words . His hands , fine and white , held tightly the hilt of a jewelled dagger . Sometimes he gesticulated , pointing to a great map pinned to the tapestry on the north wall . " To Virginia , Captain Amadas , Virginia . " He bowed to the sturdy captain with the merry dark eyes who sat beside him . " A call to brave men of Cornwall and Devon  --  perhaps one man from every hundred of our two counties ! A summons for tall ships built at Bideford to sail down the Torridge and out to the open sea ! Other ships lie even now in the Pool at Plymouth Haven . Three months only will take them to the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Island of Roanoke . Will any stout Cornishman or Devonian refuse so brilliant an opportunity to bring glory to his Queen , to shut Spain out of the New World ? " " Down with the Spaniards ! " someone shouted . " Hear ! Hear ! " came hearty voices raising the echo to the kingbeam of the vaulted roof . " Who will lead ? " called Christopher Harris of Radford . " Who but the greatest man of the West Country ? Who but Grenville ? " Raleigh answered , quick to take advantage . " A Grenville ! A Grenville ! " The old battle cry of past ages . Men were on their feet shouting the name , while they banged pewter and silver drinking vessels on the smooth oaken boards of the long tables . " A Grenville will lead us to the New World ! " John Grenville tried to shout , but the words died in a sob that rose to his throat . Through the mist he saw his father 's tall form , erect and noble . John swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A Grenville , strong as an English oak , " Black John Arundell said , beating the table with the hilt of his dagger . A mighty man , Grenville , thundering down the ages . It must have been like this when a Grenville banner waved beside William the Conqueror 's ; and in the Long Crusade ; at Agincourt ; at Crecy  --  at all  | the battles that made England great . " A Grenville ! " Swords flashed aloft . The clarions resounded . The old rallying cry rang out again and again : " A Grenville ! " He caught a glimpse of Colin , his eyes alight , fixed on Sir Richard Grenville . Black John caught up the banner of Arundell . Courtenay , Prideaux , Stafford , St. Leger , Champernowne were quick to lift theirs aloft . They crowded close . Tables were pushed back ... . Young John Grenville could stand no more . He turned and rushed out through the long window behind his bench , clown through the garden . On and on he ran , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beechwood he stopped and threw himself on the ground , his heart bursting within him . He was not sixteen , far too young to plant the Grenville banner in the virgin soil of the New World .  | Harvest Home CHAPTER 8 THE shouting died . Sir Richard Grenville , with one glance toward the minstrels ' gallery and the white , stricken face of his wife , made a short speech of acceptance . From the tail of his eye he saw Philippa lead Lady Grenville along the upper gallery , young Mary supporting her . It must be a shock for her to hear the plans for sailing to Virginia , but perhaps it was as well to come this way . It would save him explanations and tears . Gad , how he hated women 's tears ! They took the strength from his veins and turned his liver weak . He said what he had to say . One sentence came out clear and strong at the end : " Since Her Gracious Majesty the Queen has seen fit to make me admiral and general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of all ships and all men involved in this expedition to the new land of Virginia , I will assume the responsibility . The loyal support of the men of the West Country and the stout ships of Devon will carry us forward . With God 's help we will succeed . " There was further talk and discussion . The shouting died . The guests went out of the banquet hall , scattered over the house , the adjacent gardens and terraces . In a small antechamber off the great hall sat five men : Walter Raleigh , Philip Sidney , Captain Amadas , Ralph Lane and Richard Hakluyt . The western sun already low shone through the mullioned windows . Moving patterns of sunlight and shadow on the flagged floor were made by ivy that grew thick on the outer stone wall and hung in streamers across the window . Holland chairs covered in red leather , a leather-covered window bench and a long table of old oak formed the furnishing . Raleigh was talking . In his face and eyes there was the remnant of that excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have seen for yourself what I mean , Lane . In Grenville you have that rare thing called leadership . He has the quality to make men follow him to the death . "  | Lane sat stiffly while the other men lounged . It was said he wore a corselet of iron under his doublet to give his figure the prescribed flat stomach and straight back . " We do n't want men to follow to the death , " he said , a slight edge to his voice . " My mistake , Lane . " Raleigh spoke good-humouredly . " I should have said , Men will follow Grenville to the ends of the earth . " Sidney lifted one silken-clad knee over the other and settled himself well in the high-backed chair . " It was mediaeval , that demonstration . I kept thinking that the Crusades must have started in just such a way . That black-browed lad catching up the banner , the others following , the air heavy with their ancient battle cries . " " That is the West Country , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand well together when it comes to an issue . " He glanced at Hakluyt , whose long angular body was bent over the map . Amadas , from the window-seat , watched two wrestlers who were entertaining guests on the greensward , and said nothing . His time would come later . " I agree with Richard . Some of my people come from the West Country . It is a society welded close , link on link . Its strength lies in its integrity and forthrightness . Did you ever see such a demonstration , Lane ? " Sidney pressed the silent man for an expression . The masklike features of the Queen 's equerry did not change . " Often , " he said in his fiat , disinterested voice . " Often we have whipped up wild enthusiasm among the populace when the Queen is to make some public appearance . " Sidney glanced at him . " Ah , Lane the Londoner ! Are your perceptions so blunted you can not discern the difference between your staged demonstrations and one that comes from the heart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestry , he was sensitive to any slight from a man of the position of Sir Philip Sidney . For a moment he was speechless . Without wit or quickness , he had not the grace to turn a phrase neatly . In a few moments he had command of himself . After all , was he not the friend of Sir Francis Walsingham ? And was not Sir Francis the Queen 's principal secretary ? " I thought it well rehearsed , " he replied , clinging to his original idea tenaciously . " I grant Grenville is a little king in this territory . I wonder if it is wise for a Knight of the Shire to have too much power . " There was a veiled threat in his words . Raleigh broke in quickly . This was not going the way he planned .  | There must be harmony , or the venture had little hope of success . " You misunderstand our people , Mr. Lane . We are a stiff-necked lot . We have a certain rugged independence , but we are loyal folk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Queen . You are mistaken if you think this display of enthusiasm you have witnessed was anything but spontaneous . Only a few of us present had ever heard anything of the plans before . Do n't think this demonstration is any parallel to the whipped-up enthusiasm one sometimes sees in Westminster , which is engendered by proddings . " Lane disregarded Raleigh 's explanation . " Who were those men ? " he asked . " Whom do they represent ? Are they Grenville 's tenants and their sons ? Fishermen ? Yeomen ? Folk who do Grenville 's bid-ding ? " " I can see , Lane , that you have no conception of the West Country . Have you never heard of our county families who date back in unbroken line to the Conqueror  --  aye , and some of them beyond , to Saxon times ? " " I may have heard something at one time or another . It made no lasting impression . " Raleigh struggled to keep his composure . " Then there is no use to expound their virtues . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects than the men of the West Country who have fought her wars and upheld the dignity of the Crown ? " Sidney put an end to the discussion by joining Hakluyt at the table . Looking closely at the map , he called to Amadas , " Captain , will you show us the point where your ship made an entrance behind the long sand islands ? Is there a bar ? How deep is the water ? How large is this Island of Roanoke ? " Amadas got up and followed Sidney to the table . Raleigh , tired of explanations , also went to the map . With the tip of his finger the young navigator traced the route his ship had taken from the Azores and up the Florida coast to an inlet between the long islands to the haven near the Island of Roanoke . " We knew nothing of the main , " he said regretfully . " We explored only a little , but we know there is a great inland sea beyond the island . " " Why did you not investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to , " he said frankly , " but Barlow was against it . The Indians we had seen seemed friendly , but we were a  | small company , ill equipped with stores or small ships to go farther . Barlow contended that we had done what we had come for . I knew he was right , but certainly I wanted to see beyond the verge of the continent . " " You were not so cautious as Master Barlow , " Sir Philip said with a smile at the young captain . " Sir , no , I am not cautious . I wanted to sail on and on , but  --  .  --  - " He shrugged his shoulders expressively . " Our Indian friends whom we brought home with us , Manteo and Wanchese , both advised against it . They said that the Indians up the great water were treacherous and at war with their people . " " Are you going on this journey with Grenville , Amadas ? " Raleigh asked . Surprise crossed the open countenance of Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Sir Richard 's quotation the other evening . It suited my mood perfectly . And shall I die , and this unconquered ? ' " " Excellent . You shall have a ship of your own this time , Captain Amadas , and if you wish to explore the inland sea and the main beyond the Island of Roanoke , I am sure Sir Richard will voice no objection . " " Ah , that is what I want , gentlemen . I wish you could , with your own eyes , view that fair land  --  the gigantic pines ; the monstrous cypress marching from shore far into the water ; the myriad flowers and bushes unknown to us , and the vines thick as the compass of two hands with the luscious purple and amber grapes . A fertile land with lusty growth . Ah , again I say , And shall I die , and this unconquered . ' " He paused , grinned a boyish , half-embarrassed grin . " I talk too much , " he said and went back to the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney said . " Come with me , Amadas . Let 's walk out and see the new mare Sir Richard has been boasting of . We can talk more on the way . What you tell us catches my imagination , sir . " Lane got up from his chair , a look of puzzlement on his face . To Raleigh he said , " I hope Sir Richard Grenville has been informed that I , by the Queen 's grace , will be the Governor of Roanoke for a year and a day . " Raleigh spoke shortly . " He will be informed . " Lane left the room . As he crossed the hall to go to his room , he saw Sir Richard walking up and down the garden path with the Rector of St. James-the-Greater , of Kilkhampton . The rector was talking earnestly ,  | Sir Richard listening without interruption , but the heavy lines between his eyes were deepened almost to a scowl . Whatever Mr. Tooker was saying , it did not please the knight . Lane smiled , a sly crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the garden Mr. Tooker said earnestly , " I have done what I can by diplomatic means , Sir Richard . Mr. Paget has left but Mrs. Paget refuses to give up the rectory . I am at my wit 's end what to do next . I have been here two months now , and she will not move out , nor will she allow me to have a room or go into the study , where there are many church books necessary to me if I am to go on with my work in the parish . I must have the lists , so that I may call on my new parishioners and become acquainted with them . " " The woman 's a fool , " Grenville said , " a silly , obstinate fool . I offered her a house in the village or one at Morwenstow , or even a dwelling in Bideford . She would not give way . I 'll have to take steps . " " Dear , dear ! I hope it will not come to the place where you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed . " My dear Mr. Tooker , I am the law in this parish , and I am likewise the Patron of St. James-the-Greater . " The rector hesitated . " Perhaps I should give way and resign ... . Do you not think it ill advised to start off so badly ? A quarrel with a woman , and that woman the wife of a former rector . . . . People will not take kindly to that , or to me . " " Give way , sir ? How can you voice such a thought ! Run from a woman ? Mr. Tooker , if you have n't the humour or courage to take a stand , you are not the man to have the church . You would be the laughing-stock of all Cornwall if you retreated from a woman . Nonsense ! We 'll see that Mrs. Paget moves from the rectory before the week is up . " " Thank you , Sir Richard . You give me courage . I feared that you might think it unwise for a man of the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of you if you retreated from a stand which you know is right . Cheer up , man . It 's not a problem that ca n't be solved . Come . I see Dame Philippa and Lady Grenville . Shall we join them forthwith ? " Lady Grenville had been in the upper garden . The basket on her arm was filled with lilies . She smiled at her husband , but her face was as white as the lilies she carried , and her eyes had a hunted look .  | Philippa , on the contrary , was still possessed of the excitement that had filled the great hall . She watched Grenville 's approach . He is young , learned , virtuous and full-manned , she thought . Danger is in his blood . So is the sea in his blood ; it draws him inordinately . What will come of this new venture ? Will it win for him new laurels , everlasting fame , as Drake 's voyage has done for him , or will it bring dis-aster ? Sidney had said to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men . " She recalled at that moment a look she had seen on Lane 's face as she watched the procession of young men . He , in his narrow way , his unrestrained will and great ambition , could be a bitter and vengeful enemy . Richard , a spirit beyond the reach of fear , would not guard against little meanness . He might easily underestimate the Queen 's equerry . Richard 's reaches were simple and direct . An enemy he could slay . If he wanted a woman he would seize her . His was not a nature to combat slyness or intrigue of a mean cast . His was a splendid character for a prince . A couplet she had recently heard came to her mind because it fitted the man so closely : Who to himself is law , no law doth need , Offends no law , and is a king indeed . That was Richard Grenville . Because he would not lower himself to intrigue or treachery , he would not recognise it in others . Should she warn him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of a man he was ! Physically and mentally of high stature , the sum of all bodily and mental excellence in man . She watched him as he spoke to his wife , now all solicitude . Before her gentle spirit he lost the calm remoteness that characterised his common attitude toward people . Mary had no conception of his fiery anger or his firm courage or his disdain of mediocrity in men or women . With her he was the eternal protector . I would be bored to death , if a man treated me so , Philippa thought . The Richard Grenville she knew was not boring . Mary Grenville went away and left them , intent on her household duties . Grenville indicated a bench . " Please sit down , Philippa . I 've been wanting to talk with you , but there has not been a moment . " Philippa spread her skirts and sat down . Each movement of her body was one of studied grace . " You are today 's hero , Richard , " she said , busy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the remark without comment , standing before her , stripping a short stick he had picked up in his walk through the grounds . " What arc you doing with that hazel stick ? Do you intend to search for water ? " she questioned , humour in her upward glance . " No . " He laughed and tossed the rod away . " No , I have a better use for it . I should , if I had my wish , lay it on the round bottom of Madam Paget . " " Richard ! " " Yes , and with some heat . The woman is causing Tooker trouble without end . " " How can anyone cause trouble for that pleasant little man ? " " She wo n't move out of the rectory . I told him to move right in with her . He was shocked . He began to shake as though he had a palsy . " Philippa smiled . " No one ever suspects you of humour , Richard . " " Am I so grim ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as grim as a High Marshal . " " Lane ! " There was contempt in his tone . She ran her slim hand along the silk that covered her knees . " Do n't think too little of that gentleman , Richard . He has the ear of several important people . " " Let him . I will continue to think little of him . He might be good on horseback or at raping , but no more . " " I still say , have a care , my good brother . " He sat down beside her . " You are sweet when you worry about me , Philippa , sweet and lamentable . I like a woman who does not worry , who sends a man forth with a smile and with dry eyes . Let the prayer for his safety be in her heart , not on her lips . " " You are hard , my dear .... But we were talking of Lane . It is good sometimes to remember that an enemy at court is not a good thing . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are morbid . That is not like you . " " Perhaps . But I saw Lane 's face at dinner . It was not pleasant . " " Lane ? Why think of him ? An equerry to the Queen . A glorified groom . Dame Philippa glanced over her shoulder and put her finger to her lips . " He rides beside the Queen , " she said in a subdued voice . " There are many occasions to speak confidentially . "  | " Let him speak . A Grenville does not fear calumny when his conscience is clear . I will be a man who crosses the sea to win an empire for his Queen , not one who plods the earth to fetch fuel for a kitchen fire , nor one who cringes at the petty dictums of the court . No demiCaesar am I , but a man to please his ancestors and himself , and perhaps  --  who knows ? ? the men who come after him . My own man am I , so let the Lanes vent their spleen or nip at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippa 's blue eyes widened as Grenville spoke . Her hand all unconsciously touched his that lay on his knee .. " Your pardon , sweet Richard ! My doubts and fears have taken swift flight . How could I be distressed or carry fear in my heart ? You rise taller than any man within all England . " " Dear Philippa , thank you . I wish that my Mary would think as you think now . " He stretched his legs and got up from the bench . " I am a coward when it comes to hurting her . Today I saw her white face as you led her from the minstrels ' gallery . It was a dagger in my heart . For a moment I was all aflame to go to her and comfort her in my arms . In truth , I took a step , but Walter caught my arm . " " You are going to her now ? " " Yes , I will put it off no longer . " " See that you do not wear her down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will join your tenants to make merry . " " Aye , I know . " He stood for a moment looking across the garden . His eyes fell on Thomasine as she ran across the upper terrace and disappeared into the yew maze . " That wild creature ! I do not know how Mary will tame her . " " Why tame her ? " Philippa answered . " Why clasp her in a mould ? I think she is best left alone , with only small guidance . " Richard shook his head slowly . " Three days only , and half my young squires are running after her . She is a honey-pot . She draws men . If she is not careful , she will say farewell to her virginity before long . " Philippa said , " I think not . I saw her scratch Tremayne when he tried to snatch a kiss . I think she will take care of herself . " " I do n't want my squires thinking of women . They must have minds free to think of nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A cold bed , if what I hear be true . Water and sand , a few tall trees , snakes and vipers ... "  | " A woman 's thought , Philippa , not a man 's . A man 's mind will be set on glory  --  to be the first to seat vast new lands for the Queen 's realm is honour enough for a man 's lifetime . " Philippa lifted her arms behind her head . The wide lace-frilled sleeves of her gown fell to her shoulders , leaving her lovely arms bare . " When I marry again , I will not marry a man who seeks adventure on the sea or iii far lands , but one who will take adventure between the sheets of my bed . Heigh-ho , here come Walter and Sidney , and behind them your Master Lane . " " I 'll go now . I think Mary is waiting for me . " He leaned far over , his eyes smiling . " You would be worth it , my dear , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippa 's fair face . She put her fan to her cheek to conceal the colour , as ' Walter Raleigh and Sidney approached her across the greensward . A rim of red moon rose over the low-lying hill . From vale and woodland and field came the sound of laughter and hallooing back and forth . The tenantry was making ready for the harvest festival . There were pasties and seed-cakes and cakes of saffron , baskets of apples , jugs and barrels of good Devon cider , ale , cheese from home dairies , great bowls of clotted cream to eat on peaches or fruits preserved in spring for this occasion . An old custom , the harvest festival . Old wives contended that it came to them from the Saxon times . Some antiquaries insisted that it was planted on the island by the Romans . Ceres ' Festival they called it . Whatever the origin , each year yeoman and tenant , herdsman and yokel and children looked forward to dancing and the harvest games . The festivities at the great house began as the moon rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the rooks caught the excitement , and long past their usual time they circled over vale and wood . Their heavy raucous cries seemed to penetrate the falling darkness as the roar of an angry sea might penetrate the fog over the rocky coast . The guests were in the walled garden . Raleigh , Sidney and Lane were the center of a semicircle . The other guests and the members of the household sat behind them . The young squires lay sprawled on the grass . On the opposite side the servants were gathered , a hundred or more , dressed in the blue livery of the Grenvilles . Old Pooley had a seat of honour , while Ching the chamberlain moved quietly about to see that guests and servants sat in comfort . He kept his eye on the  | Norman gate in the outer wall where Colin , in his shepherd dress , waited to give the signal . Tonight the tenantry , headed by the elder yeoman from each farm , would pay tribute to their overlord , each bringing with him the symbol of lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great oak , an oak so venerable that it was written into the Domesday Book , a ceremony as old as the Domesday Book itself . An earlier Sir Richard Grenville had had the Domesday record translated and carved into the stone above the fire-place in his hall . There it remained . Sir Richard Grenville and his lady took their places under the Domesday Oak when the moon climbed as high as the Norman tower on the eastward wall . The knight was dressed in white , his doublet slashed in silver . He wore corslet and epaulets of silvery metal . Beside him on an iron garden table was placed his casque with blue plumes . The casque was cleverly arabesqued in damascene , with inserts of silver-gilt . His hosen were silk , his boots leather from Morocco as soft as a piece of Lyons velvet . His reddish gold hair was shortcropped : his beard , almost auburn , was trimmed to a nice point . Had he been going to a levee at the palace , he would not have been more elegantly dressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetched home from the Holy Land , where he had journeyed with Godefroy de Bouillon in the First Crusade . Lady Grenville was all blue and silver , and her brocade gown swept . about her in heavy folds . On her head she wore a heavy coif with a long lace veil that fell to the ground , giving her more height . Grenville was attended by his sons Bernard and John , his lady by her daughters Mary and Catherine . They composed themselves in two great chairs with the Grenville crest carved at the top . By the side of each chair two Italian stone garden benches had been placed . The young people grouped themselves close to the chairs where their mother and father held court . Behind them and around the circle torches were being lighted before darkness descended . " What is the meaning of this ? " Lane inquired . " Why do Grenville and his lady seat themselves in throne chairs ? " " It is an ancient custom at Stowe . The tenants come once a year to pay tribute , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only once before , years ago when I was a lad . I remember how impressive it was . " Lane said nothing . Philippa watched him covertly . He likes nothing  | that concerns Grenville , she thought . Then she turned her attention to the west portal where the great double gates were swinging open . So heavy they were that they could not be negotiated by hand . A group of servitors turned a wooden crank that worked the machinery to open them . In ancient times a moat had surrounded the stout stone walls ; now it was half-filled with rubbish and overgrown with brambles and ivy . As the gates opened , Colin gave the signal and the clarions sounded . The procession , headed by the oldest yeoman , holder of the oldest land lease , stepped over the threshold and into the cobbled courtyard . Behind him a long line waited to move forward . Beside each yeoman a young man walked carrying a lighted pine knot . The open gate gave a view of the long road that curved down the hill past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vale . Flickering lights showed the procession winding slowly down the opposite hill , now heavy in shadow . As the grey-haired yeoman advanced , dressed in his best leathern jerkin and short breeks , his buskin laced almost to the knees , the visitors saw that each man carried a red rose in his hand . Now the ancient one stood in front of his overlord , whom he saluted , not by the bent knee , but by touching his forehead with the fingers of his right hand . Then he laid his rose on the stone bench and , after a word or two of greeting from Sir Richard , passed on below the terrace where rows of benches had been placed . The torch-bearers stuck their torches in the ground , making a ring of light . The harper , seated near a trellis covered with red roses , struck up a tune , a quick lilting tune which caused men to step more briskly . For an hour the procession moved on ; old tenant and young paid their tributes with red roses until the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had touched his forehead in salute , the court-yard was crowded with women and children who came to watch and , when the ceremony was over , to join in the harvest festival . Sir Richard rose to his feet . His clerk , grown old and bent leaning over ledgers , brought a scroll and quill pen . Grenville 's full rich voice was heard above the lesser sounds and whisperings . " Let all men that are present and to come know that I , Richard , son of Roger , son of Richard de Grenville , and of the Richards who preceded them , have granted such leases the liberties which have heretofore been theirs . Besides I have granted them fairs and markets  | throughout all my lands in Cornwall and Devon . Waters and pasturage , tolls and stallage shall be free to them . " On Tuesday will I hold court , when each man may come for redress , or send a relative or friend if he be on pilgrimage or beyond the seas . " They may choose one burgess to be head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be paid to that officer from me and my heirs . " On this I print my own seal before witnesses . " Colin stepped close and turned his back . The clerk used it as a desk . Then signed Sir Richard Coffyn of Portledge in Devon , Richard of Spekcat , John St. Leger and Sir John Arundell the Elder . This ceremony over , the clarions rang out . The tenants crowded through the court-yard into the main yard , out through the lane to an open place by the stables where the harvest games would take place . The guests rose from bench and grass . Philippa turned to Master Ralph Lane , waited for his comment . It came reluctantly . " I must describe this to Her Majesty . She will be interested to know that such ancient customs and privileges still survive in the County of Cornwall . " Philip Sidney listened , his head tilted on one side . He held a red rose in his hand , which from time to time he lifted to his aristocratic nose . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking I would describe the tribute of the rose to her . It will be interesting for the Queen to compare two versions of this most interesting ceremony . " Raleigh came up . " We are to go to the stables . Now that this formality is over , the fun begins , when we can watch the tenants take part in their harvest festival , a custom quite s old as the one we have just witnessed . " Philippa said , " Lady Grenville will lead a contra-dance with the chamberlain Ching , while Sir Richard will step off with Brooks the housekeeper . You gentlemen , if you are lively and arrive before the farm lads , may each choose a buxom milkmaid as your partner . " " Ah , how delightful ! " Raleigh and Sidney exclaimed in one breath . " Let us make haste ! " Lane said , " A buxom lass is not to my liking . May I have the honor of stepping a measure with you , Dame Philippa ? " " Indeed yes , Master Lane  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pleases you . But I should prefer simple Ralph  --  from you . " Philippa swept a curtsy . " It shall be as you request ... Ralph . " She pronounced the name prettily , with a little hesitation . If Richard Grenville had been near by , he would have said it was time for Master Lane to beware . When they reached the stable court-yard , a team of grooms and field men were drinking cider , each with a lighted candle set in his mug , while the crowd about them were singing : " Old Tom Tanner is come to town . Heigh-ho , heigh-ho ! His nose is burned , his eyes are burned , His lashes also . " An old yeoman named Jonas , with merry eyes and round red cheeks and a tuft of white hair standing straight up on his head , was selecting a bundle of grain out of a stook with great care . Only the best sheaf would do for " Crying the Neck . " Colin stood by . Philippa called to him , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are about to Cry the Neck , " he said , coming to her . " In a moment the game will begin . Pardon , Jonas is calling me . I am a contestant . " He hurried away , to a crowd of reapers , men and girls , who had formed a circle about the stook . Colin stood in the center holding the sheaf , or neck , high above his head with both hands . The reapers stooped low to the ground . With a long wailing cry they began to sing : " The neck , the neck . Wee  --  Yeu , Wee  --  Yeu . " As they raised themselves slowly , Colin broke through the ring and ran swiftly toward the farm cottage a quarter of a mile away up the hill . There a dozen dairymaids stood guarding the doors and windows . They held water pails in their hands , ready to douse him as he came through . If he could get by the vigilant maids , the sheaf still held in his hand , and reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forfeit , kiss the girl of his choice . Running along the hedge in the darkness , he avoided the doors which the maids were guarding . Swinging himself along the wall , he reached the roof and entered through an upper window .  | The crowd followed . They rushed into the cottage and found Colin seated by the kitchen table , playing with a tabby . Shrieking and crying , " Unfair ! ' T is witchcraft ! " they circled around him . One maid after another came close , nudging his shoulder with elbow or hip , but he did not claim forfeit . He raised his eyes and looked toward the door . Thomasine and young Mary stood outside peering into the room . He leaped across the table and crossed the room . Mary hid behind a bush . Thomasine , with a frightened glance over her shoulder , picked up her skirts and fled down the path that led to the spring-house , well hidden from the cottage by a small copse of willows . Colin caught her there . He threw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl resisted , struggling to break from his arms . " Let me go , fool ! Let me go or I 'll call your master , Sir Richard . " " Call your master , the devil , for all I care . " He was laughing as she fought in his arms . " You owe me something for a branding . I choose the forfeit of a kiss . " He pronounced the customary words of the harvest game . " Give me your lips . " " I will not ! It is my teeth you 'll get . " She bit at his arm but found no flesh , only the sleeve of his leather jerkin . " Unhand me ! You smell evilly of sheep and cattle and manure . " " Health and fertility lie in manure , my fine lady . " She was breathing hard . " You hurt me , " she said , making her voice pitiful . He laughed again a little wildly , for his blood was alive and racing at the nearness of her body . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forearm . " Come , ' t is lawful for me to kiss you . I won you fairly . " She still fought him , struggling in his arms . Voices sounded across the field calling to them . He picked her up and carried her along the hedge that walled the meadow . " Where are you taking me ? " she cried , her voice trembling . " To a quiet spot I know where we can kiss without interruption . " " I 'll scream " She had no time to finish her words , for his hand closed on her mouth . On he walked up the sheep path , holding her slim waist with one arm . " You are a wee light lass , " he said . " I could carry you all night until the sun came up . Then we would be lying on the cliffs , listening to the pounding of the sea . " He felt her lips nuzzling his palm , trying to fit her teeth . " Keep trying , pretty mistress . I like well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand .... Do n't you see what you  | have done ? I wear your brand . I am your slave and , as your slave , I must be near you . " They came to the brow of the hill . In the rock was the shelter made of upright stones . Three sides of it were enclosed ; the fourth , to the west , lay open . He released her but stood blocking the entrance . She tried to pass him . He held her arm . " Have patience ! I will make a light so I can see your beautiful anger . " He struck a stone and a light flared up , which he held close to a tallow dip stuck on a stone bench . " Come sit beside me close , and I will keep the chill wind from you . " The feeble light flecked in the girl 's eyes . She did not scream but held her body close against the wall , as far away as his encircling arm would let her go . " I will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday that  --  " " That what ? " His voice sounded cool . " Of what will you com-plain ? " She was silent . " Of a kiss ? " He bent over her . His lips brushed her cheek . " This is a lawful kiss . I so declare . " He circled her waist , leaned to her , one arm about her shoulders , his hand caught in the hair at the back of her head . Slowly he drew her to him until her slim body lay against him . Then he put his mouth to hers , pressing against her until she opened her lips to cry out . Then he kissed her parted lips until she ceased to struggle and lay quiet in his arms . He meant to kiss her only once , the lawful kiss , but fire swept him and set him trembling . He drew her to her feet , pressed her body hard against him . " The lawful kiss and then this unlawful one . " He kissed her as though he would never have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . Free of his arms , she darted to the doorway . The moon was well up now , and the path lay clear in the moonshine . Far below the lights and beacons of Stowe burned like fire-flies in the night . He overtook her half-way down the hill , caught her arm . " Kiss me , " he said harshly . " I will kill you ! " " A happy death . " He put his palm to her lips . " The burn will go away , and the hate . " Surprise forced her question : " Do you hate me ? " " Hate you ? I loathe you . Are you so insensitive not to know it was you who caused me hurt beyond repair ? To wear a brand like ' a criminal ,  | burned into the palm of my hand for some silly play of St. Leger ? " " St. Leger ? Was it he ? " " Who tried to pinch your buttocks ? Yes , St. Leger , half drunk , hanging over my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . If that is true I am sorry . " " Keep your sorrow to yourself , " he said angrily . " I 'll have none of your pity , madam . " " St. Leger , " she repeated . " St. Leger . " " Aye , St. Leger who laid his hands on you . " He pulled her to him roughly , his hands heavy on her shoulders . He let them slide down her back slowly , across the curve of her waist , down her thighs . " St. Leger tried  --  but I succeed . " " Let me go ! Let me go ! " She was sobbing . " Oh , do not hold me so ! It is beastly . ' It is lustful . Let me go ! " " Go ! " he said thickly . " Go and complain to Sir Richard if you want . I shall claim harvest law for my kiss . " She put her fist against her lips to keep from crying out . Suddenly she turned and stumbled down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched her over the first knoll until she was lost in the shadow of the hedge , behind the French tennis-courts . He threw himself on the ground and looked up at the sky . I 'm a fool , he called himself in disgust ; a fool . I should have got her with child . . . . And swung from a gibbet , his better guide added . ... Well , no woman is worth the gibbet . He began to laugh silently . She was terrified , he thought . That little wild one was as tame as a cony in my arms . . . . It was not so difficult to tame them after all .  | CHAPTER 9 GRENVILLE , accompanied by half a dozen men of the Stowe household , rode to Bideford in North Devon . Here his guests Raleigh and Sidney were to take ship for Bristol after a conference with the merchants . Before they talked with Bristol men Grenville wanted to make sure what ships and supplies were available at Devon 's own port . Merchant venturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade with India and Cathay by the Cape of Good Hope route , following the example set by the Portuguese navigators . Sir Francis Drake had opened the possibility of the new route around Cape Horn , but that had not yet become a commercial reality . The Spanish were taking more than their share of gold and silver from South America . The Plate Route from the Spanish Main to Europe yielded prizes in Spanish galleons , rich in treasure , to English ships . The shrewd merchants of Bristol knew it was to their advantage to have a part in new ventures , and bought shares in freebooter enterprises . The Queen herself , secretly out of her private fortune , had taken shares in Drake 's and had received a magnificent return in gold . Raleigh wanted to get money from the Bristol men . Grenville had been against the idea . " Let us finance the whole venture in Devon . Let us take the risk and reap the gains , " he had told his cousin . But Raleigh was already committed to at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can provide at-least three ships , perhaps a fourth , if the yard at Cleave House have it off the ways by April , " Grenville told him . " I will hold my ships in the Appledore Pool as they come in from Lisbon and the coastal trade . If we sail in the spring , that will give the shipyard time for repairs , new sails and rigging . How many ships do you plan to send ? " Raleigh said , " I 'd like to send seven , but I think five will be all we can outfit . " This conversation took place as they rode along between the Devon  | hedges on their way to Portledge , Richard Coffyn 's estate on Bideford Bay . Here they would stay the night and meet Dame Philippa , who had travelled down from Stowe two days before on her way to London . The evening had turned chill and rain threatened all the way from Clovelly Cliffs . They had seen the dark mass of Lundy Isle rising from the sea . " A true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've never known it to fail . " " Do you still own Lundy ? " Walter asked . " Yes , though I 've thought to sell it . It gives me small revenue and much trouble . It is the haunt of piratical seamen , and I have not sufficient police to enforce the law . If I could sell it , I could build more ships , " he said thoughtfully , his eyes on the island , and repeated , " build more ships . There is fortune in ships and in trade . " " You must own half of North Devon now , " Sidney remarked . " Why do you seek more fortune ? " " The Fortescues , the Stukeleys , the Monks and the St. Legers have larger holdings than the Grenvilles now . Each generation of us has sold land unfortunately . " He did n't say it aloud , but he had already made arrangements to sell another manor in order to finance more ships . They had come to the gates that marked the entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffyn on your lists of available young men for our venture , " Raleigh said as they rode among the woods in the vale that led to the house . " No , there is n't a Coffyn who can go , " Grenville told him . " His sons are too young . Richard himself is too lame from wounds in the wars . " They paused as the rambling stone house came into view . It was set deep in the vale between high rolling hills , which were partly wooded in oak and beech , partly lush green meadows where red cattle grazed . Portledge had been the seat of the Coffyns almost as long as the Grenvilles had been overlords of Bideford . It reached from Allwington to Bideford Bay , with many farms and tenants to bring wealth of the earth to the lord of the manor . Grenville 's young men galloped past the Norman portal and up the path toward the high-walled gardens . They dismounted at a gate in the old wall and hurried to their quarters in the monks ' cells within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartered . There were young women staying at Portledge , and there was a  | pleasurable anticipation of a swim at the beach . Then they would return and array themselves in their best doublets and hosen and soft shoes before the supper hour . There was sure to be gaiety at Portledge , music and perhaps a ball in the picture gallery . Raleigh and Sidney dismounted stiffly , unaccustomed to hard riding . Coffyn , limping , led them through the flagged entrance . Sidney paused to comment on the Spanish armour , mounted on pedestals on either side of the entrance . Someone had thrust a red rose through the gauntlet of one figure . Coffyn , a thin man with a long nose and sand-coloured hair and beard , said , " My daughters take turns in ornamenting the Spaniard . They try to conjure up the handsome dark-haired caballeros who once wore the armour . " " Ah , youth ! Youth ! " Sidney exclaimed . " I wish I had not left that age behind me . " " Magnificent armour ! " Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight  --  the Low Countries . I have another trophy here . " He indicated the leg that dragged so when he walked . " I hope no Spaniard finds that armour here , " commented Grenville . " What , Spaniards invade our Devon ! Not while we can fight our good oak ships , " Coffyn boasted . " One never knows the strength of the Spaniard . He is a tough enemy and very resilient . " Grenville spoke grimly . " One never knows . Each planning the Spanish make toward invasion brings them nearer success . ' When you think of how little strength is in our navy these days , I sometimes wonder . Now under King Harry we had a navy . " " The Queen is all for trade rather than fighting ships " was Sidney 's comment . " No trade comes without a fight , and a country must fight constantly to maintain it . Ship of war and ship of trade go sail to sail ; the one complements the other , " Coffyn maintained . " Trade ! Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships . " Raleigh laughed . Coffyn stood aside at the door while his guests went inside . They walked into the great octagonal hall where a fire burned brightly in the stone fire-place . Other guests were assembled  --  James Stukeley , one of the Fortescues , other neighbors who had come to meet the distinguished  | guests . There was talk of the new venture that evening and arguments for and against it . While the elders talked , the young folk danced . In the morning they would ride on to Bideford four miles distant . The company rode down the narrow Northam Road and paused to glimpse the beauty of the river and the curve of the bridge arches . The small white town nestled in the fold of the hills , with staunch stone houses along the quay . They stopped at the chapel near the bridge-head . Grenville went inside to kneel for a moment at the tomb of his ancestor Sir Theobald , whose effigy in stone , with his little dog at his feet , was beside the altar . Sidney lingered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Grenvilles are still feudal , he thought , still living in the long past . Shut off from the changing world of London , they are as medieval as though the moats still surrounded their castles , and each morning and night the drawbridge rose and fell and shut out the world . The world Richard lives in is within the confines of his own acreage . There he is lord  --  at Stowe , at Kilkhampton and again at Bideford ... . " It is amazing ! " he said to Raleigh , who had come out of the church to join him . " It is amazing that so splendid a life is still lived in our times . Indifferent to the world without are these little islands within our little island . " " These shires , these independent people of the shires , make England great , " Raleigh answered . " Here you see our strength ; in London you see our weakness . God grant the shires stay strong forever ! " " Amen , " said Sidney fervently . " Amen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quay and the river and the shipyards in East the Water in plain view . Dame Philippa stood near a window in an ante-room , watching the upper road . Grooms waited near the doorway to lead the horses down the quay to the stables . Footmen were there to carry saddlebags to the rooms . The great gloomy town mansion was in gala array . Her journey from Stowe to Bideford had been a succession of feasts of welcome by the country folk . But Bideford would top it all . As for her own feeling , there had been enough of feasting and long  | talks among the men-folk about Virginia . County life began to pall . She was ready for gay evenings of bright , brittle laughter , inconsequential conversation , a stolen kiss or two behind brocade curtains in a window embrasure . Things that she had painted as abhorrent when she talked about little Mary with Richard Grenville at Stowe resumed their lure . Too serious , these men with a purpose . They gave no thought to women . They were moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be excluded was not to Philippa 's liking . Soon she would be home in London . She was ready for new adventure . A little flirtation with Philip Sidney was not undesirable , even though he had lately been so devastatingly in love with Penelope Devereux Rich . She did not take too seriously his recent marriage to young Frances Walsingham , Sir Francis ' daughter . She could think of her only as a little girl , and the marriage only as a family arrangement entered into on the rebound . She was glad he was riding up to London with her , and Raleigh well left behind at Bristol . A night at Bath would be pleasant , and no one would know whether she slept alone or had an ardent bedfellow . Philip was handsome as a god . She wondered why she had not thought of him as a lover before . The many times she had stayed with his sister at Penshurst , the thought had not come to her  --  or to him , for that matter . But that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lighted the fire . Perhaps he would be slow to set aflame . What was it he had said last night  --  that all cats were grey in the night ? The thought amused her . Perhaps his experience had been unfortunate , and the cats rather tame . She hugged her slender arms about her breasts and laughed . Let wild-fire whirl over him and give him a new world where all cats were not grey in the night . Let a thousand flames of joy spread over him , if he sought her bed , wild vicious flames that consumed and left no ashes of regret . She saw the riders halt at the gates . She turned and walked swiftly down the long hall to the stairway . She must have time to dress carefully tonight . Tonight would be the beginning of a campaign . It must be quiet , subtle , with no gaucherie . He must pursue me , not I him , she thought . His dignity will not allow common dalliance . What mood will be mine  --  all innocence , boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilith ? She hummed a song as she moved about her chamber , waiting for  | her woman to lay a perfumed bath : " My true love hath my heart , and I have his . " Richard Grenville , leaving his guests to their own devices and comfort , mounted his horse and rode across the Long Bridge on his way to the shipyards in East the Water . He rode at a sprightly pace , followed by Colin , his sole attendant . The Haven of Bideford had built ships since the time of Henry V , when the Admiralty ordered Bideford yards at Appledore Pool to build large vessels for the King 's fleet . The tide ran deep and strong at the quay near the street of the smiths , and ships up to one hundred tons ' burthen , with prows and sterns greatly elevated above the water , were fashioned in these yards . Many folk in the narrow crowded street touched their caps to Richard Grenville as he rode along , and greeted him with courtesy . Some he knew by name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently he came to the gates that led to the yards , where he found the small stone office of Edward Chapman , a cousin of Raleigh who lived at Buckland Brewer . Now superintendent of the yard , Chapman and his young son John , a lad of fourteen , walked with Grenville to the ways , where his ship the Virgin God Save Her was drawn up for caulking . A ship of two hundred tons , she had been launched two years earlier and had already made several trips to Portugal and the Azores . Near by was the bark St. Leger , one hundred sixty tons , owned by Grenville 's brother-in-law , waiting its turn on the ways . The bark Fleming , two pinnaces and one snow were farther downstream . Chapman , thin , with a high-bridged nose and light-blue eyes , stood taller than Sir Richard . He had deep lines from nose to lips , and the flat planes of his face showed the bony structure beneath . He coughed violently and confessed a cold that had kept him abed for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship yesterday . It now lies safely at the dock at Cleve House , where she will be ballasted  --  a hundred and four tons  --  and rigged to go over the bar at a moderate tide . " " Who owns her ? " Grenville queried . " Mr. Gorges , your relative , sir . He will load her with spirits , cordage , linen and cotton and some earthenware from Wales . " " To trade with Portugal ? " " Also woollen goods billed to Portugal , but the rest of the cargo goes to Turkey . "  | " I wager some gets to Spain instead of Portugal . Trade knows no enemies , " Grenville remarked . He dismounted and tossed his reins to Colin . " Tie up the horses . I will go with Mr. Chapman to his office . " He turned to young John . " Have you finished building your boat , lad ? " he asked . " Sir , it was finished last midsummer . " " Have you taken her outside the bar ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she handled like a veteran . " " Good , lad . You 'll be building ships as staunch as all your people have built these long years . " " Thank you , Sir Richard . That is my hope . " He glanced at his father , smiling . The elder man smiled back . They were as alike as two pease . " Not until you have spent a year or two at Cambridge , " his father remarked . The boy asked , " But , sir , how can Cambridge help me build ships ? " Sir Richard added a word : " Mathematics , my boy . Euclid . " " That 's what my father says , and Cousin George . " " Ah , George Chapman , the poet who writes plays . I had forgotten he was your kin . If he would take you under his wing , you would be in good fortune indeed , " Sir Richard said . " Now suppose you show Colin your boat . ' What kind is it , a sloop or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very sturdy and seaworthy . " The boys went off . Sir Richard watched them striding away , headed for the quay . " How old is John ? " he asked Chapman as they walked to the counting office . " Going on fifteen , " Chapman answered . " I 'm sorry . If he were older , he would be a fair one to navigate a ship for me when I go on my next voyage to Virginia . " Chapman raised his heavy eyebrows . " Virginia ? Are you thinking of sailing to Virginia ? " " Yes , I 'm making up an expedition to sail to the New World in the spring . That is why I have come to see you today . I want to know what ships may be had , and want you to look through the Sessions Book of Bideford to find out what shipwrights and quartermasters may be available for the voyage . I want sober men and diligent , those who will work to the satisfaction of their officers , " Grenville added as they entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be seated , Sir Richard . I will  | have my lists brought up . In the meantime will you not tell me more about this Virginia expedition ? " On the way back Sir Richard stopped at the rope-walk where the long lines of hemp lay , fresh dipped in tar . Under a roof shed near by men were making ropes for rigging ships , combing hemp , spinning two or three strands into strong lengths . A shallow cistern filled with liquid tar had a windlass attached to the lip . Here a man feel the rope into the tar while a boy cranked a windlass which wound the well-tarred rope . Colin , returned from viewing John Chapman 's snow , stood watching while his master talked with the foreman . It was a new thing to him and new things he found of interest . As he started across the long bridge on the way back to Grenville House , Sir Richard motioned Colin to ride closer . He had observed the lad 's close attention to the rope making . He listened to the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , was his unspoken thought . A good lad to have close beside me on the voyage to look after my interests . He questioned him discreetly , learning something of the way Colin 's mind worked , and he was pleased with what he discovered . It was quite apparent that Colin held no grudge against him for the branding . Sir Richard was deeply chagrined when he learned the truth of that little affair . Colin had not told him that John St. Leger was the culprit . He liked that ; it showed good strength of character to accept the punishment . No tittle-tattle , but a lad who knew his place . He thought of Dame Philippa 's remark that Colin learned faster than any of the young squires because he was eager for information . " A mind in which curiosity is lively " had been her comment . Another thing Philippa had said came to him : " Take a good look at his features and his carriage . Does he not have something in him that favours the Grenvilles ? " Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle William had been blond , with eyes as blue . " Who was your mother , Colin ? " he asked abruptly . A dark look crossed Colin 's face . For a moment he hesitated . " Sir , my mother is dead . " " And your father ? " " He also is dead . " " And your name ? " " Colin . " Nothing more . No explanation . There was a fine dignity in the boy , Grenville thought . He would  | say no more . When he returned to Stowe , he would question Nurse Marjory or old Pooley about Colin . He thought of the numbers of young Grenvilles who had visited Stowe  --  their cousins the Champernownes , Gilberts , Arundells and St. Albans , who all had Grenville blood in them . Young blood sought young blood , and there were a dozen young milkmaids and farm girls to meet under hedgerows in the spring or the heat of summer . The lad was sixteen or thereabout . Sixteen years .... He must have been begot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that was about the time of the turning point in the relations between England and Spain , when Phil made his plan to send the Duke of Alva to the Netherlands to crush the Protestant resistance . . . the year when the northern earls were rising and when the Duke of Norfolk was flirting with the idea of marrying Mary of Scotland , a wild notion that cost him his head . Pope Pius excommunicated Queen Elizabeth about that time . Where was he , Grenville ? Oh , yes , he remembered  --  part of the time in Ireland . But he came home when his Catholic cousin Sir John Arundell of Lanherne and Sir William Godolphin were at the head of a commission to muster Devon and Cornwall from Land 's End to the Bristol Channel . A silly business , which died aborning . He 'd gone up to Parliament about that time as Knight of the Shire . There was trouble then over changes in the Book of Common Prayer , and his cousin Humphrey Gilbert became a defender of the Queen 's prerogative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closetrimmed moustache and beard . An incident came to him , one of those quick flurries of passion that sometimes overtake a man at the sight of a woman 's bosom or of the curve of a thigh under a rainsoaked garment . Could it have been . . . He glanced covertly at the boy . One never knew in these cases whether one has planted a seed . That midsummer night , when he rode in from a late visit in Kilkhampton . . . He had dismissed his groom , he remembered , and ridden alone . The moonlight was bright . Near the upper gate of King 's Park he heard a woman cry out . He had reined his horse and dismounted , gone in through the gate . There he saw a farm lad making a poor attempt at covering a girl with his body . He sent the man packing with a lash of his riding whip about the yokel 's shoulders . The girl , her hair falling over her face , her soft bosom showing under the torn kerchief , jumped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of her hands . The fragrance of new-mown hay was in his nostrils . The girl was young and soft and desirable ... .  | Strange , he could remember so much detail after these years and could not remember whether he took the girl or not . They had come to the gates of Grenville House . He dismounted at the block and left Colin to take the horses to the stable . His mind turned to the business at hand . He would let Raleigh convince the merchants of Bideford of the desirability of giving monetary aid to purchase ships . Chapman had told him that the Tyger was available . The great door swung open and he entered the hall , walked swiftly to his room without encountering anyone except the lackey and footman wearing Grenville livery . One thing was certain . At Raleigh 's behest he had , by letter , engaged the attention of Dominic Chester , a merchant of Bristol . Bristol had been made ready to take shares in his earlier planned venture  --  to circle the globe  --  back in 1573 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist themselves and their goods in the service of the Queen Majesty and the promotion of trade . " May Francis Drake be damned eternally ! " he said aloud in the silence of his own chamber . It was Drake who had snatched his idea and prevented Grenville from accomplishing that great adventure . Not only had he ruined Grenville 's great plan , but he had , by subterfuge , got the Grenville manor of Buckland Abbey . " May he be eternally damned ! " he repeated . He shouted for his man , who came hurriedly , alarmed by the volume of the summons . He stripped his master and followed him to the antechamber where the bath was ready . As his man scrubbed him energetically , Grenville 's mind fell away from the thought of Francis Drake and turned again to the farm girl under the hedge on the midsummer moonlit night . Did he or did he not take the maid ? Try as he would , he could not remember , and the question that had risen in his mind  --  could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Philip Sidney left the company of merchants and sought the company of Dame Philippa where she sat in the small room off the great hall . It was a pleasant room , with a deep seat in the window that looked out on the quay , a few chairs , and a table on which a footman , at Philippa 's request , had left a flagon of wine and a few silver cups .  | Sidney seated himself near Philippa at the window . " I could bear it no longer , " he said . " The same talk , over and over . I know the words Walt will utter before they pass his lips . " " Are the Bideford men interested ? " " Yes , I think so . Walt is playing them off against the Bristol merchants . You know there is a fine competition in trade . " " Is Richard using his influence to persuade them to join the ven-ture ? " " No . Wisely he sits back and listens . His part is to select the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I notice he has put his name down for a goodly sum . " " I know he is selling one of his manors to get money , " Philippa said . " I had no idea it was so important to him . Grenvilles do n't like to ' , sell land any more than the Sidneys . . . . But let 's talk of something else , my dear Philippa . I imagine you are pleased with the idea of going back to London after so long an absence . " " Almost a year ! " She sighed . " The country has advantages but one misses the stimulation of active , brilliant minds . Tell me what goes on . Has Mary Sidney found a new poet to write verse to her charms or a playwright to read to her ? " " No one new , I think . " Sidney stretched his arms and rested his sleek dark head against the yellow brocade curtains . " Ah , yes , one ? unknown quite until she found him . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making calf 's eyes . He has written a verse beginning " No spring till now ... " " I think it a lovely line , " Philippa said slowly . " There was no spring in this world until I met you . " She looked at him , her eyes lovely with innocence . " That is what he meant , was n't it ? " " I suppose so , " Sidney replied . " The sentiment must be pleasing to women . Mary has had it painted on her latest portrait , set in a wreath of leaves or flowers . I really do n't understand the symbolism . " Philippa did not answer . She took up a lute and touched the strings softly with her long white fingers . " You are jealous of the unknown poet , Philip . You wish you had written those lines in a note to some fair one . " He laughed . " Perhaps . Who knows what lies underneath the mind of a man of thirty ? Jealousy , passion , love , ambition  --  who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words of a ditty Sidney had written :  | " My true love hath my heart , and I have his , By just exchange one for the other given : I hold his dear , and mine he can not miss ... " Her voice was pleasing . She looked at him as she played . Was there a question in her lovely blue eyes ? He leaned toward her , seeking in the dim light to read her face . " There never was a better bargain driven . " He took up the tune . " My true love hath my heart ... " Her hand fell on the strings with a jangling sound . Her voice was very low ; her eyes were veiled . " Have you no place in your life for a woman who can love ? Do you think only of your early love ? " The room was silent ; the moonlight lay on her face and her eyes looked , not blue , but black and mysterious . " Only of Penelope ? " he questioned . He was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said too much , Philippa thought . She too , was silent , not moving . Her small plans had failed . Philip Sidney had no thoughts away from his beloved . After a little he laid his hand over hers , but he refrained from speech . Philippa forgot the planned intrigue . She was stripped of old superficial thoughts . She yearned over him , as a mother yearns over a child , meeting defeat and loneliness . A tenderness she had not known she possessed rose in her heart , engulfing her . She wanted to soothe him , comfort him , share the lonely brooding thoughts that engulfed him . She could no longer stand the silence . " Do not shut me from your thoughts , " she breathed . " My thoughts are dismal things . You would not want to share them . " She moved a little into the moonlight , knowing that moonlight became her , her white skin , the silvery glisten on her blond hair . " Dismal and dark , " he said half to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered at his tone . " What is it , Philip ? " she whispered . " What is it that overwhelms you , that makes your eyes so tragic ? "  | " I do not know how the thoughts came . " She caught his hands , forgetting herself , thinking only to comfort him . " Tell me ! Tell me ! " " It is the way of the Sidneys to think of their doom . It is thought of my death . . . on a field of battle ... far from England . " " What are you saying ? " Philippa cried , caught up in his dark thoughts . " What are you saying ? " " I thought you knew of the prophecy , it is so old . I thought Mary must have told you . " " No . I do not want to know . I do not believe old wives ' tales . You are young . You will live long , long , to the glory of England . Oh , Philip , you can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his arm about her shoulder . " There . You are shaking as though you had an ague . Listen , my sweet friend : I am going to London ; from there I go out to the Netherlands under Leicester . I will not return . I shall die on a battlefield . All this is foretold , and in my heart I know it to be true . Philippa put her hand to her face . Tears streamed down her cheeks . His arm tightened about her shoulder . " Does that hurt you so much , my sweet ? " " I can not bear it ! " she whispered , her face against his . " I did not know , " he said wonderingly . " I did not know . Nor did I know before that you were so beautiful , so desirable . " " No spring till now , ' " she whispered . " No spring till now , ' " he repeated . He got to his feet and pulled her to him . The lute which lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint discordant tone .  | Some Letters CHAPTER 10 RICHARD GRENVILLE let the words and arguments rumble about him . Talk of ships , of ways and means went on endlessly . He would have liked to escape from the room as Philip Sidney had escaped  --  by the simple expedient of walking out . He felt sorry for Walt , seized as he was in the vise of questions flung at him by the shrewd Devon men , who were first of all suspicious of Londoners . So often they had been betrayed by politicians and men intent only on moving themselves forward , ambitious men who had forgotten the soil that nurtured them . They were like yeomen who ploughed and planted and took from the soil without putting anything back to make it fertile . They said the kindgdom was depopulating from the increase of enclosures and from decay in tillage . They sorrowed over restraints put on the exportation of corn , while full liberty was allowed to export produce of pasture , hides , wool , leather and tallow . They complained bitterly about the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , some indeed had doubled . That would make for stagnation . They wanted to tell of their grievances as merchants and landholders . Because Raleigh was influential , they must tell him their woes . The extravagances of great men were spoken of . Raleigh protested he was not informed that the Earl of Derby had two hundred and forty servants ; or that when the Earl of Leicester gave the Queen an entertainment at Kenilworth , three hundred and sixty-five hogsheads of beer were drunk . He disclaimed any knowledge of Burghley 's plate , presumed to be no less than fifteen thousand pounds in weight . Was it true that the Queen never gave away habits she had worn , but put them away in wardrobes , until they now numbered three thousand garments ? Raleigh cast an anguished glance at Grenville , who came to his aid then by bringing the merchants back to talk of supplies for ships and the bright prospect for the port of Bideford once trade was established with new and prosperous colonies in Virginia .  | The evening ended finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously to undertake a great share of the venture . The worshipful mayor made the last talk . " Let it be the ships from Bideford Haven , lads . Have we not the stout oak , the stout men with stout hearts , to carry forward a great undertaking ? Yea , and the Bideford black to paint the ships and the boys to sail them ? " A rousing cheer and lifted mugs greeted the mayor 's words , and the evening came to an end . The merchants of Mill Street and of High Street , the Magnus Vicus of Roman days , took up their velvet caps and proceeded homeward , well satisfied . They were rich men , made rich by trade ; so rich and important had they become that Queen Elizabeth had been led to grant them a new charter , which empowered the election of a mayor , aldermen and burgesses . Now they would be first to capture the Virginia trade , through their overlord and good friend Richard Grenville . So they walked home , that moonlight night of August in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a table in his cabinet and took up his quill to write to his wife : Dearest : Our guests have departed over the Long Bridge on their journey to Minehead , where they will take ship for Bristol and thence to London . I think Walt was happy at the outcome . I was happy for him , and I liked him far better here than at Stowe . The longer he is away from London , the more he sloughs off the fictitious character that he has acquired as a courtier . A man may have courtesy and good breeding without losing kindness to all men , save only his true enemies . Walt seemed to be franker , for he knew he was among folk who would not thrust a knife in his back or run to the Queen backbiting and talebearing . At first he seemed like a man living in the shadow of the Tower , but the longer he breathed free Devon air , the freer his mind became . It pleasured me to see him emerge a Devon man once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was , as you know , his birthplace . I was astonished when he told me that his father never owned that land , merely a tenancy . This may explain some of his actions : a man without land is a transient , and uneasy . Philippa was very quiet when she departed with Sidney and Walt . I think she wants the excitement of London , but Devon is bred in her . She told me she would come back to Stowe next spring when I sail on the Virginia journey . That pleases me , for she is good company for you , and she will really be a lady-governess to our children .  | I will return soon to Stowe , but take ship from here to Padstow . Please send a letter in care of Richard Prideaux at New Place , for I will stay with him before travelling farther south . I must inspect defenses in South Devon and on St. Michael 's Mount .

We go to Plymouth next day . Colin deserves well of your praise . I think one day to give him the name of William Grenville , or would that displease Your Ladyship ? He could remain Colin to the family . He is surely a natural son of some Grenville .

GRENVILLE.  | From Exeter to my best friend Mary Grenville . By hand . The messenger is paid , but give him one shilling more . After he had written to his wife , Grenville penned a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham : The pier and quay at Boteraux Castle in Cornwall are nearing completion of the repair work . They may well serve as a model for the defence of Dover or Folkestone . The Dover pier should be made of stone and chalk combined , and I enclose a drawing of the masonry . I think , sir , that this will finish my work on harbor defences which I undertook at your behest . I take occasion to deny the truth of the reports raised against me of having committed unlawful violence in the parsonage house of Kilkhampton , to the terror and danger of Mrs. Paget , who kept possession of the house after the arrival of the new rector , Mr. Tooker . If any terror was inspired , it was Mistress Paget who inspired terror in the breast of Mr. Tooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection of armour and munitions : I have a ship ready to carry cargo to the destinations along the coast , as soon as the officers of ordnance , Mr. Paynter and Mr. Bouland , send same . I hope this plan will save the Cornish and Devon coast from piratical ravages . John Piers is in gaol at Padstow with several disreputable men . But so long as Sir John Killigrew 's servants pass unpunished for smuggling , it is useless to gaol lesser men . Your assured friend R. GRENVILLE Private . To the worshipful my loving friend Sir Francis Walsingham , at The Hatchet behind St. Clement 's Churchyard in London . My new man to carry this . These letters safely on their way by messengers , Sir Richard spent the hour before midnight in his room at the bishop 's palace , copying a poem given to him by Dr. Hooker . It was written by another Sir Richard Grenville , his grandfather . It interested him because he himself  | might have written the lines , so near were they to his own thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune Whoe seekes the waie to win Renowne ; Or flies with wynges of high desire ; Whoe seekes to wear the Lawrell Crowen , Or bath the minds that would aspire : Tell him his native soyle eschew , Tell him go rainge and seek anewe . To pass the seas some think a toille , Some thinke it strange abrod to rome , Some thinke it grefe to leave their soylle , Their parents , kynfolke , and their whome ; Think so who list , I like it nott , I must abrod to trie my lott . He sat for a long time looking at the paper and the signature Richard Grenville . Ah , well , other Grenvilles , in earlier years , were questing gentlemen . Perhaps there would be others still to follow him . Lady Grenville studied her husband 's face as he sat by the fire , his dogs about him . They were alone in their chamber . She thought he looked tired , the lines heavy in his face . Ever since he had come back to Stowe a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle riding from one field to another , from vale farm to the hillside acres , talking with tenants , planning for next year 's planting . Many yeomen had been tenants at Stowe for three generations , one family for four . Good people all of them . He understood them , and they him . Life was good . The land gave bounteously . But now he must sell another manor , and there was n't one with which he cared to part . The worst of selling was that the tenant , who held a ninety-year lease , might get a bad landlord , and he did n't like that . But he must have one more ship . He sighed heavily . Mary looked up repeatedly from her knitting , her eyes on his face , but she said nothing . Long since she had learned not to break in on his abstraction . When the time came , he would tell her what troubled him . She was patient , content to wait , content to have him sitting beside her . These past days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as well as their daughters , a family all together . That was as it should be . She could not conceive roaming from the roof-tree and the hearth . " Mary , I 've let the land at Eggafenne to Thomas Snellard . I doubt if he is a good tenant , but since he is married to one of our kin , I could not refuse him . " " He 's Alice Grenville 's husband , is n't he ? " " Yes , a far cousin , but still our kin . The rent runs from the Feast of St. Michael  --  one silver penny . " He laughed at her expression of incredulity . " I knew you would laugh , but I ca n't have them wandering about without a home , now can I ? " " You are so generous , Richard . Why do you try to conceal your generosity ? " " It 's the land out of Sir Theobald 's holding , a good strip of field and two meadows , an indifferent manor but a roof over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table . " Symon Arthur is granted the right to carry and recarry with carts , waggons , horses and beasts over our lands for a year and a day . If he proves a good carter , I will renew the bill of indenture next year when I return from Virginia . " I 've let one messuage of ploughland with appurtenances in Cokemalone for twenty marks , the rents to be paid at Michaelmas . Then William Hale , bachelor , of Barnstaple , has taken the first close , called Beef Lears , and the soil of the pond in the same field , the west and south files , hedges and fences of Linhay ; lease for twenty-one years from Lady day , for one broad piece of gold . " He folded the papers . " So you do not have to worry about these matters , sweet . I do not want you to have too much burthen when I am away . I 'll go over the list of tenants with Bernard . " Mary looked up again from her knitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And John also . " She asked , " Have you told them of your decision , Richard ? They will be disappointed . I think they count on going . " Grenville took a turn or two about the room . Stopping near his wife , he put his hand on her shoulder . " Mary , it tears at my heart to leave you . Yet something stronger tells me I must go . But I will not take your sons from you . That will comfort you . " I have made arrangements for John to go to Oxford . Bernard will be in my stead here at Stowe . He is a good lad and with Ching 's  | help will manage . And by the way , when I was in Tavistock , I stopped the night with the Duke of Bedford . He gave me the name of a tutor whom he recommends highly . I have written to the man to come here . He will coach the boys from now until next autumn . " " You think of everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Latin with them , but they protested . They say they learned more from Philippa than they ever did from Mr. Paget . " A frown deepened on Grenville 's forehead . " Paget ! The very name annoys me . Tomorrow I must ride to Kilkhampton to see if his wife has removed herself from the rectory . Women cause all the trouble in the world , i ' truth . " Mary smiled gently . " And all the happiness too , Richard . " He leaned down and put his lips to her smooth , cool cheek . " And all the happiness , too . " " If you are going to Kilkhampton will you take a package to Mr. Tooker ? I made the singing cakes for the communion , and he should have them , so he wo n't worry about Sunday and no cakes . " He pulled her to her feet and held her in his arms , his lips to her throat . " You never tire of good works , do you , my Mary ? Come , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us repair to our bed . " Before they slept Mary said , " When you talk with the boys , explain to them why they are not to go with you . They will take it hard , particularly if John Arundell and Dick Prideaux are going . " " Very well . I 'll talk with them tomorrow . " " Be patient with them , my dear . Boys need understanding and patience , and they are so proud of you , but they are a little afraid . If you take them into your confidence it will make them feel elated . Give them responsibility and they will accept it . They are old enough for the family councils , do n't you think ? " " I suppose they are . I 'm afraid I have n't given it much thought . How wise you are , my Mary , how wise and understanding ! " Grenville rode between the hedgerows toward Kilkhampton . A few paces behind him were his sons Bernard and John , and in the rear young Colin and Constable Smithers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . He did not relish making war with women , Puritan women most of all . It had been annoying for Eusebius Paget to turn out so unworthily , getting himself into hot water continually by making accusations against the Rector of Philleigh , saying he was a dicer , and against the Vicar of Gulval because he was  | a drunkard . But when he accused the bishop of nepotism  --  and worse  --  there was nothing to be done for him . Paget was dismissed . This did not disturb Grenville , for Paget had proved more of a Puritan than a Churchman . He gave the living to his cousin William Tooker . Paget had gone peacefully , but his wife , who was an acknowledged Puritan , brought her kin to stay in the rectory and refused to leave . If he put her out , which he must do , people would accuse him of hounding Puritans , as they had accused him of hounding Catholics . He still smarted from the case of Cuthbert Mayne , whom he had dragged out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Folk did not seem to realize that as Sheriff of Cornwall he had been obliged to carry out the orders of the Queen . She was determined to root out every vestige of Catholicism in Cornwall . The Arundells of Lanherne were known to harbour priests from Ireland . At any rate he had done his duty as sheriff and followed the law , even though it was obnoxious to him , going into the house of his dear friend and hauling a priest from his hiding place . Well , that was over . Now the Puritans would take issue and put out untrue reports about his cruelty . Only one thing to do with this case : get it over quickly . He left the young gentlemen at the London Arms near St. James the Lesser lich-gate . He proceeded to the rectory and dismounted , throwing the reins to Colin without words . " Wait here , " he said to the constable . He gave a sharp rap on the lion knocker and opened the door . He found Madam Paget seated in the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grey dress with the white ruche neck-piece of the Puritans . She was surrounded by a company of six , who were drinking sweet cider and eating cake . Four of the six occupants of the room he knew ; the others were a man and woman he had never before seen . They were laughing and talking animatedly . When Mrs. Paget recognised Grenville , she snatched the child from her breast and put it in the arms of the woman at her right hand . Hastily pushing her protruding bosom within confines , she began to button her bodice with clumsy fingers , even as she rose and made an awkward curtsy . " I should be glad of a minute 's speech with you , madam , " Sir Richard said gravely . The woman hesitated . She glanced at the unknown man , a dark ,  | beetle-browed person . He stepped forward . " In a matter of business I represent my cousin Madam Paget . " Sir Richard looked at him , a cold , grave look ; then he turned . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will state it before these persons . I give you two hours to leave the rectory . Carts will be here within the hour to move your possessions to a house I have secured for you in Clovelly , a house more spacious than the one you are now occupying illegally . " The woman started to speak . She turned her head from one side to the other , plucking at the mull at her throat . A dark spot began to show on her bodice . The babe began to whimper . It was evident that it had not dried up the milk in the woman 's breast . " I will not leave , " she said sullenly . " Mr. Kempthorne , the justice , has told me I need not move from here . " " She need not move . That is the law , " the man said belligerently . Sir Richard did not pay the slightest attention . " Two hours I give you . If you are not ready to leave peacefully by then , you will be removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I withdraw my offer of a house in Clovelly with a year 's free rent . No use barricading yourself again , for I will have you brought before the Stannaries Court charged with trespass . " Without listening to the chorus of voices , the wails of the woman , the crying of the child , he turned and walked out of the room . At the door the constable waited for instructions . " Go inside , Smithers . See that they do not pack any articles belonging to the rectory . Put a seal on the study before they get to it . " " Will she leave peacefully , sir ? " the man asked . " She 's been very cantankerous , very cantankerous , sir . " " I think she will leave , " Sir Richard said grimly . Colin held the stirrup . Grenville threw a long leg over the back of his horse . " I 've given her two hours . If she has n't gone by then , you 'll find me at the London Arms . " He rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle to the inn . Smithers shrugged his shoulders and went inside the door with a certain amount of swaggering confidence . After all , this time he had Sir Richard to back him up , Sir Richard within stone 's throw at the inn . When Grenville went into the inn , he found his sons had been joined by Arthur and Diggory Tremayne and John Harris . While they ate , he regaled them with his experience .  | " I gave the woman and her followers no time for words of protestation . I find success in giving orders , and no success in asking folk to do thus and so . " He attacked a large portion of well-cooked joint with gusto and washed it down with a mug of ale . " Most folk want to be told , " he added , eyeing the young men . " Remember that . There are always a hundred men to follow the one who leads . " They were eating the sweet , served by a pretty rosy-cheeked girl , when John , who sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The others went to the narrow window . Madam Paget , her child and the two self-styled cousins were in one cart ; the other two carts were piled high with household goods. - They looked away from the London Arms as the carts rattled off down the road that led to Clovelly Village . Folk were peeping out of windows and doors , waving good-bye , but none went out to speak . Sir Richard had not moved . He continued to eat his sweet and drink his ale . He was not ill-pleased . In a few moments he had settied a matter that had had the village on its ears for months . Now William Tooker could move in and begin his task of looking after the souls of the Parish of Kilkhampton . He found his wife in the orangery , where she had been talking with the head gardener . They sat on a bench , while he told her the end of the Paget affair . " If it is the end , " he said half-heartedly . " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in the Mayne business . I would not like to have a garbled report reach Walsingham  --  nor my friends among the Puritans either . " " Why not write to Sir Francis yourself ? Let him have the truth before rumour gets to him . " " You are right , Mary . I 'll do that this very day . I 'll not have these people striking at my reputation . I can forgive an injustice aimed at me , but this horrid business is aimed at the Church . " " Your Puritans , Drake and Hawkins , wo n't agree with that , " his wife said . Grenville got up and paced restlessly , as he always did when disturbed . " Drake ! How pleased he would be to do me an ill turn ! " " Nay , I think your own dislike outruns your reason , Richard . Sir Francis Drake is not likely to speak against you  --  you who are so just , so brave . " He plucked a small golden orange from a clipped tree and began peeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sweet . I 've  | noticed that when a man has done another a grievous wrong , he speaks ill of him to cover his own conscience , seeking out his faults and magnifying them . His own guilty apprehensions make the other an enemy . " He divided the fruit , laid an opened section in his wife 's hand . He smiled down on her , a tender , loving smile . " Yes , I 'll write Walsingham this day . How is it that you have so much wisdom , madam ? Do these inspirations come to you as you sit stitching on that great tapestry ? I think perhaps you are Penelope . Mind you  --  no lovers while I am Ulysses and gone on my journey ! " Mary Grenville laughed . She loved her husband in this teasing mood ; already he had banished the earlier worry . It was always so . Worry sat on him for a short time only , until he resolved on some action . Then worry fled . Late that evening Grenville read the letter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances ; concluding with a paragraph which Mary heartily approved . Whereas I being now prepared to commit myself to the pleasure of God on the seas , having a desire not to leave so great an infamy as this laid on my poor name unanswered before my departure next spring , I have thought it convenient even in plain sort to set down to Your Honour and other my honourable friends the whole and true course of all my dealings in this behalf .  | The Moor CHAPTER 11 PARLIAMENT met in November . By Christmas the Queen 's pleasure and the sanction of Parliament were assured . Raleigh 's charter was approved by a committee of eight men , with a large ' West-Country representation , including Sir Francis Drake . There remained only the financial organization . This was done through Raleigh and Sidney in London , and Grenville in Devon and Cornwall . In spite of Grenville 's distrust of him Ralph Lane was made Governor of Roanoke at the request of the Queen . Francis Brooke , of a strong Devon family , was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given a ship . Twenty or twentyfive men were recruited in London by this group against the advice of Grenville . " It 's all wrong , " he told Raleigh . " You take twenty-five city men and put them on a savage island for a year , and what happens ? They can not adjust to changed conditions . They are disgruntled , unhappy . They breed discontent . I tell you , the success of such an undertaking is in carefully choosing your men . You want adaptable men , not those who crave the feel of cobbles under their feet and the London street cries in their ears . " Raleigh agreed . " I can do no more , " he admitted . " Lane has the Queen 's ear . These are his men , and since he is to stay on the island the full year , I do not see how we can keep him from selecting some of his companions . After all , you have the selecting of seventy-five men , Dick . Is n't that enough ? " Grenville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane 's men . Once again in Bideford , Grenville settled down to make plans in earnest . Four months was little enough time to secure the men and get ships in order . Five would sail out of Bideford to Plymouth , where a ship and two pinnaces would join the little fleet . The day of sailing was set for the ninth of April . This day was chosen because auguries were good , and the season the best to escape the winds of hurricane  | proportions which came on the equinox . God willing , it would prove auspicious to all concerned ! Sir Richard had at one time planned to have in his company one man for every hundred of Cornwall and Devon  --  a hundred was a subdivision of a county , having its own court  --  but he soon discovered that it was not feasible . He set Bernard and John making lists of the county families , segregating those who had cadets of an age to undertake such a venture . None under twenty , he told them when they started work . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were happy to have some part in the venture , if only a minor one . Richard Prideaux and John Arundell he put iii Edward Chap , man 's shipyard under his brother-in-law John Stukeley . The more familiar they were with ships , the better was the chance of success . He was often absent from home , riding to Launceston , Padstow and Exeter to rouse interest in the forthcoming voyage . He was determined not to ask any man to go . Each man should come to him fired with desire , proud of the privilege to sail under the Grenville banner . It was not long before a multitude of young squires and students besieged him and his associates . " To Virginia ! On to Virginia ! " became a rallying cry in the shires . So great was the enthusiasm that the Queen became alarmed . " Who will be left to guard our shores if the Spaniards come ? " she cried to Raleigh . " That insatiable Grenville will absorb all my men and all my ships . Have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cousin Grenville : I told her it meant only a hundred men and seven ships , very few out of the thousands left to defend her realm . " They go for your honour , fairest and most sagacious of all Queens , to add to your realm by annexation of territory and to your glory on the seas . " She was then satisfied . But cease enlistment publicly , my good Dick . I need not tell you that I will sleep uneasily until your ships have sailed away westward . This terror called Spain hangs heavy over Her Majesty 's head and disturbs her dreams . She is like a mother partridge who spreads her wings and calls her young to draw close to her for protection . So she would spread her arms and draw in ships and men before the time when we must stand back to back and ship to ship against the Spaniards , who have gained friends and a haven in Ireland . A man to represent each hundred in Devon and Cornwall is what you desire  --  a goodly idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men to represent our Devon and Cornish families . Remember ,  | it was but twenty-eight families of Devon who volunteered their services and swords to Her Majesty to rid her of her troubles in Ireland . Be content with a hundred men , my cousin , a hundred for Roanoke ? or shall we say the Roanoke Hundred ? Grenville cursed , tore the letter into bits and let them fall to the stone floor , where the small white scraps buried themselves in the rushes . Tomorrow they would be swept out and burned . Grenville did not take orders readily . Let Walt write orders  --  he would follow his own course . But by the time he spoke to his wife about the letter his first flush of anger had subsided . What matter ? What was to be was to be . There was something of the fatalist about Grenville  --  a belief that brought comfort to soldiers and sailors . A strong faith in God 's divine will and protection had sustained him earlier in battles and would last him to his end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility asking God 's guidance to show him the rightful way . Harsh and stern disciplinarian as he was , he had a trust in his destiny too deep-rooted to be disturbed because he must at times give way . With some impatience he sensed the situation of Raleigh , caught in the seething ambitions and jealousies , the subtle intrigue of Elizabeth 's court . He must at times play his cousin 's game , thanking God the while that he , in his own county , had a freedom of action unknown to the habitues of the court . Let be the worries , he thought . He had tall ships in Appledore Pool , and some on the ways . Two more , D.V. , would sail in from Terceira within the month . He could do no more at present than scan the lists of volunteers that were coming in by messenger once or twice a week . Now he would spend the time getting his own affairs in order . A tutor was bargained for already . Bernard must be coached to attend the farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a friendly lad and got on well with the tenants , a necessary thing ; friendly , yet not too intimate . He must talk with John about his relations with women . Have a care to avoid unclean women , lest the French evil be the result , which would incapacitate him and make children improbable , or idiots . He would like to arrange a marriage for Bernard with Philip Bevil 's daughter Elizabeth before he left , but the thing hung fire . Bernard had shown signs of being interested in sedentary and scholarly affairs . This Richard could not countenance , for Bernard must , as his heir , be prepared to assume the responsibilities  | of the farms and offices in Devon and Cornwall . John should go with him , not on this journey to Virginia , but the next . Grenville already planned to come home as soon as the colony was seated in order to recruit a second hundred , or perhaps two , yeomen and artisans in the most part , to carry on the work laid out by the explorers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the devil with the Spanish supremacy in America ! It was dusk when he left Bodmin , but the December moon was full and the wild moor was swept clean of the snow that had fallen earlier in the week . Behind him rode Colin and a groom belonging to Arundell of Trerice , where he had been for a week . Ahead of him was a guide , a dark swarthy Cornishman who knew the moors . With good fortune they might reach Launceston by morning . His host , Alexander Arundell , had protested against night riding , and on Sunday at that , and particularly had he warned Grenville about the country after he left the River Camel and turned northward . " ' T is an evil country , " he had said as they drank the stirrup cup . " Evil , with unknown danger on the wild moors . Evil from the strange folk who cavort among the hills  --  those ancient folk who built with stones before the Romans came . " Grenville laughed and held his cup to the beaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales , Alexander ? " Alexander Arundell shrugged his shoulders . " One hears things , " he said . " Those desolate downs hold many a secret . After the great Temple Downs there are other places of danger . Last week a wool train disappeared , and all the men who drove the packs . Next day six men were found near Brown Willy , all dead and laid in a circle , their feet pointing outward  --  dead , and not a sign on them to show how they went out of life . " Richard extended his cup for another refilling . " I 'm not afraid , " he said . " I 'll keep my eyes and ears alert . ' T is smugglers who are the danger , not the Ancient Ones . " Alexander looked gloomily at , the floor . " I would say caution , if it were a word you knew , Richard . Caution when crossing Temple Moor ; caution around the tower of Week St. Mary if you go to Bude by that path ; caution around Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are mighty cairns where evil folk may hide . " " I 've no wish to be lost among the stones of Brown Willy , Alexander . Is not your man familiar with the track ? If he is not , what  | good to send him ? I will manage in front of me , Colin to guard my rear . " My man is armed and he is strong in a tussle . " Richard Grenville had a twinkle in his blue eyes as he spoke . " But what if the Ancient Ones are playing bowls among the stones ? " " Mist ! Do not speak so . You may bring evil upon yourself . " Grenville was thinking of the conversation as he rode along in the moonlight night . They had left Bodmin behind them and were now in the narrow track that crossed the wild Temple Moor . So deep were ruts in places that they could glimpse only the banks , not the moorland . No other riders could be seen , nor any human being on the moor , though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high spot where they could see for-some distance , Sir Richard drew rein until the other riders came up . He whistled to the guide who was trotting along ahead on his sturdy moor pony . There they held council . In the moonlight the guide seemed even more wicked than he had by daylight . He had a low over-hanging brow , his eyes were shifty , his mouth was sullen , and he seemed to have some impediment that made speech almost unintelligible . Grenville was obliged to question him several times before he seemed to understand . Finally he answered that there was a narrow sheep track across the upper moor which they could follow and thus escape going through Launceston . The man considered while his pony pawed the ground , impatient . They might turn off near Trewince Marsh . It would be bad if they lost the path and their horses floundered in the marsh . Men were known to have sunk so deep that the evil ground covered their heads . He seemed reluctant to go by the sheep track , but Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road and made a line toward Tintagel , following the North Star . The terrain changed and grew wilder . Rocks in strange irregular formation gave the impression of an upheaval , with stones pushed up from the bowels of the earth . The moon was rising higher ; it spread a strange bluish light over the earth . The shadows cast by small hills and cairns were heavy and dark . The guide fell back until he was but a horse 's length ahead of Grenville . Colin and Arundell 's groom closed up , as if for company . In the distance was a howl , which might have meant a wolf , and the sharp bark of a fox . Conies and other small animals scudded  | across the path in front of them . The guide turned aside and fell in with the two riders behind Sir Richard , murmuring he did not know the path . Since the master had chosen the sheep track , he would please to lead the way . For a long time they rode onward . An owl hooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped the guide and he edged his pony in between Colin and the groom . " It is no time to laugh , " the guide muttered . " ' T was hereabouts they took off with the wool train . Over there . " He waved his hand in the direction of the sea . " They live in these round hills and make merry with travellers , using their heads for bowls . " " Nonsense ! " muttered Colin . " Nonsense ! " " ' T is true . My granddad was telling me this fortnight gone how he laid eyes on them when he be lad . They be quare , ver ' quare folk , taller than most , with big eyes to see in the darkness , and their hands fall heavy on a man . " " Silence ! " Sir Richard spoke harshly . " Silence , fool ! Think to frighten good lads with your talk ? Watch your horses now . We must cross a bit of marsh ahead . " Colin said , " Sir , do you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are . I 'll lead . ' T is not a long stretch . Best to cross before the cloud covers the moon . " Colin looked up . A long streamer of cloud lay in the sky , mottled like a mare 's tail . " ' T is a way they have , " the guide muttered . " They cover the moon so they can snatch . " Colin said , " Close your mouth , fool ! " but there was a catch in his young voice . " They cover the moon . Then they make their balls of fire in the hills . " " Ride behind , you fool ! " Colin shouted . " Get behind , and quit your gibbering ! " They rode slowly , the horses ' hoofs sucking up the earth in small cupping noises . " Easy ! " Grenville called . " Turn left . The marsh deepens here . " On they went , winding in and out , until at last they had all crossed the long thin finger that reached out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross-path . Grenville called for the guide . " Which path ? " he asked . The guide got down and ran around in small circles . It seemed as though he were sniffing the earth . Off his pony , he was  | short-legged and full-bodied , almost a dwarf , with heavy powerful shoulders and long arms . After a time he pointed to the right-hand path which forked from the one they had been following . " This , " he said . Grenville said , " This seems wrong to me . It lies away from the sea . " " A short time and a turn to the left , " the guide said . He mounted his pony and , waiting for the three to pass , fell in at the rear . They were among rocks now and the path narrowed . The clouds were crossing the moon , and the light grew dimmer . The clouds darkened as they slid across the curve of the moon . A strange sheen seemed to cover the moor , a weird glimmer , not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they all watched the moon . Grenville thought , When it is all dark , perhaps we had better make a camp . He spoke over his shoulder to Colin and told him to ride forward . Side by side the horses stood while they talked . The horses were restless and uneasy . One whinnied , the moor pony . The moonshine faded , and the moor gradually grew black . The heavy rocks , the round hills were like ink against the grey shadows . Suddenly the guide made a moaning sound . His voice cracked and creaked with fear . " Look ! The moon lights ! The moon lights ! " Grenville swung in his saddle . To the left some distance away three or four circular lights hung in the darkness . They seemed to spin as an apple swings from a string . " Moon lights ! " the fellow called out again , his voice filled with terror . There was a gurgling sound as though a hand clapped his mouth . A moment later the groom fetched a frightened cry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone ! " Grenville rode back , cursing . " You fool , lie ca n't be gone ! " " Sir , he is . He had caught hold of my arm when something wrenched him right off his pony 's back . I smelled a sulphur smell ! T is the Old Nick himself . " The fellow trembled and caught Colin 's arm as he rode near . Grenville circled , calling . There was no answer . The cloud was moving . A dim light pervaded , in which objects became visible again . He saw the moor pony , riderless . It was standing stiff-legged , its eyes wild , its body trembling . The other horses were shaking . Their eyes too were distended . Their hair was ruffled as in a strong north wind . Grenville cried out in a mighty voice , " Guide ! Guide ! " An echo came back , " Guide ! Guide ! " and a sound like laughter .  | " God 's heaven ! " cried Colin . " What 's that ? " Grenville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have done with this nonsense ! " On a sudden the moor pony threw back its head and neighed , the horrible cry of an animal in fright . It reared and struck out with its hoofs . Whirling , it snapped the reins from the hand of the terrified groom and tore off , back toward the marsh . For half an hour they searched , calling , calling . No voice answered . Only Grenville 's voice , reverberating . " We may as well ride on , " he said after a time . " The guide will follow us no doubt , now that it 's light . " " Sir , he 'll never follow . " The groom got on his horse slowly . " The moor-folk have got him . Did ye not see their balls of fire and hear their wild laughter ? " " Folderol ! " Colin said , but his voice carried no conviction . Grenville tightened the gorget about his throat . His sword was slung in a boot at his knee . He had his pistols hanging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a strong knife at his waist . He wore light chain-armour under his doublet . He drew his cape about him ; the wind was rising . He was thinking , Why did the guide choose the right path at the fork ? The left was better marked and it pointed in the direction of the sea . What had he said ? A short way , then the path would bear left ? Instead , it was bearing farther right . His instinct told Grenville something was wrong . He had no belief that the moor-folk had snatched the guide from his pony and carried him off . " Rein in ! " he shouted to Colin . He turned and joined them , his horse brushing close to Colin 's mount . " I think we have taken the wrong turn . We will ride back to the forks . " A moan escaped the groom . " Sir , sir , " he pleaded , " not the forks ! Before God , that is where they lurk ! Let us ride on and put their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an expressionless blur in the dim light . " Turn your horse , fellow . We will ride to the forks and take the left turn . " With teeth chattering and hands trembling so they could scarce hold the bridle , the groom followed as they galloped back . " Do n't leave me ! Do n't leave me behind ! " he kept calling . " Spur your horse then . " Grenville 's voice was harsh ; he had no  | liking for a coward . If Colin was afraid , he did not cry out , but rode close to his master . They found the forks without trouble and took the path to the left . It was poorly marked until they had gone a quarter of a mile . There it made a half-turn left behind what seemed to be barren rocks overgrown with scrub . Perhaps it was an old wall , or it might be the remains of a Roman camp or earthworks . It was impossible to make out . But the path was strong and well marked here . Grenville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markings at first , many small paths spread among the stones . Now behind the barrier it becomes strong , as though the folk who travelled it thought they were far enough away for concealment to be no longer necessary . They rode on and on through the night , sometimes in bright moonshine , sometimes in shadow . Presently they came to a second fork . Grenville continued left . " A light , sir . " Colin rode up close . " A light dead ahead . " The groom crowded them close . " Moor-folk , " he muttered . " There will be more shining on the hills . ' T is danger , sir . Let us ride back . " " I have no desire to back and fill across the moor . We will ride forward , but cautiously , my lads , until we see what is ahead . " " You will see  --  more lights will come , more lights to lure us to danger . " But no other light appeared . After a time they came to a lowlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship 's light , swung from a pillar , set before the dark mass of a building . They drew rein . " Let us dismount and spy out the land , " Colin said , standing by his master 's knee . " Maybe it is a farm-house , but I hear no dogs . " " Nor I , " Grenville answered . " More likely it is a moor inn of evil repute . " " So I fear , master . May I spy out ? " " Go ahead . We will stay by . Wait . Are you armed ? " " My dagger , sir . " Colin handed his reins to the groom and disappeared into the shadows . The groom drew close . " Sir , there is danger , " he repeated . " I have smelt it . " " More like you smell the sty . Brace your back , fellow , and sit straight in your saddle . You will have more courage if your back is straight and your head erect . " The moon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal ,  | tuntil he came to the corner of a building . It felt cold under his extended hand . He drew back quickly , his stomach tight , the hair of his head stiffening . Then he chuckled . Slate . A building of slate that was chill against his palm . He walked slowly around , touching the walls from time to time . Once , twice , there was a break in the wall ? a door , a window dark within . Half-way to the front of the building  --  and it was a large one , long and low , all slate-covered on the windward side  --  he saw a chink of light . He applied his eye to the crack . He was looking into the kitchen . An old woman , bent , with a mob-cap over her scraggly locks , was at the fire-place . The window was an opening without panes . The woman 's back was toward him , but she was speaking to someone . " They be gone this some time . Bewse and Kendall go seaward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in against the rocks . Four men they have beside thyself . Tickle , he takes half a dozen brave boys and rides toward Launceston . There be a train of woolmen coming . Mayhap he will relieve them of the weight of gold they carry to pay the wool farmers . " There was a laugh . Colin edged closer , turning this way and that , until he got the second one in his vision . The laugh betrayed him . It was the guide , sitting at a long table , his elbows on the board , before him a meat pie . " ' T was about that I came to the inn this night . A mighty man rides the moor with a poor following , two only . He must have on him a sack of gold . " " Why did n't ye kill he and take the gold ? " The woman stood before him , hands on hips . " Why indeed ? He had two with he , and he be dressed in a chainmail that my blade would do naught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . " The woman sat down on a stool and began to stir the contents of the pot with a gourd dipper . " Let be , Eyekut . Leave highwaying to they who know how . Best you stick to your smuggling and leading folk astray on the moors . Boys will soon be back and you can tell ' em about the fine gentleman with a bag of gold . " This was enough for Colin . He moved softly out from under the eaves and made his way back to the spot where Sir Richard waited . " Ah , " said Grenville when he had heard the tale . " I was right .  | Our guide intended us to fall into the clutches of the highwaymen . For that he must be punished . " Colin said quickly , " Sir , the others  --  the highwaymen  --  will soon be returned . Had we best not ride ? ? " Grenville interrupted shortly . " Have done ! " He gave his bridle to the groom . " Stay here until I deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strode off toward the house . When he reached the wood rick near the entrance , he found that Colin was behind him . He grunted , but he did not send the boy back . Colin followed him around the house to the doorway where the lanthorn burned . " Where is the kitchen ? " Grenville asked in a low tone . " Right , " Colin answered . Grenville went inside quietly , threw open the kitchen door and banged on the door-frame with the hilt of his sword . " Entrance in the name of the law , " he shouted in a voice so terrible that Colin shrank back . The old woman dropped the ladle . The guide tried to get up from the bench , but Grenville laid the flat of his sword across his shoulders . " Truss him up , Colin . " He threw a bridle part on the table . " Stuff his mouth . I 'll deal with the crone . " The guide caught up a long knife , lunged viciously at Colin . Colin had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , fending off the thrust with his arm wrapped in his cloak . Twice the fellow thrust ; twice his thrust was countered . Colin struggled to free the dagger caught in his belt . The guide , with foul words flowing from his evil mouth , pushed Colin back until he stood at the open door of a dark room that gave off the kitchen . At last Colin got his dagger loose , but just as he did so the guide lunged again and this time pinked Colin in the shoulder . There was no pain , but blood began to drip from the right sleeve of his doublet . His dagger fell from his hand . The guide turned and rushed at Grenville whose back was turned while he dealt with the fighting , clawing woman . Colin cleared the bench in a flash and , before the guide had time to thrust the knife into Grenville 's ribs , caught him on the jaw with clenched left fist . The blow jarred him and he swayed . Colin kicked him in the groin . He doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hand . Colin snatched it from the floor . Before the guide could recover , Colin had his arms pinned behind him and a sleeve of his coat stuffed into his mouth . The woman  | fought on . She was stronger than one would think , but she too was soon tied up and gagged . " Out with them ! " said Grenville . " I will take them to Camelford and leave them with the mayor for a present . " He picked up a candle and looked into a room that opened off the kitchen . " As I thought  - -  bales of smuggled goods . Come . Out with you ! " He slapped the woman with the flat of his sword . " Tie them to the horses ' tails , " he told Colin . For the first time he noticed the blood on Colin 's sleeve . " Are you hurt ? " " Only a pin-prick . " " Well , if that 's all ? Secure now ? Let them trot along . Ride ahead and keep a sharp look-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in along Corbin 's track . " " You know the lay of the land , sir ? " " Aye , well enough . In an hour 's time we will be in Camelford , before dawn , and the sheriff shall have his men riding over the moor to catch the highwaymen before they waylay the wool train . " He looked at the guide tied to the tail of Colin 's horse , and the crone dragging along , well secured to the groom 's horse . He laughed . " I could have killed the fellow , but gaol is best . A little persuasion and he will tell the names of his fellows , and they will all lie in Launceston dungeon before another day . " They rode into Camelford as the first rim of light tinted the east . Grenville turned to Colin . " You did well , boy . I would not regret having you stand behind me in danger . " Colin was all but speechless at his master 's words . " Sir , oh , sir , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ask nothing more of God the Father ! " Grenville turned his searching blue eyes on the eager face lighted by the first rays of the rising sun . For a long moment their eyes met . Then Colin turned away . " Sir , I 'm sorry . I spoke without your leave . " Above his beard a smile indented the corners of Grenville 's firm mouth . " We shall see what the future brings , my lad . " He spoke to his horse . The other horses pricked up their ears and broke into a swift trot . Into Camelford they went , the two frightened captives running behind . Grenville rode to the square , stepped to the mayor 's house and pounded on the door with the hilt of his sword . " Wake up ! Wake up ! " he cried .  | A window was raised . A blond head appeared surmounted by a red night-cap . " Wake up , Mayor of Camelford ! It is I , Richard Grenville , and I bring you two prisoners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before God , what have you here ? " " Smugglers , and if you are quick and send your men by the Corbin trace , you 'll catch a netful . " The voices raised the porter . A sentry cried out . A sergeant came running across the square , pulling on his coat . Grenville said to him , " Take these rascals . A touch of the lash and they will spew out names . " The mayor , clad in robe but without night-cap , opened the door . " Step inside , Sir Richard . A bite of breakfast for you , sir . Your men will be taken care of at the barracks . " " Arundell 's groom may go with your servant . This lad is my squire . He 's been pricked in the shoulder . See to his wound . Then he will breakfast with me , Mr. Mayor . " He caught Colin 's startled glance . A smile came over his lips . " My squire , after the old manner . He has won his spurs this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quay at Bideford was alive with the town 's citizenry dressed in their best . April was at its pleasant prime . Gardens were abloom . A soft breeze blew in from the west up the Bristol Channel and the Torridge . The mayor , his aldermen and councilmen were aboard the Tyger , the ship that flew the Admiral 's flag , dining with Sir Richard , drinking toasts , making speeches . Half North Devon , great landowners , yeomen , artisans , had come to call a farewell and wish a cheery voyage to the adventurers . The men from the shipyard had laid off work . Shipwrights , caulkers , sail-makers , cord-spinners and sawyers were in holiday attire . Had they not built the ships , made the sail , tarred the decks and the ropes , and were they not entitled to an active part in the celebration ? Merchants of Bideford had their pride . They had furnished the stores to feed the voyagers , selected the implements , the seeds , the cookery and the crockery . The housewives held themselves proud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserves and dried fruits , breads and cake and other products of their kitchens . The ships that lay in Appledore Pool , the Roebuck , the Lyon , the barque Dorothy and the Virgin God Save Her , were trimmed with garlands of flowers which the young girls had made . They festooned the decks and cabins . Unseamanlike , the sailors whispered , but let the maids have their way . Tears would be shed as the ships crossed the bar  --  tears for young lovers , for sons , for husbands , who sailed out into the unknown Western Ocean . Let them make merry now and dance on the decks and in the market-place with gay whirling skirts and flaunting petticoats , with curls and braids tumbling , lips that smiled tremulously , bright eyes with tears close . Children climbed on rope coils and hung perilously over the side of the quay , or clambered down the stone water-steps to jump into small boats that filled the Torridge from Bideford out toward the bar . How brightly the sun shone on the little white town nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been chosen to sail ! How sad were the lads who  | must stop at home ! How enviously they looked toward the ships dressed in gay flags ! How jealous they were of those men who walked the quay with arms about maids ' waists , unashamed ! Cavalcades clattered down the streets , banners flying . Those dressed in light armour , riding fine horses , were the fortunate young men who were taking ship at Bideford  --  North Devon men and Cornishmen  --  old names , Arundell , Gorges , Stukeley , Stafford , Courtenay , Rowse and Prideaux . The people cheered and cheered , and the maids cast flowers , as the young cadets and their men rode by . They would go aboard the ships after the mayor and the burghers came ashore . The rector from Kilkhampton and the vicars from Morwenstow and Hallam were already on the flagship . At sunrise that morning they had blessed each ship , to cast out all evil and leave only good . When Sir Richard 's ships made rendezvous at Plymouth with those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony at the cathedral . But here the men had gone to early morning service at the chapel near . the bridge-head . They had knelt at the altar and partaken of the holy bread , each with his own prayer on his lips and in his heart . Lady Mary Grenville had said farewell to her lord the night before . The couple had stayed at Portledge , and she would not go farther , in spite of his protestations . " Tonight we are together for the last time , " she said as they walked down the wood path to the beach . " Tomorrow you will belong to Bideford , to Devon , to the Cornish people , who have come to wish you God-speed . You will belong to them . Tonight you will belong to me . " He put his arm through hers and clasped her hand . " My Mary , I would like to think of you watching my ship sail down the river . " " No , my dear , no . But I will ride to Hartland Point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see you out of sight as your sails carry you away . " He started to speak , but she silenced him with her , words . " Let me finish , my husband . Do not importune me . I am jealous . I can not share you , even with our dear Bideford folk or our friends . When you put foot upon your ship , you are the Queen 's man , with a great task , a heroic task before you . Tonight . . . " Her voice broke . They had come to the high cliff where the narrow path led down to the water of Bideford Bay .  | He held her close , kissing her lips . She broke away from him . " Let us walk down the path to the water 's edge , " she said . " I have a desire to dip my hand in the water that will carry your ship to the far ocean . " They walked across the shingle to the water 's edge . Mary stooped down , unmindful of her flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted them . She stood quietly , her eyes fixed on the west . Lundy Isle stood out clear , and the dim purple line that marked the shore of Wales . For a long time she stood with extended arms , the water dripping from her fingers . Richard watched her . She was like a Grecian priestess pouring libations to her gods . Perhaps she was . The thought came to him then that there were depths in Mary he had not fathomed . When he came home , they would be close , closer than they had been these years that had passed . They had been the children 's years . Now the children had grown or were growing to their own estate . He and Mary would be together . . . . She made a quick movement with her arms and cast the water into the bay . When he saw her face he took her into his arms . " My dear , " he said softly . " My very dear ! " The young folk rode down from Stowe . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though his father had explained to him a week before that he must go to Oxford , and promised that he could go out on another voyage . " This is only the beginning , " he had told his son . " There will be another and another voyage . Ships and more ships will be sent until the Queen 's colonies cover the whole of America . It will be only a matter of time until we force the Spaniards out of Florida and take over . So have patience . " " But the first one is the most important , Father , " John persisted . " No , my son , not the most important . The most important will be the one that survives . I have written to your principal at Oxford , telling him that I am committing you to his trust . That is a greater trust , John , than if I gave him my whole estate to administer . I want you to live as a gentleman should , and funds will be available for that purpose . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are to have dancing and fencing for gracefulness and recreation , but do not let these devices interfere with your studies . Decent and genteel recreations are good for exercise and health . You must be a scholar . Bernard has the learning ; now he must put his studies to  | practical use . I have already talked with him . He knows his responsibilities to the land . The Grenvilles have always taken their duties toward the land seriously . I will allow you eighty pounds a year , and ten a year for your servant . " John had asked him for Colin as his servant . " Colin will go with me on the Virginia voyage , " Grenville said . " Recently he saved my life , giving no thought that he was weaponless when he came to my aid in peril . When we return , I intend that he shall have tutors . He will be your companion , not your servant . " John was pleased at his father 's words . " Good old Colin ! " he cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell him today . As to the eighty pounds , John , that amount will defray your diet , your chambers ' rent , your clothes and your tutor . Do not write to your mother for money , for I have asked her not to send any . The amount is ample . " " Yes , sir . " " Now a last word of warning . Shun drunkenness . Drink your will , but be not drunken . Keep from drunken companions lest you share their ill repute and be utterly lost in my opinion . Again I warn you to keep within the compass of your allowance , for more you can not have . Remember that your family has certain standards and patterns of conduct . Do not lower yourself by being less a Grenville than your forbears . " One last word , my son . Present my service to your tutor . " He rose and laid his hands on John 's shoulders . " My dear son , I do beseech God to bless you and imbue you with wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them away with the back of his hand . His father pressed his hands deeper against the lad 's shoulders . " Be not ashamed of your tears . I find my own eyes clouding . " He had gone away . John , left alone , struggled to keep back the tears . Just then Thomasine came into the room . After one startled glance at him she backed away without speaking . " Damnation ! " said John softly . " Damnation ! The girl is always about , eavesdropping . She will laugh and tell the fellows that she found me blubbering . " For all he knew his father 's judgement was right , John could not help showing his disappointment now that the last day had come . The sisters , on the contrary , were in holiday mood , dancing on the deck of the Dorothy with John Arundell , Richard Prideaux , young Anthony Rowse of Bideford . Rise Courtenay joined them , and young Stukeley ,  | with several of the Denny folk from Orleigh Court . The girls had brought packets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Mary had stitched a standard bearing the Grenville clarions . Thomasine moved on the outskirts , sometimes walking along the quay . She was searching for Colin to give him the hosen she had knit , but she could not find him . She had been aided on heel and toe by Nurse Marjory , who seemed to have forgotten her distaste for her . Nurse Marjory herself had sent a fine packet of herbs to Sir Richard , herbs that were health-giving and medicinal . In truth everyone in the north of Devon had brought some gift . The cabins and below-decks were piled high with gifts . While the young folk were making merry , a solemn ceremony was taking place in the cabin . The worshipful mayor was in the midst of a speech as he presented to Sir Richard a great silver-gilt cup , richly chased , bearing the arms of Grenville . Though the mayor was chubby and red-cheeked , his face was now set to solemn lines , for the occasion was one of great solemnity . " In this year of 1585 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that Devon men will long remember . As you all know , the Grenvilles for many a generation have been overlords of Bideford . Now a worthy son of that ancient family sets his eyes toward a far land beyond the sea , so that he may bring honour and , later , trade to our city . A noble man , a gentleman of very good estimation both by his privilege and sundry virtues , is willing now to hazard himself on this voyage for the love he bears his kinsman Sir Walter Raleigh and for a disposition that he has to attempt actions worthy of honour . " Sir Walter enjoins him not to tarry in the country of Virginia , but to leave some gentlemen of good worth and a competent number of soldiers there to begin an English colony . " With him will go Sir John Arundell , Thomas Cavendish , Ralph Lane , Edward Gorges , John Stukeley , Edward Stafford , Philip Amadas , Thomas Hariot and divers other gentlemen and a sufficiency of soldiers . " I propose , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him so that he may , once each day , drink to Bideford a lusty toast . To the good voyage of each and sundry , that by the grace and kindness of the ever-benevolent God they may come safely on those foreign shores and as safely return to us ! But first , gentlemen , to our lady Sovereign Queen , God bless her ! "  | Toasts were drunk , as many as the names spoken , until the merchants of Bideford scarce knew when they left the ship or how they reached the quay . Thomasine wandered from group to group searching for Colin , with the packet containing the hosen she had knit for him clasped under her ann . A rude man tugged at her sleeve as she pushed through the crowd , whispering a lewd invitation . She snatched the arm away and went on . She did not even turn to heed him . She knew that only girls of the town walked alone , those strange creatures who lived in small huts near the river . She had looked inside a lout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , a half-dressed man lying on a bed . The gongs were sounding . The boats that had brought the mayor and his aldermen were going back to shore . She was close to tears when she ran into young John Arundell . He was at the water steps , ready to embark in a skiff that would take him to the Tyger . " John , John ! " she called out and started to run to the steps . John saw her and turned back . " All , my little cousin ! " he cried , clasping her hands . " Have you come to tell me farewell ? " He threw his arms about her and held her close . Then he bent and kissed her firmly on the lips  --  a sweet boyish kiss that had in it affection and some of the sadness of farewell . " Sweet Coz , be good and I will bring you a red Indian for a slave when I come home . Would you like that ? " Thomasine smiled up at him . She felt a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thrust the packet at him . " Take these . They are for you . Perhaps they will be welcome when the nights are cold in Virginia . " " Dear Thomasine ! Something you made for me ? This touches me deeply . " He kissed her again , this time with more ardour . The crowds about them smiled kindly . These partings were sad . Someone from the boat called , " Break away ! Break away ! " " I 'll write to you if occasion offers , " John promised , still holding her hands . " Write me and we will keep the letters till I return . And thank you , sweet Thomasine , for your gift . I shall treasure it because you thought of me while you were working . " She managed to smile at him , hating herself because she had not thought of him at all while she was knitting the hosen , but only of Colin  --  Colin who wore her brand in the palm of his hand ; Colin who hated her . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | to Stowe that she remembered the little message she had concealed in the toe of the hosen . Later from the deck John Arundell tried to discover Thomasine in the crowd on the shore , but she had disappeared . The distance between shore and ship widened as the Tyger began a slow yawing with the tide . The dear girl , he thought , the dear girl ! How beautiful she was , with her clouds of dark hair and her great dark eyes ! Why had he not sought her out these weeks ? What a fool he 'd been ! He tucked the hosen in a corner of his sea-chest . He would not wear them until he returned home so that Thomasine might see how he treasured her gift . The ship bell sounded and the bells on shore . Sails were hoisted , and the ship made ready for the turn of the tide to fall down river . The others of the little fleet would be ready in Appledore Pool to fall into line . A full complement of sailors lined the gunwales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man behind him holding his house banner . Each ship had its new broom to signify sailing . Crowds ashore sang and cried their God-speeds and farewells . The banks were gay with moving figures in bright dress . Scarfs and banners flew . Sir Richard , that man of equestrian stature , stood on the bridge beside the ship 's master , dressed in armour , wearing his helmet with waving plumes , its visor turned back . Ashore the young Grenvilles stood close one to the other , clasping hands , a small circle , away from the crowd : Bernard , tall and commanding , his father in younger years ; John more emotional , waving his hand aloft ; little Mary and the younger girls beside Madam Denny , in whose charge they were . They were strong in pride yet tearful . Mary turned away as the ship sailed past them . " Where is Thomasine ? " she whispered to John . " I have n't seen her all this afternoon . " John Grenville looked about him . " Nor I , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly girl ? Always running off by herself . " " Perhaps she thinks we do n't want her . Mother says she is shy . " Little Mary spoke anxiously . John said , " Now do n't begin worrying about Thomasine , Mary . She can fend for herself . " " But there are so many people , so many men in high spirits . They might  --  "  | " No fear , sister . That girl is like a wild cat with her claws . Did n't you see Tremayne 's face ? " He paused suddenly . " I 'm sorry , Mary . I forgot Arthur Tremayne is your betrothed . But he is a bit of an ass about women when he is in his cups . " Little Mary 's gentle face crumpled as though she were going to cry . " I know , " she said in a broken voice . " Ah , John , why is it ? Is it because I am not dazzling enough to hold his love ? " John patted her hand and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Men are like that . They like to stray a little . No harm in it . Arthur 'll be as good a husband as the next one . " But in his mind he wondered . They caught up with the others as they came to the gate of Grenville House . They entered the great hall in silence , as if a sort of pall had fallen on them . Indeed the heart of the house had gone from it . The core and centre had sailed away into the unknown . It was Bernard who broke the spell . He stepped into the place of the host . He was now the man of the house . He rang for a footman to take the guests from Orleigh Court to their rooms . " We will have refreshment in an hour , " he said as the girls went up the stair , led by Madam Denny . He spoke to John . " Have Ching send men out in the town to search for Thomasine . God 's truth , why must she cause trouble tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depar-ture ? " " God knows , brother ! Thomasine has little thought or care for anyone save Thomasine . No doubt she went home to Stowe with some of the yeomanry . So do n't worry . Have pleasure , brother . Let us have music and dancing when supper is over . Let us be gay , not sad . I am sure our father would wish it so . " " Perhaps you are right , John , but I worry about that girl . " " Do n't worry . If she is n't found soon , we 'll have the watch notified . But I 'm bound to think she is on her way to Stowe , sitting on the knee of some yeoman or lying in the back of a cart . " " Do n't be lewd , John . Do n't forget she is well-born . " " But badly reared , " John grumbled . Thomasine was indeed riding in the back of a cart , but not bound for Stowe . Instead , she was on her way to Launceston with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she had made friends at the quay . From Launceston she would find a way to get to Plymouth . She had time to spare to reach that haven before Sir Richard Grenville 's ships made rendezvous with the ships of Sir Walter Raleigh at  | Sutton Pool . Hanging about at the edges , her eyes and ears alert , she had heard things . The London men would be in Plymouth  --  Sir Walter , Sir Philip Sidney and the two scholars in the drab robes . London ladies and gentlemen would be in Plymouth , Dame Philippa among them , and perhaps the Countess of Pembroke . Wild thoughts ran through her head , wilder plans . She lay in the back of the cart on a bed of soft wool , the wool merchant 's fat wife breathing heavily beside her . She hugged herself close , her thin arms across her breast . She had escaped without anyone being wiser . She had two golden crowns in her belt , and the road to Plymouth lay open before her . She woke once . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet . Cassiopeia shone down on her . The old crone at Merlin 's cave used to call Cassiopeia her star of good fortune . She lay quietly , warm and comfortable , secure in the belief in her star . After a time she fell into a dreamless sleep . Ships built under Elizabeth were not beautiful , Grenville thought , as he stood on the bridge of the Tyger . He would like to build a ship after the Spanish style , all carved and gilded . Lundy Isle lay off , a purple blotch in the blue water of Bristol Channel  --  his own island , which he loved , although it gave him trouble enough . There was something in an island that always stirred his blood and caught his imagination . Lundy itself was a sort of haven , a protection for small craft , offering security for the little ships that navigated the Channel ; a holding ground where a ship might lie peacefully when the wind was blowing ; a pleasure to behold when a ship negotiated White Horse Race or had the ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no such problem in navigation . He had only to cross the bar . The tide served his ship well . The wind was just strong enough after they passed Appledore . There they had picked up the Lyon and the fly-boat Roebuck . The Dorothy , a small barque , sailed well and kept within easy distance . At the last Grenville had decided against taking the Virgin God Save Her . He would save her for the second voyage . The Elizabeth was at Plymouth with two small pinnaces , ready to rendezvous at Sutton Pool . Cavendish would master the Elizabeth and carry the London contingent . The bar was crossed . Clovelly lay snuggled against the cliff . Beyond  | lay the headlands and the long roll and power of the great ocean . Richard turned his glass on Hartland Point , on that great barren cliff which the Romans called the Point of Hercules . When they rounded it , he called out that they were coming into a new sea . The mystery of stern dark cliffs , the high promontory led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought : Hartland was a boundary between waters that were home and the unknown . Before him were the West and the terrors of deep ocean . As long as Hartland was in his vision , England was there , strong and steady , to hold him . The brisk wind filled the sails of the ships . Long rollers caught them . There was no storm , only another mystery of ocean . This would be their daily mead from now on . He gazed eagerly through his spy-glass . Mary was there , somewhere on that savage rock against which the waves thundered . His last link with home ! The rendezvous at Plymouth meant nothing to him . His farewell to England had been said among his own people at the North Devon port of Bideford . The swell of the ocean impelled them . The wind drove them south and west . The horizon dipped and rose again . On deck he watched the familiar coast . On the bridge he stayed until he thought he heard faintly the bells of Tintagel Chapel in faint farewell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admiral 's cabin in the Tyger . For an hour they had talked , trying to be prepared for every eventuality . " Accidents are a sign of incompetence , " Sir Richard told them . Ralph Lane sat by , against a port-hole , spending his time looking out the window or paring his finger nails with his dirk . Grenville paid no heed to his inattention , nor did Raleigh , who sat at the table by his cousin going over and checking the names of the men of the Roanoke Hundred . Seated on deck outside the door were the two savages Manteo and Wanchese , who had been brought to England by Captain Philip Amadas and Captain Arthur Barlow . Wherever they had moved a crowd had followed , but the Indians walked with the high heads of princes , which indeed they were among their own people , and made not to hear the comments of the people . They had learned to understand English well enough under the tutelage of an Oxford scholar while they resided in England at the expense of Sir Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they might see the Queen in all her magnificence and view the great concourse of people who rode and walked the streets of London . Their character was that of the Roman Stoics . They were expressionless when they saw troops march past Whitehall and when they visited the great abbey . Manteo became Christian , but Wanchese remained savage and was of moody disposition , speaking little , even to Captain Amadas . Simon Ferdinando , the Portuguese pilot , knew the way of the ocean from the Azores to the Florida coast , having gone with Captain Amadas . He promised now to lead them safely to Virginia waters . A boastful man , low-browed , with eyes that looked away , he was not trusted too much by Sir Richard . Thomas Cavendish , following Lane 's example , took small interest . Sir Richard , in good temper though his blue eyes were cold , picked up a paper he had prepared and read it aloud . " 1 . The admiral shall carry his flag by day and his light by night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorten sail by night , then he shall show two lights until he be answered by every ship showing one light for a short time . " 3 . Item . If the admiral , after shortening his sail as aforesaid , shall make more sail again , then he shall show three lights , one above the other . " 4 . Item . If the admiral shall happen to halt in the night , then he shall show light over his other light , wavering the upper light from a pole . Then shall all ships gather round the admiral . " 5 . Item . If the fleet should happen to be scattered by weather or other mishap , then so soon as one shall descry- another , he shall hoist both topsails twice , if the weather shall serve , and strike them twice again ; but if the weather serve not , then he shall hoist the main topsail twice and forthwith strike it twice again . " 6 . Item . If it shall happen a great fog to fall , then presently every ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , but if it be calm , then every ship shall hull , so to lie at hull until it be clear , and if the fog do continue long , then the admiral shall shoot off two pieces every evening , and every ship shall answer by one shot , and every man bear to the ship that is to leeward , so near as he may . " 7 . Item . Every ship shall hail the admiral every evening and then fall astern him while sailing through the ocean , and being on the coast shall hail him morning and evening . " 8 . If any ship be in danger , any way by leak or otherwise , then she shall shoot off one piece and presently hang out one light , whereon every captain shall bear toward her , answering her with one light for a short time . Then he shall put it out again thus to give knowledge that he has seen her token . " 9 . Item . Whensoever the admiral shall hang out his ensign in the main shrouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summons to council . " 10 . Item . If there happen any storm or contrary wind to the fleet after the discovery of land whereby they are separated , then shall every ship repair to their last good port , there to meet again . " There was silence after the reading while Colin passed a copy to each captain present . As they studied his paper , Grenville said , " Our course , agreed on by Sir Walter Raleigh , Captains Amadas and Barlow and Pilot Ferdinando , is to steer directly on the Isles of Canaries for rendezvous at Fuerteventura . Our second rendezvous will be at Cotesa , a small island hard by the Island of St. John de Porto Rico , where sweet water is to be had . Another rendezvous will be Isabela  | on the north side of Hispaniola ; and our final one , God willing , will be off Hatorask , into the harbour at Wococon , and so to the Island of Roanoke . " If every captain present understands these instructions , he will please affix his name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grenville turned to Cavendish . " Is all clear , Captain Cavendish ? " Cavendish glanced at the paper . " All is clear to a navigator , Admiral . " Captain Aubry asked , " Do our charts and maps coincide ? " Raleigh answered , " All maps and charts are identical . That has been checked and verified . " He turned to Captain Boniten . " That is correct , Captain ? " " Correct . " " Any other question ? " Captain Clarke , who had been with Sir Humphrey Gilbert on his ill-fated voyage , asked , " Is the entrance near the Cape of Hatorask very narrow ? Must each ship take pilot there ? " Grenville answered , " Yes , Ferdinando will see to the piloting . " Ferdinando spoke . " A dangerous passage that . It must be navigated by one who knows , else one 's ship may go aground and block the way for others that follow . Captain Amadas will tell you it takes skill . " He raised his brows and shrugged his shoulders suggestively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the work of ordinary navigation . " Amadas nodded . " We all but ran aground ourselves , Sir Richard . " He rose then and put his name to paper . The others followed in order . Thomas Cavendish , John Clarke , Captain Aubry , Captain Boniten , James Browewich and Sailing Master John Gostigo of the flagship Tyger . Lane got to his feet and looked at his round watch . " If you have no more need of me , Sir Richard , Thomas Cavendish and I will take boat to the Elizabeth . I am expecting a visit from Admiral Sir Francis Drake on my ship ere long . If you will pardon me ? " Grenville bowed . " We have finished with the business at hand , Mr. Lane . If the other gentlemen will remain , we will drink a toast to our safe voyage . " Cavendish said to Lane , " I will come to you shortly , sir . I would like to join this company of captains in a toast . " Grenville and Raleigh walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-boys waited , commensurate with the dignity of the Governor of Roanoke . As they crossed the deck , a sturdy redhaired  | man approached them , wearing a broad grin on his face . Sir Richard stopped suddenly . " By the eternal God , it 's Nugent ! " Pleasure showed on his face . Nugent saluted first Grenville , then Raleigh . " Walt , you remember Nugent , my seargeant-major who was with me in Ireland ? " " Yes , indeed , I do remember , " Walter Raleigh answered . " I remember every man who stood behind us those dark and bloody days . " " How come you here , Nugent ? " Sir Richard asked . " Sir , I was told in Belfast that you were sailing out on a great voyage of discovery . Sir , I came as fast as I could sail across the Irish Sea to Bideford . Sir , when I got there , they told me you had sailed . But I persisted , riding night and day . Sir , will you have me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nugent ? Aye , as the sun dawns . Come to my cabin . You shall serve us the farewell toast we are about to drink with our seven captains . " The toast was drunk out of the great gilt and silver cup which the worshipful mayor and aldermen of Bideford had given to Sir Richard , an earnest of their affection and admiration for their distinguished lord . " To the Queen ! To the Queen ! " the toast was drunk , and to Sir Walter Raleigh their patron , and to the seven great sea-captains , one after the other , and to England , blessed country . . . . Nugent served , Colin at his elbow . It was sunset before the captains left in high good humour , some with bemused expressions and eyes glassy . Thomas Cavendish had forgotten that Sir Francis Drake was supposed to be aboard his ship . " What of it ? " he said when he was reminded . Had he not been with noble friends , the seven captains ? As for Drake , he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake 's appear no more than a sail from Deptford to the mouth of the Thames . The pipes shrilled , water-boys brought up boats , and , clinging tightly to the ropes , the seven captains were rowed in all honours to their ships . The last one , bearing Cavendish slumped down in the stern , passed a barge bearing Sir Philip Sidney and Dame Philippa , coming aboard the Tyger to give their farewells to Richard Grenville . A slim youth , with clerk 's quills and sand , passed across the deck . When he saw Sidney 's barge , he moved quietly from sight behind the  | deck-house . Even as he hid himself from view , Colin stepped from the cabin . Wondering , he watched the lad move stealthily . A moment later the side-boys hurried to the companionway and piped the great lord , Sir Philip Sidney , representative of the Queen , over the side . Still curious , Colin walked around the deck-house and came on the lad suddenly . With an exclamation the clerk dropped the inkhorn and quills ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered curse he bent over to pick up the empty horn , his face and neck scarlet . " ' T is a strange habit that you wear , Mistress Thomasine , " said Colin . " One not suited to a young woman . Are you waiting to see Sir Richard or do you follow some Bideford lad ? " Thomasine found her voice . " I do not follow a Bideford boy . I  --  I seek adventure , the same as others on this ship ! " " Oh ! " His voice was harsh , his blue eyes were unfriendly . He started to leave . Thomasine caught at his arm . " Do n't go to Sir Richard , I beg of you . Promise me . " " Why should I promise ? A ship 's no place for a woman  --  or a girl . Surely Lady Grenville did not give her permission . " Thomasine looked down at the deck . " No , " she said sullenly . " No . " Colin spoke passionately . " You think of no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Thomasine leaned against the deck-house , dismay and discouragement on her face . Still , he had not said that he was going to Sir Richard . A seaman came up and saw the ink run down the freshly holystoned deck . " God A'mighty ! " he exclaimed . " You should wipe it up with your nose , Master Clerk . " But Thomasine had gone . Almost running she gained the clerks ' cabin , where an old man sat at a slanting desk hinged to the wall . " The ink , lad  --  where is the ink ? " he exclaimed querulously . " I could n't find any ink-horn , " Thomasine lied . " I 'll look later . ' See , there 's enough in the old horn , if we only water it a little . " The old man grumbled , while she fetched water from a vessel and dipped a small amount into the thickened ink . Stirring it with a quill , she exclaimed , " There ! It is as good as new , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head within six inches of the book . Praise God , he 's half blind ! thought Thomasine , but that he might see too much was not her great worry . Colin had recognized her , Colin who hated  | her . He would notify Sir Richard and she would be sent ashore , after all the trouble she had had to convince the officer that she was a clerk , and to arrange her sleeping accommodation in the cubby off the old clerk 's room . Misgivings crowded on her . How was she to keep away from the seamen ? The privy was below decks , and there was no recourse but the bucket behind the press where the files were kept . Something else occurred to her . What kind of men were these ? Were they like those lustful men she had seen on the moor ? Suppose they would discover her and put her ashore at the Canaries ? She began throwing her few belongings into the little case , preparing to go ashore . What a fool she was ! Why had she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She started for the gangway . She could go ashore with divers of the visitors and not be noticed . She hurried , pushing her way to the side , only to be stopped . " Hey , lad ! Wait your turn for a shore boat . " She stood behind a group , looking fearfully from time to time toward the Admiral 's cabin in the high poop of the ship . Alas , it was not easy to masquerade ! It might be readily done in a play on the stage , but how hard to accomplish in this world ! Presently she saw the door of the Admiral 's cabin open . Colin stepped out . He stood looking down on the deck below . His eyes sought the spot where he had encountered her . For some time he stood searching , his eyes roaming across the deck . She made herself small behind a group waiting to go ashore . Then the time came for her to go down the ladder into a half-empty boat . The watermen were ready to cast off when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were descending . To her horror she saw Sir Philip Sidney and Dame Philippa . Dame Philippa stepped down with as much grace as a worldly woman could muster who had her wide skirts held around ankles by a scarf . She was laughing as she took Sidney 's hand and stepped gingerly into the boat . They took seats with their backs to Thomasine . She was drawing a deep even breath when Colin appeared at the loading opening in the ship 's side almost even with the water . His eyes roamed across the boat . With a start he discovered her . She had pulled her cape over the lower part of her face . The action , on a warm April night , drew attention to her , rather than made for disguise . He stood for a moment looking at her with level eyes . Then he called loudly , " Give my farewells to the folk at Stowe , Thomasine. "  | " May he be damned ! " Thomasine muttered , for at his words Sidney turned . He , too , saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boat shoved off . The distance between her and the ship widened . Colin remained a dim shadow within the cavernous blackness of the hold behind him . The score was paid off , so he considered , for he smiled at her and made a gesture of farewell . Tears came to her eyes , which she whisked away quickly . Sidney made his way precariously to the bow of the boat where Thomasine was , and sat down beside her . He appeared not to see the evidence of tears . " Dame Philippa has given me orders to bring you to her side as soon as we land . " Then he smiled , a little twinkle in his eyes . " You must be swift and think up a good tale , my dear , a convincing one , for she will want to know why you are here , and not at Stowe , and why you are decked out in this outrageously becoming habit . " It was almost nine when Dame Philippa sent a servant to Philip Sidney to ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on Bideford Bar , with little privacy , but her sitting-room gave onto a private garden , which , in the moonshine , took on an illusion of beauty . They strolled down the brick path to the latticed arbour . The high walls were bright , planted with a hedge of may just breaking into tender bloom , for the season was early . They sat close on a stone bench and watched the ships ' lights in the dark water . " What did you say to the girl Thomasine ? " he asked after they had sat a time in silence . " What did she have in mind to do in that disguise ? Sail on the Tyger ? " " How did you guess ? " she answered . " It was a pitiful story . It surprised me beyond words . It goes back some months . " She told him of the night Richard Grenville had set a brand in Colin 's hand at Thomasine 's behest . " In spite of her hard shell she is soft as a little clam inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wakes at night and smells burning flesh . She tried , in her queer way , to make some amend , but Colin hates her  --  rightly , she admits . She thought she hated him . But it seems that the night of the Harvest Festival he won the right to kiss her . " Dame Philippa laughed softly . " He seems to have kissed her thoroughly . Then when she responded , he scorned her , she told me , and he said he loathed her . Instead of being prideful , she became the opposite  --  humble . She followed him , thinking to get aboard his ship . She succeeded . "  | " And he sent her back ? " Sidney questioned . Philippa laughed softly . " No , no . ' T is absurd , but amazing . She got on without difficulty , engaged as a junior clerk to help a half-blind old man . " Philippa began to laugh again . " It was the little cabinet . She had n't thought of that complication before . How was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex when it came to Nature 's easement ? " Sidney joined her laughter . " What a sad death to romantic adventure ! Where is she now ? " " I 've put her in your sister Mary 's room . I forgot to tell you that Mary and some Plymouth friends have ridden out to Buckland to visit Drake . " " And you did n't go ? " " No . I 'm like Richard . Drake may have done great things for England , but I do n't like him . Besides , at sunrise I propose to be standing on the Hoe watching Richard 's ships sail out of the Haven . " " I will be beside you , my sweet friend . " For a long space no word was spoken . Then he said , " It is decided . I am to go to the Low Countries . " She drew close . " Sidney , tell me that you have forgotten those evil omens . Surely you , who have so much to give the world , must live until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to great things , Philip . Forget those unhealthy portents . " " Dedicated ? I wonder if anyone is dedicated . Life , well lived with all one 's zest , may be full and overflowing before the years are advanced . We are young . . . and suddenly we are gone . " Philippa laid her hand over his , which rested on his silk-clad knee . " If you were three score and ten , you would still be young , for spring is in you . " " No spring till now , Philippa ? " He spoke softly , his hand clasping hers . " Philippa , you believe my doom lies this year ? I have convinced you ? " She shivered . He drew her to him . " I 'm alive now , my sweet , and it is spring . Let us live valiantly while there is time . " Even as his lips pressed against hers , the image of Sidney vanished . She saw instead a strong man , one who stood on the bridge of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . Then it was that she admitted to herself that she did not love Sidney . For him she felt affection and strong pity .  | It was Richard Grenville she loved . She released herself gently . His arms dropped to his sides . There was a sound of horses ' hoofs on the cobbled street outside the walled garden . A coach was arriving . A woman 's voice dismissing her coachman . " Let us go in , " Philippa said . " Your sister Mary has come from Buckland Abbey . " Richard Grenville sat by the table in his cabin , his writing-desk before him , and a candle placed beside him . A letter to write to Sir Francis Walsingham , and some final instructions to his steward Ching . Then a letter to Mary . Dearest Dear : Philippa will bring this letter to you , my last word before we sail . Had I known that they would come down from London , I would have been tempted to insist that you come too . But perhaps your way is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little beach , and the walk through the beechwood in the moonshine . . . of scarf waving as you stood on Hartland Point and watched our ships fade into the horizon . I can see you riding homeward . Our sons and daughters will watch over you diligently and well , tenderly too , and be close to you every day of my absence . Today was very fine . The Plymouth men and women did us great honour . This was Raleigh 's delight , this honour done to him , and he made a noble speech . I think there were tears in his eyes when he told them at the banqueting hall why he did not sail with us tomorrow . I felt his grief . He sorrows mightily . When he is in Devon , he loses the veneer London has put on him . He was among old friends who love him . Among all those who had come to dine us and bid us safe journey , no one in the room had a knife at hand ready to slip into his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked him well , for he grows in stature when he is free . Sidney is sad . He goes soon to the Netherlands under Leicester . If all goes well on that expedition , he will be made Governor of Flushing . He does not want to go . He told me he knows he will never return to England . Pray God his fears are groundless ! Mary Sidney is as wise and lovely as ever . But you will soon see her , as she plans to come by Stowe with Philippa on her way home . You will be pleased , I know . She is a woman of much wisdom and grace and deserves more of life .  | Philippa , I think , is sad for Sidney . A look passed between them that enlightened me of some secret understanding between them .. . or perhaps the candle flickered and I read something in their faces that was not there . I must have done . They will come to the ship after supper , to say farewell and take this my greeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD GRENVILLE On board the flagship Tyger 8th April , 1585 , By the hand of Dame Philippa I think the Plymouth people have not the gaiety our people have . They have more serious visages than we of the North . Every great man of this town , of South Cornwall , and the Stannaries was here today  --  St. Albans , Killigrew , Hawkins ( talking of a new voyage to the West Indies ) ? everyone but Drake . He nurses a cold at Buckland , so they tell me . Devil take the fellow ! I hope he has a bad cold . Cavendish and the Londoners arrived too late to be banqueted . Lane came early yesterday but chose to spend the time with Drake at Buckland , I 'm told . They expected Drake to sup with them tonight on the Elizabeth , but his cold prevented . Lane travels on Cavendish 's ship , which suits me well enough . Good night , dear wife . In the small chamber of the Guild Hall a scribe sat late , writing by the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plymouth . Fine beautiful writing it must be , as fine as ever the monks wrote in their missals . On this day , the Ninth of Aprill , 15845 . Sir R. Grenville , Knight , departed Plymouth with Seven Shippes and barker , for Wingane DeLoy where he carries one hundred men or thereabouts . The first day out the Admiral appeared on deck after the bos'n 's pipe had sounded assembly . A prayer was read . Then the Admiral , as he was now addressed , made a speech to his men . " We are now set on a hazard of prime importance . It is to the best interest of all to prepare ourselves for this task , so that we may be a credit to our Sovereign Queen and our country .  | " I have noticed , in time of war and whenever companies of men are gathered together , that the Devil dwells in idleness . Therefore I propose thatwe in this ship avoid idleness and dissatisfaction by having daily tasks set , and that we live rigidly and according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times , and that we prepare ourselves for the task of settling a colony . " To that end , I have detailed certain plans . " First , the ship 's complement will be divided into a number of companies , each with a captain . " These companies , or bands , will be in competition with other companies and bands  --  in drill , in fencing and in target practice . " A group of musicians will be formed to play and sing . " A company of players will be formed for the reading or acting of plays . " Teams will be organized in deck games and such games as are suitable on shipboard . " Books are available on soil and planting , on new methods of setting our orchards and fields , on minerals , botany , house-building , weirbuilding and the making of nets , for fishing will be a part of our industry . " A man skilled in any craft will write his name in the book and tell what craft he is interested in . " A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their personal wants . There will be one man assigned to each six gentlemen . The others will be put to more useful work when we go ashore . It is well , during this long voyage , for the young gentlemen to learn to do for themselves ; so this plan will be inaugu- - rated at once . " All tasks will be performed by all men , so that each and every one of you will know how to sail a ship and keep her ship-shape ; the tasks going in rotation , as assigned by the sailing master . " We will have daily prayer , which all will attend . An evening reading of the Scriptures will be held after supper but will not be obligatory . " That is all . At ease , gentlemen . " He handed the paper to Nugent , gave a nod to the bugler and walked to his quarters high on the poop deck , leaving consternation behind him .  | Far Horizon CHAPTER 14 THE young cadets of the county families soon found that the Admiral 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Nugent a man to trifle with . The second morning out drill began . A ragged drill it was . Orders were snapped out . Awkward lads responded as best they could . After two hours they were dismissed , a weary , bedraggled group . There were muttering and grumbling , but some stayed to watch the seamen go through their morning exercises and fire drill . John Arundell exclaimed , " By the Eternal , lads , if those uneducated bully boys can do that well , so can we ! I 'm going to read the manual and see what this business means . " " What 's the use of resisting discipline ? " Richard Prideaux remarked , flexing his aching muscles . " We are in for it , and we may as well admit it . We knew the Admiral is a hellion for discipline . I agree with you , John . Let 's get down to work . " Half a dozen others fell in with them . Philip Blount , who had joined the ship at Plymouth , and Anthony Rowse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by John Arundell , set themselves to learn drill . As an inducement to make their endeavour energetic , red-haired Nugent undertook to instruct them in sword-play . Since fencing was a sport , there was an enthusiastic response . Grenville had in his equipment a goodly number of basket foils , and every morning after drill was over there was an hour with the swords in which teams competed . This sword-play made up in a measure for the rigours of drill and was in the form of reward for good conduct . With swords Richard Prideaux and John Arundell were supreme , although Colin was a close competitor . With the cross-bow Colin led the ship , for not only was he the best marksman , but he could cut and feather the arrows . Many of the younger men , led by James Lacie , a South Cornwall  | man whose brother had sailed round the world with Drake , thought the bow old-fashioned and not worth competitive exertion . They wanted musketry . This Nugent would not allow , for , by order of the Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board the Tyger was not spent in idleness as on some of the other ships . The third day out the weather changed . The sky became overcast ; the wind quickened . By night a great swell caught the ship , followed at regular intervals by another and another . Many of the young stalwarts sought the rail with a quickness they had not displayed in drill . These swells kept on with no sign of a storm . The sky was clear of clouds at sunset , and the stars were visible all through the night . A double watch was set to keep contact with the six other ships , which were held in sight . The night passed without untoward incident and the morning of the fourth day dawned . The Admiral was on the bridge at daybreak . All the ships were in sight . He read morning prayer on the deck and thanked God for their preservation . But the great swells kept rolling , and the ships tossed over the swells ' tops and into the troughs . Half the Tyger 's company were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackadaisical to move from a spot near the rail . Colin and John Arundell swabbed decks side by side . They came upon a great dark spot that did not give way . Black John stood surveying it , his chin on the long handle of a mop , his two hands clasped around the stick . " If I did not know better , I would say it was a blot of ink , " he remarked to Colin . " It is a blot of ink , " Colin replied . " Thomasine dropped the inkhorn . " John looked up quickly , an expression of surprise on his face . " Thomasine ? You mean Thomasine Arundell ? Whenever was she here on the Tyger ? At Bideford ? " " No , at Plymouth . " " Plymouth ? " John 's expressive Gallic face showed his incredulity . Colin told him how he had recognised Thomasine in spite of the boy 's garments ; how he had called to her as she was leaving ship in the same shore boat that carried Dame Philippa and Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " John said . He thought of the fine hosen she had knitted for him . A pleasant thought came to him : Had she made the journey to see him ? " I wish I had seen her , " he said . Observing Colin 's expression , he  | hastened to add , " She 's my cousin  --  far distant kin , but still my kin . " Colin had nothing to answer , so he said , " We had better sand off this ink before inspection . " John agreed . " I think someone will always be cleaning up after that young damsel . I fancy she will go through life leaving a burning trail behind her . " The disk of the sun hung in a horizon of crimson . The dirty-grey sea rose and fell , the waves tumbling wavering lines of fleck and spume . Dark descended , a heavy sullen dark , with no moon to show if clouds that banked the red horizon would float near to break into wind and storm . Colin had watch at midnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He climbed the rigging to his station without thought of the rolling of the ship beneath . He moved swiftly and surely up the ratlines , holding by one hand . He knew he must be sure , for if he fell into that trackless sea , there would be no turning back to help him . That was the rule of the sea , a rule that would not bend or break . The bos'n had told it to them on the first day . It was the rule of the fishing boats of Cornwall , so it was no new thing to him ; but he saw some of the lads turn white when it was read . Aloft on the yard he felt his way to the nest , the dark sea below him , the heavens above him black , pierced by a few stars . Polaris was behind ; he was sailing away from the Pole Star to meet the Southern Cross . As the night progressed , the sky grew starless : the solitude closed in upon him and he was alone between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned at intervals to count the lights of the ships that followed . " One , two , three , four , five , six . " All was well . After a time the wind rose . The masts swayed and the topgallants cracked and whipped . He heard cries from below : " Let tack lines fly ! ... Let go ! . . Clew up ! . . . Let go all ! Now trice up and make fast ! ... Give us a haul ! ... " " One , two , three , four , five , six , " Colin called monotonously . The cries that reached him were harsh and urgent . " Furl topsails ! Bear a hand , men ! Have you iron feet ? " Sailors were clambering , reaching for shrouds . Curses rose like disembodied spirits , hurling imprecations upon slow and tardy men who , drunk with sleep , moved with the heaviness of beasts . " One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Up they came climbing ,  | ten men or twelve . The bos'n yelled below , as the wind rose . The ship reeled . The mizzen brace slackened , and the great sail thundered and roared . Hands in the waist sprang to haul taut the murderous canvas . The pressure of the blow put the Tyger on her side , careening . The yards buckled and bent . Colin clung to the shrouds . " One , two , three , four , five . . . five . . . five ! " he shouted . His voice blew off to leeward and did not go below . " One , two , three , four , five . " One ship was out . The wind was roaring . A rag of canvas split from a sail slow-furled slapped across his back , binding him to the shrouds for a moment , then slapped back . Again he shouted , " One , two , three , four , five . " Someone on the yards heard his voice . His words were repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " How many lights ? How many lights ? " " One , two , three , four , five . " Colon 's dreary repetition beat against the wind . Grenville shouted , " Make a wavering light above the light ! " The signal for the ships to gather round ! But how could they in this dirty night , in this foulest of storm and wind ? With chattering teeth and icy hand Colin clung to the lines , straining his eyes for six lights  --  but the sixth light was lost . Black night and starless . Passionate men fighting a passionate sea . Where had he heard those words ? Above the wind sounded the boom of a deck piece . Now only one light shone on the Tyger . And on each of five ships one light answered .. The wind beat them until the first streak of dawn cut through the heavy darkness . Grey was the sea and grey the sky , with only a streak of yellow lying along the eastern horizon . His eyes smarting with - wind that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . " One , two , three , four , five ? " his cry was repeated on the deck below . When full dawn came they knew it was the Elizabeth , Thomas Cavendish 's ship , that was missing . As light came and mountainous seas subsided , the Admiral had his ensign run up in the main shrouds to call the captains aboard the flagship . A soft breeze wafted up that seemed to bring the southern lands to them . The sun was well above the horizon when relief came and Colin , stiff and weary , called his last report before he climbed down the ropes to the deck . " Sun up . Ships Roebuck , Dorothy , Lyon and the two pinnaces . Elizabeth , Thomas Cavendish captain , missing . "  | On deck Colin met Richard Prideaux , still a livid green from his late sea-sickness . " The Admiral wants you on the bridge , " he told Colin . " He is in a wry mood because of Cavendish 's ship . " " Thank you . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wait to freshen up ? " " Best go now , " Prideaux said . " He 's been up all night like the rest of us . God , what a storm ! I could have stood the weather if it had n't been for Lacie making great tales about the storms his brother encountered when he sailed round the world with Drake . And John Payne laughed at the sea-sick lads . He thinks himself superior ' cause he sailed with Hawkins in ' 64 . They laughed at us , said we were lubbers . I tell you , Colin , they sickened my stomach as much as the sea did with their boasting . " Colin said frankly , " I was scared . I thought the mainmast would touch the waves . I wondered what would happen if the rope that bound my middle gave way , and I fell into a huge wave . Were you scared ? " Richard Prideaux laughed . " I was too stomach-sick to think of anything but belching bile . I do remember wishing I had n't drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated behind a table in his cabin , a pile of papers in front of him . He was talking to Sergeant Nugent when Colin knocked at the open door . He signalled for Colin to enter , and went on talking . " We 'll know more about it when the captains come aboard . I ca n't think how Cavendish got so far away , unless he tried to sail out the storm . " Nugent said , " Admiral , he may overtake us when we reach the Canaries or at Dominica . " Grenville 's lips were drawn to a thin line . " I wo n't wait one day at Fuerteventura , Nugent . There 's something untoward in this . I would not put it past Lane to order him to take another course so he might reach St. John 's in Porto Rico before we do . " Nugent had a homely freckled face , usually smiling except when he drilled his men . Now he put on his drill face , severe and firm . " I na like Master Lane , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to show his authority as Governor , sir . As long as we are at sea , you as Admiral give the orders . When we get to Roanoke he will be the Governor and give orders . " Grenville said shortly , " When we arrive at Roanoke  --  and not before . "  | Nugent left then , and Grenville spoke to Colin . " What was your watch last night ? " " Sir , I was aloft twelve to sunrise . " He did not say that it was well after dawn before he was relieved , that the mate had forgotten him in the excitement of the blow . The Admiral looked at him , but Colin had the impression he did not see him . Grenville 's face was stern  --  his habitual expression ever since he had come aboard the Tyger . It was no wonder he had acquired the name of disciplinarian . Colin waited . Looking through the door , he saw the sailors at work in the shrouds ; he watched the water blinking and sparkling in , the sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had passed the stormy Bay of Biscay . Strongshouldered men were setting sails , singing , while the mate watched . There was a pleasant wind after last night 's gale . Grenville spoke abruptly . " Can you compose a letter and make a fair copy ? " " Sir , I think I can , if I know what I am to answer . " Grenville pushed the papers toward him . " Take these . There is a table in the next cabin . If you do the work to suit me , I will count you a scribe . That will clear you of deck work . " " Sir , I do not mind deck work . " " There are others to do such tasks . Few I can trust with this . " He laid the mass of papers in Colin 's hand . " I do not promise it unless your work be good . " Colin went out the door and into the adjoining cabin . As he passed along he looked at the deck below the poop , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mate 's voice came clearly : " No , this wo n't do . See how you 've let the water lie with edges showing dirt between clean strips . The deck must be as clean as a cook 's deal table . Get stones , men . On your knees , and make it clean . This spot ! It looks to me like ink  --  but who would be casting ink on a ship 's deck ? " He passed into the cabin and closed the door . He seated himself at the table , arranged pen and sand and found an ink-horn . Then he read the first letter . It was from Blount of Montjoy . Colin knew him , the father of the blue-eyed , bright-haired lad Philip , who had joined the ship at Plymouth . My honoured friend : This will be put in your hand by my first son Philip Blount . I pray  | you do listen to his pleas and allow him to go aboard your ship under your flag . I had hoped ere now to have Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the amenities and such instruction as befits a lad coming into man 's estate . For no one in all Cornwall or in all Devon can so instruct youth in the responsibilities of knighthood as you . I would have desired to have him with your own sons and with your wards Prideaux and Arundell . When I was about to ride to Stowe to make my request , I heard of your voyage . After Philip heard , there was nothing but talk of Virginia from his lips . So do , my old and trusted friend , carry him with you in your ship . Your sincere friend , BLOUNT To my loving friend Admiral Sir R. Grenville on board Her Majesty 's Ship Tyger , lying in the Pool , Plymouth , Devon . Third day of April , 1585 Colin looked at the back of the letter . The Admiral had scribbled a few notes : " Yes , will do what I can to instruct son along with other young gentlemen . Instruction in deportment , discipline , small-arms , swords , etc. , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard men to uphold her flag in the New World and on the seas . " Colin pulled up a three-legged bench and began to write . At first the groans and creaking of the ship 's ribs cut into his consciousness , causing him to blunder , but he persisted , though at times he could scarce keep his eyelids from falling . Men came and went , shuffling along the deck , but no one opened the closed door . After a time it grew stuffy and he prized the cabin window open a few inches . The air was balmy and soft against his cheek . He heard the alarm for midday meal , but he did not dare to leave without permission . He worked on . Next came a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham describing the sailing , the conduct of the crew , the storm , Cavendish 's missing ship ... . " We will have well-disciplined young men ready to occuply sundry rich and unknown lands . I shall have opportunity to send this by the captain of some English ship at the Canaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home-coming ship or two in the Canaries . The post will be sent from there . The sunset gun sounded . Sir Richard had long since sent his captains back to their vessels before he thought of Colin and the task he  | had set him . He walked to the cabin and opened the door . The boy sat at the table , his head pillowed on his crossed arms . He was sound asleep , but on the table beside him , weighted down by a bit of an iron bolt , was the pile of letters . The Admiral glanced through the fair copies , and a pleased smile softened his lips . There was a gleam of joy in his steady blue eyes as he looked at the tousled blond head resting on the rough brown cloth of the doublet . He nodded his head in appreciation . He spoke . Coming quickly awake , Colin jumped to his feet and stood at attention . Grenville said , " You have done the task to my satisfaction . Have your kit moved here as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribe and share these quarters with John Arundell . " He left the cabin without hearing Colin 's stammered words of thanks . On the fourteenth day of April they fell with Lanzarote and Fuerteventura , Isles of the Canaries . The night before , the sea was filled with strange lights within the water , as though St. Elmo 's fire lay all about them ; the ship 's wake streamed with fire ; and dolphins broke water , leaped into the air and plunged back into the burning fire . The men crowded the rails . Some , frightened , protested it was Satan 's fire following them . Old seamen such as Lacie and John Payne scoffed , said it was always so in these blue waters of the islands . But many turned their heads and hurried below to say their prayers , lest evil befall them . The whole day they stayed on Fuerteventura playing at games , talking to the inhabitants , loading fresh-food and sweet water . At night they anchored off the shore , well prepared to make sail quickly if a Spaniard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sunrise gun they made sail and heaved anchor . By noon they were far off the islands , sailing westward toward San Domingo . With good winds and God 's will they would reach it in four weeks . There were nineteen or twenty men seated on the after-deck where the cook had set up his cooking apparatus , made of a rectangular iron flooring with a gallery of iron six inches high for siding . Pots were suspended above the charcoal heat . The men were finishing their meal when Colin came with his wooden platter and pewter mug to get his share . Cook Nicholas was a grim-faced German who had been picked up at Plymouth , where he had been in the stocks on a minor charge . He said , " Food 's about  | gone . " He grumbled as he scraped the stew from the bottom of one of the pots . " You should come on the hour , yes ? Then you would have fish , fresh pulled in by me from my lines that drag behind . " " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread on the point of a knife . He moved to the edge of the circle and sat down , his legs folded under him . Lacie was in the midst of an engrossing talk , so that no one bothered to glance up . " Sir Francis Drake 's men are tough and hearty , and Sir Francis Drake 's as bold as a pirate . Why , my brother Edward said they 'd kill and fire a village or a town , and pillage after , and the crew would get its rightful share . Once my brother went ashore with Captain Drake down at Port St. Julian , near Cape Horn , and there they found a gibbet already built . They hung some of the rude savages for an example , because they did n't bring baskets of corn . Aye , and the Indians then did come running with corn and other provender and laid it at Drake 's feet . It do n't pay to be mild-mannered with savages . " " I think that is a disgusting tale , " Richard Prideaux said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His voice was insolent . " And what would our fine gentleman Prideaux have done in like case ? " " I 'd have paid for the corn , " Prideaux answered . " That would have been fair . " " In English shillings , I 'll be bound . " " No , in trade goods  --  something the savages needed . " " Hm . I see . This is n't a venture , it 's a christening mission we 're on . " Some of the listeners snickered . Prideaux 's boyish features reddened . Lacie turned his back . " Aye , and that 's not all . When they were down by Magellan 's Straits , it was brought to Drake that one Thomas Doughty 's actions were not what he looked for in a seaman , but tended rather to mutiny or disorder . In such case the success of the voyage would have been at hazard . So the captain called the company together and told the story of Doughty and brought out evidence . Now Drake was precious fond of Doughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way when a voyage is at hazard : So he took vote of the company and it was for death . " But Drake did everything according to the law of England . He even requested our minister Mr. Fletcher to give the poor wretch Communion , and Drake himself took Communion with him on his knees and allowed him to take leave of all the company . And Doughty , with a prayer to the Queen 's Majesty  --  he was a quiet sort ? laid his head quie ly on the block .  | " Then , that being over , Drake made speeches to the company . praying for unity , courage , obedience , love and regard for the voyage . And in contentment every man went about his business . " Lacie waited a moment , then added , " So you see what a captain Drake is . " " We 've a great captain ourselves . " James Skinner , a stern-faced lad of twenty-two with a powerful body , broke in . " My father told me what a mighty man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he went against the Sultan in Hungary . Devon men were all valiant on the plains of Hungary : Champernowne of Dartington , William Gorges , Thomas Cotton and Philip Budockshide . They all fought bravely , and they were young  --  younger than we are . They fought with fortitude like men born to arms and not to idleness . That is what my father said . " " No doubt your father spoke true , " Lacie said . " I 've no interest in land fighting . ' T is the sea that shows a man 's stomach and liver . " No one answered . Perhaps each youth bethought himself of last night , and many of them wondered if they had stomach for the sea . Colin listened but said nothing . He saw in Lacie a man to cause dissatisfaction if he wished . Lacie got up and flexed the muscles of his powerful arms and shoulders . " Who 's for the dice ? " he said , looking about the group . Half a dozen rose . " The dice and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new worlds for gold , for praise , for glory , ' as Drake says . " " The words were Sir Walter Raleigh 's , " Colin found himself saying . Lacie turned quickly . " Who says I lie ? " " No one , " Cohn answered . " You are mistaken , that 's all . " He put his trencher on the deck and rose slowly as Lacie strode toward him . " Who are you , and what name do you bear ? " Colin stood erect , eye to eye with Lacie . " My name is Colin , " he said quietly . " Colin what ? " " Colin . " " Ah , a king or a prince who bears but one name , or a " He paused . He heard a low sound of protest from the company . " Have done , Lacie , " a voice called . " The lad 's right . ' T was Sir Walter who penned the words . " " Well , mayhap . I 'm no such scholar . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks the new worlds . " He strode away with his satellites behind him . Prideaux edged closer to Colin . " He 'd have bashed you in another second . What a forearm he has ! He 'd have put you on the deck in an instant . " Colin plunged his trencher and cup into the bucket the cook had set out for the purpose . " I 've seen bullies among farm lads , " he answered . He turned and walked down the deck , but not before he saw admiration reflected in the eyes of the remaining lads . It was a warming thought and not undeserved , for he had felt no fear as Lacie faced him . Rise Courtenay overtook him at the foot of the companionway ; a quiet fellow , Courtenay , and modest for all his great lineage ; he was descended from the Earls of Devon , though the last earl of their name was dead , and the inheritance had passed into the hands of women . ' " You are right , Colin . I know the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He misjudged in the beginning . I saw him glance at your shoulders and appraise your strength . You are strong , are n't you ? " " Mayhap strong enough . " " Ah , that is good ! But here come Sir Richard and his man bearing the great drinking cup . ' T is sundown , and time for the company to toast the Queen . " Colin liked the ceremony . Each night as the sun hung on the western verge , the cook ladled out every seaman 's portion of ale . All hands on deck waited , the Admiral , Sir Richard , standing among them . His man waited beside him , holding the Bideford cup filled with sack or ale or sometimes Portuguese wine . As the sun dipped , he spoke the words in a ringing voice that could be heard to the deck below , " The Queen and the Realm ! " and the toast was drunk midst shouts and cheers . The cup passed around among the company and each man had his turn . Then the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel , it was placed in Sir Richard 's sea-chest which was pushed under his sleeping bed . Tonight the sun was red , and the clouds that hung over the horizon took on its glory . The gentlemen quietly returned to their places abaft the mast . The seamen went forward . That was the rule . Colin thought , But for a trick of fate I would be forward . Yesterday he had  | been , and now he found himself in quarters next to the Admiral ! He thought of Dame Philippa and blessed her , for was it not she who had taught him to draw words prettily as any monk ? He stood looking at the water in the brilliance of its evening colors  --  blue of indigo , pink , lavender and flame , like the clouds . They were deep into southern waters . He turned and made his way to his cabin on the poop . There he found Black John Arundell spreading out his clothes on a berth . Richard Prideaux turned from the port to greet him . " Sir Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rise Courtenay 's yet to come . Four of us share . But we must go our way on the deck when you start to scribble . " They were laughing with merry eyes and lips . " Gad , is it agreeable to leave that stinking place , where rats move about as men , and men as rats ! " Prideaux paced about uneasily , not speaking . Arundell looked at him , a significant glance , as Colin set himself at the table . He noticed new books were piled there , vellum-bound , and one in red morocco . Arundell said , " By the Admiral 's orders we are to keep books together . I do the log and stand beside the helmsman , and with the navigator when he views his charts , and set all down . You are to keep a quire of the doings of the ship 's company and the seamen , and write the weather and whatever befalls day or night , so that we have record . " Colin nodded , liking the idea well . Prideaux began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who joins us here , will keep record of winners in sword-play and drills . In all , we will be the honourable company of scribblers . " They all laughed , being young and in fine animal spirits . " This for the first month , then there will be a change . A toast to the first month ! " Richard Prideaux continued . " Let 's seta record for the men who come after us . No blots . No blots . Clean paper and .. . What a record for fire-eating venturers ! " They laughed again . Arundell said , " Dick , you are to " He paused . Prideaux glanced at Colin , already at work with papers . He hesitated , but Arundell kept nodding to go ahead . " Colin , my lad , we want to have talk with you . " Colin glanced up , surprised at his tone . " Yes , serious talk , but hang it , it 's monstrous hard to say ! " " Go ahead , " urged Arundell . Prideaux looked one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged ahead . " It 's about your name . You know you 've  | always been Colin , since long ago when we came first to Stowe and we used to play together with bow and arrow and wooden swords . " " And you taught us hawking , " Arundell broke in , " and to ride a moor pony  --  remember ? " They stopped and glanced at him questioningly . Colin said nothing . He looked first at one , then the other , a steady inquiry in his blue eyes . " Oh , Phoebus ! " said Richard . " It 's this way . You ca n't go about being Colin , just Colin , now that we are out in the world . It was all right at Stowe , anyway ! He will make something of it , something to stand in your way . We wo n't have it . We 've talked it over . We have decided you must have a name , and a good one , for you are a good fellow . " They paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a withdrawn look on his face and in his eyes . " Hang it , a good name with something behind it ! So we 've decided it must be either Arundell or Prideaux , whichever you choose . " Still Colin did not speak . He could not . His heart was in his throat . " Wo n't you choose ? Then we 'll draw lots . We 've already written our names on cards . Come , Colin , draw one , and whichever you draw is your name . " Colin found his voice . " You are good , but I ca n't do that . ' Whatever will your people say ? A name ca n't be thrown about , one to another , like that . " " Why not ? " Arundell spoke impatiently . " Why not ? There 's some law , I suppose . We can invoke it when we go home . Just now you want a name to write down in the ship 's book . I hope you draw mine . I 'd like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Prideaux is a good name added to Colin . Come now . " " It would n't be lawful , " Colin protested . " Come ! Do n't be a dunce . Draw , man , draw a name ! " Colin rose slowly to his feet , his eyes fixed on the door . The two boys turned and saw the Admiral standing in the doorway . How long he had been there , they did not know . His face was stern , but his eyes were twinkling . " Young gentlemen , " he said , advancing into the room , " your kind intentions do you honour . As you say , you both have names of high value , but you are too late . Look in the list of the company of adventurers and read aloud what you see written . "  | John Arundell , standing nearer the great volume , turned the pages until he found the place . " Colin Grenville , " he read , " Colin Grenville . " The Admiral did not look at Colin when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all according to law . That was attended to at Plymouth . The papers were taken to Stowe by Dame Philippa for Lady Grenville to sign . By this time it is entirely legal . " He placed his hand on Colin 's shoulder for a second and left the room before the boy had found tongue . " Jesus ! " John Arundell exclaimed . Richard caught Colin 's hand and pressed it . Colin did not move . He stood white and shaken , looking at the page before him . The first thought that came to him was that Dame Philippa would be pleased . A second later he saw the mocking face , the impudent dark eyes of Thomasine . She would laugh , laugh , laugh . Well , let her laugh , damn her ! He would prove himself as strong , as stalwart a Grenville as any of them . When he looked up he was alone .  | Tropic Isle CHAPTER 15 THE small Spanish horses were restive and giving trouble to the men who were endeavouring to load them onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke halter and got away . This angered Grenville who was watching the loading from the bridge . He sent his cabin boy for Colin . " Go ashore and show those men how to handle animals , " he said . " I want the mares handled gently , else we shall have wild , untamable animals on our hands . See that the kine , bulls , goats , swine and sheep are kept in pens until the tide turns and we move closer in shore . It is unfortunate that we did not bring sheep-dogs from Stowe to do the work . " " Sir , I brought my dog Hubba . Do you want me to work him ? " Grenville nodded without taking his glass from his eye . " Damnation ! They will ruin those horses . " He lifted his voice and shouted to the mate , " Have done . I 'm sending a man ashore to look to the animals . " To Colin he said , " Tell the bos'n to have a sling made , strong enough to swing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the Spaniards have a float we could borrow . " Grenville turned on Colin , his eyes blazing . " Christ ! Do you think I 'd ask a favor of a Spaniard ? " He glared at Colin . " Get them on board without help . I want them loaded before I send a boat around the island for salt . Bring me your quire before you leave . I want to see what you have recorded . " Colin left quickly . He encountered John Arundell outside the door of their cabin . " The Admiral wants you at once , " he said with a grin . " What 's his humour ? Is he chewing glass or beating up furniture ? " " No , but he 's wrathful . I think it 's because our men are stampeding the animals and making a display of their ignorance before the Spaniards . " " No doubt . I do n't like it myself . " Black John looked shoreward . " There must be a hundred of them sitting around watching . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their silly mouths are smirking .  | Judas Iscariot ! I could put the lash on those bungling yokels . " He turned . " What does he want of me ? Will he skin the hide off me with his tongue ? " " He wants the stockade made strong enough for defence in case they should attack in force . For all they pretend friendship , he does not trust them . " " Christ ! I know nothing of building a stockade . Tell me how , Colin . There 's a good fellow . I 'm too liverish today to stand a tongue lashing . I 've had Nugent on my neck since early morning . The drill manual wo n't stay in my head . " " Remember how we drove strong saplings or stakes into the ground and laid others across the top , lashed together with vines or thongs ? " " Yes , yes . " John 's dark eyes brightened . " Yes , of course . Heavy uprights at the corners where sentries can stand . Right ? Thanks . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And not waiting for Colin 's answer , he walked quickly toward the Admiral 's quarters . Colin went into the hold and got Hubba , who was tied to a stanchion . The dog barked when he saw Colin , short , happy barks , nuzzling his cheek against his master 's hands and licking at his face with red tongue . " Easy , Hubba . " Colin rubbed the great white ruff gently . " Easy . We 've work to do . " He found the bos'n on the after-deck and inquired about a sling . " We 've got such already , quite strong . I told the mate , but he would have none of it . He thinks he can lighter the animals over on a pontoon . A stubborn mon is the mate and will take no telling from me . " He spat copiously over the rail , a gesture of silent contempt . Colin said , " The Admiral has ordered me to get the animals aboard . He says they are to be slung . " A slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin 's words mightily . He had an old feud with the mate  --  not only a personal feud but the inherited feud of centuries between mates and boatswains . " Aye , sling them we will . " He winked a bleary eye at Colin . " I 'll be ready with the derrick windlass and sling by the time you get them alongside . You 'll be wanting A net for the small animals  --  sheep , kine and swine ? They work easy in a net . " " You 're right , Bos'n ; a net also . " " Aye , aye , sir . Just be giving me the signal when you want to hist they . "  | " Right , Bos'n . " Colin got into a boat , carrying Hubba . The dog struggled at first , but he soon was quieted by gentle words from his master . On shore he found everything in confusion . Half a dozen men chased squealing swine , some escaping to the woods , others running down the beach . " May God damn all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a lean black pig that had got away . " They 've greased the beasts . " He looked at his hands . " Fall on them ! " Cohn cried as he made his way toward the glowering mate who was cursing and swearing at men and animals indiscriminately . Sweat ran in rivulets down his dusty cheeks . He had stripped off his jerkin and was naked from the waist up . Sweat beaded his face and his hairy chest and back . " God damn all swine ! " he muttered , mopping his face with the back of his dirty hand . Colin said , " The Admiral says for me to take over . " The mate glared at him . " Take over and welcome . How can I move animals with a lot of greenhorns like these ? " " I 've brought my dog . He 's trained , " Colin said , repressing a smile . The mate grunted and walked off . Colin called three men who were standing knee-deep in water , looking after swine that ran down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mares and stallions were galloping up a narrow path that led to the high land . A rough pen had been set up , made of driftwood and stubs stuck into the sand . " Stand between the pen and the water , " Colin said to the three men . " My dog will run the animals in . Then you can throw a gate across the entrance . " Whistling to Hubba , he made his way up a path and came down to the beach beyond the stampeding animals . Hubba was barking , his great plumed tail wagging from side to side . He kept looking at his master , waiting for a signal . When it came , he began to work the excited kine toward the pen . With sharp barks and quick short plunges at the heels of the recalcitrant animals he headed them along the beach . Colin turned his attention to the horses . Some had run toward the marsh , pursued by a dozen men . He must reach them before they entered the bog . The smaller animals were moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen . He waited until they were all in . Then he whistled to Hubba and walked along the beach . Ankle-deep in sand , he made slow progress . The marsh lay three or four miles from the stockade that Sir Richard had had built when they reached the Bay of Moskito in the Island of St. John de Porto Rico a week before . The Admiral had no intention of being at the mercy of the Spanish there on the island . He was taking no chance of treachery . They had seemed friendly enough . Upon the arrival of the ships they had come down carrying white flags to show their peaceful disposition . They had made signs of parley . Sir Richard had sent out two men to parley , Edward Stafford and Philip Blount . The Spaniards were pleased when they found they spoke their language , and brought greeting and inquiry from the governor of the island . But they made protest against the company for occupying their land and fortifying on it . The two Englishmen sent word to the governor that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only long enough to build a pinnace . The messengers told them that their governor was a man of proud humour , and they did not know whether or not he would permit trespass on their land . Stafford had replied that their Admiral also was a man of proud humour and that he had falcons of power and he proposed to stay on the land as long as he pleased and would sail at his own convenience . The two men had come back , and the Tyger 's men and those of the other ships built a makeshift stockade , where they stayed at night , keeping a strong sentry . In the morning they felled trees and set about building the pinnace . A river ran at one side and the whole compound was surrounded by forest , excepting on the sea side . Three days later eight or more horsemen had come out of the woods half a mile away . They sat on their fine caracoling horses , their splendid armour glistening in the hot sun . Sir Richard sent ten armed men marching along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and rode away . Three days after that a great excitement had come to the company . The look-out discerned a sail and sang out , " Sail ho ! Sail ho ! " Bare feet pattered on deck as men and officers ran to look . A Spaniard ? A Frenchman ? What ship lay in the offing ? Signals were called among the ships , and the Admiral wakened from his siesta ( as the Spaniards  | put it ) . Spaniard or Frenchman or war ? In either case an enemy . Sir Richard studied with his glass , waiting . An order went from ship to ship : " Make ready to hoist anchor . " For it was ever the humour of the Admiral to be first to attack  --  a sturdy attack was the best defence , he had frequently told his captains . " Let the enemy do the guessing while you do the manoeuvring . " Larger and larger grew the sail until at last he discovered that it was Master Cavendish 's ship that sailed toward them  --  lost since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies of each ship had shouted for joy , thrown caps into the air and danced on the deck . A gunner fired off the ordnance  --  a welcome shot that sent some onlooking Spaniards fleeing for safety into the wood . There had been toasts and gaiety far into the night , so glad were Cavendish 's men to be at the rendezvous in time , and so glad were Sir Richard 's men over the reunion . Sir Richard and Master Cavendish had foregathered with the captains in the Admiral 's cabin to plan and give thanks , but Master Lane did not come , offering as an excuse that he suffered from ague . Of the men , those more moderate in habit had contented themselves with talk and the swapping of yarns . But now as Colin ran along the beach he saw evidence of wilder jollity . Many of the company had drunk too much and were stretched out on the sand . He noted with satisfaction that none of these were from the Tyger . The Tyger 's men were too well disciplined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leg irons . At length Colin came close to the horses . In order to get beyond them he must clamber up the low cliffs and go through a forest . The marsh lay ahead . He planned to get behind the mares before they reached the quagmire . Two of the company joined him , young Allyn , whom he had known at Stowe where his father was one of the Grenville tenants , and James Skinner . He was glad of their company , first because he did not know whether Spaniards were hiding in the woods , and then three were better than one to fan out and turn the horses . It was a full hour before the mares were stopped . One of them was gentle enough for Colin to vault to her back and drive the others before him . Hubba skirted the woods along with the men and kept the horses running toward the rough pen . The loading progressed in a more orderly fashion now . The horses were driven onto a pontoon . Plunging to their knees in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Strangely enough , once the slings were secured about their bodies and the blindfolds  | on , they made no protest even while they were swung out over the water and into the loading down in the hold of the ship . The kine and swine squealed endlessly and the sheep gave frightened bleats as they were cast into the nets and made the trip above the water . It was sundown before the task was completed . " ' T is enough to drive a man wild , " Lacie remarked . He was waiting to go aboard , standing in the water while a servant scrubbed out the boat . The frightened animals had left many tracks behind them , and the smell of urine was strong and nauseating . " They 'll make the ship stink like a prison ship , " Lacie continued . " Why do we have to take a shipload of these damned animals ? I thought this was a ship for a company of gentlemen adventurers , not one filled with farm-yard stenches and manure . " Colin looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on the Island of Roanoke for a year ? How could they do that without fowl and cows , milk and butter and beef ? He said nothing . Lacie had neither looked in his direction nor addressed him since the fracas aboard ship . That suited Colin ; he had enough on his hands . But there was smouldering hatred in Lacie 's breast , and more than one man had warned Colin that he bore a grudge , and that he would wait his own time to satisfy it . Darby Glande , who had sailed to the Indies for the Bristol merchant Thomas Aldworth , had stood sentry one night with Colin . He had been outspoken . " Watch yourself lest he take you unawares , my lad . Lacie has boasted he will lay you by the heels . " Colin thanked Glande whom he liked , a stalwart man with mild blue eyes that met one full and steady . He had a thin face . The bones of his cheeks stood out under tight-stretched skin , thickened by the winds of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , and his golden ear-rings , he was a quiet man , but Colin thought he could be harsh enough and quick to fight when aroused to anger . He was kin to William Saltern of Bideford . He had come to the Tyger when Cavendish 's ship reached St. John de Porto Rico , giving as an excuse that he wanted to be with North Devon men . A good navigator , Glande had sailed to Muscovia . He was watchful , as he had been taught to be in dealings with the Easterlings and in traffic into Turkey . Tonight they walked the beach at sunset . Sir Richard 's seven ships riding at anchor were a goodly sight . Glande talked of trade and the wealth that trade had brought to the merchants of Bristol .  | He held the company on the Elizabeth in scorn . " They talk of gold and silver and pearls , " he told Colin . " They should be thinking of pitch and tar , hemp for cordage , and masts . Hides and rich furs and the like will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was a new idea to Colin . " You think there is no gold in Virginia ? " he asked . Glande shrugged his shoulders . " I do not seek gold , Colin . I seek a place to abide , where trade goods are easy and cheap . Mayhap I will set up a station and make my contacts with merchant companies in England and Europe . That is my hope . Another voyage , perhaps two , and I will settle myself in a new country and gain my wealth through trade . " John Arundell joined them then , throwing himself on the sand beside them . " God 's visor , I ache in every bone ! My feet are burning , my back aches , and look at these blisters . " He held his long white hands before Colin . At the base of each finger was a huge puffed blister . Glande said , " It is best to draw off the water . " " Best how ? " John asked helplessly . " How ? Never before have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a needle and a shank of thread . Sew directly through the skin and let the water drain off through the thread . " John shook his head . " I do n't know what you mean . I 'm sure I can never sew my skin . " Glande laughed . " I 'll fix them when we get aboard ship tonight . " " I 'll never go aboard ship . I 'll lie right here in the sand until the tide bears me away . " " And let the mosquitoes feast on your skin ? " " God , no ! They liked to have eaten me last night . They stung me until the blood streamed down my face . " Glande said , " That is not good , Master Arundell . Sometimes , after the mosquitoes bite , a fever comes with chills and one wants to die of aches and pains . " John laughed wryly . " No one tells of these plagues when they talk of Virginia and the New World . They speak only of grapes and fruits . Trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Game in the woods . Pearls in the rivers . A veritable Paradise , to listen to Amadas . " " And so it is . " Glande got to his feet and took up his harquebus . " These little nicks and pricks of Nature come to remind us that perfection  | is the attribute of Allah alone . " He went off to walk his rounds . John said , watching him move off to the stockade , " Why does he speak of Allah ? Is he a barbarian ? " " No , not so . I think he was prisoner to the Barbary men . Note the scar he wears across his face . ' T was made by a scimitar stroke . " John said enviously , " Some men walk in danger and excitement while we fight only gnats and mosquitoes and break our backs making arbours , so that high dignitaries may dine in state even on a savage island . " Colin glanced at him . Was the heavy work beginning to break Black John 's spirit ? Then he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How goes the stockade ? " he asked . " Well enough . It fell down twice , until we set the poles deep in the sand . I ca n't see why we must keep strengthening the stockade . The Spanish are fearful of us . They stay watching us from among the trees , not daring to come close . They sit there all day on their horses . By Jupiter , but they have fine mares ! I 'd give something to own the one the captain of that troop rode . " " Perhaps it is because of the ships ' guns that they stay at a distance , " Glande remarked shrewdly as he returned from his rounds . " They bear watching , those fellows . You ca n't trust them . " Arundell lay on his back , his arms over his head , gazing at the great cumulus clouds that drifted slowly across the blue intensity of the sky . They moved slowly , compelled by some lazy wind drifting in from the south . It was all lazy  --  the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to love . A picture of Thomasine crossed his mind . It would be good if she were here , a part of the slow easy life of a tropic isle . His eyes closed . His thoughts drifted into dreams . He dreamed he saw her riding down the beach on the back of the beautiful mare he coveted . Her hair was floating behind her , caught by the wind . She rode without saddle , her fine white thighs firm against the satin flanks of the bay mare . They were one , the horse and the girl . A depression came over him . He could not move  --  only watch her riding away from him , never turning to look back . He groaned and wakened . Colin was laughing at him . Glande was saying , " The Admiral has a stomach for Hispaniola . He must sail to that island . Once when I was there I saw a bull-fight . A gory one it was . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
