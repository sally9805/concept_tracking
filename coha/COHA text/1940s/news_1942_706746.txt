txt BARRED CITY TAXIS TO CARRY WORKERS TO L I. WAR PLANTS Hundreds , Off Streets Under ODT Ban Tomorrow , to Ease Transport Problem RENTED BY DEFENSE UNITS Women Will Drive the Cars ? North Shore Areas Will Be Especially Benefited Hundreds of New York City 's taxicabs , which will be taken off the streets tomorrow night in con-1 formance with the recent order of the Office of Defense Transportation to save gasoline and conserve tires , are expected to be pressed into service within the next ten days to help transport Long Island aircraft workers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties to and from their plants , it was revealed here yesterday . These taxicabs , which will be operated under the jurisdiction of the Nassau and Suffolk Counties ' Defense Transportation Councils , will be used to supplement existing transportation facilities and to afford transportation to workers living in areas where such facilities are limited or already overloaded . Rented to the Defense Transportation Councils by owners of fleets of taxis in the city , the " defense workers " taxis will be manned almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged fares ranging from $3 to $3.50 weekly for six days ' transportation ? a fee which is about equivalent- to the fares they now pay on bus lines or the Long Island Railroad . Ever since the aircraft plants on Long Island expanded their production to meet the ever-increasing vital need for more warplanes , the transportation of workers to and from their plants has almost daily increased in complexity . ? Most Lines Run East and West The situation is accentuated by the fact that on the island the main lines of transportation  --  the Long Island Railroad and the main bus lines  --  run east and west , with the result that north-south travel other than by private automobile is slow and particularly overcrowded . Many workers living in Port Washington , Glen Cove and other North Shore communities , for example , have considerable trouble getting to their plants . To alleviate this situation and to afford quicker transportation to and from the plants will be the duty of the taxicab fleet . The plan to use the taxis for transportation of the defense workers has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to sponsors , has been looked upon with favor by the Office of Defense Transportation . The details of the " taxicab plan " were made public yesterday afternoon by Benjamin Botwinick , president of the Taxicab Bureau , Inc. , of 1775 Broadway , whose organization is composed of twentyfive individual taxicab fleet owners . The Terminal Taxicab System is also affiliated with the bureau and it and the bureau members control some 3,000 cabs , nearly half the total number of taxicabs operating within the city . In discussing the plan , Mr. Botwinick stressed the fact that the proposed use of taxicabs to transport workers on Long Island was not intended in any way to compete with existing transportation facilities , but instead was to supplement them and merely aid in getting the workers to their plants . " We want it to be clearly understood that the taxis will be used only in communities where workers are having a hard time in getting to their plants , " he said . " The transportation officials on Long Island want the workers , wherever possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Only where workers can not - use these lines will we step in and try to help them get to their plants . " Sketching the development of the " taxicab plan , " Mr. Botwinick revealed that credit for originating the plan should go to M. P. St. Clair of Westbury , a former transportation executive , who several months ago conceived the idea of using taxis to get the workers to the plants . On Labor Day the proposal was first put into operation when Mr. St. Clair started his taxi service , and then appealed to Mr. Botwinick for additional cabs . Mr. Botwinick 's organization placed eleven city taxis at Mr. St. Clair 's disposal for " experimental purposes . " These taxis , carrying seven passengers each , were able to get the workers to the plants in a considerably shorter time than they could have if they had used the existing transportation facilities . The idea soon gained headway and it was brought to the attention of the Nassau and Suffolk County Defense Transportation Councils , who saw in it a possible solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county transportation officials got in touch with OPA and ODT officials and a .. series of conferences followed . The OPA officials , according to Mr. Botwinick , were delighted with the plan . He explained that they had been flooded with requests for-new or retreaded tires from defense workers using their own cars to get to work  --  a request that they could not meet . The OPA officials and the ODT spokesmen gave their approval to the plan and told the local county representatives to " go ahead and give it a try : " And the local county officials are going to do just that , Mr. Botwinick added , declaring that he expected that within ten days hundreds of city cabs would be operating in the two counties . Mr. Botwinick explained that his organization , starting Sunday night when the ODT order to the taxicab companies to take onethird of the fleets off the street goes into effect , would have 1,000 taxicabs on hand for that purpose . He said he did not expect that all these available cars would be used immediately , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . *Under the plan , the members of Mr. . Botwinick 's organization will pool their extra taxis in a newly formed War Worker 's Motor Service . This service will then rent the taxis to the Nassau and Suffolk counties Defense Transportation Councils , who will in turn schedule routes for the . pick-up of defense workers . Mr. Botwinick was enthusiastic as to the prospects of the plane He insisted that through the use of taxis the workers would be able to conserve their own private cars , avoid long and crowded traveling and get to work easier and quicker . He revealed that the taxis would carry seven passengers , three in the back seat , three in the two convertible seats and one hi front with the driver , where the taxi meter will be replaced by a seat . He said that workers would be able to make twelve trips a week ? six to and six from their plants ? for fares . ranging from $3 to $3.50 . This . rate , he asserted , was about the same that the workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected will be used to defray operating expenses , buy gasoline , make repairs , pay the driver 's salary and give the taxi 's owner a " small profit .
