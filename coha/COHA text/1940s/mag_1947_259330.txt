Other Mexicans hope for loans , treaties and boundary changes from the President of the U.S. on his visit this week . Shy , plump Genaro Corona Morales , the legless bootblack of the presidential palace , just wants to shine Harry Truman 's shoes . <P> Genaro was a Morelia carpenter just come to the capital when , on Oct. 3 , 1920 , he bumped his head getting off a streetcar and fell beneath the wheels . He lay in the street while Mexico 's Red Cross and White Cross ( then hot rivals for every body found in the streets ) argued about who should get him . A woman stepped from the crowd and applied a tourniquet ; but gangrene set in , and when the doctors were through with Genaro , both legs were gone at the hips . With a hot rage against life in his heart , Genaro got a little wooden platform to wheel himself around , bought a shoeshine box , and went to the patio of the National Palace to earn his living . He remained silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , generals , Supreme Court justices . But one day President Alvaro Obregon slapped him on the back , called him Chaparro ( Shorty ) and invited him to his office to shine his shoes . Genaro came out with shining eyes-he was the President 's bootblack . <P> Thereafter life was like new . Every day Obregon told him a new joke . He took him along when they went to fight down revolutions , and Genaro thanked God he was so short when bullets flew through the presidential train . On his last day in office , Obregon discovered he had got all this service free-Genaro was not on the palace payroll . He flipped Genaro a gold coin , promised : " When I come back I 'll see that you get a home of your own . " But he never came back . On the eve of his return to office he was assassinated . <P> Shining Career . But Genaro was established as presidential bootblack . He bent over the shoes of stern Plutarco Elias Calles , of genial Emilio Portes Gil , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $45 a month ) . Courtly Pasquel Ortiz Rubio sent the presidential limousine for him . President Cardenas bought him a specially made English car that he could drive himself . Avila Camacho paid off a $300 mortgage on his house . <P> Genaro had become an important man in Mexico . Lots of history had been made over his head , and it is his proudest boast that he has never repeated a word he has heard in the presidential office . Teresa , daughter of an Army officer , was proud to marry him-and is prouder now of their nine children , six of them sons . Says Genaro with quiet assurance : " I have talked with our ambassadors who have seen the feet of many of the world 's rulers . They tell me my work is the equal of anything in Europe or America , superior to anything in China . I 'm sure Mr. Truman will be satisfied . "
