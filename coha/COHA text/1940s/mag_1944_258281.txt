This week two famed flying men will celebrate a coincidence : 25 years ago they both got into commercial aviation on the same day ( Dec. 28 ) . Since then both have shared in making the adventure into a globe-girdling industry . The men : United Air Lines ' " dean of all airmen in the world , " Captain E. Hamilton ( " Ham " ) Lee ; and North American Aviation 's president and production genius , James Howard ( " Dutch " ) Kindelberger . <P> Between Wars . <P> Barnstormer Ham Lee went to work 25 years ago for the U.S. Post Office , flying the nation 's first air mail route ( Washington-New York ) ; salary : $300 a month . Army pilot Dutch Kindelberger went to work for Glenn Martin as a $27.50-a-week draftsman . Ever since then Dutch has built them and Ham has flown them . <P> Dutch is big ( 6 ft. , 194 lb. stripped ) , has a famous temper ( he once really broke all his golf clubs ) , and his wispy grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look something like a horned owl . Ham is small ( 5 ft. 5 in. , 150 lb. ) , mild-spoken and teetotaling . Dutch left Glenn Martin in 1925 to be Donald Douglas ' chief engineer in Santa Monica . In 1934 General Motors picked Dutch to manage and expand its North American Aviation . But while Donald Douglas held back against the inevitable expansion of U.S. aircraft production ( TIME , Nov. 22 ) , Dutch pushed it with characteristic fervor ( he had taken a 1938 European trip and had seen the Nazis ) . <P> Though Dutch Kindelberger is by no means the No. 1 aircraft producer , he gets the credit as the industry 's first mass producer . His two great contributions : <P> 1 ) breaking one highly skilled job down into repetitive , lower skilled operations ; <P> 2 ) figuring out ways to make those jobs comfortable , upright operations instead of nerve-racking , crawling-on-the-back business . His output from three big North American-run plants ( Inglewood , Calif. , Dallas and Kansas City ) includes the famed Tokyo-raiding 6-25 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon to be battle-tested , that looks like the best high altitude Army Air Forces fighter yet . <P> Globe-Girdling . <P> Ham Lee 's career has had more superlatives . The chief one : his 3,500,000 miles of flying-enough to girdle the globe at least 150 times-put him far &; away ahead of every other commercial pilot in the world . He has had only three bosses in his 25 years : the Post Office , Boeing , and , since 1927 , United Air Lines . And the nearest thing to a serious accident in his 24,000 hours of flying time was when he got lost in a fog over New York Harbor in 1920 , had to make a groundloop forced landing in a small clearing on Staten Island . <P> Ham Lee 's maxim is " When a plane stops flying , it falls " ; and though his approach to the air is cucumber-calm , he also says : " Heaven help us if the human race ever gets to where it is n't afraid of flying . " But about the only time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Robert E. Lee ( the General was a distant ancestor ) became co-pilot on Ham 's regular Los Angeles-San Francisco run . <P> The Celebrations .
