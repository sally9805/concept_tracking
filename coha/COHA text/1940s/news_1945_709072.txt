txt Senator Barkley , chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee Investigating the Pearl Harbor disaster , released today an imposing list of about fifty witnesses , including top-ranking military officials and such highly placed civilians as Governor Dewey of New York and former Secretaries Hull and Stimson , who will testify when open hearings begin on Thursday . Grace Tully , private secretary of President Roosevelt , will be one of the witnesses . Testimony made before the committee , said the chairman in a statement accompanying the list , will " lay all the facts before the public , no matter whom they may hurt in high or low places . " " Neither I as chairman nor the committee as a whole , " he declared , " will countenance any effort to keep from the public any fact material to the inquiry . " He explained he was making this statement so that there would be no misunderstanding " resulting from the discussions in the Congress and in the press over the last few days about the progress of the Pearl Harbor inquiry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government departments and agencies , he said , and the counsel and staff are now ready to produce at the forthcoming hearings " all the evidence they have collected to date . " President Truman had ordered on Thursday the heads of all government offices and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to authorize their ' personnel to turn over to the committee " any information of which they may have knowledge " that would serve to complete the data already on record . " The evidence prepared up to date , " Senator Barkley said today , " includes great quantities of material from many sources heretofore unpublished and confidential , including White House records and papers of President Roosevelt .

From Capitol Hill came indications that Congress and the members of the committee would demand much of the witnesses . Senator Homer Ferguson , Republican , of Michigan , and a committee member , said he had taken steps to obtain the diary of the events leading up to the disaster kept by former Secretary Stimson . The Senator said he had asked William Mitchell , committee counsel , to request the diary two weeks ago , but he has not yet received it . The Michigan Senator has sought to have the hearings postponed until Nov. 23 , on the ground that the committee did not have the information essential to the investigation . " Take the Stimson diary , for example , " he said . " I have n't seen that . How can I ask intelligent questions regarding it when Mr. Stimson appears as a witness " ' Senator Ellender , Democrat of Louisiana , called it " a great mistake " for the Democratic majority on the committee to refuse permission to Republican members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asserted , whether on the committee or not , i should he allowed to do their own investigating if they reported back to the committee before making their findings public .
