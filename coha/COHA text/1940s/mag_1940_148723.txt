To the average man modern architecture , modern furniture , modern city planning suggest depressing acres of window-pitted , slablike walls , rooms like hospital wards , cubical stacks of identically planned apartments , chairs of undernourished metalwork , " housing " developments that resemble mass-produced jails . He is apt to forget such examples of perfect , modern design as the airplane , the suspension bridge , the ocean liner . <P> One modernist who sympathizes with the average man 's horror of most modernistic building is Walter Dorwin Teague , an ace industrial designer who last week published a discursive , philosophical book ( Design This Day-Harcourt Brace-$6 ) on the present and future of design . To Designer Teague the industrial Revolution has been the bloodiest revolution of all . <P> Today , says Teague , " ... We find ourselves at the end of a long term that has been very much like war : a century and a half of turmoil and confusion , suffering and bleak unloveliness , a turbulent period filled with the unhappiness that is inevitable when basic readjustments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was for example a generation or two that suffered from Watt 's steam engine more frightfully than any people suffered from the first World War . " In the field of design the revolution has been as wasteful , haphazard and painful as it has in economics or politics , principally because man is still merely fumbling with the brand-new set of complicated tools modern technology has given him . Today 's designers , working laboriously by trial &; error , are creating the semisavage " primitives " of the machine age . <P> Some of these primitives-the Douglas transport plane , the modern bathroom , gas range , and washing machine-are pretty good , pretty well suited to their purposes . But designers of buildings , says Mr. Teague , still think in terms of cathedrals , designers of cars in terms of carriages . In a well-integrated period , thinks Designer Teague , all art is " applied art , " and the finest craftsmen devote themselves to beautifying the things people use in their daily lives . <P> Bald , cob-nosed Designer Teague has been beautifying machine-age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to spiffy up its then drab-looking cameras . From cameras . Teague went on to magnifying glasses , mirrors , telescopes , binoculars . Steuben glassware . <P> Pyrex ovenware , boilers , mimeograph machines . His car-body designs for the Marmon 16 in 1930 set a whole new style in automobile streamlining . Today , a consultant on everything from railroad coaches to pickle bottles , Walter Dorwin Teague is one of the half-dozen crack U. S. industrial designers . In his Clinton , N. J. farmhouse , Designer Teague gives himself a change of pace with early-American furniture .
