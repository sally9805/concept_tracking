She is easily the No. 1 salesman on the air . Her five-to-ten million women listeners buy any product she plugs . When she told the faithful about Winter Garden carrots , sales immediately leaped from two to ten carloads a day ; sales of a soft drink , advertised on her program alone , rose 900% . <P> Every weekday for the past 12 years Mary Margaret McBride has brought to the air 45 minutes of what she calls " a good radio voice-the kind that pushes itself up against you . " For the first 35 minutes she titters through an interview with a celebrity . In the last ten she really goes into her act-mugging through commercials for 13 sponsors ( who pay her about $100,000 a year ) . <P> She gets radio awards by the baker 's dozen . This week she will get " one of the sweetest of them all . " The society of Audubon Artists will honor her for making the most " notable contribution to radio " in the last year . The dividend : her portrait painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , Winston Churchill and a heap of crowned heads . <P> " Basic Dark Blue . " The picture will show a well-spread , middle-aged ( at 47 ) spinster , who dresses in " basic dark blue " sacks ( designed by Nicole de Paris ) and replies to almost any statement by clasping her hands , pursing her lips , blinking her eyes and exclaiming : " Goodness ! " But Mary Margaret is a brilliant interviewer . With a well-controlled gush she can " soften up " almost anyone to just the sticky consistency her listeners love . She does it with an air of dithery , appreciative interest that soon has most guests babbling as if they had known her for years . Once she had Jimmy Durante telling such pitiable stories about his youth that , before the program 's end , both were sobbing . Last week she interviewed Gallant Bess , The Talking Horse ( see cut ) , who made horse-faces at the mike-and whispered. * The only other participant in these scenes is Mary Margaret 's announcer-a 37-year-old Princeton graduate named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternally after the show . <P> What she calls her " fannies " follow her home with 500 letters a day and truckloads of presents : dolls , fresh eggs , lazy susans , antimacassars , samplers , crocheted towels , doilies , candy , cookies and an emu egg . More than anything else , the fannies send food . Mary Margaret used to finish almost all of it-eating the icing and leaving the cake , sucking the insides out of chocolates and leaving the shell . But for the past year she has watched her diet . <P> Business Deal . Mary Margaret grew up in Missouri , studied journalism at the University of Missouri , got a job on the Cleveland Press , went on to the old New York Evening Mail , soon crashed the Satevepost with a profile of Paul Whiteman . By this time she put her business affairs in the hands of Stella Karns , a businesswoman as bright and hard as a new dime . Stella muscled Mary Margaret into radio practically on her own terms . She also does as she pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She chews the rag so much , it 's a wonder she does n't have lint on the lungs .
