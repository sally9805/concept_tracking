Only last month , in a comic strip , when Daddy Warbucks had to have a blood transfusion , Little Orphan Annie had a frantic time finding a donor with the right blood type . But that desperate , urgent situation , fairly common in modern medicine , may soon be out of date . <P> Such far-from-comic searches may soon be ended by a new method of blood transfusion that makes possible the use of one type of blood for all cases . The " revolutionary " new process was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association last fortnight by Drs . Ernest Witebsky and Niels Christian Klendshoj of the University of Buffalo . <P> The blood of every human being is in one of four groups : A , B , AB , or O , a classification based on the nature of blood cells . If a donor 's blood is not of the same type as the patient 's , antagonistic cells introduced into the blood stream destroy the old cells , cause death . Over 40% of all human blood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O blood can safely give transfusions to persons of any type . But practically , type O blood contains anti-A or anti-B factors which , if active , destroy A or B cells . <P> Nine years ago , Nobelman Karl Landsteiner of the Rockefeller Institute isolated the A substance , discovered that it was a crystalline carbohydrate . Last week , Drs . Witebsky &; Klendshoj reported that they had isolated the B substance , also a starchy powder , from gastric juice and animal tissues . <P> To prepare universal blood , they add a few milligrams of A and B powders to each pint of type O. These added A and B crystals are strong enough to destroy the anti-A and anti-B factors . The neutralized blood can be used immediately , in hospital or battlefield , for all transfusions . The doctors have used the powders successfully in over 100 cases at Buffalo General Hospital , have already sent a supply to London .
