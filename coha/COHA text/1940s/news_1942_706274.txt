txt Plight of Enemy Aliens That five-minute dictum that emanated from the balcony of Piazza Venezia on Dec. 10 catapulted us into war with Italy , and in the frenzy of caution for our national safety a tragic situation has engulfed many thousands of Italians in America . Enemy aliens we call them ; we fingerprint them and forbid them to work in many places ; we classify them indiscriminately with the nationals of other , Axis powers . Veritable orphans of the storm . And thus we add another bitter drop to their cup of heart-breaking anguish . Their native land enslaved to the Nordic despoilers by the will of a self-elected tyrant ; their adopted land questions their love ; no special tribunal weighs their plight , no moral agency divines their feelings ! And yet they pray for a free America that means a free Italy ! ANTHONY DE FRANCISCI . New York , Feb. 28 , 1942.
