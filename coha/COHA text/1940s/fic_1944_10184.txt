in his malady . The conversations lasted at least half an hour each time . At these times that flabby and bloated old face would come alive and alight , his eyes would glow . He would sit on the edge of his chair , gripping the telephone , his voice trembling with absorbed eagerness , and even fanaticism . What of that new concentrated insulin of which he had read in the last issue of the American Medical Association 's magazine ? Was there anything to it ? The magazine said it was predicted that only one shot a week would be necessary . What 's wrong with you fellows ? What 's wrong with research ? Were they letting the whole thing die ? The physician , a really brilliant man interested in research , had actually been able to coax many thousands of dollars out of Armand 's tight pocket for a certain research laboratory in which talented and devoted young physicians , undistinguished for private means , labored night and day to discover new cures and new drugs to alleviate the agonies of such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been quite enough , for the physician had informed Armand , in the first months of hope , that the laboratory needed millions . Armand could not understand this . He would complain querulously about the " greediness " of these young researchers . Why were they not contented to labor selflessly for the sake of humanity ? Why did they not understand that they were really " dedicated " ? Why should they care for " fat " salaries ? Was it not enough to serve mankind ? When the physician explained that the young men had families , or obligations , Armand was outraged . Families and obligationsindeed ! How dared the gifted priests of medical science have such things ? They were traitors , exploiters . Medical science should be a monkish fraternity , where heaven-endowed men ought to spend their lives in devotion , thinking of nothing but service . Service , Armand would repeat , grudgingly writing another small check and hurling it at his physician . When the latter mentioned the Rockefeller Foundation , Armand would smile sourly and say , thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician would eye him somberly , and ask silently : No ? The physician was a venal and luxurious man , and no selfless saint . But sometimes he would stare at Armand for a long time and wonder if the lives of such men were worth the labor of the brilliant-eyed young researchers in that hot and meager laboratory . He thought of their exhaustion , their thin and eager hands , their passion for analysis , their joy in discovery . Was all this primarily designed to extend the useless and miserable existence of fat old men with diseases induced by fatallyp20Istricken psyches ? " Who can minister to a mind diseased ? " he would quote to himself . For he was coming to believe , reluctantly , with many angry repudiations , that the diseases of the flesh were only the outward and visible manifestations of diseases of the soul . He had discovered , only too often for his own peace of mind , that the sufferer from heart disease , from diabetes , from cancer , was sick of the world , sick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subconscious desire for death , for the obliteration of a mind that endlessly accused itself , for the eternal stilling of a sleepless despair ? The flesh struggled to survive . But in the eyes of the sufferer the physician would often detect the agony of a soul that wished nothing but darkness and nirvana , and escape from consciousness . The crippling diseases , too : were these not the index of a soul that dumbly prayed to be relieved from active participation in a world that feverishly labored for nothing ? It was conscience , or despair , or grief , that sickened the soul , and sickened the flesh . This , the physician was beginning to believe . He was revolted , derided himself for becoming a dupe of Christian Science , or other " superstitions . " But the evidence was growing . He found himself , quite against his will , fumbling with a very new Bible he had recently bought , and angrily reading the New Testament 's accounts of the healings of the sick by Jesus . " Take up thy bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take up thy bed , have courage , have manhood , and face the world of reality and fight it with bravery and faith , " He must really have meant . The world , to the physician , was becoming filled , despite his " enlightened " resistance , with millions of anguished and despairing souls that could not endure existence in such a frightful place . He observed , too , that as the tension among nations increased , and hatred bloomed like a bloody flower in every habitat of man , and fear blew like a poison gas through every city , disease increased . Death , and the desire for death , were striking the souls of men as blight strikes fruitful trees , blackening them , withering them , killing the flowering branch . Once he was on the point of saying to Armand : " Give millions , not thousands , to my research laboratory , understanding that you will help science to discover new methods of curing disease , not only for yourself , but for millions of other men . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that his words would be met with greedy indignation , or a stare of utter incomprehension . He would arouse himself from these speculations with an angry word , or a gesture of contempt . He would go to his research laboratory , and cautiously and in circumlocutions , he would hint at his speculations . He found , to his great surprise , that the young physicians knew all about this , and did a great deal of speculatingthemselves . So it was that with more gentleness than was his usual custom he would listen to Armand 's eager questions , his suggestions , his long and meandering dicussions of his disease . Under this flow of self-absorbed words , he would search for a hint of the real cause of this old man 's suffering , the real cause of the refusal of his glands to operate . Finally , he had a hint . Armand lived in chronic fear . Of what was he afraid ? Of himself ? Of others ? The List was now Armand 's gospel , the magic which extended his existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daily , he was becoming weaker . Death , the desire of his soul , would soon end the life of his body . Why was this ? The physician might have received a hint on a certain night when Armand , in his lonely apartments , was listening to the radio . Armand detested radios . A few years ago , he would never have listened to the flow that moved heavily through the ether . But now , in his lonely extremity , he listened . Out from Europe , out from the capitals of the world , came anxious voices , exultant voices , terrified voices , exhortingvoices , all concerned with only one thing : the debacle of civilization , the approaching and inevitable war , the tortures and agonies of mankind face to face with its self-wrought dissolution . Some of the voices blamed Hitler , urged the rising of the world against this madman who had been created by the powerful , the lusters , the haters of men . Some of the voices declared that it was the British or the American or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon all . Others decried the self-seekers , the exploiters , the crafty , the conspirators , the ambitious . The pacifists who had kept America unarmed were blamed ; the " armaments manufacturers , " others declared , had plotted the coming horror for the sake of profits . None cried out that it was every man everywhere who had conceived , allowed or consented to the rising catastrophe . None asserted that it was in the souls of men that the guilt lay bloodily . The German madness had been there for every man to see , but no one had revealed it to the sight of all the world . Some few had seen , but they had been silent , hoping to profit by the disease . Now only turmoil came from the air , and through the millions of radios in defenseless homes . But no voice cried out : " You , who listen , are guilty of this . " Armand listened , crouched in his dark rooms , bending his ear towardp203the instrument , the dull light that came from it the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face puckered , pursed , his gray brows drew together . In himself he could feel a sudden weakness and disintegration , a dull fever and nameless anguish . He suffered as an animal suffers , with wild dull surprise at his own voiceless pain , with incomprehension . And with it was a sick horror and formless guilt . Sometimes he would stare about him in the diffused darkness , and say to himself : Where have I been all this time ? What has been happening ? He was without imagination , without the ability to analyze himself or others . Yet , within him , the enormous sense of guilt grew , so that he felt his blood hurry faster with a kind of terror . Where was his guilt ? He did not know . But the sickness increased in him . He began to see the face of Jules Bouchard , his father , in the illuminated dial of the radio . It was a smiling face , darkly exultant , subtle and ironical . When some commentator hysterically cried out against the " armamentsmanufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damned nonsense ! As if a handful of men like myself had anything to do with this ! " He felt the verity of his own words , and was momentarily , if indignantly , comforted . What folly to believe that a few men actually set out to create wars for their own profits ! How dared the fool mouth such idiocies ! Worst of all , the ignorant and the stupid might believe it . He sat down again , trembling with the first hot rage he had felt in many years . He turned off the furious rush of words , and sat panting in the darkness , clenching his fists and beating them on his fat knees . Where were Henri , Christopher , Antoine , Francis , Emile , Nicholas  --  the whole damned family ?  --  Why did they allow this infernal nonsense ? And then he saw their faces , passing slowly before him , and was silent . He began to speak aloud , slowly , dully , incredulously : " Yes , of course . They are guilty . We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But people like us , in Germany , in France , in England . People like us , who made Hitler , who armed him , who shipped him materiel of war , who lent him money , who plotted with him , against our own countries , our own people . Why did we plot ? " His brows drew together , and he gnawed his lips in the darkness . There was a vast trembling in him , so profound that he vaguely thought the whole house was swaying in a vast agitation . He clenched his fists under his chin , and crouched forward on his chair , a stout grotesque figure with a large head partly covered by sparse gray curls . He might have been a fat gnome there , in the darkness , concentrating as he had never concentrated for many years , his mind aching and throbbing , his heart shaking . He remembered all those years when he had been Chairman of the Board of Directors , after he had relinquished the presidency of Bouchard &; Sons to Henri . Even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sudden sweat , the dry-mouthed impulse to flight , which he had felt during his attendance at the Board meetings . He remembered how his ears had suddenly rung , become deafened , dull , so that the words and statements of others were a blur , and meaningless . But , he had heard , in spite of himself , and what he had heard came back to him now so vividly that they seemed written in letters of fire on the dark walls of the room . His subconscious mind had heard and recorded , and it was like a hand , now , opening inexorable books for him to read . Faces , haloed with sinister light , floated before him . He saw their smiles , their lifted eyebrows , heard their low voices . Lips moved soundlessly , then suddenly roared loudly so that he caught every distinct and ominous word before it faded again into silence . The voices told of money , food , oil , cotton , pouring into Franco 's Spain , after the collapse and ruin of the Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant people who had thrown off the crushing power of Church and State exploitation . He heard the voice of his relative , Hugo Bouchard , Assistant to the Secretary of States , urging that precious ores and materiel of war be sent to Franco , a request which was granted by the Bouchards and the presidents of their subsidiaries . " Of course , " said Hugo 's voice , shrillingly loud and clear in the hot darkness of Armand 's room , " there will be the questionfrom certain vicious radicals why Franco needs such enormous quantities . " Hugo smiled ; there was a dim echo of laughter all about him . " It will even be asked if most of this materiel does not find its way to Mussolini and Hitler . Now , we boys employ very expensive public-relations and publicity men , and it is up to them to put the quietus on the thing . They can do it . They 've done bigger and better jobs than this . They 'll be fools , or worse , if it ever gets out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell ! We 've been helping Franco since 1936 , you boys in active positions , and I and my friends in the State Department . We 're not stopping now . Hitler needs  --  " and the voice sank to a murmur , was lost , for it was at that moment , years ago , that Armand had muttered something incoherent , and had fledp205from the room , followed by the derisive and laughing eyes of the others . Now Christopher 's voice , vitriolic and incisive , rose in the darkness : " We are n't deceiving ourselves , I hope , about the immensity of the coming struggle in America , whether or not there is war in Europe . Labor is rapidly getting out of hand , under this Administration . Dogs and swine ! We 've got to get busy , and that without delay . Francis , what are you doing about unions ? " Emile 's voice : " Hitler must win the coming war . Tell me , you fellows , just what have been your shipments to Hitler , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , from Bouchard &; Sons , but I 'm not very familiar with your work . Henri , what about those cartels ? What are the production figures ? " Jean 's voice : " I tell you , fascism is the only protection we have against labor . Some of you have wondered about the American masses ' reaction to such a regime . But I tell you now the people do n't want to think . They want to be led , regulated , thought for , even driven , if driven firmly and strongly , for their own good . ' Do you think the American mob is any more intelligent than the German or Italian ? If you do , you 're fools . " Alexander 's pompous parson 's voice : " We 've got to have a governmentby Managers in America , Business Managers . Why , I 've got Biblicalapproval of this ! " The voice of the President of the American Association of Industrialists : " I tell you , it is n't going to be very easy . It 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you must remember there is a noisy if minority group which is all for Jeffersonian democracy , and if they are eloquent enough , and violent enough , there 'll be trouble here . Especially if there is war . We 're strong , I admit that . But what are we doing in a practical way ? " Look at the facts : Kiss-mammy idealists , Marxist college professors , New Deal politicians , vociferous and ideal-drunk newspapers are already bellowing and breaking down public trust in our business structure . We 're fascist , conservative , reactionary , and Tories . ' They 've got a following , and that following can grow among the stupid masses . Look at labor gains , since that rascal has been in the White House ! Do you think that labor is going to relinquish its rights so easily , and quietly let us destroy its goddam precious democracy ? You 're confounded asses if you think so ! " Jean 's soft and smiling voice again : " We can give them something , more colorful . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that new organization of yours , Chris , when war breaks out in Europe ? The America Only Committee ? We 'll have five million members overnight , all sound blimps who will hate anything we tell them to hate : war-mongers , ' Jews , radical statesmen , snotty-nosed idealists . Anything . While they are hating so vigorously , we can bring out our own Guardians of America , the lawful and whitewashedsuccessor to the Ku Klux Klan . Do n't forget , too , we 've got the American Legion with its hatred for Communists . All we need now is a few good slogans , and our publicity boys ought to be able to find them . We have sufficient committees , I believe , to befuddle and disorganizethe stinking masses long enough to let Hitler win in Europe and keep America out of the mess . Then , when Hitler has cleaned up the balance of Europe , we 'll demand that he assist us here . It 's the least he can do , after all we 've done for him . " Then Antoine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I 've seen enough in France , among my elegant associates , to know that France , with all her fervent patriotism , and her devotion ' toliberte , egalite , f raternite , will fall easily during the first few monthsof German assault . It 's all settled , there . A faint show of resistance , to throw off public suspicion , then an insupportable ' situation which will end in immediate capitulation . The French leaders have done their work excellently , even in such a homogeneous country where the masses profess to adore France . It will be easier in America . Who loves America ? The descendants of Germans , Italians , Poles and God knows what other human scum ? The American people , too , are the most stupid and ignorant in the world . They will allow fascism to gain dominance here much quicker than the French will allow it . I agree with Jean . A few active committees and organizations , all hating something or other with that single-hearted delight that animates the American-Neanderthal man , a few induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rich vulgar ridicule , and the work is done . Labor ? Labor is too illiterate , too greedy , too gross and animalistic to lift a hand , labor leaders to the contrary . When we take over the Government under the new Nationalism , labor will simply love to work twelve hours a day for just enough to keep its gaunt belly filled . " Besides , have n't we the Church to rely on in America , with its gospel of work , propagation , family , obedience and ignorance , for the masses ? God knows , we 've subsidized it enough ! Then , we 've got our newspapers , our chains . I think they will justify our faith in them . " The voices came quickly now to Armand 's shrinking ears , vicious ,  |p207loating  , laughing , conspiring . And now the voice of Mr. Douglas Flannery , publisher of the Detroit Clarion which boasted four million readers not only in the Detroit area , but far beyond it : " My paper has gained over a million readers during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gentlemen ? I 've slashed everything , from the New Deal to Britain , France and Spain , from labor leaders to Communists , and I 'm proud of the record . I 've emphasized that we need in Washington sound and conservative business men who will put the needs of America before the Marxist needs of European radicals . I 'm not afraid ! " continued the pompous and rumbling voice triumphantly . " I 'm the only newspaper in America that dares to attack the Jews and the Negroes , and in the event of any dissatisfaction or confusion in America , which might interfere with the plans of you gentlemen , a pogrom , an epidemic of lynching , can easily be arranged . These will distract the public mind . Look at my columnists ! I can truly say these boys are doing their work excellently . If Roosevelt has the audacity to seek a third term , which he wo n't do of course , we 'll rip him wide open . We can quote Washington with the best of ' em ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , Armand suddenly clapped his hands to his ears , and rocked desolately on his chair . His wrinkled forehead was wet and cold as ice . Now the voices became a confusion in the hot silence of the room , voices of conspiracy against America , against the world , against all mankind . Voices of greed and cruelty and rapacity and immense cunning . A Voices that told of the rearmament of Germany , of fellow conspirators in England and in France , the conservatives , the Tories , the plotters on English country estates and on the French Riviera , of vast loans to Hitler , of the intricate maze of international cartels that would restrict the arming of America , and the conversion of her economy into effective war-production , of the division , under these cartels , of South America between German and American companies , of the suppression of competition , under these same cartels , and the monopolizing of the markets of America , of the exchange of vital patents with Hitler , of propaganda throughout the world which served as apologia for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decadence , ' of arrangements for shipments of vital war materiel to Hitler in the event of war , through South America and other neutral countries . The voices rose like a storm , like a hurricane , so that the sick man listening to them as he rocked desolately on his chair thought that the very dome of the sky echoed with them , threw them back to the duller echoes of earth . And then , they faded away on a last shrill note . But the air of the world vibrated with them , quivered like plucked strings , which though now silent , still trembled with unheard reverberations . Armand lifted his head from his chest and stared about him , blindly . His mouth had fallen open , and he was panting . His sickness was devouringhim like a tiger . The years of his life marched before him , those confused , frightened and formless years , filled with shrinking and fear . He had had such a small and wounded integrity , which had never been enough for anything but to induce this lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have done something ! Instead , his weak conscience had gnawed at him , devouring the cells of his flesh , petrifying the vital forces in him , delivering him up at last to this desolation and this feeble despair , this loneliness and lost hopelessness , this bewilderment and torture . He did not regret ; he merely suffered . What could I have done ? he whimpered to himself . I never really cared . Why , then , was I tormented ? Why did I run away ? He stood up , and his whimper broke from his lips : " I really was a good man ! I hated it . I was better than they . I really had the capac-ity " Now his terror inundated him , and he clasped his fat hands together convulsively , and glared about him , affrighted . He had never had any patriotism . His sole loyalty had been to himself , to his family . He could not understand . Even now , he consciously felt no fear for America , no concern for the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horror . " I was really a good man ! " he cried again , to the somber darkness . And then he knew that all his life he had wanted to be good , to be simple , to be kind . But he had been a coward . This very desire had been part of his cowardice . It had never been enough to overcome his native rapacity and avarice . He saw that he was an even greater criminal than Henri , than Christopher , than all the rest of his ominous family . He had never had any faith in anything . He opened his mouth now , and whispered : " God . " But the word meant nothing to him at all . It was an incantation without magic . His heart was beating with slow thick strokes , as if it were drowning . Now he felt that the rooms of his house were crowding about him ,  |p209the  walls overhanging him like the walls of a cliff , that he was about to be crushed . He dropped his mouth wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder : " My conscience was only fear for myself , fear of any possible consequences that might come on me because of the plottings and conspiracies of myself and others . " His mortal terror increased . He felt death in him . He glared about him like an animal . When a branch of a tree brushed the window he started with a cry , and trembled violently . And then he heard the distant opening and closing of a door , the footsteps of his son ascending the great gilt and marble staircase . A great sweat broke out over his body . He ran to the doorway of his rooms , stumbling , staggering . He flung open the door , caught at the frame to uphold himself . He cried out , over and over , in a voice that ran through the corridors like the voice of a tortured man in flight : " Antoine ! Antoine ! Antoine ! " ANTOINE , who had just had a most delightful and intriguing evening , and was now bemused in very pleasant thoughts , was considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distraught and frantic face , with such a trembling pot-bellied body , in the doorway of his apartments . It was some time since Antoine had entered his father 's house . The light in the lofty corridor was very dim and soft , and its uncertaindiffusion gave an eerie and unreal quality to the apparition that confronted the young man . But he was amazed at the eyes , glaring , starting , catching the suffused light on their distended balls . He saw how his father clutched the frame of the doorway , how his knees were buckling . He saw his terror , which was overwhelming and frenzied , saw the open gasping mouth and heaving chest . He went to him quickly , exclaiming with unusual roughness : " What is it , Papa ? " But Armand did not move or speak . He only regarded his son in a kind of hypnotized horror , watched his approach in complete silence . He thought in numb anguish : This is my son . But he is like my father . I have never seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , and I hate him . How can he help me ? He would only destroy me if I told him . He would laugh in my face . My God ! There is nothing I can say or do . There was an appalled terror in his eyes as Antoine continued to advancetowards him , and though he still did not move , he appeared to shrink , to dwindle . Antoine , slightly alarmed now , took his father 's arm . It was rigid as wood under his hand , and trembled constantly . " What 's wrong ? Are you ill ? Let us go in . You must sit down . " Armand stumbled as his son led him back into the great hot room , so dark and heavy . Antoine was forced to support him . He brought his father to a chair , and with unusual thoughtfulness lowered him into it . He turned on a few lights . Armand watched him , crouched on the edge of the chair , his shaking hands , overgrown with thick curling auburn hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his shoulders . He resembled an old sick animal , gasping and undone . " Shall I call Dr. Billingsley ? " asked Antoine , standing near him and eyeing him with reflective penetration . Armand whispered : " No . No . It is nothing . " He lifted his hands and pressed them against his face . He sighed . The sound seemed to come from the very depths of him . When he dropped his hands his expression was stark , abstracted . Antoine hesitated . He drew a chair near to his father , and sat down . Still watching the old man , he lit a cigarette , put it with slow and delicategestures to his lips , and blew the smoke thoughtfully upwards . That narrow black head , so sleek and small , that brown smooth face , those glittering black eyes and that subtle mouth , impressed themselves vividly on Armand 's tormented consciousness as they had never done before . Yes , it was his father who sat before him , not his son . This was Jules ' sleek elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , it was Jules ' smile , secret , faintly amused , quietly cruel . " There must have been something , " said Antoine . " You looked like the devil , for a minute . What frightened you ? " What frightened me ? said Armand to himself , still staring at his son . He thought : It is you . Despair choked him . He put his hand for a moment to his chest , and gasped again . He said : " It was just that I was alone . " " Ah , " murmured Antoine . His eyes narrowed . They pierced Armand like thin black rapiers . He thought , contemptuously : The old fool . Wandering around this mausoleum like a dirty fat ghost . He neverp211had any guts . What does he want ? Something has frightened the life out of him . He saw that Armand was still staring at him rigidly , and something in that fixed regard made him momentarily uneasy . " You look like my father , " said the old man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . He added : " Did that frighten you ? " Armand answered with sudden quietness : " Yes . " Then his rigidity dissolved , his features twisted , his eyes were wild with terror again . He cried : " I 'm sick ! I 'm dying ! " Antoine frowned . The smoke from his cigarette floated before his face , and his eyes gleamed through it , evilly , thoughtfully . " Nonsense , " he said , quietly . " Billingsley told me only last week that you were doing splendidly . He did say , however , that you needed some interest in your life . You think too much of yourself , dear Papa . You 've never had any hobby , or any amusement . You 've gotten moldy in this house . Green with mold . Yes , I can see you 're lonely . What can you expect ? You live for Annette 's call every morning , and then you subside into inertia again . You never go out , except to visit her , and the family has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitations . I understand that you do n't even take a drive in the mornings , as you formerly did . You 've become so damned engrossed in your List that you 've abandoned even those few interests you once had . Too introspective . You ought not to have retired so soon . " His voice , silken , soothing , yet filled with smooth Jesuitical cruelty , held Armand 's distraught attention . He listened , not looking away from his son , rubbing his knuckles against his fat reddened nose or against his shaking mouth . There 's something here , thought Antoine . His feral instincts were alert . For he had seen the sudden vividness in the old man 's eye at his last words . He repeated , watching him closely : " You ought not to have retired so soon . " " No , " whispered Armand . He dropped his hands again to his knees . His head fell forward on his chest . His voice came to his son , stifled , almost inaudible : " No one tells me anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio . They  --  believe that Hitler will march soon . On Poland . There 'll be war . We 'll be in it " Antoine shifted slightly on his chair . He dropped the hand that held the cigarette , and it was tense and still , the smoke curling slowly.  |p2I2  " No . We wo n't be in it . Did that worry you ? " Armand was silent . " Then , you have no need to worry , " continued Antoine , smiling again . " I can give you my personal assurance . You never did like the idea of war , did you ? Well , then , you need have no fears whatsoever . America wo n't engage in any European mess . Keep our boys from fighting on foreign soil . ' That 's our slogan . For the first time in history the Bouchardsare n't interested in war for America . " Armand lifted his head , and again he stared at his son motionlessly . " Yes , I know that . " " Then , why were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the strangest fixity : " I never believed in anything . We were never religious , we Bouchards . We have never been Americans . Is n't that very queer  --  never having been Ameri-cans ? " The fool 's in his dotage , thought Antoine . He smoked again , to hide his irrepressible smile . Armand 's voice was faint and toneless as he continued : " French schools . German schools . We 've never been Americans . We had nothing to do with America , or for America . " " We 've built up a vast industrial net-work , " said Antoine , again watching his father closely . " In a way , we 've helped develop America . We 're in everything . That ought to make you proud . You used to be proud . I remember that , when I was a child . Steel , mining , armaments , chemicals , copper , cars , railroads , aviation  --  we 're in it all . Really , we 're American , after all . " Armand looked away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too , of course . " Antoine frowned . " Radio ? Probably . " Armand had begun to nod his head slowly . The nodding continued . He did not seem to be able to control it . Then a rush of words came from his dry lips , a whispering rush so faint , so choking , that Antoine had to lean forward to catch the sounds : " Tell me something about it . No one ever tells me . I do n't know anything . What will happen ? If Hitler wins  --  over there  --  what will happen ? To America ? What is happening in the world ? You 've got to tell me . Antoine was silent for a few moments . The glare of terror was again in Armand 's eyes . He had begun a soft pounding of his knees with his clenched fists.  |p213Antoine  shrugged . " Do n't you read the newspapers ? You listen to the radio , do n't you , Papa ? Then , you know as much as we do . Suppose Hitler takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's . Europe has always had its confounded quarrels . And always will . Britain may attack him . I do n't know . Incidentally , I 'm not much interested . Just now , we are concerned with America . " And then he noticed a heap of newspapers beside his father 's chair , all open at the financial pages . He laughed lightly . He pointed to the papers with his thin brown finger . " Is that what was worrying you ? The Stock Market ? Well , I agree with you it 's in bad shape . However , we are expecting a rise . " Armand said nothing . Antoine continued in a curious silence : " Naturally , you would be concerned . After all , you still own fifty-one percent of Bouchard stock . So , if the Market has been disturbing you , I can assure you , personally , that it wo n't disturb you much longer . " He waited a moment . He said , more quickly : " It has been worrying you , has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Armand . The strangeness of his look increased . " You think the Market will rise ? It usually drops for a while , after the outbreak of war . Why do you think it will rise ? " He actually knows nothing , thought Antoine , smiling internally . He shrugged lightly . " Why should n't it ? We 're bound to make money . It is really very simple . " " The Neutrality Act ? " said Armand , again in a whisper . Antoine laughed . " Oh , come now . You ca n't be that ignorant , Papa . There 's South America , and Holland , and half a dozen other avenues . " " For Germany ? " Antoine paused . He narrowed his eyes intently . " Yes . Who else ? There 'll be nothing for Britain , or France , either , if we can help it . " Armand moved even farther to the edge of his seat . There was a passionate intensity in his regard . " We 've never done that before . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany now , and not  --  the others ? " " Because , " replied Antoine , slowly and carefully , " we want Hitler to win . I thought you knew that , dear Papa . Hitler is our only hope , all over the world . " He spoke as one speaks to a dull child , choosing simple words . " We 've got to get rid of democracy , or Communism . They amount to the same thing . Labor is getting out of control , under this filthy New Deal . We 've got to have a new outlook , a new philosophy , in America . Not just business as usual . We want the business of controlling America absolutely . We 'll get it , too . With Hitler 's help . "  | He reached over and patted his father 's knee . " Then watch your stocks rise ! " " You mean , fascism in America ? " murmured Armand . " A nasty word ! " smiled Antoine . " Let 's say , rather , the control of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? Hitler has promised to assist us . The yellow weasel has given us his word , for all it 's worth . " " How can he assist ' you ? " Armand 's voice was clearer now , and louder . Antoine hesitated . " There are ways , " he replied , pleasantly . He stood up . Armand still sat in his chair . His uplifted eyes were very bright as they contemplated his son . And now he hated Antoine as he had never hated anyone before , not even his father for whom he had had a peculiar frightened regard under the hatred . He was frozen with his renewed terror . He pressed his hands together , and a long shiver passed over his body . He thought : It 's too late . I ca n't do anything . I do n't even know what to do , or whether I want to do it . It 's all very confused . I ought to have kept up , known what was going on . No one ever tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling down at him . " I 'd advise you to go out more . Annette and I have our own interests . We are n't children any longer . I heard you refused Estelle 's invitation to dinner on Saturday . Why do n't you reconsider it ? " " I will , " said Armand , obediently . " Yes , I think I will . " When Antoine had gone , Armand sat crouched in his chair , his head thrust forward , his teeth gnawing his lips . There was a frightful struggleraging in him . Though he did not move for nearly an hour , his forehead , his balding skull , were damp and glistening . Finally he stood up , almost fell , so weak had he become . He fumbled for his telephone , and though it was nearly midnight , he called his lawyer and made an appointment for the next day , in New York . HENRI BOUCHARD sat alone this hot August day , at his desk in his great Bouchard offices . The heavy doors were shut , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least an hour . The bronzecoloredcurtains were partially drawn against the blinding light thatp215radiated through the windows , and there was a somber , almost pious , hush in the room . Here and there a sunbeam struck with hot golden silence on the edge of some metal on the desk . Henri was smoking . He rarely smoked alone . It was his only sign of some profound inner uneasiness and perturbation . He sat at his desk , not moving , dressed in his favorite dark gray , which had earned him Antoine 's name of the " Iron Man . " He stared before him , his large pale face stony and immovable , his pale eyes fixed . He lit cigarette after cigarette , but hardly put them to his lips . They burned out slowly between his fingers . Sometimes his eyes dropped momentarily to the neat heap of papers before him , and would remain there for long moments in a kind of somber trance . At the end of each fifteen minutes , he would take up his telephone , his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift metallic voice which informed him of late developments in the Europeansituation . He would replace the receiver , not a muscle in his face moving , would light another cigarette , and stare again at the papers . One report had reached him that morning : " The American people remain apathetic during this mounting crisis in Europe . Only among certain groups is there any deep interest . It is the consensus of experts that the inertia of the people is due less to fear of future events than to a static ignorance and indifference . One expert believes that the indifferencecan be laid at the door of past efforts on the part of professional pacifists and isolationist Senators . Others , more informed , more attuned to the public mind , believe that Hitler has made himself so exceedinglypopular with the American people , with his anti-Semitism , antidemocracy , and ruthlessness , that they could n't be aroused against him except on the occasion of a direct attack upon America . Hitler , no doubt , understands this , therefore he will refrain from such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the American people 's apathy to place no obstruction in his path of conquest . " At this , Henri had smiled grimly . He smiled again , as he recalled the report . But what could one expect of a nation of first and **25;9501;TOOLONG slaves , who must feel abysmally uneasy in the presence of a liberty created and loved by a handful of Britons in the far and bitter past ? How would George Washington deal with this cringing nation of swine and slaves ? Would he recognize , in these sullen Teutonic faces , these dark swarthy Mediterranean wretches , the people whose blood he had shared , whose language he had spoken , and with whom he had fought and suffered ? If he could come among them today , would he not despise them , understanding the threat implicit in them for America , and the survival of America ? Rome had learned the deadly lesson , that one dare not admit among a free people the children of besotted and superstition-ridden slaves . The vandals at the gates of Rome had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Henri Bouchard . He smiled contemptuouslywhen he thought them . But he could not dispel the uneasinessin him , the hatred , the aversion and anger . What was America to him ? It was true , that except for the slight strain of French blood in his own blood-stream , he was of the race and , outwardly , of the religion of those who had founded America . His heritage was British . But never in his life had he known one thrill of patriotism or passion for America . He lifted the sheaf of papers , stared at them , thrust them away from him . jay Regan , the aging and dying financier , had sent them to him by special messenger . He told himself that it was his rage against his relatives who dared conspire against him that so disturbed him now . Was patriotism , after all , only jealous fear and envy and ignorant hatred ? He finally concluded this must be so . He lifted the telephone again , and now the sharp metallic voice was shrill and breathless with excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon reach some form of accord , after which Russia will not oppose any territorial ambitions on the part of Hitler , so long as Russia , herself , is not attacked ! " Russia ! This was not impossible , of course . Henri remembered Munich , when Russia 's oiler of assistance had been ignored , when she had been shut out from the shameful conference at Berchtesgaden . Was this her revenge , then , born of her bitterness against those hypocrites who had mouthed of peace , those cowards who had sold the treasure of ages to a murderer and a liar , those plotters who hated their own struggling peoples ? Henri smiled suddenly . He felt a harsh sympathy for Russia . When the attack against the hypocrites , the cowards and the plotters began , it would be a just judgment upon them . Then their people would shriek that they had been betrayed , blaming " the industrialists and capitalists " or " the politicians , " not understanding that before death can overwhelm them the disease must first destroy them internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , would not be aware that the rottenness had first been in themselves , whether they lived in mansions or in the gutter , that their own brutish hatred , ignorance and lack of values had betrayed them to their enemies . Even the Bouchards , and all their friends , could not destroy Americap217if America was not ripe for destruction . Diseased seeds could grow only in diseased soil . The soil of America was diseased . Henri rose and walked heavily up and down the room . He was not subject to any malaise of the spirit , to any uneasiness . All his life he had known what he wanted , and had seized it . His mind had been single and integrated . Now he could not understand his own heavy and somber thoughts . He listened to the loud words in his own spirit as to the voice of a stranger which he could not shut out . He was impatient and disturbed , as he had never been impatient or disturbed before . Was this fear for himself , or revulsion against relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a soft tap on his door , and angrily he called : " Come in . " His secretary entered apologetically , and cringed at his glare . " I am sorry , Mr. Bouchard , but Mr. Armand Bouchard is here and wishes to see you . He says it is very urgent . " Henri scowled . " Please tell Mr. Bouchard that Mr. Antoine is not in at present . " Then he paused , abruptly . What the hell did the old sot and fool want with him , Henri ? He had not been in these offices since he had made his appeal for his son . All at once , a curious excitement struck at him . His instinct was awakened . He sat down at his desk . " Please send Mr. Bouchard in at once . " While he waited for Armand , he tapped on the top of the desk with his blunt fingers . What the devil possessed the miserable old cringer ? What had he heard ? He despised Armand , rarely thought of him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destroyed by some chronic inner disease which Henri had already suspected was not of his big-bellied body . But he was still latently potent . He , Henri , knew enough of Armand to believe that there must be moments when his father-in-law would rememberthis . Now all his uneasiness of the last hour or two , all his smoldering rage and disgust , concentrated themselves upon the vision of Armand , and his intrusion . He was annoyed at himself for this childishness , but the cold emotion remained . He held the greater part of Bouchard bonds but his dominant role in Bouchard &; Sons was only by consent of Armand and his precious fifty-one percent . It was a situation which had long enraged Henri , and which had impelled much of his caution . The situation had sometimes become almost untenable for him . So it was that when Armand , already disorganized , already shaken to the very frightened depths of him , already confused and terrifiedp2I8 and sick of soul and flesh , encountered Henri 's cold and formidable look he winced as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first impulse was flight . He stood far from the desk , and actually trembled , moistening his dry and swollen lips , staring at Henri in utter silence and disintegration , his hat in his hand like a beggar . Henri rose slowly and reluctantly . He placed a chair for his fatherin-law . What was wrong with the old fool ? He looked as if he had heard the most frightful news , and was on the verge of collapse . Now Henri forgot his anger and frustration . He was suddenly alert , and he could even smile . " Well , this is pleasant , " he said , in his heavy and toneless voice which denied the pleasantness of this visit . " Sit down , Father . You perhaps did n't know that Antoine is n't here ? I wish you had called up first , and saved yourself this trouble . " Armand sat on the edge of the chair . Now the visible trembling invaded his knees , which shook in their untidy trousers . Henri , seating himself again , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth about Armand 's fat neck . The lapels of his coat were sprinkled with white flakes . His vest was badly buttoned , and a tuft of shirt protruded through it . The big round head , with its crop of gray tendrils , shook faintly , as if the old man had been seized with a palsy . But it was his face , the color of tallow , the staring little black eyes , the uncontrollable twitching of his facial muscles , which focussed Henri 's attention . It was evident that Armand was sick with despair and fear . He kept touching his mouth with a tremulous hand . He could not speak for a few moments , and then he said , almost inaudibly : " I did n't want to see Antoine . I came because I knew he was n't here . " " Yes ? " said Henri , in a smooth and quiet tone . " Well , then , is there anything I can do for you , Father ? Are you ill ? " Armand gazed at him mutely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper : " Yes . Yes , I am very ill . " He looked down at his hat as if he had never seen it before ; then , with odd timidity , he placed it on the desk which had once been his . Henri watched all his fumbling and uncertain movements . Then , as his eyes met Armand 's , he was shocked and startled at the brilliant terror in them , the sudden overwhelming despair . He half rose from his chair , then sank down again , in alert silence . Something was up . Of that , he was very sure . He saw no accusation on Armand 's face , no querulous protest . Could it be that there was actually a plea in those tormented eyes , in those aimless fat hands , over/I9grown with auburn hair , which kept lifting and dropping themselves ? " What 's wrong ? " asked Henri . " You seem disturbed . You know , if I can help you , I 'll be only too glad to do so . " He thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know what to say , that the chaotic and terrified thoughts in his mind were too huge for speech , for orderly beginning . It was a mortally-stricken old animal that sat across from him , trying to stop the shaking of his lips with his stained and yellow teeth . And Henri saw that this was no new thing , but a manifestation of a life of fear , of cringing , of nameless anguish . He was surprised . He had never given sufficient thought to Armand in the past to conjecture about him , yet the cumulative evidence that had been stored in his subconscious now neatly fitted together and revealed itself as a visible pattern to him . His surprise grew , and with it , a cynical compassion for Armand , so bedevilled , so undone , so confused and tormented . He studied him with an alert and rising curiosity . He saw that Armand , in his turn , had fixed his eyes upon him with sudden penetration and passionate eagerness , and that he had straightened in his chair as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the orderly confine of mere words . His words broke from him , in stammering and discordant confusion , and he leaned towards Henri , putting both his hands upon the desk and pressing upon it so that the cords sprang up visibly through the hairy flesh : " There are so many things I remember lately ! " And now he spoke in French , which his father had insisted upon , though it had been laughed at as an affectation by the other Bouchards . Henri had to listen acutely to understand . What frantic stress must the miserable old fool be enduringthat impelled him , in his distraught frenzy , unconsciously to use the language of his childhood ? Armand 's hands were moving with strong jerks in the air , as if to ensure full comprehension for his own incoherent words and make them understood . His eyes were bright and feverish , and as he uttered each word he mouthed it as a stammerer mulls over the painful sounds he can not control : " All the things  --  over the years , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a terrible man . I always knew the terribleness . It frightened me very much . " Henri , even as he listened with strong interest , remarked to himself that this language , pouring from Armand 's shaking lips , was not rusty , as might have been expected from one who had not used it for years , but was strong and naturally accented , though hoarse with peasant inflections as if Armand 's very flesh remembered its ancient blood . These , too , were ancient peasant gesticulations , and even over his face there came a subtle mask , coarse and vital and earthy . Now the words came faster , so that Henri lost many : " You see , Henri , it was always very dreadful to me . I never realized it until just recently . Yet I must have known . There was something in me , rebelling . " He struck his chest firmly , though his eyes never left Henri 's . " I had no words for it . I was dumb . Speechless . But it grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They saw it in my face , perhaps . It was very ridiculous to them . Do you understand ? Well , there was nothing I could do , not even for myself . I could not understand it . It was so excessively absurd . You find it absurd , my son ? " Something made Henri say quickly : " No , I do not find it absurd . " He spoke in English , and a curious restlessness passed over Armand 's face for an instant . He continued : " I do not understand even yet . I only know I am ill . The needle  --  it does not help me . How can I tell the doctor this ? He can not understand . No one knows . But it is there . And now I know it will kill me . " He was silent . But the hands pressing on the polished desk spread an aura of dullness about them , as of sweat . He leaned even closer to Henri and searched his face with those starting and pathetic eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said nothing . To what a pass this tortured soul had come in this gross and unwieldy body that it must cry out even to a man such as himself , thought Henri . There had never been much friendliness between Armand and the man who had married his daughter , never any confidence or sympathy , or kindliness . In fact , Henri could not remember that there had ever been any of these between Armand and another human being , exceptAnnette . Armand 's mean and peevish little wife , his brutal brothers , his subtle and vicious father , his inadequate and sorrowful mother : among all these he had never had a friend or a confidant . He had lived alone in his body , which had been awkward and lumbering even in his youth , and if he had ever wished for communication with another man he had never indicated it . This is a hell of a day ! thought Henri , uneasily , remembering thethoughts which had preceded Armand 's coming . And now this oldtragic fool sat before him , increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , he said , slowly picking his wayp221through his stony French : " There is something troubling you . If I can help , I will . What is it ? You have said that you have rebelled : I will not pretend that I fully understand you . You have told me enough to indicate to me that your conscience is making you suffer . " He pressed his lips strongly together to keep from smiling at the ridiculous word . Armand stared at him , then slowly lifted his hand and rubbed his mouth heavily . He whispered : " My conscience . Did I ever have a conscience ? " He drew a deep breath , and spoke with long spaces between his words , as if it had become a matter of terrible importance to him that Henri should understand : " You see , it is all so confused . Once or twice , I thought : I can not go on , doing these things , plotting . But I went on . Why ? Because I was greedy . I was weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would look at me with the most wicked and cunning eyes . I could not endure his suspecting . " He paused , and asked : " Will there be war , Henri ? " Henri was silent a moment , then replied judiciously : ' I am no prophet , Father . How can I tell ? But I am firmly against war . For the first time , the Bouchards want no war . " Armand nodded , and smiled wretchedly . " Yes , I know . That is what is so terrible to me . You understand ? " Henri stared , frowning . Then , he understood . The old fool , then , was not entirely a fool . He smiled . " Yes , I understand . " They looked at each other in a long silence , and then a strange sympathywove itself between them . Henri was aware of a growing excitement in himself . Armand looked down at his trembling fingers . He spoke hesitatingly : " Long ago , I hoped you would be my son . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " repeated Henri . And then he said nothing else . He looked into Armand 's eyes , so bright and tragic and haggard . " Antoine is really like my father . No man could be father to a Jules , Henri . I am so terribly afraid . Antoine is to marry the daughter of Andrew Boland . " Now Henri forgot everything in his dismay and apprehension . " The devil ! You mean Mary Boland ? " So , Antoine had clone well for himself to pick out the daughter of that pious old serpent , Boland , " Aluminum Emperor , " and owner of one of the most powerful oil combines in the world.  | Armand saw Henri 's perturbation , and nodded somberly . " You see how it is . We must move very fast , must we not ? " Henri said nothing . But as he looked at Armand , his excitement grew , and he felt a quicker beating of his heart . Armand gave the impression of drawing closer to the younger man . Now his words came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , too , Henri . You are not a good man , are you ? You are rapacious and ruthless  --  like all the other Bouchards . You would do anything for power and profits . But , I am not condemning you . How could I ? You , at least , never had a conscience , so nothing could be expected of you . " I remember the legends of old Ernest Barbour , your great-grandfather . He was never really cruel , or subtle or vicious . That was because he never had the slightest conscience . He was a force . A natural force . One does not blame the glacier or volcano . It can not help itself . Sometimes , it can be admired . You are like that , Henri . " I did not quite understand that until I heard your conversation with my brother , Christopher , when you warned him of his plottings with the Germans . Then I recalled other things , also . They made a whole . Tell me , Henri , what you wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri did not speak for several moments , though he studied Armand intently with his pale and inexorable eyes . He knew he must move cautiously . He began to speak with heavy slowness : " I thought you knew . It is not that I have had a change of heart , " and he smiled . " I am thinking of what is best for America  --  because what is best for America is really best for us . Things have changed . The world , after all , belongs to the people who inhabit it , and not to a chosen few , not even to the Bouchards . When strong men devour everything , they starve the weaker who prepare the food for them . " The war that is coming was brought on by the greed of industrialists and bankers to perpetuate the status quo . And this war might be the very weapon that will destroy the system which they have laboriously built by the manipulation of everything that could be exploited . Now , I believe that every man , even a Bouchard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalistic democracy . It can only be saved in the future by evolving methods to give the people as much as possible , stopping short of destroying working capital . After the war , we 'll undoubtedly have newly created markets in the world . Production for use ! ' We must inaugurate a higher standard of living all over the world , not only inp223America . This will steadily increase markets for peace-time products , and will be the greatest force against future wars . " Our relatives do not agree with me . They are complete fools . They see themselves as a family of potent Hitlers , operating in America . They do not realize that tyranny devours itself , in the end . They do not understand the people at all . They will fight to the death for the status quo , with their European allies . It is their greatest dream to reduce the world to mediaevalism again , supported by a supine State and a rampant Church . They do not see how ridiculous they are . The world is filled with a different breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most painful attention . He had nodded eagerly once or twice . He had relaxed sufficiently to be able to sit back in his chair . " And Antoine ? " he said , now in English , as if some unbearable strain had been removed . " He does n't agree with you ? He is plotting against you ? " Henri was surprised . He frowned , and said nothing . How the hell could this old fool have known this , absorbed as he had been in his infernalList ? " I know all about it , though nobody has told me anything , " continued Armand . " Yes , he is really my father . I can see that . " His face was a better color , and firmer and more resolute . " I knew what you believed , and wanted , Henri . That 's why I came here this morning . You see , yesterday I was in New York , with my lawyers . " He took out a crumpled paper from one of his untidy pockets . His hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old Armand again , fumbling but compact , awkward but practical . He looked down at the paper , and said : " I 've made a new will . But no one shall know of it but you , myself and my lawyers . I have created a trust fund with my fifty-one percent of Bouchard stock , for you and my little Annette . I shall collect the income during my lifetime , but I am giving you now power of attorney to vote the stock as you see fit on any occasion . After my death , the stock and income will belong to you jointly . They will eventually pass to the survivor , of course . " He looked at Henri , with a deep smile . Henri had turned singularly pale . He sat as motionless as granite in his chair . " As for Antoine , my son , I am leaving him only my minority shares in other corporations . He will have nothing to do with Bouchard . That is the danger I 've eliminated . "  | " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri , in a curiously stifled voice . " The trust fund has already been created ? And I now have power of attorney ? " He stood up , and began to walk up and down the room . The nostrils of his short and powerful nose had dilated , because breathing had become so difficult . Exultation filled him like a bright and expanding gas , threatening to burst its confines . He could not believe it ! He lifted his head and clenched his fists . Now , he had everything , and not merely by the grace of Armand Bouchard . His power had been the slothful Armand 's , only . Now , it was his own . He stopped by Armand 's chair and looked down at the fat and shapelessbulk sprawled in it . Armand 's face was lifted . It wore an expression of complete peace and content . The eyes were closed . Henri , who had been about to speak , was silent . He slowly and thoughtfully bit his index finger . PETER 'S book was developing with a feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who works swiftly and anxiously the while the sky darkens and he glances over his shoulder at the first intimations of thunder , and the first red flashes of lightning . Despite his reason , which told him that men rarely cogitate , almost never understand , he had that intoxicating faith of the crusading author that the printed word might divert the fury and calm the ignorant passions of mankind . Only when he wrote like this did he even for a moment believe that the pen was mightier than the sword . Was it not Voltaire 's pamphlets which had destroyed the oppressors of France ? Was it not his word that had overthrown the golden throne and set up the guillotine in the marketplaces ? Behind the cry of his written and impassioned sentences came the rumble of the tumbrils , and a whole continent awoke from its slumbering lethargy at the blazing trumpet of his soul . Then Peter experienced bottomless despair . A nation enchanted by baseball and comic strips , by painted Hollywood trollops and automobiles , could not possibly feel the ancient and mystical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature timid and conservative , suspicious and dull , easily hating the weak , easily submissive to the strong . Only among the New Englanders , perhaps , and among the decaying aris/tocracy of the Southern States , could there be found a man similar in feature and mind to the noblest forebears . Should he awaken and disturb such men ( and how few there were in America ! ) , what could they do ? For the first time in his life Peter had a sickening doubt of democracy , where the voice of the ox is as important as the voice of the wise man . He might arouse a hundred thousand enlightened men to the terrible danger that was blowing up like a hurricane over the rooftops of the world . They might rise up , crying aloud . What could they do , in a nation of one hundred and thirty millions of dolts and ignoramuses who would gape without comprehensionat stern and portentous faces , and listen apishly to warning cries ? He had no illusion that these few men possessed any considerablepower in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , held ability and mental aristocracy suspect , was inimical to superiority , and placed in power only those gross charlatans , those bumbling clowns , those sly and inferior minds , that most resembled the majority of the people . All his adult life Peter had disliked the policy of the Roman Church , which had apparently kept millions in mental serfdom , and elevated only a few ( in those countries in which it was potent ) to positions of power and authority . Now he began to wonder if the Church was not possessed of a subtle and ancient wisdom , and if it did not fully understand that the majority of men are still in the dark dawn of civilization , and that any attempt to thrust them into the full light of significant history threw a whole world out of perspective and made for grotesque chaos and fury and misery . But , fascism was not the answer to the bewildered and brutish ignorancewhich seemed so integral a part of democracy . Nor was the passionateaffirmation of foolish idealists that men needed only bookish " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , valid and adequate , or even intelligent . What , then , was the answer ? How could a way be found so that superior men , of integrity , compassion , purity of mind and heart , subtlety and ability , would be elected to fill the powerful halls of Congress and the seats of authority ? The greatest obstacle was that such men lacked that theatrical dash , that roaring basso , that agile buffoonery , that cheap and colorful noisiness , so beloved of the masses . At these thoughts , Peter 's pen would grow so heavy in his thin fingers that it would drop impotently to his desk , and he would starep226wretchedly into space for a long time . Impotence would paralyze all his muscles . There was really no solution , he thought . Many brilliant men had acknowledged this , with sadness . His warning of danger would be heeded only by those who already knew the danger . And they , too , were impotent . He would tell Celeste of his thoughts . She would listen gravely , mutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only do what you can . And if every intelligent man did what he could , it would be of value , whether he was a clerk in some obscure office or a philosopher in a great university , or a single politician , or a lone industrialist . It 's your job , Peter , to make them see this value , and how , in the aggregate , they might have considerable potency . Even minorities can have some measure of strength . " Peter 's egotism as an author , the desire for power which lurks even in the most selfless men , his despair and feeling of inadequacy , were not comforted at this observation . But , it was all he could do . Perhaps the imponderabilities of chance might operate sufficiently to place a few scattered men in positions of authority and power . It was his only hope . He recalled that a few Senators and Congressmen , a few politicians , were already as aware as he of the blackening danger , and though they were attacked as " war-mongers , internationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty enemies of the people , they would not be silenced . He must show them the way , must encourage and hearten them . He continued to write . In his preoccupation , he was only vaguely and irritably aware that Celeste was becoming excessively pale and silent and abstracted . He was not of a gregarious nature , but he suddenly became conscious that he and his wife rarely accepted any invitations , never took small vacations , or had any other diversions . He remembered , too , that while he and Celeste had lived with Annette and Henri , Celeste was almost always absent and attending some festivity . Now , she lived immured with him in that horrible Endur . So it was that one hot August morning , Peter felt that life had become , all at once , acutely unbearable . He had listened for hours to the excited and ominous stream of voices pouring over the radio , crackling with rumors , with accounts of the gathering of German divisions near the Polish border , with the pompous statements of American " authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat and crushing sense of despondency , of dry weariness , of aversion and disgust , overwhelmedp227and stupefied him , rendering him unable to think , and awakening in him a passionately hungry desire for some refreshment , some little gaiety and release . All the vague , pains and prostrations of his illness came back to him , and though he did not recognize it as such , the last hopeless surging of the will-to-live tormented him . He dressed with trembling fingers , conscious of his nameless urgency , his sick desire for escape . When Celeste , as usual , came with his breakfasttray , she was surprised to find him dressed , and standing near the window , looking out with restless gloom at the blazing expanse of grass . The tall poplars of Endur were bending like giant plumes in the hot summer wind , ruffling and whitening and tossing . He closed his eyes for a moment and turned to his wife . " No , " he said , irritably . " I 'm not such a damned invalid . " He added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . I ca n't write today . In fact , I might say : I ca n't write . " He tried to smile . Celeste said nothing . She laid the tray on the bedside table , then straightened and scrutinized Peter . He was so thin now , so haggard , that all his flesh appeared translucent and fragile . She suppressed the pang that struck at her heart , and returned his smile . " How nice , " she said . " You 've worked too hard , dear . Frankly , I 'm tired of eating alone . Shall we go down now ? " His irritation continued to grow during the meal , which sickened on his tongue . He thrust back his coffee cup , and said with that vague heat and painfulness that distinguish the nervous : " Look here , Celeste , what have you been doing ? We never go anywhere . No one comes to see us . Are we pariahs ? I know we 've never been the darlings of the family , but good God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars , my pet . We 're not poor relations . I 've never loved the family , I know . But why this thick silence ? " Celeste slowly replaced her coffee cup . An anxious and secretive look came over her face . She glanced about the breakfast room , so stark , so blazing with glass and chromium , so emptily sterile , and shivered a little . She said , not looking at Peter : " I did n't know . I thought you wanted to be quiet , while you worked . " " I did n't want to be shut up like some damned monastic eunuch ! " cried Peter , with unusual irascibility . She saw how gaunt was his hand as it lay on the table , so that every bone and vein could be discerned . " There , I 'm sorry , darling . I suppose it 's my fault , too . So , I must he quiet , eh ? The stern and serious author shut away from the world while he writes his momentous claptrap , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it matter whether I write or not ? Who cares ? Maudlin egotism to believe anything matters , in such a frightful time , except wickedness and ruthlessness and greed . Here I sit , like some infernal Lady of Shalott , spinning my idiot webs  --  " He paused abruptly , for Celeste had started , and was staring at him with the strangest expression in her eyes . " What 's the matter , Celeste ? " he asked . " Nothing , " she replied , after a moment . " I just remembered that you told me that Mr. Hawkins had a high opinion of what you 've written . He did n't seem to think it claptrap , did he ? " " 0 hell , I 'm not interested in what anyone thinks ! " he exclaimed , with increasing exasperation . " Wait until he sees the last batch of manuscript . He 'll hold his nose and send it out to the incinerator . Of all the cursed egotism , to believe Celeste was silent . She had dropped her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hurting her , and perversely , his irritation strengthened . " Yes , it 's my fault . I gave you the wrong idea . You 're still young , darling , and here you 've sat , day after day , like a disciple at the feet of some miserable little messiah . And , of course , you 've never considered that I might want some change . How many weeks have we been shut up in this metallic prison ? Without seeing a single soul ? " Celeste regarded him quietly . " What would you like to do , Peter ? Shall we have a dinner ? And whom would you like to invite ? To tell the truth , I 'm very pleased to have you come to life like this . It 's a sign your health is returning . " " I do n't care , dear . Two or three of the family . My brother , Francis , perhaps , and his horsey Estelle . Not my brother , Jean , though . That poisonous mushroom . Have Christopher and Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I suppose you 'd like to have him . He 's in New York , now ? Well , that 's a relief . You might invite Annette and Henri , though I could well endure it if he could n't come . But I 'm fond of Annette . I thought you two were such friends ? Is she off us , too ? " " Annette has called up almost every day , but I thought " " Yes , I know. , The great **32;9528;TOOLONG must n't be disturbed in his history-making labors . So , Henri and Annette ought to be invited . Look here , have n't you any friends outside of the family ? " " A few . " Celeste began to count on her fingers . " I think it would be nice to have a small dinner . It is more congenial , I think . I do n't careP239this . Ca n't you see ? " He put his arm about her , and she dropped her head to his shoulder . " I 'll send you some material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hand to Peter . Peter stared at the hand , then took it . " And another thing , " said Henri , smiling as if with deep amusement , " do n't be scholarly in your attack . Use words of one syllable , if possible . Remember , the majority of the people are pretty ignorant . They have a natural suspicion for what they call college professors . ' Keep it simple , telling , violent , and spectacular . Nothing measured and restrained . They 'll only turn you off , otherwise . Listen to Bishop Halliday , that pious swine . Copy his style , and improve on it . He 's a good rabblerouser . Be a rabble-rouser . " Peter smiled convulsively . Henri saw that his mind had already flown off into an excited and turbulent realm , and that he was already formulating what he would write . He did say , however : " It 'll be fantastic , working with you , Henri . I still ca n't believe it . " " Believe it , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting facts tomorrow night , after dinner . " Annette was silent . But her little hands clutched Henri 's solid arm , and she was smiling radiantly , seeing nothing but his face . And so it was that no one saw that Celeste , too , was looking at Henri , . her lips fallen open , her eyes dark and strange . PETER had purchased ten acres of land on Placid Heights for his new home . The land embraced a whole low hill , and behind it rose the mauve folds of taller foothills so that it seemed enclosed in the ring of an immenseand circling fortress . The house , now in the process of being built , stood on the tip of its hill . The grounds were to be adequately landscaped , but at this time , in late August , the hill was brown and scorched , with here and there a bent and sinewy tree and spindling second-growth timber . Therefore , the house had an exposed and vulnerablelook in the brawling sunlight , its strong gray walls somewhat grim , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloped gently down to a narrow cleft between the hills , a valley filled with radiant and translucent mist , so that the trees scat- tered through it stood motionless in a silver light . No other house was visible . There was only the pale brilliance of the sky , the purple folds of the hills , the dreamlike valley , as far as eye could see . There was no wind , no sound of a bird in that vast and widespread quiet , under the universal cataract of the sunlight . Only the sawing of wood , the clamor of workmen 's hammers , an occasional rough voice , or the clump of a footstep on rough new flooring . The smell of fresh sawdust permeatedthe hot and sterile air . A short way down the slope a small blue car was parked , and near it , on a smooth stone , sat Celeste , her red dress a splash of color against the yellowed hillside . She did not look up and back at the house . She stared before her down at the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair lifting and falling faintly as the slightest of breezes sometimes touched it . The stern quiet of her face had relaxed ; her lips were softer , more blooming , more gentle , than they had been for some time . Once or twice she smiled , quickly , with a caught breath , then sighed , and for an instant or two the old rigidity would tighten her features , to pass away once more in a vivid flash of renewed sweetness . She had come out to discuss the panelling for the library with the architect . He had gone . She was all alone . The diamond on her hand flashed in the sunlight like a round prism . She had sat like this for nearly an hour . No one looking at her could have guessed the feverish excitement that filled her , the sudden gusts of black despondency that followed , which were followed in turn by a wild bright quickening that made her clench her hands together , and pierced the swelling of her heart with voiceless ecstasy and deep passionate sadness . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become very limp and still , to begin the cycle of emotion again within a few minutes . She had been dead so long . Since last night , when Henri had proposed his plan to Peter , the latter had been so violently excited , so exultant that Celeste had been unable to restrain him . Any suggestion that he calm himself was met by an outburst , by his crying that she did not understand him , that she was trying to quell the first joy he had felt for months , even for years . So , she had finally said nothing . She saw that Peter , too , had been dully desperate , full of impotence and fear and hopelessness . Now he had been given an opportunity to reach millions , who must be awakened . Celeste would think of the man who had made it possible for Peterp241to live again , to feel once more that terrible bright exultation of the potent . And she would feel a trembling in herself , and would catch her breath . So many years had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware , after so long , of the acute sharpnessof the world 's imminence , its passionate violence , its urgency and wonder and vivid color . She had been given again that clarity of perception , that exhilarating keenness , which she had once felt in existence , and which she had forgotten had ever been . Now , as she thought of Henri Bouchard , her awakened senses observed everything with such vividness that it was almost painful . The small rubble at her feet took on significant shapes and forms . The shadow of a twisted tree near her was full of meaning , and as its great leaves bent in the faintest of winds , she could hardly endure the poignancy of the sunlight upon them . She would lift dazed eyes to the sky , and it seemed to her that the drifting outlines of pale clouds were more than she could bear . So absorbed was she that she did not hear the grunting struggle of a car as it climbed the roadless hill , nor the slam of its door . Nor did she at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent towards her . When she discerned who it was that was approaching her , it seemed only the continuation of her dazed and radiant dream . She could only sit there on her stone , dimly smiling , her face turned towards the climbingman . Then , all at once , she became aware of him , and it was like a shock through all her body , a wild awakening . She could not rise . She could only sit there , her hands gripping the sides of the stone , her face white and set . When he lifted his hand in a friendly salute , she did not answer . She was paralyzed ; her heart appeared to stop . Now he halted for a moment some fifty feet below her , and wiped his damp face with his handkerchief . " Hello ! " he called . Her lips and throat were dry . She was still unable to move . He climbed slowly and easily towards her , then halted again some ten feet distant . " Peter here ? " he asked . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " No . " Now she could stand up . He was smiling at her in the friendliest fashion . " He 's not ill again , is he ? " Her lips formed the negative , but no sound came from them . " At the last minute , Annette decided it was too hot , and so I thought I would run out myself , " he said.  | Celeste was silent . They faced each other , and now he , too , did not speak . His large head was inclined gravely , his expression serious . She awaited what he would say next , with an agonizing acuteness of all her senses . But he only said at last : " Well . And how are things coming along here ? You know , we often come out . " " Very well , " she replied , again struggling to speak . Her limbs were heavy and throbbing . He turned away from her , and smiled again . " I 'd like to see for myself , " he said , and climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him go , mutely . After a long time , she sat down again on the stone , quickening with a desire to run away , to get into her car and turn it down to the valley . The desire was like a blowing flame in her , but she had no will to respond to it . She did not know how long he had been gone , but he was suddenly beside her again . He was not looking at her ; he was gazing down at the valley with a contented expression . " Very nice , " he remarked . " And not too far from the city . You know , I saw the old Sessions house a few times , when I was a brat . You 've heard of it , Celeste ? If I recall it rightly , the plan of the interior was similar to this , and there was an exteriorresemblance , too . " He laughed a little . " It ought to have been preserved as a family monument . There 's a story that it inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally abandoned by the family , after my great-grandmother , May Sessions , died , in 1910 . By then it had become surrounded by slums , but she still stayed there . Must have been a fascinating old devil , my great-grandfather , eh ? The house was slowly falling into flakes , but she stayed there , thinking of him . When she died , though , the family pulled it down so it would n't degenerate into a rooming house , or worse . " He laughed again . His strong broad teeth flashed in the sunlight , as she gazed up at him , dumbly . " You know , I 'd have liked the final irony  --  the old Sessions house becoming a bordello . There 's an epigram in that . The thing that at first inspires a man finally becomes his degradation . I 'm clever , are n't I ? " Now she could smile , painfully . She stood up , brushed off her dress . " I must go , " she murmured . He lifted his hand easily and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started , and then hardly controlled a humiliating impulse to tear her arm from his grasp . So she stood , becoming very still and cold . But a sudden sharp heat spread from the fingers that grasped her , spread all down her arm and then into her body . Now her eyes widened , fixedp243themselves upon him , blazing with vivid blue light , proud , bitter and incandescent . " Hello , Celeste , " he whispered . Any movement on her part , she thought , despairingly , would make her ridiculous , increase her wild humiliation . So she did not stir . But her heart was rising on a swift arch of exquisite pain and tumult . And he watched her closely , smiling , that pale and polished gleam of his eye narrowing between its lids . " Let 's walk down there a little way , " he said . He dropped his hand to her own hand , and held it strongly . He drew her after him , and she followed , stumbling , seeing only the floating ground at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They moved along the slope at an angle , so that a rising hump of ground hid them from the sight of any curious workman at the house above . There was a short squat tree here , with thick shade . They stood under it . Here , Henri dropped Celeste 's hand , and they faced each other in silence , a silence almost violent in its unspoken power . Then Henri spoke very quietly , and slowly : " It 's time we had a talk , do n't you think ? And made up our minds what we are going to do . " Celeste smiled bitterly , and flung up her head . " Are you actually considering divorcing Annette ? " she asked , with harsh mockery , her look very direct and bright . She expected him to hesitate . But he slowly and gravely shook his head . " No . Not yet . " His voice was reflective and firm . " For a reason I ca n't tell you about just now . It came up very recently . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opportunity will come later . Not very late , I hope . " And now , you . Are you going to wait until Peter dies before we begin to live ? " The audacity of him , inexorable as it was , and now grim , stunned her . She could only stare at him , dumfounded for a long time . Then incoherent and furious words rushed to her lips in such a flood that she stammered over them- , as one stumbles , falters , runs and staggers in flight : " Oh , you are contemptible ! How can you  --  ! You are a ghoul ! " here 's nothing I can say to you but this  --  leave me alone . Stay away from me . Have n't you hurt me  --  and Peter  --  enough ? Do you think it 's easy for me to look at him ? Now ? I 've got to make it up to him  --  How can I bear looking at him , every day , every night ? You could never understand that . There never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fidelity , no kindness . You would kill poor little Annette , easily ,  |p244if  it would help you in any way . Sometimes I think you are killing her ; she has such an awful look in her eyes lately . What am I going to do ? Nothing ! Never ! Never , never . " She turned away from him , and took a few rushing steps . But he caught her at once , and pulled her back . He shook her with hard violence . " Celeste . You fool . Stop struggling ; you are ridiculous . Look at mc , Celeste . " She was weeping loudly now . But at the vicious contempt in his voice , the implacable command , she stopped , sobbing under her breath , regardinghim with mute and intense hatred through her wet eyes . He dropped his hands from her shoulders . " There , now , that 's better . You act like a child , a stupid and unreasonableand romantic child . We are n't children , you little imbecile . We are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faced , understand , and decided upon . Yes , you are hating me now , are n't you ? You 've made a fine mess of our lives , yet you have the impudence to glare at me as if I were the one to blame , and not you . A fine defense mechanism , but a cowardly one , like all defense mechanisms . Or is all this beyond your intelligence ? " A flood of scarlet ran over her face . She was very quiet now . She said , looking at him fixedly : " Yes , perhaps I 'm a coward . I always thought I was . But that does n't matter now . I 'm Peter 's wife . It may surprise you to know that I do n't want Peter to die ! You see , I love him . " " And so , " he interrupted her , ironically , " you prefer to discuss this matter after Peter is dead ? You have that in mind ? You ca n't see the nastiness of that ? Bah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be honest ? The fact that you have decided to think about matters after you are a widow does n't enhance your fine honor , your smug virtue and righteousness . It does n't undo any wrong ' you 've already done to Peter . It does n't exonerate you because you wo n't face things until your husband is dead . The thought is already there . " She was silent a moment , still staring at him . Then she drew a deep breath , and said softly : " All right , then . I 'll decide now . Whether Peter lives , or dies , there 'll never be anything between us , Henri . Never . Not even if you divorce Annette . Not even if Annette should die , and you do want her to die very badly , do n't you ? " He began to smile . " Annette die ? Yes , I would n't mind that . I 've no real dislike for the little thing . In fact , I 'm fond of her . But it would simplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just now . "  | " I 'm sure I hate you now , " said Celeste , with a kind of wonder . " Yes , I 'm sure of it . " His smile became a laugh . " That 's better . I like you to hate me . And you have n't really decided , have you ? You are a wordy little wretch . Did n't Christopher feed you milk toast and romanticism all your life ? I think I remember that . You are an untidy little romanticist . Your hair is all disorder . I 'm speaking figuratively , of course . You see , I have to be very careful in choosing words that are n't beyond your limited intelligence . You 've thought yourself quite a high and noble intellectual all these years gypsying around Europe with Peter , have n't you ? You 've sat and listened to the masters at every international tea-table . So now , you have a Mind and a Soul . Yes , my love , you make me sick . " He added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing you might have acquired just a little sense , to discuss with me what we are going to do now . And you come out with Jane Eyre . " He moved a foot or two from her , and inclined his head towards his car below on the slope . But his harsh and cruel eyes did not leave her face . " I 've never pursued women . Frankly , I do n't like women . I do n't like you ; I never did . But I 've loved you . I 'm not too sure , just at this minute , whether I love you any longer . Fools make me puke . You are quite a fool , you know . But , I 've loved you . I might even love you again . " But just now , I 'm not sure . I 'm not even sure I want you . I 'm almost sure I do n't . " He paused . Her face was as white as bone , in the shadow . She could not look away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the blackest depths of despair and desolation , of an anguish so acute and immense that it seemed her heart must stop . He watched her narrowly . He lifted his hand slowly , and pointed at her , and his finger was like a dagger . " I 'm going to start to walk , Celeste . And at any time before I reach my car , you may call me back . But once I get in it , and go away , that 's the end . Think about it for a moment , honestly , like a decent human being . When I go away , that 's all there is . There 'll never be anything more . Never , never , ' " he added , with quiet disgust . He waited a little while . But she stood there unmoving . He smiled grimly . With infinite slowness and resolution , he turned away from her , began to walk in the direction of his car . She watched him go . He had reached a little mound of rocks . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back . He 'll never come back.  | Now all her pulses were like separate hearts in her throat , her temples , her hands , her knees . She could feel their sickening bounding and leaping , tearing at their confines , forcing a taste of salt into her mouth . I k was within sixty feet of his car now . He walked very steadily , never faltering for a moment , never hurrying , never pretending to delay . She saw his broad gray back in the sunlight , the back of his large and brutal head . He seemed as unaware of her as if she did not exist . Now a huge pain took hold of her with iron teeth , so that she literally felt their tearing in her flesh , their clenching in her vitals . No ! she cried in herself . 0 no ! 0 Henri , no ! The strong figure moving so inexorably in the sunlight had shut out everything else in her consciousness . It was a nightmare , a dream that dragged each horrible moment to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iron teeth had fallen on her last living defense , and she felt a soaring of agony in her body and her spirit which was unendurable . It was this that made her cry out , a great loud cry that was less an act of her will than pure torment , which had become beyond her power to fight . He heard that cry . Through a wavering and darkening mist he came back to her , not slowly now , but walking with quick and rushing feet . She did not know that she lifted her arms to him . And now she was held close to him , passing her hands over his shoulders , his arms , weeping wildly and terribly , clutching him as the drowningmight clutch . He did not comfort her , but held her more tightly . He felt the smothering beat of her heart , her suffering . When he tried to release her frantic hold upon him , to calm her , she became less controllable . He was alarmed , and looked about him uneasily . Someone might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He released himself forcibly . He took her convulsed face in his hands , and by looking into her eyes he forced her to be calmer . She was weeping again , but with more quietness . She lifted her hands and clasped them about the wrists so near to her cheeks , and her fingers were like iron , biting into his flesh . " Henri ! " she cried , hoarsely . " You would n't have gone away ? Not really ? " He held her again to him , tightly . " Yes , my love , " he said , very softly . " I would have gone . Really . " And then he added , more roughly : " Do n't do that again to me , Celeste , not ever . "  |p247IT  WAS on that day in September , 1939 , when a world ended and a strange , new and terrible one was born , that Antoine Alexis Barbour Bouchard was married to Mary Eloise Boland . The wedding was very quiet . As was pointed out in a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , the late Mrs. Jules Bouchard , and young Miss Boland had been bereaved of her mother some two months ago . The marriage took place ( for " reasons of family tradition , " sang the newspapers ) in the beautiful little old chapel of the Episcopal St. Mary's-on-the-Hill in Windsor . The chapel , which was not very old , had a very ancient and Norman look , all heavy gray walls and ivy and strong squat towers , to match the parent building , aggressively Norman and stately . The stained glass windows were excellent , with just reason . They had been lifted bodily from a real Norman church in France , and transported , at enormous expense , to their new setting by old Ernest Barbour , who had built the edifice . Here , he , himself , had lain in that rainbowed and mysterious light cast by the windows , and here other Barbours and Bouchards had slept on their cold satin pillows before they were carried to their last narrow niches in the cemetery . Here infant Bouchards had been christened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shifted in their solemn pews , yawned , stretched , dozed and plotted , had indulgedtheir peculiar thoughts and their sadnesses , had pondered their lusts and hatreds . The Family was extremely delighted with Antoine 's choice . No memberever married inappropriately . Antoine had carried on the tradition , in spite of past uneasiness about him . The Bouchard males had always had a penchant for great ladies . Miss Boland was a great lady . She was also , happily and appropriately , very stupid . Her figure was rather short and plump , like a dainty squab 's , and she possessed very tiny and pretty little hands and feet , plump also , and white as milk , dimpled of knuckle and beautifully tended . Like many young women of her figure , she had a round soft white breast , and swelling hips , and a short narrow waist . Her face , too , was round and soft and dimpled , and she smiled almost constantly with the sweetest of tempers , the dimples appearing delightfully in cheek and chin and about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a round pink mouth , a little round tilted nose , naturally rosy and blooming plump cheeks , and very large bright gray eyes surrounded by bronze lashes . From her low foreheadrose the soft fine waves of her auburn hair , to blend into a gleamingknot at the nape of her short white neck . She was very pretty ; she was very charming ; she had the sweetest of tinkling laughs . She never said a thing of any significance , but neither did she ever say a word that was not tactful , gracious or proper . She was twenty years old , and she was also a virgin . She had never had a thought that was original or acute , pertinent or profound , unchaste or compassionate . Best of all , she was a great heiress . And she adored Antoine . All in all , therefore , the family could do nothing else but approve his choice . She was a typical Bouchard woman , and so , perfect . Miss Boland was the only child of her father , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying Mary 's mother . None of these wives had borne him children , and so he had discarded them . Mary 's gender had at first infuriated him , but she had finally won him with her charm and sweetness and imbecility . She had not been more than a year old when he had begun to look about him for a suitable husband for her . When Antoine had appeared on the scene , he had been highly gratified . He was seventy years old now , and had begun to worry about his daughter . To his father , Armand , Antoine had said : " She is really a delightful and satisfactory little creature . Her mother came of a family of prolific breeders , so you will probably be a grandfather half a dozen times over . " All in all , Antoine 's choice was universally approved . The wedding , though quiet , was perfect . Miss Boland looked like a rosy cherub in her filmy white veil , her embroidered satin gown with the train six feet long , her bridesmaids with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her cousin , the ambitious second vice-president of the Morse National Bank , was best man . She stood at the altar with Antoine , and through her veil her round and stupid and pretty face shone like a rosy moon . Because of the sinister and ominous event which had exploded in the world , the honeymoon was short and quiet . The happy couple returned to live in the great gloomy castle of Armand 's . Within less than a week , Armand was passionately fond of his new daughter . ( As for herself , she " loved " all the Bouchards , considered them the most brilliant , the most soigne , the most endowed and superiorcreatures in the world . She was very grateful to them for takingp249her into their closed clan . This did nothing to abate their approval , though after five minutes they found her tedious . She set herself to be indispensable to Armand , for she was really quite kind , provided she was not puzzled or compelled to think a situation through . She saw that Armand was sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her own father was as tough and twisted and dry as an old and weathered tree . Here was a creature she could mother , and the maternal instinct was very strong in young Mrs. Antoine . It was enough for her that he was sick and neglected , that everyone laughed at his " List , " that no one considered that " List " as important . Mrs. Antoine found it very important . She spent hours each day with him , bent over the despised paper , seriously and gravely discussing with him various menus , and personally seeing that only those articles selected appeared on the table . " My love , I have n't diabetes , " protested Antoine , when another dish of sweetbreads or lean thin meat or broiled chicken appeared at dinner . " Neither have I an aversion to potatoes . And I loathe limp vegetables cooked in water and flavored with mineral oil . " But young Mrs. Antoine was very firm . As a result , Antoine ate dinner at home not more than twice a week . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy dinner hour discussing the menu for the next day . It was no wonder that he began to adore her . Within less than two months , she was happily pregnant . In a world that was sick to death , that lived in a nightmare of constantlyshifting backgrounds of fury and madness and confusion and hatred , that was so twisted and blown by a thousand rumors , that presented a multitude of rising and falling faces lighted by the glare of a wild Walpurgis Night , that resounded with the shrieks and cries of faceless madmen , young Mrs. Antoine lived a placid and insulated existence . " You are so restful , my sweet , " Antoine would say to her at breakfast , as she prattled away on some pretty asininity . " You have n't the brain of a mouse . " He knew many women without the brains of mice , but they never seemed to realize it . They were full of seriousness , and discussedmany problems with an air of intellect . It was delightful to find a woman who happily accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her role of amiable rump , and had a pretty little laugh that strove for no significant meaning . The gloomy castle on the river began to take on an air of festivity and gaiety , incongruous to its character . " Like an ancient giantess wearing a foolish little hat over one eye , " Antoine would say . But sunlight now invaded the immense dark rooms . Potted flowers appeared on every vast window-sill . Antoine said nothing until his cherished Rubenses and Goyas suddenly disappeared , and he discovered that his cabinet of ancient and curious snuff-boxes had been tossed into the store-house over one of the garages . " But those little boxes were so nasty , darling , " said young Mrs. Antoine , quite red of cheek , and with tearful eyes . " I looked at them . Some had such horrid little pictures on the lids . So musty and old , and not pretty at all . Besides , no one ever uses snuff now , so why do you want them ? " The cabinet reappeared in the library , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers on it , and rearranged the draperies at the windows so that the cabinet was in constant shadow . And then , of all the Bouchards , Antoine suddenly found his wife unbearablyfatiguing . He had always admired his relative , Rosemarie Bouchard . She was a woman of wit and malevolence and swift vitriolic mind . He knew of her embroilment with Henri Bouchard , but he also knew that she had many other interests . She had some talent for writing , and small vicious " profiles " of prominent people written by her often appeared in the " smart " magazines , and even in the newspapers . At the present time , Rosemarie was in Washington , where she had many friends among the wives of Senators and officials of the State Department . She was writing casual columns for a newspaper syndicate now , and Antoine was delightedby her wit , her pungency , her subtle and perceptive remarks on the national and international situation . He visited her several times . It annoyed him that she was still so engrossed with Henri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returned from these visits much elated and soothed in mind , and was able to treat his little wife quite affectionately thereafter . After a stimulating dinner , a sweet frappe could be enjoyed . Rosemarie , in her turn , began to look forward to Antoine 's visits with increasing interest and pleasure . Their similarity of temperament and mind , even their physical resemblance to each other , piqued and amused her . Besides , she was very useful to him . She could inform him of the slightest rumor , the slightest change in opinion of the powerful in Washington . He began to take notes in his small artistic hand , as he sat with her in her smart apartment . He discussed with her many matters of importance , and though well aware that she was vicious andp251treacherous and greedy , he knew he could dispense with considerable caution during these evenings alone with her . They wanted the same things . They understood each other . They could help each other . By the early spring of 1940 , they were in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her brief visits to Windsor , but she could tell Antoine many things about his hated kinsman which were of extreme value to him . Because of her free access to the salons of Washington , she was also able to tell him many other things . Acting as his spy , she sought out politicians , newspaper owners , prominent lobbyists , powerful women , and , finally , was able to get on excellent terms with the gravely excited and highly placed men of the " New Deal . " They all thought her merely a brilliant and intellectually inquisitive woman , charming in appearance , of excellent taste , and great sympathy . What they told her , in their soothed egotism , was relayed to Antoine , with Rosemarie 's own subtle and excellent footnotes . When the America Only Committee suddenly burgeoned into prominence , Rosemarie appeared among the organizers , but only sub rosa . She was too clever to allow her name to be used . She knew that one faction of her family was supplying the huge sums necessary for its existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought after by the officers of the Committee . She wrote much of the propaganda which appeared in its smooth pamphlets . She wrote many of the radio scripts which were shouted over the ether by bought , suborned and traitorous speakers . Antoine supplied her with certain information and suggestions . It was understood , of course , that the Bouchard name must never appear in any fashion . Rosemarie , it was , who brought many Senators into the America Only Committee , by way of large checks , promises or even delicate blackmail . Rosemarie never appeared at the German Embassy , and was even heard to express her contempt and disgust for the Third Reich , and Hitler . Nevertheless , it was rather odd that much of Goebbels ' choicest propagandaappeared in her scripts , cleverly changed and disguised , but still virulent . " Remember , the motif must always be Americanism , ' and very patriotic , " Antoine had cautioned her . " And play up Constitutionalism . ' Everything must be very dignified and solid and respectable . You can let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the name of religion . By the way , you must impress upon themp252that their own motif is Christianity , ' as opposed to atheism , Judaism and Communism . Also , it is necessary that we secure the services of some national hero , some prominent man . Look around for him . " Therefore , it was Rosemarie Bouchard who found the " national hero " who could act as spokesman for the America Only Committee . CAPTAIN AUGUST JAECICLE was of old German-American stock , and had been born in Wisconsin on January 2 , 1900 . He was now only approachinghis forties , and was of considerable comeliness . He had that **25;9562;TOOLONG of face and figure so irresistible to women , for he was rather short and slight of build , and had fair thin hair on a boyish skull and a rather stupid and immature cast of feature . Even in old age , he would still possess that rather wizened adolescence ; the mind behind that sloping smooth forehead had petrified into a school-boyish fourteen-year-old . He was a great athlete , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muscle-building , and his remarks on the classical trend of American schools were very strong and contemptuous . " That 's Europe , " he would say , with profound scorn . " We 've got to teach our youth to revere the body . " As his remarks were always distinguished by profound stupidity , the American public considered him a very oracle . They delighted in photographs of him . His vapid serious countenance , with the small and somewhateffeminate features , his lock of light hair falling over his forehead , his air of innocence and grave dedication , his large pale blue eyes shining with fanaticism , he appealed overwhelmingly to American women and to a certain type of American man . It did not matter to them that he was a fool and an ignoramus , that he was a poseur and a passionate seeker after the cheapest publicity ( in spite of his loudly declared aversion for " the press " ) . He was a hero . He personified " American youth . " He was a hero , indeed . For August Jaeckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied about his birthdate , and had enlisted in the American Army in May , 1917 . Two of his brothers were already serving in the Navy . " I used to cry , after Mother had kissed me goodnight , " he was fond of saying with a sweet reminiscent smile , and that shy air of his which convulsed middle-aged women with tender ecstasy . " I could n't stand it , thinkingp253of George and Heinrich standing foursquare on their battleships with the wind in their faces , while I was wasting my time in the Shinehaha High School . Mother tried to console me . I was her youngest , her little boy . ' She could n't bear to think of me joining my brothers in the defense of our country . It was even worse for her when George was killed at sea . She used to cry . But there was something in me ( perhaps it was my father 's voice  --  he had been killed in the Spanish-American war , you know , just before I was born ) that kept urging me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been my heroes . So , one day I kissed her good-bye . She had no idea that she would n't see me again for nearly two years . But I knew . She thought I was going off to my classes . But I went to the recruiting station . " At this , he would smile again , lovingly , with great tenderness for the vision of that valiant schoolboy marching off to the wars , with his mother 's kiss still damp on his boyish cheek . His eye would become moist . His voice would tremble . He would draw a deep shaking breath into his immature chest , still unmanly at the age of thirty-nine . He would almost whisper : " Mother ! " At this , it was not unusual for susceptibleladies to control sobs . Everyone knew by now that Mrs. Jaeckle had died of pneumonia , during the great influenza epidemic , without ever seeing again her valorous young son already in the trenches in France . Everyone also knew that August had become a hero almost overnight . Single-handed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( also boys ) , had taken twenty prisoners , and had marched them back to his own lines with a stern and exalted look upon his face . No one but August knew that it had been a little Jewish sniper , caught with him and ten others in a shell-crater , who had really wiped out the machine-gun nest and died a few minutes later of a bullet in his heart . Happily , a hand-grenade from another isolated shell-hole had demolished the other witnesses to this act of supreme marksmanship and heroism , leaving August quite alone , and quite mad with terror . He had risen from his own shell-hole , screaming , and in his rush to his lines had come across the twenty Germans cowering in still another shellhole . Exhausted , starving , diseased and hopeless , they had surrendered to him with cries of joy . For a few feet , in fact , they had literally pursued him , begging him to take them prisoner . He had finally come to his senses , and had obliged his " captives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened heart the fear that someone , somewhere , might know of the little Jewish sniper.  | In consequence , and by virtue of the involved mechanism of selfdefensewhich operates so darkly in the human soul , he had become a rabid anti-Semite . He had never been at all religious during his school days . But now , he became a militant " Christian , " a vicious and fanatical enemy of everything that was irreligious . The defense mechanism operatingvigorously , Russia became to him a symbol of " anti-Christ . " He hated all things that smacked of Communism , which , in some peculiar fashion , was a symbol of Judaism to him . Sometimes , at night , when the face of the little Jewish sniper would rise up before his inner eye , stern , reproachful and contemptuous , he could not sleep . He would walk the floor , sweating , weeping , wringing his hands , his whole being afire with hatred . It was then that he would give vent to the foulest and most obscene cries , in a low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroism . He loved his publicity . He wore his medals with passionate egotism , for all his publicized " modesty and shyness . " At the age of thirty , he had married a wealthy buxom widow some ten years his senior . Some fatuous ladies declared she was a " mother symbol " to him , and indeed he was often heard to admit shyly , with a deep look at his wife , that " Emma resembles my dear mother so much . " Within a year after their marriage , he began to call her " Mama , " though she had never borne a child . The widow was a woman of no small intelligence , and possessed considerable shrewdness . However much she resented the " Mama " appellation ( for she was handsome and had great style ) , she never betrayed it . She , too , loved publicity , and she had never been blessed with it before . Her first husband had been merely a fat businessmanof remarkable skulduggery , and there had never been anything about him to inspire rhapsodies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money by supplying inferior blankets to the Army , he preferred obscurity . So Mrs. Jaeckle wore her new fame proudly , made over a considerable fortune to her " boy " husband , simpered over him in public , often ostentatiously smoothing back his incorrigible lock of light hair , and posed with him girlishly for press photographers . She also gave out interviews to lady reporters in which she carolled over dear August 's " sweet boyishness , simplicity , profound and scientific mind , and lovable shyness . " This spoke well for the woman 's histrionic ability , for she knew only too shrewdly her husband 's meanness of mind , stupidity , ignorance , avarice and tiny petulancies . She knew , too , that he was capable of only one largeness : hatred . She despised him . But she was grateful to him for lifting her from the anonymous mass , for she was a clever woman , of talents and accomplishments.  |p255But  the public , however adoring , has a new hero every day . August could not compete forever with pretty male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful gangster . Mrs. Jaeckle saw the cloud of worshippers thinning away into air . The shine of the medals was no longer bright enough to dazzle the capricious public eye . Mrs. Jaeckle was indeed clever . Moreover , she had an authentic regard for truly great and noble men . Among her friends was a scientist of supreme achievement , a Belgian count who was , at that time , teaching trigonometry in some obscure New jersey college . Apparently he was doomed to pass his life away in this backwater when he suddenly discoveredsome new system of mathematics which lifted him , for a time , to almost the same precarious fame as the latest Italian murderer in Chicago . Only a few brilliant men even pretended to understand this latest system in the realm of that most classical of the arts , mathematics . But the mystery and the newspaper acclaim made the public conscious of this new hero , though where his heroism lay the average man could not tell . Then , one man understood , one man among the five who pretended the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was Captain August Jaeckle , now almost forgotten . Fame does not always bring lucrative rewards . The Belgian count was only too well aware of this bitter truth , and he did not hesitate much more than a hour before he accepted Mrs. Jaeckle 's check for ten thousand dollars , a permanent annuity of two thousand dollars a year , and a small new house near the campus of his college . For this quiet reward , he let it be known , very reluctantly , that Captain August Jaeckle had long been studying with him , Captain Jaeckle , in his shyness , never before having allowed the public to guess at his secret addiction to mathematics . " It was always a kind of vice with me , " August admitted , with blushes and blinkings of his vapid shining eyes . Two of his elderly former teachers in the Shinehaha High School were greatly amazed at all this , but understanding acutely that there was no fame in rebuttal , they allowed themselves to be interviewed , with photographs , and declared that " dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were very grateful for the substantial checks sent to them by the more grateful Mrs. Jaeckle . The fame of mathematics was good for one year of new and heightened publicity for August . Mrs. Jaeckle was indefatigable . The lust for notoriety was a disease in her fifty-year-old body . She searched feverishly , while the new famep256began to decline , for new fields for August to conquer . She hinted at divorce . The newspapers went wild . She denied the rumor . This was good for two months . She and August would adopt two children . Photographsof a multitude of orphans appeared in the newspapers , with large captions asking pertinently : " Is this the one ? " August , in turn , became famously interested in aviation , mechanics , economics , social problems . He was an authority on President Roosevelt , whom he hated . He gave lectures . ( Mrs. Jaeckle wrote the lectures . ) He travelled about , speaking on practically every subject , always shy and modest and boyish . During this time , Mrs. Jaeckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new social theories of the Administration . This induceda vast and hysterical hatred in her . She found its echo in August , who feared nothing more than poverty and obscurity . August began to speak on " American bolshevism , " " the new American Communism , " " Roosevelt dictatorship , " " international plotters against pure Americanism . " Somewhere , American womanhood , and the Home , were hinted to be under attack by nefarious conspirators in the background . August was famous again . August was invited by the German government to visit the Third Reich , and to see for himself how the new order was operating in Germany , how private property , private enterprise and initiative were rewarded and encouraged , how pure Womanhood was protected , how the youth were trained in physical culture , how the Home was revered . August , accompanied by " Mama , " went to Germany , was feted , photographed , followed by loving crowds ( carefully herded by Stormtroopers into strategic positions for photographers ) , and personally decorated by Hitler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager and vicious little heart swelling with pride and emotion . He was consulted by State Department officials on the " truth " about Germany , and his remarks delighted their hearts . His first lecture , after his return , was in the nature of an apology for German anti-Semitism . His second stated that Germany was invincible in the air , on land , and on sea . His third , that Hitler was a demi-god . " We must learn that there is a new and burgeoning spirit rising in the world ! " he cried , to an audience of fat middle-aged ladies who loved to hear of the masculine contempt of Hitler for everything female . " We must learn that the stream of human evolution can not be damned by foolish idealists and outworn democrats ! We can not escape the dynamic revolution of the human soul , as it is expressed in politics . Politics are history . In Germany , one hears the rumbles of a mighty new birth of thep257world . However we shut our ears , the thunder will penetrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence its voice . We can only ride in its train , if we are cowardly . Or , we can march in the vanguard , with Hitler , if we have courage and pride and the spirit of true America in our hearts . " Always , he spoke with authentic passion and noise , for lately the face of the little Jewish sniper had a terrible way of meeting him every night when he was alone . August was famous again , more famous than ever . The indignation and laughter and furious contempt of his enemies only made him the more famous . Violent controversies took place all over America , in the press , in public forums , in parlors and in kitchens . Bishop Halliday gave a series of radio addresses on this " vibrant young American hero who has heard the call of the Future . " Subversive organizations , already forming in the dark , and bearing heroic names such as Friends of the American Constitution , Guardians of America , Soldiers of Washington , and so on , invited him to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexhaustiblyon the folly of " intervening in European conflicts , " and of giving aid and comfort to Russia , the arch-enemy of Hitler . Hitler was the bulwark against universal bolshevism . Moreover , the war was none of our business . Hitler had never , at any time , dreamt of attacking America . That he intended to do so was the lie of " interventionists , Communists , anti-Christians , international bankers , war-mongers who want profits from the deaths of our boys , first-generation Americans , Moors ' a euphemistic term for Jews , New Deal politicians , who want a war to keep them in power , " and practically everyone who disagreed with August . His slogan , " The Coming Thunder , " inspired a small and best-selling volume written by Franz Haas , who was later indicted as an agent of the German Government . The American public , sweating in secret and terrible uneasiness since the ghastly attack on Poland by Hitler , finally became wildly vociferous and excited . Many sections , heretofore adorers of August , began to despise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pipsqueak , " a fool , a trumpery hero , a masquerader , a petty mountebank , a bumbling numskull , a solemn idiot , an ignoramus and a faker . In their ire , they saw their hero as he was , and their fury against him was a fury against themselves for having been part of his adoring train . His pretensions to learning were unmasked . One of his school-teachers , who had never ceased to regret her duplicity , and who had an ancestor who had fought and suffered with Washington , now declared her folly and her seduction at the hands of Mrs. Jaeckle . But , as no one had ever understood the fame of mathematics anyway , this one trembling voice was hardly heard . Serious and intelligent men attacked August in the press , in the pulpit , and over the radio waves . They stripped him naked . They exposed him to the jeers of their enlightened listeners . One by one , they demolished his foolish arguments . They denounced him as a dupe and an imbecile , a two-penny actor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on his alleged aversion to publicity . However , as these men were intelligent gentlemen of learning , wisdomand understanding , the American people disliked them intensely . They preferred the screamers who defended August , for these screamers were violent , colorful , dramatic and vicious . Their lies were extravagant and monstrous , and inspired the delight of the masses . They preached the vilest hatred , and the masses squirmed with sadistic lust . " Lie to the people , tickle them in their prejudices , make them itch for blood , especially the blood of the defenseless , make them hate , make them long to destroy and murder , and you can do with them as you please , " said Bishop Halliday , who was a very astute servant of Christ , and also a dear friend and servant of Baron von Teckle , Charge d'Affaires at the German Embassy . In the South , where lived Americans of old British blood , August was anathema . In most parts of the West , this was also true , except in those regions infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populations of the large Northern cities , whose peoples stemmed from Poland , Italy and Germany , and Ireland . After one tellinglecture by August , many Jews were attacked on the streets of New York . Bishop Halliday was delighted . All this , however , while making August very famous , or infamous , did nothing to increase his fortune , or rather , Mrs. Jaeckle 's fortune . August was ripe for subsidy . Rosemarie Bouchard knew Mrs. Jaeckle quite well , and she sought her out very discreetly . The details were never known . But , suddenly , August became an officer in the America Only Committee , and under its auspices acquired a high and solid respectability . Rosemarie polished his scripts , wrote many of his public addresses . He , who in the past had adored no one but himself , began to adore her , to follow ler about , to touch her hand shyly , to dream about her . This dark and vital woman , who in no wise resembled " Mama , " nor Mrs. Jaeckle ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his senses . He wouldp259have worked for her for no reward at all but her smile , and the promise in that smile . Captain August Jaeckle became one of the most momentous and dangerous figures in contemporary American history during the first year of the second great World War . Rosemarie Bouchard had found her hero for the America Only Committee . Antoine 's faction was highly pleased . ANTOINE , with those deft and graceful gestures , that insouciant manner , which he had inherited from his grandfather , Jules , poured another measure of cointreau into his Uncle Christopher 's delicate glass . He smiled as he did so . Christopher leaned back in his chair , held his glass to the light , appreciatively , and smiled also . " So , you 've got Eagle Aviation , too , " remarked Antoine , seating himselfagain , and lifting his glass in a light salute . " Good judgment on old Stone Face 's part . Give the devil his due , he generally picks the right man . You wo n't be returning to Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida and Detroit . We have plans for building a large plant in Buffalo , also , and perhaps Los Angeles . Henri has hinted that the British Government has already approached him with an offer to assist in the building of the plants . The cash-andcarryplan will soon be in operation . There 's always a way of getting around the Neutrality Act , and good old Hugo is working on the State Department to that effect . " Antoine laughed . " Playing both ends against the middle  --  the usual Bouchard game . In this war , we 'll do it for a while . Not that I approve of it , of course . We have our plans . Britain must n't be supplied with too much . That was our original idea . You still agree ? " " Of course , " replied Christopher , gravely . He turned the glass in his fleshless and transparent fingers and regarded his nephew fixedly with his silvery gray eyes , so enigmatic and motionless . The two men were sitting together very cozily in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned on the black marble hearth , and a dim gray snow was falling softly outside , this early December day . " I think we 'd better call a meeting , Chris , " suggested Antoine , after a thoughtful stare at the fire.  | " The sooner the better . Hugo is coming home for Christmas , and I understand he is bringing Senator Briggs with him , and one or two others . We must move fast , now . I have it on excellent authority that France will collapse in the spring . That will be the beginning of the end . " Antoine 's glittering smile flashed in the darkness of the warm room . " The end ! The end of the British Empire ! You know , I 've always hated the British . Perhaps it is the French in me . So , I 've a personal reason . How long do you conjecture it will be before the Lion is smashed to a pulp ? " Christopher was silent for a few moments . Then he said , softly : " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Stalin 's signed a pact with Hitler , has n't he ? " Now Christopher smiled his curious icy smile . " I 'll tell you something else . Hitler will attack Russia some time next summer . " " Impossible ! " But Antoine was staring piercingly at his uncle . " Not until England is done . You think England will be done by then , though ? " " No , " said Christopher , placidly , " I do n't . And because England wo n't be smashed , Hitler will turn east . That 's always been his mission , you know . " Antoine rose swiftly to his feet and began to walk up and down the room . He was frowning intently . " I do n't like this . You never speak without knowing what you are talking about , Christopher . If Hitler attacks Russia before England is done --  " Then , " said Christopher , very softly , " he is done . " There was silence in the room , as Antoine moved silently up and down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaunt and sunken face . But he could read nothing there , though the red fire flashed up on the fragile taut bones and made vivid holes of the eyesockets . " He must be stopped , " said Antoine , at last , pausing before his uncle . " How ? " " I 'm going to New York next week . Von Teckle will meet me there . " " That 's dangerous , Antoine . If you are seen . " " I wo n't be . Will you go with me ? " Christopher hesitated . Then he said : " Yes . " Antoine sat down again on the edge of his chair , his sinewy thin arms folded on his knees . He regarded Christopher in a long silence , smiling in a peculiar fashion . " I 'd like to be sure of you , Chris , " he remarked , very softly  |p261Christo|pher  shrugged . " My dear Papa used to say : Never trust anyone but the devil . ' " " You are in this with us very deep , Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire again with a gentle expression . Now Christopher was smiling his enjoyment . " Are you blackmailing me , by any chance ? " Antoine , smiling in return , made a Latin gesture with those agile brown hands of his . " Of course not ! Certainly not ! But , as my dear grandpapa said : Never trust anyone but the devil . ' You are n't quite a devil , Chris . But old Stone Face would be hard to convince . " Christopher studied him oddly . " You are still afraid of him , eh ? " Antoine flashed him a shrewd glance , full of light hatred and ire . But he said , humorously : " You must remember that my darling papa is Annette 's papa , too . And while that fact remains , Henri 's got Bouchard . I 've been thinking . " " Yes ? " prompted Christopher , softly . But Antoine turned his black and jerking eyes upon him penetratingly before he answered . " Do you think the Gray Glacier has forgotten his penchant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But every nervous muscle along his body tightened . He said : " I do n't know . Has he ? " Antoine rose again , and moved to the windows . He gazed out upon the snow . Without turning , he asked : " And  --  if he has n't  --  what is your position ? " Christopher placed his glass carefully on the table , very neatly , very precisely . " My position ? I have n't any . Celeste can manage her own affairs , for all of me . She is n't a child . What she does is her own choice . I can tell you this , however : she wo n't divorce our dying Galahad . " " But , after he is dead ? " " Henri knows on which side his bread is buttered . He wo n't divorce Annette . Can you imagine him doing anything so indiscreet ? So disastrous ? " " No , " admitted Antoine , turning from the window . He thrust his hands in his pockets . This gesture did not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of its grace . Now his face was in such shadow that Christopher could not see it . But he felt its malignant alertness . " You know , of course , that our angel Celeste has been meeting the Iron Man in some cosy rendezvous in New York , quite regularly ? " For the first time Christopher showed some perturbation . His hands tightened on the arms of his chair . But he said calmly : " Has she ? Who is your informant ? " He felt , rather than saw , Antoine 's wicked smile . " I ca n't tell you that . But I know the source is authentic . Is it possible you are disturbed , Chris ? " Christopher deliberately relaxed himself . " No , " he said . " As I 've remarked before , it is Celeste 's affair . But what is all this leading to ? " Antoine came back to his chair , sat down , leaned towards his uncle , his smile very broad and sparkling . " Yes , you 're in with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just how deep . We 've kept minutes , you know . Incidentally , he still has n't the slightest idea ? " " I can vouch for that , " said Christopher , keeping his voice neutral . " If he had , do n't you think he would have moved before this ? He can still smash us . Yes , as you 've so subtly pointed out , I 'm in this deep . But , as I asked you a moment or two ago : What is all this leading to ? " " Just this , " replied Antoine , in a sweet tone . " If my little sister should hear of these delightful rendezvous , I imagine she will divorce the Gray Glacier promptly . And  --  if there is a divorce  --  " He threw up his hands swiftly , pursed his lips as if blowing away a feather . " Henri is done , " concluded Christopher . " Well done . My fat brother will throw him out of Bouchard , bonds or no bonds . Of course , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you thought of that ? " Antoine was silent . His brown face puckered drily . His eyes fastened on Christopher 's bloodless face , in which the mouth was smiling ever so slightly . " The plan  --  your plan  --  smells , " said Christopher , still in a very gentle tone . " We ca n't risk the smashing of Bouchard . Ever heard of Samson ? There 's something about Henri that reminds me of Samson . " He paused , then continued : " If he wrecked Bouchard , he 'd wreck himself , you 'd say . And what of you ? You 're Secretary of Bouchard . Would you enjoy being part of the wreckage ? " Antoine did not answer . He began to rub his puckered mouth very daintily with one forefinger . It was not a usual habit with him . Christophersaw the gesture , and suddenly it was as if there had occurred an appalling explosion in his chest . He remembered that gesture , delicate , reflective ; it was his father 's very own . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fantastic and irresistible hatred for Antoine . His hands clenched on the arms of his chair , and his transparent nostrilsp263dilated . By some trick of the firelight , playing on Antoine 's features , so brown and taut and narrow , it was Jules ' face that was turned to Christopher . " You would n't enjoy the wreckage , " he repeated , in a strangely hoarse voice . Antoine began to smile . " So . You are still involved with your darling , eh ? " The explosion of uncontrolled hatred in Christopher was still shaking him . But he said , calmly enough : " Suppose we leave my sister out of this ? I 've merely pointed out to you that you ca n't polish off Henri without ruining yourself . Do you want to risk it ? " He was surprised when Antoine said thoughtfully : " I 'd like to see the old fool 's will . Of course , Annette will have her share . There is also my share . There will be provision , naturally , for Henri to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to know the exact terms of the will . Have you any idea ? Papa is your brother , after all . " " We 've not been very devoted , you will remember , " Christopher pointed out . His triumph was hardly less disastrous in its physical effect on him than his hatred . " He 'd hardly confide in me . " " You 've got the same firm of lawyers . You could find out , Chris . A few discreet questions . " Christopher was silent , But he was smiling again . He gloated inwardly . For the first time , he had exulted over his father in exulting over Antoine . Antoine sighed , flung out his hands again . " Yes , as you 've remarked , the plan smells . I was very fond of it . There were personal implications , too . I 'll keep it in mind , however . If we are forced to use it , you wo n't object . " " Why should I ? " Antoine was suddenly relieved as he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . By that time , most probably , it wo n't matter . Old Stone Face wo n't be in a position to smash Bouchard , Still , I 'd like to know about that will . " He studied Christopher intently . " I 'm rather fond of my own sister , too . " Christopher laughed a little . " You know how she adores Henri . Annette'sno imbecile . I would n't be at all surprised if she had some idea of Henri 's frequent little depredations . Wives always know by some damned intuition . If she has n't made any objection in the past , she wo n't , now , "  | " She might be forced to . " Christopher lit a cigarette . " I would n't rely on that . And now , sit. : II we drop that subject ? We have more important things to discuss , 1 think , than the state of women 's hearts . " Antoine began to laugh amiably . " How do you like our hero , Jaeckle ? He 's costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . " " It was a clever move , " admitted Christopher . " Five thousand dollars ? Out of whose pocket ? " " The general fund , of course . Rosemarie managed it very nicely . At our next meeting , I suggest a considerable increase in the funds for the Committee . It now has three more subsidiary committees , too , whip h need financing . Especially in the South , among the Ku Kluxers . We 're taking up the Negro angle , there . Negroes in the South , Jews in the North , Mexicans in the South-west , labor in the East . A very neat program , if I say it myself . We can so disorganize the damn country that it will stop staring at Europe for a while . We need that , while we complete our plans . Hitler must have a clear field ; he must n't be annoyedby alarmed preparations in America . Disunity must be stimulated . It wo n't be hard . The mob has n't the brains of a louse . " Rosemarie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated her enough . She is now organizing a pacifist society to be called Mothers of America . ' All the mamas in the throes of libido will join with enthusiasm , to protect their boys : We 've begun to subsidize Halliday , too , as you know . Three thousand a month . Our next step will be to organize the middle class . Have you heard of that Irish scoundrel , Patrick McHenry , of New York ? He 's been clamoring for years that Roosevelt is out to liquidate the middle class , but no one has listened to him very closely because he lacks funds . We intend to supply them . " Christopher had been listening keenly . At intervals , he had nodded his head with an air of grave approval . " We 'll give Roosevelt enough to think of right at home without troubling his tender heart over Europe , " added Antoine . He paused . " You think all this very crude ? It lacks finesse ? When has it ever been necessary to use elegant tactics with he masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't said I 've thought it crude , " said Christopher . Antoine thought of something else . " By the way , have you heard the latest commentator , Gilbert Small ? We 're outlining a plan for Jaeckle to denounce him as a Communist , a tool of Stalin , a war-monger , an interventionist and hireling of the New Deal and dupe of Britain . Wep265have a dossier on him . It 's unfortunate that he is n't a Jew . He is n't even a New Yorker , which is always good for our brand of propaganda . He 's a Middle-Westerner , and his mother is a native of Martin Dies ' own State . All this has disarmed us , temporarily . He , too , again unfortunately , is a war hero . We tried to find a connection between him and the Spanish Communists , but I must admit that his dispatches to his former newspaper , the New York Times , were fine examples of neutral and dispassionate reporting . Moreover , as you know , he wrote a book on Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , for public purposes , he is a Communist . We 've put pressure on the broadcasting chain which allows him to spill his trash on the air . But for some mysterious reason they are resistant , in spite of threats . And , mystery again , he is acquiring a huge following in America . Have you heard him at all ? " " Yes , " said Christopher , thoughtfully , " I have . His scripts are excellent . Just the right amount of fire , and very logical . Simple , too , and moving . Not his style , which was always rather dull and reportorial . I wonder who is really writing his scripts ? " " We 've tried to discover that , too . But it remains a mystery . He 's dangerous to us . He 's connected with the American Freedom Association . I 'd like to know who is financing that Association , too . None of our boys , you can be sure of that . " Christopher 's face was properly serious and interested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Committee has over three million members to date , while the American Freedom Associationhas less than two million , if that . And our Committee is growinglarger every day . " He laughed . " The Association has made the mistake of hiring gentlemen and scholars , with the exception of Small . Whereas we concentrate on clever hoodlums , rabble-rousers and liars . Consequently , we shall always be more potent in America than the Association . " His spirits were rising . His love for intrigue was rampant . Christopher watched him closely . " Have you been to see your revered father-in-law , Boland , recently , about shipments of oil and aluminum to Germany ? And what about Canada ? The shipment of nickel ? " " I 'm to see him while I am in New York , Chris . Italy has almost enough aluminum for Hitler . But the petroleum and the nickel are other matters . The nickel problem will be settled next week . Our subsidiaryin Canada has its orders . It is just a matter of quiet ships to South America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than this : I 'm to see Phyllis 's husband and father-in-law , the Morse National , next week . Hitler needs huge funds in the near future . Loans can be arranged through the banks in South America , not to mention the Banque de France and the Bank of England , and others . Dr. Schacht will meet our representatives in Switzerland sometime during the next three months . By the way , Rosemarie 's little sister , Phyllis , is organizing the Catholic Wives and Mothers of America , to assist our Committee . W e expect it to be a potent organization . " There was a soft tap at the door , which opened slowly , to reveal the rosy round face of Mrs. Antoine . " Tea , dears , " she chirped , fondly . " And darling Annette is here , too , Uncle Christopher . Have you finished your very , very important business ? " THERE was a great hot fire in one of the vast drawing-rooms , and there , as though crouching about heat and light in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadowy carved ceiling far overhead , sat young Mrs. Antoine , Annette and Armand . The firelightsparkled rosily on the pale silver , picking out the elaborate curve of handle or lid , and lying in pink reflection in the waiting shells of teacups . Behind them lurked the dim shapes of heavy furniture and the glimmering backs of long tables , like prehistoric animals , half-seen in the flickering light . The draperies had been drawn on windows that reached from floor to ceiling , and were the shape of cathedral apertures . But the wind roared and bent against them like a strong resistant presence , and in quieter intervals one could hear the dry hiss of snow . Sometimes the fire flared up to show the dark gilded portraits on the walls , their spectral faces seemingly coming alive and growing vivid for an instant . Antoine and Christopher joined the group about the fire . Antoine was all affability , his sparkling smile quite radiant and full of laughter . Mrs. Antoine , serenely pouring tea , glanced at him fondly from time to time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her short plump figure already betraying signs of approaching maternity . Dear Tony is such a wit , she thought to herself . He quite brightens up even such a day as this . She was very happy . Armand had spread a huge white napkin over his fat knees . Hisp267clothing , as usual , was crumpled and soiled . Between the spaces of his thin gray curls his big round scalp gleamed . He had become very old these last three months , but calmer , almost contented , since the marriage of his son . Behind his glasses , his tiny black eyes were less frightened , less apprehensive . Nevertheless , when he saw Antoine and Christopher , his pudgy features tightened , and he said , in a strange voice : " Winter 's come early this year . " Christopher lifted his head alertly and turned his enigmatic eyes upon his brother . But Antoine said lightly : " Wars always bring early and hard winters . " " What 've you two been plotting about , again ? " asked Armand , wiping away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again that smile was uneasy , and fearful , and cunning . " Would you like to know ? " countered Christopher , and now a cruel and amused gleam passed over his attenuated face . Armand lifted his hands and fluttered them . The plate tilted precariouslyon his knee , and he caught it just as it was about to slide , with its contents , upon the floor . " No , no , " he said , very quickly , and with another frightened smile . " I 'm done with all that . I only want to be left in peace . " He rubbed a drop or two of tea from his vest . Christopher saw that his hand was shaking . The old man , his eyes searching for refuge , encounteredhis daughter , Annette . " Tony never plots ; he 's too gay , " said young Mrs. Antoine , gracefullyfilling cups for her husband and " Uncle Christopher . " " She means , the darling , that I have n't the brains to plot , ' " said Antoine , deftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Antoine smiled comfortably . " How you change the meaning of my words ! I never meant that , Tony . I only meant you are just too sweet and happy to care much about anything except your books and your pictures . And some are such ugly pictures ! Especially that  --  that Renoir . Such fat women ; no shape at all . " " In the sunlight , your body would look just like a Renoir , " saidAntoine , gallantly . " All rosy plumpness and mother-of-pearl shadows . " Mrs. Antoine giggled and blushed . " How would you know , younaughty boy ? You 've never seen me in sunlight . " Annette , beyond greeting her brother and uncle with a faint smile , had said nothing . She sat near her father , her black wool dress making her appear more fragile and wan than ever . Her little triangular face was quite haggard , and seemed to have dwindled lately . But the great pale-blue eyes , so full of light , were gentler and more profound than they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine light hair , so that her head was haloed . Antoine 's vivid glance dwelt on her musingly for a moment . Then he said : " Where 's the Iron Man ? Did n't he come with you , Ann-ette ? " " No . He had to leave for Washington this morning . I presume you mean Henri ? " replied Annette , with her quiet bright smile . " I think Henri 's a darling , " prattled Mrs. Antoine , looking about her contentedly , and loving her relatives . " He says the nicest things to me . He told me last week that I was just what I was made for , and that you deserved me , Tony . Was n't that sweet ? " " Very , " answered Antoine , wryly . Christopher was laughing , his silent and virulent laughter which made his death's-head of a face quite startling in the firelight . Antoine again turned to his sister . " You came alone , rabbit ? Why did n't Celeste come , too ? I thought you were such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny sandwich from the gilt plate which Mrs. Antoine was pressing upon her . Her face was very calm and still . " Celeste 's in New York . Last minute discussion with the decorators . I understand there are a pair of silver lamps on Madison Avenue that she wants , and the decorators are quite violently against them . She intends to settle the argument , and bring the lamps back with her . " " So , " said Antoine , slowly , looking at Christopher , and smiling evilly , " you and Peter are alone in your tombs . You in your warm tomb , and Peter in his glass and chromium mausoleum . You ought to have invitedhim , Mary . " For an instant Mary was uneasy and embarrassed . " Oh , I 've invited both Uncle Peter and Aunt Celeste very often , dear ! But they never come . They have n't been here since October . Dear Uncle Peter depressesme so ; he looks so ill . And Dr. Gordon does n't think I should be depressed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and texture of plaster again . He sipped his tea thoughtfully . But Antoine was grinning diabolically . He hummed very softly under his breath . " Celeste hopes to have the new house completely ready by Christmas , " remarked Annette . " She has already invited us for Christmas dinner . All of the family who will be in Windsor at that time . There are only a few things to do to complete the house . "  | " Such as the lamps , from Madison Avenue , " agreed Antoine , smiling at her . For a long moment brother and sister regarded each other in a suddenly rigid silence . Annette 's little face was pale and shining , her eyes resolutely bright . " Such as the lamps , " she agreed , at last . Her hand did not shake as she held her cup . As he stared at her , Antoine 's face lost its evil look , became dark and closed and brown in the wavering light . There was a peculiar pain in his chest , a most unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that she still gazed at him , indomitable in her fragility , and at bay . She knows , he thought . " Have you listened to any newscasts today , Papa ? " he asked Armand . Armand hurriedly chewed and swallowed a hard little nugget of a cake before he replied . " No . I never listen to ' em . Too depressing . I 've had my fill of troubles . I 'm letting the world wag along by itself . " He smiled uneasily , and again his eyes sought refuge . " I listened to William Benson , this afternoon , " chirped Mrs. Antoine . " I always think one should keep up . And things are so thrilling now , so exciting . It 's so easy to be frightened . But Mr. Benson is so reassuring . He says we must be calm , and sensible . We must just look on , and hold our peace . Europe is none of our business . Hitler is n't threatening us . There 're three thousand miles of water , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps airplanes can , " said Annette , looking affectionately at her brother 's wife . But Mrs. Antoine was quite superior . " Mr. Benson went into that , Annette darling . No airplane could make a round trip . Besides , Hitler is n't interested in us at all ! This is a European quarrel ; they 're always quarrelling , those strange creatures with the outlandish names . It has nothing to do with us . Mr. Benson is so clever . He had a lot of argumentswhich I did n't quite understand , but I know they were clever . He understands so many things , more than poor little me does . " Christopher looked at Antoine . " Is n't Benson the new commentator for the Green Network ? And is n't he the American Association of Industrialists ' man ? " Antoine was very arch . " I would n't know that . So far as I know , he is on the Limey Lemonade half-hour . Limey Lemonade ! God ! You 've got to admit we Americans have an unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uneasiness . " Do we have to talk about the war ? Have n't we pleasanter things to discuss ? "  |p270There  was real fear and distress on his fat and swollen face . " Such as The List ? " suggested Antoine . He turned to his wife . " What is it tonight ? Liver ? " Mrs. Antoine bridled . She shook her little pink finger at him , with a smile . " Now , now , Tony . It 's Thursday , and we always have liver on Thursday . It 's so good for Papa . Full of vitamins , and blood , I think . It 's good for you , too . " Antoine shuddered elaborately , and the others laughed . " What are you having for dinner tonight , Annette ? " he asked his sister . " I do n't really know , " she smiled in answer . " I think it 's capon . Our housekeeper mentioned it this morning , I believe . Or perhaps it 's capon for tomorrow . Why ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll drive home with you , " he said . Mrs. Antoine 's face was puckering as if she was about to cry . " Oh , Tony . How can you be so bad ? You have n't had dinner with us since last Friday . You are n't really going away tonight ? I think there are onions for you , if you want them , with the liver . " He patted her hand . " If Annette is n't having capon , I 'll stay for the liver , " he promised . " I 'm mad about capon . They call me Capon in New York . " " I doubt it , " said Christopher . " I really doubt it . I could give in-stances . " Even Armand laughed at this . But Mary looked from one mirthful face to another in great puzzlement . " I never understand your jokes , " she complained . " Please explain it to me . " " Uncle Christopher was just being vulgar , pet , " said her husband , patting her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher was glancing at his watch . " It 's almost six . If you do n't mind , Antoine , I 'd like to listen to our mysterious Gilbert Small to-night . " " The radio ? " exclaimed Armand . " Do we have to listen to that thing blare ? " But Christopher had already risen , and was making his way to a tall Chippendale cabinet which housed the radio . The dial sprang into light . A moment later a quiet masculine voice invaded the great room . " This is your KLDB announcer speaking . We are glad to bring you again at this hour Mr. Gilbert Small , authority on European affairs . Mr. Small 's opinions are not necessarily those of this Station 's . He has no commercial sponsor , and therefore speaks frankly , as he chooses . "  |p271There  was a short wait . Armand 's teacup clattered irritably on his saucer , and he sighed and shifted noisily in his chair . " I do n't know why  --  " he mumbled . " May I give you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She began to chatter brightly and clearly as Mr. Small 's grave firm voice emerged from the radio . Antoine turned to her , and said softly : " My pet , will you please shut your mouth for a moment ? " She stared at him blankly , her mouth falling open , her eyelids blinking . She glanced miserably at Annette , but Annette was leaning forward a little in her chair , her eyes fixed on the radio . Christopher stood near the cabinet , his head bent . " Today , " said Mr. Small , " the Nazis murdered ten thousand men , women and children in Poland . Today , one thousand Czech students were shot to death in Praha . The oldest was seventeen . Today , in a pogrom in Munich , two thousand little Jewish children were dragged from their mothers ' arms and pushed aboard cattle trains for shipment into death . Today , twenty Austrian intellectuals were murdered in a cellar in Vienna . " There is a great calm in America . Tonight , in a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifty thousand dollars . Tonight , in a New York theatre , a crooner is drawing an audience of six thousand titillating women and girls , who will sigh and swoon all over each other as his sweet voice thrills them to their toes . The streets of America are filled with men and women carrying bundles of Christmaspresents . In Hollywood , Marianne Vincent has announced she intendsto divorce her fifth husband very shortly . I said we were calm . No . We are very excited . We have such important things to think of . But not one of these things concerns the events in Poland , CzechoSlovakia , Munich , or Vienna . You see , Poland , Czecho-Slovakia , Munichand Vienna are so far away , and the people are so strange . They are not really our brothers and our sisters and our children . They are creatures apart . " " Too true , " murmured Mrs. Antoine , happily , forgetting her husband'ssnub . She looked about her for the usual affectionate smiles . But every face was grave , turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest ; his hands were slack and flaccid as they hung from the ends of his dropped arms . " Tonight , " continued Mr. Small , " when I heard these things , I had the most curious vision of a certain garden standing in the sunset . A quite mythical garden , you will agree . It is very silent in the garden ; over the great dark trees the sunset is red as fire , and burning vividly.  |p272Even  the birds are quiet , and the river near by flows onward without a sound , its surface blazing with crimson light . There is peace in the garden ; the flowers bend their heads . But all at once ( and this is only my vision , you understand ) , I see a dead man lying there , a very innocent young man . His sleeping face is covered with blood . It is very sad . He has never wronged anyone ; he has never injured a living soul . He has only been happy , and has only wanted to live peaceably with his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brutal and savage hand . Where is the murderer ? He is hiding somewhere among those trees , crouching in their black tangled shadow , his hands covering his sweating face . " The sunset darkens . And then , all at once , a terrible and furious wind blows through the trees , bending them , whitening them , throwing them up against the red sky . The birds cry out in the branches . The flowers turn pale as death and hang their heads , falling to the ground . And out of the wind comes a great Voice , echoing from space : Where is Abel , thy brother ? ' " Somewhere , out of that cavern of twisted tree-trunks , out of the fury and turbulence of wind and the cosmic Voice , comes a faint whisper : Am I my brother 's keeper ? ' " Mr. Small 's voice was suddenly still . But the air vibrated with its memory . Christopher lifted his stark and motionless face and looked at Antoine , who was smiling widely . Armand did not stir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair . Annette 's little hands were clenched on her knees . Mrs. Antoine sat gaping near the fire , blinking her eyes , bewildered and confused . Then Mr. Small 's voice rose on a loud arch of accusing sound : " I hear the Voice again ( and again I must warn my listeners that all this is just a dream of mine ) . And the Voice cries out : What hast thou done ? The voice of thy brother 's blood crieth unto Me from the ground : " He paused again , with passion , and then resumed : " You will say to me , my listeners , that you are not Cain , that you did not slay Abel in the peaceful garden , that it is not his blood that cries out against you . But I tell you that you are Cain , that you did slay Abel , that it is his blood that is crying out against all of America , against all of the world . If we did not actually lift our hands today , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gave our consent to the real murderer . We gave the consent of silence . We knew the garden of deathp273was there . But we were off in the town , celebrating and adoring our pugilists and our crooners , our Hollywood strumpets . If we heard the Voice that cried out from space to us , we merely told the latest band maestro to beat his drum the louder , to call on his trumpeters to shrill more deafeningly . It was none of our business . Cain was not threatening us . There was the river between the garden and the town , and the river kept us safe from him . It was too far for him to swim . Besides , it was just a local quarrel between Cain and his brother , and was no concern of ours . We 've always known that the two brothers have fought for years , and it had become very boring . " We did not hear the Voice when it turned from Cain and cried out to us : And now art thou cursed from the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blood from thy hand .  --  A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth . ' " And that , my friends , is what America has become today : a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth , hiding and whimpering in theatres and stadiums , while Abel lies dead in the garden . It must be a most horrible sight to God , to see us here . He must be quite sickened . Once , I imagine , He was proud of us . Once , we were valiant and strong and brave , and full of indignation against oppressors and murderers . Now we condone them . Now we finance them . Now we send them weapons to kill more innocents . Now we silence those who would warn us that Cain is at our very door , the Cain we have admired , financed , condoned , for half a dozen years . In future broadcasts , I shall tell the names , outline the machinations , of the men who have done these things , who have conspiredagainst you , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very active . They will become more active in the future , lying to you , lulling you , deceiving you , so that you may not rise up and demand arms against your enemies , and revenge for the death of the innocents who were murdered today , and the greater number who will be murderedtomorrow . You see , they believe Cain can be their weapon against a free America . They do not want a free America . They want a nation of slaves . You . And you . And you . " Will they succeed ? Will the sleeping soul of America brighten once more into reality and power and passion ? I do n't know . Only you can give the answer . I , myself , am very afraid . I am afraid that America has sold her dream for a handful of lollypops . " There is a couplet of Wordsworth 's which I should like to quote to you now :  | " Whither is fled the visionary gleam ? Where is it now , the glory and the dream ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then his voice dropped into profound silence . Christopher turned off the radio , and then stood by it . He and Antoine exchanged a sharp look . " Melodramatic claptrap , " said Antoine . " If that 's the best he can do , he 'll be no danger . " " I do n't know , " mused Christopher . " I 'm not so sure of that . " IIc came slowly back to the fire . " Remember : melodrama appeals to the mob . " " But not if bayonets are at their backs . They 're deaf to any appeal which urges them to fight , or endangers their bellies . They 'll listen more readily to a man who urges them to hide in the cellar , and promises them full bellies if they keep their mouths shut . " Now Annette spoke , her light voice quite vibrant and swift , her blue eyes flashing strangely in the firelight . " You have a very low opinion of the American people , have n't you , Antoine ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't just an opinion . It 's personal knowledge . There are some fools who believe that Americans can still feel the impulse to rise to an ideal , to sacrifice that others may live , and all the other trash . I do n't believe it . As our Mr. Small so poignantly pointed out : they prefer Hollywood strumpets , lollypops and prizefighters . A nation like that has no mind , no spirit , no decency , no pride or intelligence . You see , I 'm very frank . " Annette was silent . But her small thin body was taut as bent steel . " I think Mr. Small is horrid , " prattled Mrs. Antoine . " He 's just a war-monger , like Mr. Roosevelt . He wants our boys to die on foreign soil . Just for the Jews , or the Czechs , or somebody . Did you hear CaptainJaeckle the other night ? He says nobody wants to attack us , and besides , we 've got three thousand miles of water between us and Hitler . Somebody ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to get us into war , and we wo n't ! The mothers wo n't let the war-mongers take our boys away to die . " Antoine gestured towards his wife , but grinned at Christopher . " There speaks the voice of the American people , " he said , sardonically . " What more do you want ? " No one noticed Armand . His eyes were closed . He appeared to sleep . Even when the visitors got up to go , he still lay immobile in his chair.  |p275Later  that week , Christopher was shut up with Henri . He had talked for an hour , while Henri had listened , sometimes jotting down a note or two . " Yes , I think it 's a good idea for you to go with him to that conference , " said Henri . " This is very interesting , indeed . He has no suspicions , of course ? " " He hinted I was in very deep , ' " said Christopher , laughing . " He has a light hand with blackmail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , curiously , " there is something about Small 's broadcasts which sound familiar . You would n't have any idea who writes his scripts , or who is buying him time on the network ? " Henri regarded him blandly , with a faint smile . " No . Why should I ? " HUGO BOUCHARD , second brother of Peter , and Assistant to the Secretary of State , lived magnificently in Washington with his handsome wife , the former Christine Southward , whose father had been " Billie " Southward , Chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania . Hugo had inherited this lofty position after the death of the rotund and affable Billie , and because of his own personality , which was bluff , amiable , easily moved to laughter , and possessed of those extrovert qualities of fellowship , good humor , open sympathy and expansive reasonableness , had become even twice as popular as his father-in-law , which was quite an accomplishment . A lawyer of considerable parts and acumen , he still received a large salary from Endicott James of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . His own private fortune , augmented by the million and a half of his wife 's , was gigantic , a fact which he , for many reasons , kept modestly to himself . His brother , Jean , had declared that he was a club in brown velvet with a gold handle , a remark that was not without its astuteness . For Hugo Bouchard was large and solid of frame , without flabbiness or bulginess , and had a commandingpresence which inspired confidence rather than timidity . He had a big buff-colored face , bright golden eyes full of laughter and friendliness , a blunt and amiable nose , a big gay mouth with excellent flashing teeth . His hair , once buff-colored also , was now a silvery mass of thick shining waves , though he was only in his early fifties . All this ,  | combined with a certain splendor and warmth and solidity , made him the ideal politician , trusted by many , disliked by few , even his enemies , and admired by almost everyone . With all these admirable assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very few discerned that here was a consummate rascal , an avaricious and relentlessman , a man without scruple and without conscience . Even his wife hardly knew this , for he was quite moral in sexual matters , and was a devoted father to his three young daughters , Elsie , Alice and Joan . The only one who really understood him , and disliked him without reservations , was his youngest child , his son , Hilary , now almost seventeen years old . No man really likes to be " understood . " Hugo was no exception . He had taken an almost immediate dislike to Hilary , when the child had been hardly a week old . For Hugo was of that thoroughly masculine nature which tends to adore daughters and feel an indifference to sons . He doted on the three girls . Christine doted on Hilary . This annoyed Hugo . Hilary was small and brown and puckered , " like the damned Jules line , " Hugo declared , contemptuously . ( He did not admire his relative , Antoine , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Antoine 's grandfather . ) As Hugo had a hearty admiration for the " Aryan " type of physique , which he fondly believed tended to the tall , the robust , the solid and clumsily masculine , accompanied by fairness and " openness " of countenance , Hilary 's elegant smallness , his delicate features and hands , his sharp black eyes , his slight smile , subtle even in early childhood , his wryness and Latin grace , affronted and repelled him . Moreover , Hilary displayed an unusual and brilliant intelligence , and an endless zest for knowledge . He also loved all things of beauty , and so worshipped his handsome mother . Christine , a not very bright woman , yet possessed the intuition of love , and so all her presents to her son displayed exquisite taste and thoughtfulness . She filled his room , even in childhood , with objets d'art which she had sedulously ferreted out in New York , Paris , Vienna and London . She was speechless with passionate admiration for his wit and grace , and found no music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tutors . At sixteen , he was admitted to Harvard . Hugo , in spite of himself , and in spite of his contempt for learning and all the intellectual arts , was moved temporarilyto reluctant pride . Hilary 's forte was mathematics , that great and classic art . Hugo wanted the lad to study law , and often jokingly declared that Hilary would soon be invaluable to the Bouchards . He alsop277remarked that while Antoine was an adequate " Understudy " to Jules , it would be Hilary who would inherit the subtle fame of Jules Bouchard . This remark betrayed Hugo 's profound ignorance of his son . For Hilary , though possessing a remarkable resemblance to Antoine , and to Antoine 's grandfather , and showing all those apparent traits of character : keenness , wryness , cynicism and wit , which had been the **26;9589;TOOLONG of Jules , had a quite different form of spirit , which few ever discerned . For , amazingly , this young replica of Jules resembled his Uncle Peter in character . He was honorable , brave , steadfast and compassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was inclined to be blunt , angry , aggressively honest , and somberly quiet on occasion , Hilary was shrewd , skeptical , cynical and disillusioned , by nature . Moreover , he possessed an enormous and delicate tact , and a highly developed sense of humor , a balance of temperament which was incredible in one so young , and a keen awareness of the necessity of keeping his own counsel practically always . There was little of the dreamer in him , but , oddly , much of the mystic . His conversation was delightful ; his air very " soigne , " to quote the infatuated Christine . " He looks too much like Goebbels to suit me , " was Hugo 's disparaging remark . " All the damned Latin Bouchards look like Goebbels . " This remark , when quoted to Antoine , and others of the faintly " Jules line , " did nothing to endear Hugo to his relatives . Hilary , very early , took an unremitting dislike to the Family , with very few exceptions . He had seen Peter only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feeling a great and sad compassionfor him , he considered him , regretfully , something of a fool . In Hilary 's opinion , only fools disarmed themselves , made themselves vulnerable , by reason of their very integrity and honesty . Hilary believed that one 's character should be known only to oneself and to God , and , preferably , only to oneself . One should show the world only what one desired the world to see , and as virtue was always suspect , and integrity derided , these traits should be guarded like a golden treasure and unlockedonly upon extreme occasions . As a result of this philosophy , very Few of the Bouchards knew anything at all about Hilary , and he was unanimously declared to be Jules ' complete replica , even more so than Antoine . Hilary had a deep affection for Annette , a casual fondness for his three sisters , who worshipped him in spite of their beloved father 's aversion , a complete indifference for practically every other member of the family , and , very strangely , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri , " having disdained to disentangle the ramifications of relationship . He was too balanced and too cool to hate very strongly , but he truly hated his father , thought him a bumptious fool , a complete liar , a dangerous scoundrel , and a treacherous dog . As Hilary was too egotistic to conceal this fine opinion of Hugo , and too indifferent to him as a man , Hugo 's initial dislike could scarcely be expected to have diminished with the years . There was another deep and subterranean reason for the hatred between the two . Though Hugo adored all his daughters , who were fair , pretty and vivacious , and very fond of him , his youngest daughter , Alice , was his darling . The two older girls were , like their comely mother , not very " bright , " though amiable and charming . But Alice was witty and intelligent , full of laughter and sudden seriousness , and possessing a bright zest for living . She was scarcely more than a year older than Hilary ; they had grown up together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had his gracefulness , his tact and perceptive keenness , his ingratiating mannerisms , his elegant gestures . Moreover , he very early learned that she had integrity and honor ; the two older girls were too complacent , too amiable , too happy , to have any character at all , except delightful selfishness and charm . It was Hilary 's pressure on his mother , who in turn pressed determinedly upon Hugo , which resulted in Alice 's going to a fine university and studying law , instead of to the fashionable finishing-school which Hugo believed was more in keeping for Boucharddaughters . Alice was very healthy , but not aggressively so . She did not have that sweaty , wholesome appearance , that repulsive exuberance of animal spirits , which so often distinguishes the robust American female . Like Hilary , she loathed sports . Her skin , all milky whiteness and softness , with an apricot bloom upon her firm young cheeks , needed no artifice . She had her father 's golden eyes , and long bronze lashes , and their expression was alive and eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet sweet , firm and strong , and brightly colored , so that the size was overlooked . Her hair , a lighter gold than her eyes , was heavy and straight , and hung in masses on her wide shoulders . Everything about her expressed exquisite strength and fineness ; her figure was excellent . " Grecian classic , " Hugo would say , proudly . Moreover , she had taste , and a natural simplicity in dress , which enhanced her beauty . Hugo , though never a subtle man , and sly , rather than perceptive , yet very early saw that there was some passionate bond between his darling ,  |p279and  his hated son , Hilary . When they had been children , they desired only each other 's society . Hugo had attempted to send Hilary away to a military school . " Make a man of the little pipsqueak , " he had said . But Christine had violently opposed this . Hugo waited . He waited untilHilary had gone to Harvard . But long letters passed between brother and sister . Alice did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . When she went away , herself , to the university , she saw to it that her choice was not far from Harvard . Hugo knew that his son and daughter spent many week-ends together i.n New York , in a state of complete happiness and gentle rapport . To counteract this , he often visited New York , himself , and met Alice , and took her with him , leaving Hilary alone in wryly smiling silence . Hugo did not even descendto the politeness of asking Hilary to join them . Hugo , like many men of his temperament , had a certain rugged obscenityof mind , and a crude vulgarity . On the infrequent occasions when he was aroused , he displayed a violent brutality , lasciviousness of tongue , and ugly ruthlessness . He was careful to hide these traits from his peers ; his inferiors knew them only too . well . He always suspected the worst of everybody . In his private opinion , no woman was virtuous . All women ( except his wife and daughters ) were trollops , complaisant rumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a slightly higher opinion , though he cast upon them his own reflection . ) Sincerely convincedof the vileness of womankind , and the venality of men , he suspectedthe foulest of implications in an exchange of smiles between the sexes , in the slightest gallantry or the most innocent coquetry . He had a fund of vicious stories . All of them emphasized sexuality in its crudest form , and the worst did more than hint at perversion . With such a mind , and with his bottomless hatred and aversion for his son , he pretended to be convinced that Hilary 's love for Alice was perverted , unclean and dangerous . ( Alice , of course , was the pure damsel without the slightest suspicion of the hideous yearnings of her brother . ) In the end , Hugo no longer pretended to be convinced . He believed he knew . Now his hatred took on a maniacal quality , born of his jealousy . It never occurred to him that he needed a psychiatrist to probe into the dark pits of his own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His disgust had been so intense that he had been physically , as well as mentally , nauseated . He had felt indifferencefor his father , and disdainful amusement , rather than hatred . But now he hated . He was also extremely alarmed for his beloved sister . But he knew he would never dare to enlighten her . For his own part ,  | he made his letters shorter and more infrequent , when he wrote to Alice . He was often very busy when she suggested meeting him in New York . On his holidays , he forced himself to strike up more intimate relationshipswith friends . This lad , hardly seventeen , found himself engrossed in a dreadful problem from which he could see no escape , either for himself or his sister , or his father . For he saw that by gently relinquishingAlice 's hold upon himself , he was clearing the way for his father 's obsession . Too , he saw that Alice 's best hope of escape from an embroilment in an appalling situation was through marriage . Therefore , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in some young man or other . When he did meet her in New York , he often brought mature classmates with him . None interested Alice , until her brother introduced her to a young man named Charles Miles . Charles , unfortunately , came of an obscure farming family from upstateNew York . In his high-school years , he had displayed such brilliancein scientific research that he had won a scholarship at Harvard . However , he was so badly needed at home that he had been unable to avail himself of this opportunity , and it was not until he was twenty-four years old that he felt himself free enough to take advantage of it . At the time Hilary introduced him to Alice , Charles was twenty-seven years old , unusually mature , thoughtful , grave , clever and intellectual . He was also penniless . Alice immediately fell in love with him . This dark , lean young man , who , she thought fondly , resembled her dear brother , dazzled her , won her . His gentleness , his humorous thoughtfulness , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection . After six meetings , three of them alone after the discreet withdrawal of Hilary , they becameengaged . The uproar that ensued on Massachusetts Avenue could be heard three houses away . It took no great astuteness on the part of Hugo to discernthe fine Italian hand of young Hilary . Hugo 's hatred became murderous , insane . He threatened Alice for the first time in her life . But the girl , appalled , white of face , stood her ground resolutely . She had been forewarned by her brother . She would marry Charles Miles , she said , no matter what happened . Christine , though not very intelligent , was a shrewd woman . Her vague suspicions became strong in her . She stood by her daughter . If Hugo cut her off , she , Christine , would see to it that the young couple did not starve . No one had ever opposed Hugo Bouchard before . He was like a wildp281incensed bull . He raved , shrieked , threatened the most obscure and frightful things . His family , with pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her pleasant apartments . Her two older daughters crept about the magnificent house , hiding from the sight of their father . Alice went to New York to stay with her relative , Mrs. Phyllis Morse , who was fond of her . Hugo was demoralized and full of terror , as well as full of rage and hatred and jealousy . Now he felt his impotence . He wanted to kill . He stayed away from the State Department , even in these momentous days . He was sick to death , torn with agony , frustrated , anguished and mauled by the most nameless of passions . He had rationalized them , of course . Charles Miles was a servile and contemptible nobody , a beggar , a starvling , a fortune-hunter , a cur and a swine . It was horrible that such as he should dare to lift his eyes to a Bouchard daughter , this penniless scoundrel , this farming lout , this creeping snail . He would not permit Charles to come to the house . He threatened to kill him , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police record . He went so far as to write the president of Harvard , demanding the expulsion of Charles . If this was not done , he threatened , there would be no more Bouchard money pouring into the coffers . He notified the university that Hilary would be immediately withdrawn . But Christine again stepped in . Hilary would remain . She , Christine , would pay his tuition . Quite quietly , she wrote to the president and in her own turn demanded that Charles be allowed to remain , explaining that " Mr. Bouchard was only temporarily excited and would get over it shortly . " Into this disordered and furious household , Henri appeared one late December day . He had heard rumors of the uproar , but in his characteristicfashion he hardly believed that a sensible man could be truly distraught over any affair which involved a woman . Hugo knew this opinion of his relative 's , and composed himself long enough to shut himself up with Henri just two days before Christmas . He had the greatest fear and respect for Henri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not underestimate his relative , Hugo , nor was he persuaded that that hearty bluff smile , that genial affability , that loud rollickingp282laugh and goodfellowship , were the attributes of a fool . He knew that Hugo , as a man , a politician , and a Bouchard , was one of the most powerful men in the State Department . Hugo , it was , who had brought the most intransigent into the camp that supported , condoned and apologized for Franco , who had prevented the shipment of food , medical supplies and materials of war to the desperate Loyalist cities . Hugo , it was , who had distorted American public opinion into the belief that the Loyalists were " Reds , dangerous Communists and radicals , priestmurderersand atheists . " Later , after the fall of the Spanish Republic , it had been Hugo 's influence which had speeded shipments of oil and scrap , food and munitions , into Franco 's enslaved and anguished Spain . If much of all this found its way to Hitler , that was palpably none of Hugo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had acted in good and virtuous American faith . It was Hugo , who had a profound regard for conservative British politics , who had induced the State Department to proceed with caution in European affairs , and who had inspired admiration for the Men of Munich . When American public opinion cried out indignantly at the shipments of scrap iron and oil to Japan , it was Hugo who inspired the newspaper releases apologizing for the little yellow men , and hinting that China was hardly the virtuous and noble democracy so sweetly imagined by Americans . Most of the men of the Department were much like Hugo , cautious , expedient , conservative , fascistic in thought if not in intent , career men of family and polish and craftiness and greed . One thing they possessed in common : a profound and aristocratic loathing of the " common people , " " the cattle without brains or guts . " ( Though " guts " were implied rather than said , the gentlemen being so excessively refined . ) Hugo was more robust than many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more dangerous . They at least believed they were protecting their " class . " Hugo , and others like him in the Department , cared only for the status quo , their wealth and their power , which they were grimly determined should remain intact . A still closer circle believed that it might be necessary , some near day , to enlist the aid of Hitler in subduing the American masses , which were showing alarming symptoms of beginning to think for themselves . It was Hugo who helped vigorously in the formation of a policy of distrustand hatred toward " Red Russia , " who had been behind the demand that Russia pay for her shipments in gold . Out from the discreet and fastidious purlieus of the State Department came the releases which minimized Russian strength , which " scorned " the pact between Russiap283and Germany , which hinted at the dire designs of Russia upon the peace and safety of the world . Most of the gentlemen of the Department had the highest regard for Mussolini ; two had medals bestcwed upon them by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned the American people of the necessity of a powerful air-arm , it was the State Department , led by Hugo , who had besmirched and destroyedand broken the heart of that valiant and tragic soldier . The milky patricians fearfully believed that for America to be safe it was necessary only that she remain unarmed and refrain from provoking hostile gestures from Hitler and Mussolini . But there was an inner circle , composed of Hugo and the more ruthless and savage realists , who wished America to remain unarmed for their own monstrous reasons . And it was the State Department who catered timorously and with maudlin respect to a certain religious organization which was the most terrible enemy of democracy and liberalism in all the World , stronger and more terrible than Hitler , himself . Because of this organization , the State Department was adamant in its pressure on the Government to refuse visas and passports to a tortured and dying German Jewry . The gentlemen of the Department , who had a dainty dislike of all those who were not Harvard graduates and who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been composed of London whores and jail-birds swept up from the gutters of English cities for transportation to America ) , had a terrified aversion to people who could not speak English without an accent , or whose features were not correctly in line with the prevailing type of features extant in the State Department . It was Hugo , in short , who was most powerfully behind the timorous , class-conscious , fascistic , crafty , liberal-hating , Red-baiting and witchhuntingelements of the Department . Never were they vulgar , even in their contempt and hatred and suspicion of Mr. Roosevelt . Everything that was released by the Department was shining with gentlemanly restraint and polished phrases and bloodless elegance . The more earthy statements of Hugo were cleaned and deodorized before being made public . But the conspiracy was there , nevertheless . The State Department , on occasion , protested in plaintive tones to France , to Russia , to China . But never , never , did it protest to England , to Italy or to Mussolini . On occasion it reproved some more honest and valiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's timidly annoyed sentiments towards Hitler . These statesmen , who were young , honorable and realistic , were anathema top284the royal circle within the State Department , and were disdainfully stigmatized as " war-mongers , who are desirous of embroiling America in European conflicts . " The royal circle could not , in truth , scorn these Englishmen as not being " pukka sahibs , " for the majority of them were scions of old and noble British families . But they inferred , with regret , that they were not upholding their " class , " the arch-crime of all . Henri Bouchard knew that Hugo 's clique formed only one segment of the State Department , and that it was ruthless , vulgar , expedient and coarse . Nevertheless , it influenced very perilously the other cliques , and , in their combined power , they could override the very Secretary himself . The Secretary could no nothing against the libel that Mr. Roosevelt was dominated by the " Jews " ( instead of by the State Department , which was proper ) , or that the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright young men from New York , of dubious ancestry , " and Communists . The Secretary apparently thought all this very querulous and funny . He , too , was a gentleman , and he was convinced that gentlemenwere not very effective . In the meantime , during these early days of war , the State Department was in quite an aristocratic dither . Its natural bent for England , and reverence for English politics ( and the late English policy of appeasing Hitler and supporting him ) caused it to feel a very natural sympathy and concern for Britain . Nevertheless , the old habit of appeasing , placating , apologizing for and supporting Hitler , was still very strong . On this seesaw , therefore , they were quite understandably sick at the stomach , bouncing affrightedly in the air , coming to earth with strong bumps , and thus disorganizing their delicate nervous systems . However , Hugo and his very earthy and realistic clique had no sympathyat all for Britain or for France , a fact they carefully concealed from their pallid and exquisite colleagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And these designs , these plans , were very well known to Henri Bouchard . Henri , who had discounted many of the rumors reaching him of the frantic fury in the Hugo Bouchard household , nevertheless was now impatiently aware that many of the rumors must be true . Hugo was as genial as ever in his greetings to his kinsman . His laugh was still rollicking . But Henri saw that the buff-colored ruddiness of Hugo 's face was somewhat less than usual , that his laugh was forced , that his handshakewas damp and alarmingly tremulous , that his yellow eyes werep285sunken and feverish . His big body , too , was less rounded and firm , under the expensive tweeds . There was a haggard look about him , a distraught nervousness , even while he grinned and smoked , and delivered himself of a few of his choicest jokes . He had always been a prodigious drinker , but now he swallowed glass after glass in a kind of frenzy . One of Henri 's attributes was the ability to take cognizance of prevailingconditions and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this on an instant 's notice . Even while he talked amiably with Hugo , his mind was busily at work , plotting , conjecturing , feinting . He encouragedHugo to drink , but kindly refused to have his own glass refilledmore than once . Hugo burst into a loud rough laugh . " Always keep your feet on the ground , eh , Henri ? " he shouted . " Always the Iron Man ! You 're a cute devil , but I know all about you . You never fooled me . " Henri smiled easily , and said : " I never cared whether I fooled anyone or not . Besides , you know very well I do n't drink much . Were n't you the one who said my whiskey was swill , last Christmas ? " Hugo laughed even more loudly . He reached out and slapped Henri 's thigh with affection and cunning . He 's drunk , thought Henri , but more drunk with his damned emotions than with whiskey . Now Hugo lifted one index finger and wagged it archly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to Washington and leave a certain  --  Well , " he added , with a broad wink , " we wo n't mentionthat , so stop scowling , you sly rascal . I mean to say , this is n't a casual visit , is it ? You 're after something , as usual . What is it ? Are n't the boys satisfying you , lately ? " Henri smiled again , comfortably . He watched Hugo closely . Hugo , in spite of his noise and his riot , had the air of a man who listens for something at a distance . Sometimes he started nervously , cast a quick look at the massive wooden door of the library . Henri felt his way , his pale motionless eyes fixed on Hugo 's twitching face : " I do have a commission . From Annette . We 'd like to have you and your family down for New Year 's . You know , you refused the invitation for Christmas , on the ground that you had a previous commitment . Now Annette wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his big loose mouth to speak , then closed it grimly . His body appeared to tighten under his clothing . His large coarse hand tapped on the long oaken table beside him , increased in momentum while he stared at Henri . But he said , quietly enough : " I 'll speak to Christine . How long are you staying with us ? Until tomorrow ? She 'll let you know . But you know , of course , that Alice wo n't be with us ? " Henri raised his eyebrows . " No , I did n't know . How should I ? Where is the girl ? She 's somewhat of a pet with me , you know . " Hugo made an uncouth sound . " Come off , come off ! You are n't immured down there in Windsor . You must have heard something . " " I 'm not interested in family private matters , " said Henri , with impatience . " They 're none of my affair . I expect the same respect for my affairs as I accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with suspicion . " Well , " he said roughly , " Alice wo n't be with us . She 's staying with that damned Phyllis Morse in New York for the holidays . Prefers it , it seems . Childrenare the god-damnedest waste of time . You ought to be thankful you have n't any . Well . Perhaps we 'll come , Christine , Elsie and Joan , and  --  " Suddenly he stopped . His face became evil with its coarse wrinkling and twisting , full of hatred and fury . So , thought Henri , his mind swiftly working . He lifted his glass and pretended to drink . He said , elaborately unaware of his kinsman 's expression : " And Hilary , of course . " He put down the glass . " I 've often thought how closely he resembles Armand 's Antoine . Have n't you seen the resemblance , yourself ? " Hugo uttered an involuntary oath . His tapping fingers clenched ; he lifted his fist and beat it heavily once or twice on the table . Henri knew very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how often he had smarted under that gay young man 's dexterous thrusts and light ridicule . He hoped , devoutly , that his manouver had been a clever one , and had not merely served to enrage Hugo against himself . When Hugo spoke again , in an incoherent and thickened voice , Henri knew that the manouver had been very clever indeed . " Yes , damn it , I 've seen the resemblance ! It goes deeper than that . He 's like that swine in character too . Smirking , lying , twisting , bowing , scheming . A fine son for Hugo Bouchard ! A stinking pig . The only son I have , and he has to  --  he has to  --  " His voice was suddenly choked off , and a purple tide ran under his ruddiness . His eyeballs glared in the lamplight . " Oh , come now , Hilary 's only a boy , " said Henri , watching him acutely . " It 's true he resembles Antoine remarkably . But Antoine 's no fool , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added , after a pause , " he 's doing some very devious plotting indeed . "  |p287Hugo  's expression changed . It became coarsely sullen and uneasy . He lifted his big hand and plucked at his lip . He stared at Henri , and his opaque yellow eye narrowed . " I do n't know about that , " he mumbled , uneasily . Now he passed his hand over his thick waves of white hair . So , thought Henri , it 's as I suspected . And knew . Henri had an aversion to intimate gestures of any kind , and never indulged in them with others . Yet now he forced himself to lean towards Hugo and pat him on the arm . " Hugo , you and I have always been friends . Once we acquitted ourselves with glory . Remember ? Against the Armand faction ; in other words , against the Jules Bouchard faction . I have n't forgotten your help . I could n't have accomplished anything without it . You 've served me ; I 've served you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially when we serve ourselves while serving our friends . " Hugo , though resisting uneasily for a few minutes , could not withstandthis not-so-subtle flattery . His fear of Henri , and his respect , had grown with the years . He smiled tentatively . His fist relaxed on the table . " I 've never underestimated you , Henri , my lad . I knew whom I was helping . I 've done as you suggested , while in the Department , and before . You can always rely upon me . " Henri leaned back in his chair , and allowed his large stony face to darken . " I believe I can , Hugo . But , it 's very serious this time . I 've said Antoine has been plotting . Dangerous plotting . I 'm not sure what it is , exactly . But I need your help . " So great , now , were Hugo 's alarm , perturbation and suspicions , that he momentarily forgot his private tragedies . He began to sweat . He pulled out his handkerchief and passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is this damned plotting ' ? I do n't believe it . What would he plot ? I have n't heard anything . " " I have n't heard much , Hugo , I confess . But I am psychic , perhaps , " and Henri smiled pleasantly . " I feel things . I feel something in the wind . Perhaps you can tell me . " But Hugo shrugged with gathering sullenness , and looked at a point a little beyond Henri 's eyes . " Imagination , " he muttered at last . " What would that smirking idiot plot ? " " Do n't underestimate Antoine , " warned Henri . " He 's clever . Like your son , Hilary . " At this , Hugo started with quite extraordinary violence . His eyes ,  | turned upon Henri , became full of a yellow glare . He clenched his teeth ; his big coarse nostrils distended like the nostrils of an ox . Now Henri had quite a regard for Hilary , but he knew this was not the moment for softness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . I 've always known that . And I 've always known he resembles Antoine more than just physically . " I flatter myself I understand men . That 's my business . I understand Antoine . I do n't know what he 's up to , but I have the vaguest of ideas . You see , I 'm being very confidential with you , Hugo . I know I can trust you . " Hugo 's fists doubled on the arms of his red leather chair . He breathed audibly . The yellow glare increased in his eyes . Henri watched his agonized uncertainty with unswerving closeness . " What do you want ? " asked Hugo , in a stifled voice . " You always want something . You do n't fool me , " he repeated . " Yes , " said Henri , quietly . " I do want something . I want your help . I want you to use your influence to stop shipments of scrap and oil to Japan . Immediately . " Hugo started , again . His teeth glistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still when he said : " No . " The two men regarded each other in a profound silence . Henri seemed unperturbed . He did not stir a muscle . His expression was placid and controlled . Hugo was like a huge bull at bay , ready for the assaulting plunge towards his enemy . He waited for Henri to speak again , but Henri was silent . Then Hugo said : " Why ? " " Because , " said Henri , tranquilly , " I do n't want Japan to be made stronger . I think her ultimate victim is America . I have a regard for America , if only as a field for profitable business . " Now Hugo grinned , very unpleasantly . " Claptrap . Why should Japan attack us ? She 's got China on her hands . China will take her a generation to digest . If ever . What does it matter to you ? " " I do n't share your optimism , Hugo . I think we are next on the agenda . Japan will turn westward . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are her commitments with Hitler . It 's very involved , I admit . But , as things go along , Hitler will become very annoyed with us . He might inducejapan to attack . " " She wo n't attack ! " exclaimed Hugo , with unwarranted violence . He turned in his chair , fiddled with objects on the table , then swung around roughly to Henri . " That 's pure rot . Besides , she 'll have no reason . We are n't going to help Britain . That 's certain . I can assure you of that . "  | " And I , " said Henri , quietly , " can assure you we will . We have cashand-carrynow . We 'll have something more important , soon . How do I know ? I ca n't tell you that . But I assure you I shall use all my influence . " " You ! " ejaculated Hugo . He burst into a raucous laugh . " Since when have the Bouchards been so damned patriotic ? Since when have they come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ' ! " He waited again for Henri to speak , but Henri did not oblige him . Then Hugo lost control of himself . He began to shout . " Let me tell you something ! We do n't want England to win , in Europe ! You know that ! My boys do n't want it ; even England does n't want it ! She wants a negotiated peace , and quick , too . Why should she destroy Hitler , and open herself to bolshevism from Russia ? She needs a strong Germany in Europe to protect her . As always . That 's always been her game . We know it in the Department . We 've always known it . Just as we know that France will collapse in the spring . It 's all arranged . Yet here you come , breathing sweetness and light and in God we trust , ' and want us to throw all our plans overboard . No , my boy , it wo n't do , it really wo n't do . " Now Henri spoke , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you something . What you say about England is true , in a measure . But only in a measure . You speak for the so-called ruling class in England . But let me tell you this : Chamberlain will soon be out . Eden or Winston Churchill will take his place . The ruling class ' will have diarrhoea very shortly , out of sheer funk and terror . Because the British people are now aroused . I 'm not just prophesying when I say that England wo n't sign a negotiated peace with Hitler . She 'll fight to the bitter end . It 's sink or swim , now . It 's Hitler , or us . Do you want Hitler in America ? " Hugo stared at him , and slowly paled . He said nothing . Henri nodded grimly . " I 've a suspicion , I really have . I really think you 've been duped by Antoine . You 're a clever fellow , Hugo , but not as clever as Antoine . He has n't told you all of his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very amiable chap , Hugo . Perhaps you think he is all for one , and one for all . ' I have another suspicion : I believe that Monsieur Antoine is working only for himself . He has n't a very high regard for you , Hugo , nor does he think much of your intelligence . " Hugo still was speechless . " I believe , " Henri went on , grimly , " that Antoine has convinced you that England will cave in , sign a negotiated peace with Hitler , and that Hitler will then dominate Europe and do excellent business with us . Am I right ? "  | But Hugo was silent . He stared at Henri with bulging eyes . " I give you the credit of not having been completely duped by our fine manipulator , who has been using you for his own ends , Hugo . I give you the credit of keeping your own counsel . Now , am I right or wrong ? " He knew his approach and attack had been crude , calculated to have effect only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His contempt for Hugo grew as he saw the wild and violent uncertainty , the stung egotism , in those fixed yellow eyes . He spoke very , very quietly now : " Hugo , how much do you trust Ignatius O'Connor , and Francis O'Malley , in the Department ? " For a moment Henri thought that Hugo had not heard him , so unchangingwas his expression . And then Hugo said , coming to himself , and speaking gruffly : " Why ? What have you got against Iggy and Frank ? " But a wily tight look appeared about his big loose mouth . Henri smiled . " A nice trick , answering a question with a question . But I know all about that trick ; I use it myself . " He made his face change to one of gloomy gravity , and lifted his hand for a moment , dropping it thereafter with a gesture of resignation . " All right , then . I see we 're gettingnowhere . I must admit I 'm disappointed . You and I have always been friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you in confidence  --  but I see it 's no use at all . " He took out his cigarette case , extracted a cigarette , lit it with calm thoughtfulness fist on his desk . He sat on the edge of his chair , his big thighs spraddled ; he resembled a tawny and overfed and dangerous lion , treacherous though aging . Then he said , belligerently : " We are n't getting into this thing , I tell you ! The people do n't want it . Sentiment 's against us tangling ourselves up in Europe again , Roosevelt or no Roosevelt . No politician in America is strong enough to drum up a valid reason for attacking Hitler . Besides , Hitler 's too popular here , due to his persecution of the Jews . Do you think you can get the American mob to fight for liberty ' ? " His look now was one of grinning loathing . " What does the mob want with liberty , anyway ? I tell you , if Hitler appeared off the coast of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paeans . They love him , I tell you . Liberty 's never sat very well on the American stomach  --  the people have too long a memory of happy and irresponsible slavery . " Henri allowed himself to smile . " You 're quite the psychologist , are n't you , Hugo ? You know , in a way I am forced to agree with you . I don'tp291give a damn for the mob . But I do give a damn for myself , for Bouchard , for all our subsidiaries . Do you trust Hitler ? " Hugo 's expression changed , became more sullen , but he said nothing . However , his eyes narrowed to pinpoints of baleful yellow light . " Frankly , I do n't trust him , " continued Henri , ruefully . " I 'm candid enough to admit that if I thought we could , I might consider  --  certain things . But I know we ca n't trust him . I do n't want him here , the loving and adoring American mob to the contrary . We 're powerful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that power . You know enough about what he 's done to the industrialists in Germany to get some idea what he 'd do here . " I 'm not interested in England , or France . Let Hitler take the British Empire apart , and the hell with it . Who cares ? But I do n't want him here . And he 'll be here , inevitably , unless we stop him . How ? That 's why I came to see you , to discover if we could work out some program . " Hugo began to rub his chin , but he still regarded Henri watchfully . " What did you mean , asking me if I trusted O'Connor and O'Malley ? " he demanded , sullenly . Henri hesitated . " Well , frankly , it 's just what I 've been reading in the newspapers . Were n't they back of sending Myron Taylor to the Vatican ? Are n't they back of trying to discredit the so-called liberals ' in the Department , who 've taken a stand against Franco , and who 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Japan ? " Hugo laughed roughly . " So what ? We are n't in a position to annoy Hitler and Japan . We 've no army , no arms  --  nothing . Call it appeasementif you like , or diplomacy . I presume you mean the inner campaign against Sumner Welles , who 's always liked Russia ? You ca n't blame Iggy and Frank ; they 're Catholics , you know . " " Since when , " said Henri , meditatively , " have we predicated our foreign policy on Catholic sensibilities ? Do you remember your history , Hugo ? Very interesting reading . " Hugo struck his meaty fist savagely on the table . " We 're getting nowhere ! " he shouted . " What are you getting at , anyway ? Trying subtlety for a change , eh ? " Henri made his face suddenly hard . He leaned towards Hugo . " All right , then . I 've told you I care nothing about what happens in Europe . But I do care what happens here . I happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain it . I 'm willing to risk anything . " He paused a moment , then continued : " I have no real basis for my suspicions , I admit . But I know a few things . I know that our dear Antoine lately met the German Charge d'Affaires , and O'Connor and O'Malley were with him . I wonder what they discussed ? " It was a bold stroke . He watched Hugo narrowly . He had spoken in order to discover whether Hugo had known of this meeting , though he had not been present . And then he felt a sudden weakness of relief in himself . Hugo 's blank expression of shock , his falling mouth , the sudden glare in his eyes , convinced Henri that Christopher had been correct in his surmise that Hugo had not known of the meeting . Why had he not known ? Christopher had been doubtful on the point , though he had his ideas . O'Connor and O'Malley , he believed , were playingtheir own game , with their own Catholic clique . Hugo , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation , was not really one with this clique within a clique . He had not been fully trusted ; he was a Bouchard , and wealth , at the last , is almost always conservative and fearful , delicately taking alarm when danger breathes too closely . " I do n't believe it ! " stammered Hugo , his face swelling and suffusing . " They would n't dare ! Why should they do that , without telling me , without my knowing and  --  " He stopped , abruptly . Without your being present , finished Henri , to himself . Henri shrugged . " I do n't care whether you believe it or not , my dear Hugo . It happens to be a fact . May I warn you ? If you speak of it , they 'll deny it ; they 'll know there has been a leak . They wo n't like you , Hugo . They 'll believe you have been spying on them . I have an idea they do n't trust you completely . They 'll trust you less , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , then , and Antoine , and the others , will rule the Department , sub rosa . Do you like the thought of being glorified office boy to Antoine 's fine Italian presence in the background ? " Now all Hugo 's hatred for his kinsman , Antoine , all his subconscious loathing of him , both for himself and for Hilary 's resemblance to him , all his natural suspicion and jealousy and love of power , roared to his head . He was literally speechless , as he sat opposite Henri , swelling with insane fury and rage . But his mind worked rapidly . He remembered many things which had puzzled him , which had eluded him , lately , in the State Department , but he had been so engrossed with his private upheavals in this house that he had thought of them only vaguely , though his instinct had been aroused . It was the memory of these intangible things which convinced him that Henri was telling the truth . " So , " he muttered , through clenched teeth , " they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Against us , " said Henri , gently . " Do you think they love the Bou/chards ? Do you think Antoine loves us ? I can tell you this : when Armand dies , Antoine wo n't be so very pertinent in Bouchard affairs . I happen to know it . Perhaps he suspects . In revenge , and in his own desire for power , he 'll do anything , against us , against our interests . " He looked at his cigarette , and said : " I do n't know why I 'm telling you this . You could do me harm by repeating it . But , as I said , we 've always been friends , working together . I thought you might work with us now . " " Who do you mean by us ' ? " demanded Hugo . He was breathing with obvious difficulty . Henri eyed him blandly . " I suppose there 's no harm in telling you . Antoine must have been suspecting , and so he probably told you . Alex , Jean , and Emile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except remotely , with the Family . " Hugo turned aside his head and stared at a photograph of his beloved daughter , Alice , which stood on the desk . Henri could see his profile , vicious and hugely violent . " How about Christopher ? " Hugo said , at last , in a mumbling tone . Henri waved his hand . " Well , perhaps Christopher 's working with Antoine , too . I do n't know that , however . I 've just my suspicions . " Hugo swung back to him with violent swiftness . " All right , " he grunted . " What do you want ? " Henri felt a vast relaxing in himself , an almost weakness of relief . He looked at his kinsman , felt his fury , his jealousy , his savage suspicion and hatred for those who had betrayed him , for those he now believed had been using him . When Hugo thought of Antoine doing this to him , his gorge rose to maddening heights . Henri said , feeling his way cautiously : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just come on a piece of information . Some of our  --  less patriotic citizen-financiers have just met Dr. Schacht in Switzerland . You did n't know of that ? Well , among the arrangements made , the Bouchards were not included.Why ? Have you any idea ? " Hugo appeared even more stunned than ever , if possible . Henri continued : " I thought you did n't know . But Antoine did . I believe he arranged it . You see , he does n't like us at all . Incidentally , while perhaps you have misguidedly believed that the conquest of the world by Hitler might have nothing but beneficial results for the Family , Hitler does n't intend that in the least . You see , I happen to have a little inside information . Hitler 's far more fond of South America , with its Catholic-Falangist upper-class , than he is of America , where so many of us are of Anglo-Saxon origin . He does n't believe you can trust the Anglo/Saxon . Then , Franco is one of his trained seals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South America to pave the way for an ultimate conquest of that continent by the fascist forces . The South American industrialists , who have complete control of labor , with the assistance of the Church , will make admirable servants of Hitler , and he knows that . There is much propaganda already started there , that South America 's destiny is one with the destiny of Spain , her mother : What will be the inevitable result , if  --  certain  --  contingencies arise which make Hitler dominant in America ? I will paraphrase the old saying Westward the course of Empire ! ' I will say : Southward the course of Empire . ' With everything that that means . What will become of us , then ? " Hugo gnawed his lip in acute silence , staring fixedly at his kinsman . His brow had a series of deep leonine wrinkles . It was evident he was thinking swiftly . " I think Antoine knows this , " said Henri , softly . " He is already heavily invested in South America , and deeply interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk again and again in fulminating silence . " He is playing , even now , on the strength of his Latin ' blood , " added Henri , with an amused smile . He waited for Hugo to speak , but Hugo maintained his silence . Henri shrugged imperceptibly . " I 'm well informed , Hugo . You know , I never go off the deep end . For instance , do you know there is a plan afoot to produce the name of a certain fascistic newspaper owner from New York State at the comingRepublican convention ? I do n't like that man . I prefer another . One Regan suggested . I also suggest that you run for Vice-President . That can be arranged . " Hugo started . He swung fully upon Henri . Now his eyes were glittering . But he said again : " Who is the man ? " " Wendell Willkie , of Commonwealth &; Southern . " Hugo shouted with sudden turbulent laughter . " Willkie ! Who ever heard of Willkie , except on the Street ? Who are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Willkie ? " " For the peculiar reason , " said Henri , with a smile , " that he is an honest man , an American , sound , wholesome and intelligent . I 've investigatedhim closely ; there 's nothing dirty in his career . He 's a better man than the wily Roosevelt , who turns like a weathercock in every wind : His policies , I believe , will be conservative , realistic , and honorable . I'vep295found nothing in him which leads me to believe he will betray America , and everything indicates that he will fight for America , if elected . There is nothing elusive or unpredictable about him . If America is to survive , she needs him , not only during war years , but later . I shall put up your name for his Vice-President . " He spoke with power and authority , and Hugo 's tendency to ridicule subsided . " Who 's behind Willkie ? " Henri smiled again , very wryly . " An old man heavy with his sins , perhaps . Who wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very powerful old man . " He coughed , then resumed in a sprightlier tone : " Just to change the subject momentarily : is n't Christine 's fortune heavily invested in the United States Chemical Products Company ? " Hugo blinked his eyes at this abrupt change in pace . " Well ? " he said . " Nothing very important . But I understand the American Carbide Company has some thought of buying up that company . They intend to do that to remove a competitor . All this is confidential , though . " Hugo turned quite pale . " You are certain of this ? " he muttered , in a strained tone . " Quite certain . I thought you might be interested . Now , it 's never been my policy to interfere with other companies ; enough to do at home . But I can tell you this : American Carbide has asked me to help finance the sale . They offer me a very attractive block of stock in return . " Now the eyes of the two men locked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy color had faded ; it was replaced by a mauve and apoplectic tint . His clenched fists fell open on the desk , and he seemed to dwindle . And before his eyes Henri seemed to expand , to become more terrible and ruthless . " You would n't do that  --  to us ? " he whispered hoarsely . " Did I say I even considered it ? " asked Henri , mildly . " Even though I 'm interested in American Carbide , myself , not only for financial reasons . Their president happens to be a close friend of mine . " Hugo got suddenly to his feet . He towered over Henri . His breathing became more difficult , and his eyes were violent . " What do you want ? " he asked . Henri studied him for a long and penetrating moment . " I want  --  several things . I want the shipments to Japan to stop . I want a curtailment , or even a stoppage , of the huge shipments of oil , steel and food to Franco . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if smaller shipments are sent , by trusted Americans , who don't like Franco . just to see that none of the shipments go to Hitler . I want your clique to align yourselves conservatively with the liberals in the Department . Sumner Welles is very popular in South America ; I want a sort of good friend ' policy to be initiated in the South American countries . For many valid reasons , South Americans do n't like their big northern neighbor . They must be made to trust us , and it can be done , if they see we are sincere . They must join with us in a continental bloc against Hitler , no matter what happens in Europe . A little later , I want investigation of those American companies who have cartel arrangements with Hitler , and who are furnishing Hitler with materiel . I want the investigation to be given wide publicity in the newspapers . I want a more friendly attitude towards Russia " Hugo drew a deep breath , and grinned , though he remained definitely lavender in tint . " Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henri snapped his fingers . " I 'd like to prophesy that Hitler will soon attack Russia . In the meantime , lay the groundwork in the Department . You 'll have to withdraw from the more dangerous elements in your clique , and bring the uncertain ones with you , by hook or crook . I also want a deeply sympathetic attitude towards China . " Hugo walked back and forth over the thick rug of the library . " And that 's all you want , eh ? " he said , viciously . " just a few trifling little things . " He swung hack on Henri . " What about the European cartels in which you are personally interested ? " " I 'm blocking them from Hitler . " Henri added : " If you , and some of your clique who trust you , throw in your weight with the liberals in the Department , we can do all these things . " He stood up now and faced Hugo , all his casualness gone . His large pale face was grim and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony eye held Hugo in sudden fearful fascination . " I tell you , Hugo , I 'm serious in all this . If you ca n't  --  do  --  this , then I 'll move . And things will start moving , also . You wo n't enjoy what will happen , personally . I 'd be sorry for that , but there are bigger stakes in this than your own welfare , even though we 've always been friends . You see , I know a great many things which you do n't suspect I know . " " Are you blackmailing me ? " asked Hugo , incredulously , but with terror . " I 'm advising you , " said Henri , quietly.  |p297Hugo  , after a moment , pressed his hands over his eyes . " Let me think , " he said , almost inaudibly . Henri waited . He said , after a moment : " The Department has always admired England . But lately , the admiration has cooled . I want it re-vived . " Hugo dropped his hands . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , with exhaustion . " You ought to have come to me before . " Henri smiled grimly . " I wanted to make sure  --  about certain things . And now you 've got to move fast , Hugo . Very fast indeed . " Hugo was silent . " Move cautiously , " said Henri . " Do n't do anything too sudden . Talk it over with those members of your clique whom you can trust . And  --  you might keep me informed . You might let me know your own  --  opinions . " " You are asking me to spy on my friends ? " Henri laughed derisively . " Bah . Do n't be a fool . What man has friends ' ? You 've changed your mind about many of the objectives of your clique . Every man is entitled to change his mind . But do n't let your change become suspiciously abrupt . You see , I need to know a few more things before you abandon your intimates . " " My God , " muttered Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling arm . " You have much to gain , and nothing to lose . A little later , I 'll inform the American Carbide I 'm not interested in their proposition . Incidentally , I have a few tips for you , direct from the Street , and a little later I 'll discuss them with you . By the way , you have n't said how you 'd like to be VicePresident . Or , perhaps , something even more important can be ar-ranged . " Hugo drew a deep and strangled breath . He said , weakly : " What do we do now ? Sing the Star-Spangled Banner ? " PETER BoUCHARD sat with Mr. Cornell T. Hawkins in the warm and comforting seclusion of the Ritz dining-room . The last of the manuscriptof The Fateful Lightning lay on the white table between them.  |p298Mr  . Hawkins thoughtfully sipped his cocktail and stared at the pages . Then he looked up and politely scrutinized Peter 's haggard face with its blue tint and white lips . He saw the ringed and sunken eyes , the feverish pulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , in his cool compassion , must have communicated itself to Peter , for he said , with a wry smile : " I 'm glad it 's done , Cornell . I 've a feeling I wo n't see its publication . I 've just been to my doctor this morning , before I saw you . Mr. Hawkins said nothing ; his silence implied a concerned questioning . But Peter , with a restless movement of his head , dismissed the subject . " I 'm working on other things , now , which will occupy all my attention . This book  --  you have no idea when it will be published ? " Mr. Hawkins shook his head . " In about six weeks , perhaps , you 'll get the galleys for any corrections or deletions or additions . Then , later , the page proof . After that , we usually allow some time for the critics to read the book . Then , publication . It all depends on our list at the time . We want to make this a big thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicting what the public 's reaction will be . We base our advertising on prepublication sales to the various distributing agencies . That 's all I can tell you , Peter . " " I 'll be willing to pay for lavish advertising , " said Peter , eagerly . Then he flushed , for Mr. Hawkins ' frosty blue eyes were twinkling . " Please , do n't misunderstand me . I 'm not trying to log-roll . But , you see , it is so very important to me that the public read this book widely . I 've even thought of free distribution . " Mr. Hawkins ' eyes continued to twinkle , though he did not speak . He turned his glass about in his fingers . Mr. Hawkins had a deep and reservedcynicism , which he could not always control , and like all men with this particular brand of cynicism , he had a kind and sensitive perceptionof others , and a treacherous compassion which frequently made him uneasy and distrustful of himself . He looked steadfastly at Peter 's febrile expression and dying face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Peter , with a look that begged forgiveness in advance , spoke hesitatingly : " My first book , The Terrible Swift Sword , was mysteriously squelched right at the height of its popularity . I 've told you that before . " He paused . " They  --  might try to intimidate you Now Mr. Hawkins ' own expression changed , became cold and tight . He said , with hard and quiet reserve : " No one has ever intimidated mep299yet . " He added , curiously : " What you told me about Mr. Henri Bouchardis very interesting . He was very frank with you . He knows about this book , of course ? " " Yes . " Peter became uneasily reserved , himself . " In fact , he gave me material for it that I would n't have known , otherwise . He 's very hard to understand . I do n't trust him , even now . He would n't be doing all this , and arranging for the radio programs , if he was n't very vitally concerned , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . He believes , very firmly now , that the continued advance of capitalistic-industrial democracy is the only climate in which all the people can be safe  --  and America can be safe . I believed that once , myself . Now I know that we must go still further  --  we must have a kind of socialism in America , in which competition is eliminated , and every man serves his neighbor rather than himself . " Mr. Hawkins was very surprised . He stared at Peter with astounded disbelief . " But , you would first have to change human nature . And thus far , in human history , I have n't discovered any sign of that change . It seems to me that we must predicate all social advances on the fixed facts of human personality . You ca n't go against the grain , you know , even if your ideas are sublime and beautiful . Unless , " and the frozen lightblueof his eyes was wintry , " you can use force . " " We 've used force to do evil things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " demanded Peter . Mr. Hawkins paused , and there was a curious expression about his mouth . " It seems to me I 've heard that before , somewhere . Did n't Hitler say that ? " Peter flushed darkly . " I 'm afraid that you do n't understand , Cornell . " But Mr. Hawkins merely lifted his glass and drank appreciatively . It was the most damnable thing , but there really was little difference between good zealots and evil zealots , he reflected . They were equally dangerous to human welfare . Both were inimical to the slow and torturousadvance of human society through free will and gradual liberty . They left no margin for choice . " I 've always hated coercion , of any kind , " said Mr. Hawkins , meditatively . " Whether that coercion was for good or for evil . Even good ' coercion is an insult to human dignity . That 's why I 've never approved of Mr. Roosevelt 's methods . " Peter 's face had become stiff with irritation . But Mr. Hawkins was tactful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing with a fanatic , even if that fanatic was a virtuous man . Mr. Hawkins was becoming even more distrustful of virtuous men than of amoral ones . He regretted this , for it increased his cynicism . He was fast coming to the point where he would affirm nothing and believe nothing . He realized , that if such an attitude brought eventual peace , it would also bring inertia , a spiritual stupefaction . It was necessary to life to believe in something . He said : " When do you believe there will be real activity in Europe ? So far , the Germans and the French just stare at each other over the Maginot Line . " Now a dark tint , as of imminent dissolution , spread over Peter 's features . His hands began to move aimlessly and weakly among the silverware . He was like a man who can not rid himself of an eternal nightmare . " I do n't know , " he muttered . " Who knows ? " Suddenly , he lost control of himself and put his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stand it , " he said , inaudibly . " There is something terrible He dropped his hands , and said : " I have a friend in France . He 's in Paris , now . Baron Israel Opperheim . I was able to help his son out of Germany . I 've tried to get Israel to leave . In his last letter to me , he hinted he was almost persuaded . But one never knows about Israel . He is a cynic . " Mr. Hawkins ' interest was aroused . What Peter had said was provocative . But he said no more . Yet Mr. Hawkins , with sudden clarity , felt Baron Opperheim 's mysterious " cynicism " all through his own consciousness , though he could not put it into words . He was filled with comprehending sadness , a kind of strange communion with that unknownOpperheim in threatened Paris . And he had another peculiar sensation : he believed , implicitly , that Baron Opperheim must have gazed at Peter with Mr. Hawkins ' own and present reflectiveness . Outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , and the air was gloomy and dim . Mr. Hawkins watched the large and heavy snowflakes dropping inexorably . There was something of the mystic in him . He felt the death and implacable sorrow of the mournful day all through his flesh and spirit , and the sick hopelessness of the perceptive and intelligent man was like the taste of dry ashes in his mouth . THE FINAL HOUR 30Ip301CELESTE wandered restlessly in the conservatory of the great new house on Placid Heights . She carried a basket with her , and under the truculent eye of the gardener she cut hot-house roses . She did not particularly like hot-house roses ; they gave her the vaguely gruesome feeling that always attended on her contemplation of the unnatural . These thorns were weak and flaccid , a simulation of defense , as if the flowers knew instinctivelythat there was nothing against which they need defend themselves . They were meticulously tended ; their natural enemies would never attackthem ; all danger of a hostile environment , which would have strengthened them , given them vigor and lusty life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were feeble , too delicate and too decadent . That hostile environment of the fields , coupled with the struggle for existence and the competition natural among all forms of vital life , made roses colorful and full of resistance and health , made their thorns weapons of sturdy defense , made their branches sinewy and fibrous with the urgent determination to live and survive , made them exude the heavy and intoxicating scent which these vapid weaklings would never possess . Celeste found the thought very interesting . She paused in her cutting to gaze unseeingly through the cloudy glass to which the wet and heavy snowflakes clung . Suppose the idealists and the theorists had their way , and human life were bereft of the necessity to struggle for existence , and all vigorous competition were eliminated . Suppose humanity were protected from the natural forces that threatened it , and a hostile environment . Suppose , since that hostile environment was removed , that the weak could then survive . Would not humanity , like these hot-house roses , become flaccid , possessed of a decadent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor ? Would it not become uniform , without interest and variety , in such a society ? Would not the surviving weaklings , coddled , pampered and inherently inferior , yet possessed of their strange ability to procreate lavishly , finally outnumber and inundatetheir superiors ? As such a dangerous soft environment was artificial , it would not survive under stress . And stress eventually came . When it arrived , would not these enfeebled men die at once , having been robbed of their naturalp302weapons of defense , their health and toughness and sinewy resistance ? Yes , it was an interesting thought . Celeste 's smooth black brows drew together in her concentration . She would argue this out with Peter . Once , he had believed this , as she , herself , now believed it . But lately he had become excited and querulous , and had vehemently pleaded the cause of the hot-house rose . Man had a right to be protected from his natural enemies ; he had a right to demand from his rulers that his environment be made easy and sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair " competition be removed . In other words , thought Celeste , with cool disgust , it was man 's right that he should be spoon-fed with pap , that he should recline in unearned comfort , and cling , like a fat vulnerable slug , to the stem of the social order . Why ? Simply because he was man ! And , because he was man , he was inherently superior to the lesser beasts that struggled naturally and healthily with a hostile environment , and derived vigor from that struggle ! Did Peter now , once possessed of some measure of realism , plead this insane and foolish premise because he felt the deathly increase of weaknessin himself , felt the stronger pangs of dissolution ? Perhaps it was always the weak and dying rose that pleaded that his stronger fellows were wronging him in crowding him out and stretching towards the light with all the passion of their unblighted stems . And demanded , also , that those unblighted stems be cut back , that the bright and colorful bud be lopped off in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petals without competition , and fill the garden with their sick and decaying scent . Celeste , despite her love and pity for her husband , felt the strong stirringof dissent and impatience in herself . Then , she decided not to argue with Peter . He would be so exhausted when he returned from New York . She sighed , turned away from the roses , and laid the cut blossoms on the gritty wooden table . She did not want them . If they stood on her tables , she would be reminded of the argument , and would feel again that stirring of passion and anger and impatience . She felt changed and much older . She remembered herself as a young girl , and her mouth twisted with irritability . Was it always the ignorant that espoused the cause of the weaklings ? The untried , the innocent and the deluded ? She did not know . Some thought nagged her , with its vagueness . Was Henri influencing her ? She felt a warm tremor over her tired body , and a quickening of her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew asidep303a curtain . The grounds had not yet been landscaped ; that was a project for the spring . The winter had fallen all about and over the new graystonehouse , had forgotten and ignored it , covering the long slope to the valley , as it had done for centuries before , with a heavy and glimmeringwave of snow . The driveway was still only gravel ; its sunken path was faintly visible in wet dark streaks and smooth scalloped edges of whiteness . The ancient trees had not yet been moved or cut down , and as they bent under the snow they were like old gaunt men bending under the weight of time . The early winter twilight stood over the house , the white dropping hills and the twisted iron trees , like a fathomless depth of gray still water , in which dimension , distance and substance were lost and all objects had acquired the wavering and indistinctforms of dreams . The valley at the end of the long slope was lost in a kind of gray opaque mist . Nothing moved or stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no wind . Isolated though the house was , stranded like a desolate hulk on petrified and rounded white waves which extended endlessly into space and time , Celeste yet had the dismaying sensation that it was really enclosed in a vast glassy ball filled with drifting fog which rolled in upon it from every surface . Behind her , as she stood at the windows with their diamond-shaped panes , the house extended , as shapeless , as dreamlike , as empty , as the outer world . It was a house of shadows . She heard the crackling of a fire on a distant hearth in the great still room , but it had no verity for her . Through all her senses she felt the unreal curving of the tremendous staircase in the hall beyond the room , the upper corridors , the rooms opening off them , the dining-room and the library , the morning-room and the terraces . Yet , she could not believe in their existence . It was all a dream . Nothing really existed except her trapped consciousness in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths of the house , servants moved noiselessly . But still Celeste could not believe in their existence . A curious and frozen fear pervaded her , a sort of alert lifelessness and awareness . She felt herself longing desperately for a human face , a human voice . Peter was still in New York . She had only to order a car , she thought , to be in the city within a short time . But the thought brought her no relief . A heavy lethargy was upon her . She could not make herself believe there was any city beyond that shadowy mist below . Finally , she could not even believe in her own existence . The diffusion outside diffused her . She felt her personality silently and softly disintegrating , so that all its cells moved and prepared to drift away . Yet deep in herself was a hot core of drugged pain . She was only dully surprised to discover that she was weeping . The pain in her heart strengthened , but she did not know what caused the pain . She dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not endure this house , that she had never been able to endure it , that she had dreaded it from the moment the first stone had been laid . She had hoped , vaguely , and from the very first , that she would never have to live in it , and when the day of entering had arrived , she had been ill with a kind of inexplicable horror . Its beauty was , to her , the fantastic beauty of a nightmare , grotesque and unreal . Yet , it was a simple and majestic building , and she had chosen all of its furnishings herself , had made all the arrangements . But she had done all this in the depths of a fantasy , and without joy . Without joy . Yes , all her life had been without joy , until she had known Henri . And that joy had been one with pain and suffering . Her tears came faster now . But she was not weeping for herself . She could not have told why she wept . The snow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter . It was only a pall of death . She felt its death all through herself . She thought of the war , the " phony " war , where terrible antagonists gazed at each other in speechless silence , and waited . Even the war was unreal to her . She could not feel its imminence , its reality . She thought of Peter ; he , too , was a shadow . However , the pain leapt in her heart like a startled thing . She was not aware , for some moments , that she had been staring at a pinpoint of light twinkling far below the house , a pinpoint that wavered from side to side , and was increasing in brightness . When she was fully conscious of it , she could hardly believe it . Who would be coming up here on this desolate winter day ? She was expecting no one . Her relativesand friends always called up first before visiting her . She watched the light coming closer . Now , far down on the slope , she could see the struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , falling , swaying , its lights piercing the foggy gloom , and surrounded by a dim aura through the snow . She pressed her face against the cold panes of glass . Could it be Henri ? But Henri was in Washington . He had called her only that morning . The wheels of the car had found the gritty driveway , and it was plowingheavily upward . Celeste could hear the laboring of the motor , itsp305muffled roaring . It was having a hard time negotiating the frozen ruts and the slipping gravel . Then , with a triumphant hoarse heave , it had swung about before the house , and had stopped . It was a large black limousine , like a hearse . And now Celeste recognizedit . It belonged to her brother , Emile . But why should Emile , who was perfectly indifferent to her , and for whom she felt nothing at all except a dull dislike , be visiting her ? The chauffeur was climbing out of the car . He was opening the door . The tall black figure of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side in the drifts . It was Agnes , Emile 's wife . Agnes Bouchard ! Agnes , whom she had always dreaded and avoided , the cynical hard Agnes with the cruel amused eyes . Why should she be visiting her young sister-in-law , whom she openly disdained and found excessively boring ? Celeste turned on the lights , and the great quiet living-room sprang into warmth and pleasant stillness . Even the fire took on courage , and leapt upward . The snow and the death were lost behind windows suddenlydark and protecting . Now the whole house became real and tangible , solid and strong , no longer a diffused and misty outline of walls . Little as she liked Agnes , Celeste yet felt a pleasure in this approach of another human being . She heard Agnes ' voice in the quiet hall , a brisk clipped voice with its undertone of wryness and humor . That voice no longer made her shrink . She advanced towards the archway with a welcoming smile . Agnes appeared . Though she was no Bouchard by birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Latin " Bouchards . She was somewhat tall , and possessed a compact and excellent figure , very chic and slender . She was now about forty-nine years old , but there was a briskness and avidity about her which made her appear much younger . She moved with swiftness and lightness . Her narrow white face , with its long " harpy " nose and patrician thinness , had a cruel and alert look , cynical and shrewd , and there was no gentleness in the thin thread of her wilted lips , so violently painted . Her hard and bold black eyes had a predatory gleam in them , disingenuous and malicious . Agnes Bouchard had no faith in human nature , nor in any of its " virtues . " She did not believe that it possessed any altruism or kindness or justice or mercy , or even decent honesty , nor that it had more intelligence than a monkey . She found it rather regrettable , but amusing , too , that the only good men she had ever encountered had been fools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their generation than the children of light ,  | she would quote , with conviction , and no sadness at all . She found no difficulty in adjusting herself to such a dark and menacing world , and was constantly mirthful about it , because she was a clever woman of considerable intellect and much knowledge . In many ways she was much like her younger relative-by-marriage , Rosemarie Bouchard , except that she was a wiser woman and possessed of much innate integrity and forthrightness and open disdainful courage , and that there was no sadism in her such as there was in Rosemarie . She had for her husband a kind of affectionate scorn and indifference , and a cold and vicious contempt for her dull but dangerous son , Robert , the familiar and slave of Antoine Bouchard . She brought briskness , coolness and movement into the room with her . She had not removed her smooth black fur coat ; it fell back to revealher smart black dress and scarlet scarf . There was a Russian hat of the same fur on the perfect white coiffure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid gloves ; it was evident , however , that she was not remaining very long . " Agnes , " said Celeste , extending her hand , real pleasure shining over the ivory planes of her face . " I 'm so glad you came . But what an awful day . " Agnes ' piercing eyes flashed over her young sister-in-law , and there was a minatory brightness in them . The scarlet thread of her lips curled . " You wo n't be so glad I came in about five minutes , " she said , with hard and disdainful curtness . She moved to the fire , rubbed her hands , stared about the room . " A nice place , " she commented . " I probably wo n't be seeing it again . " Celeste was startled . All her life , she had felt dread at the sound of cruel and relentless voices , and the old shrinking , the old tension , made all her nerves tighten defensively . " Why , Agnes ? What is wrong ? " Agnes continued to rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound in the room . She had begun to smile , her predatory profile outlinedagainst the fire . Then she turned her head again and stared at Celeste with brutal curiosity , as if the younger woman had been an object which aroused her amusement , contempt and wonder . The inexplicabledread in Celeste increased . She retreated involuntarily . Agnes moved away from the fire and sat down in a chair , her excellent back straight and alert . Celeste seated herself also , and waited , her hands pressing one upon the other . " Celeste , " began Agnes , in a cold and curious voice , " do you knowp307anything ? Anything at all ? Are you a complete fool ? I always thought you were , you know . I thought it from the moment I first saw you . You were about five , then , were n't you , or a little younger ? You had black pigtails and big dark-blue eyes and a stupid little red mouth . You were always afraid . People always spoke of you as a tender little creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , even when you were a nasty little brat . It was always men . " Celeste was silent . Her white face was very still and taut . But her eyes fixed themselves expectantly upon Agnes . Agnes nodded with a cynical smile . " Yes , you were always good at that attitude . They thought it was defensiveness . But I know it is invulnerability . You always took exceedingly good care of yourself . You still do . " She paused , and humorously lifted her hand , and began to check off the fingers . " First , there was your father , Jules , who ruined the lives of his sons , because of you . Little Celeste must be protected . ' He never thought the boys really ought to be protected against you . They were n't loving sons and brothers to begin with ; but Jules ' distribution of his estate , to protect ' you , did nothing to increase the loving kindness betweenArmand , Emile and Christopher . Probably they would have feuded , anyway , and plotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exhibited because of you . Did Jules know that ? I often wonder . He never did like his sons . He was a very subtle man . " Celeste 's white lips parted , and she said , quietly : " This is very interesting . But family history bores me , I am afraid . I am not to blame for my father 's will . Also , I must confess that I do n't see how all this concernsyou , Agnes , or how it is your business . Emile 's done very well for himself , has n't he ? Or , do you want more ? You always were very avaricious . " Agnes still kept her hands in the air , in the attitude of counting , but over them she regarded Celeste with narrow gleaming eyes and a malevolent smile . " So , you do have fangs , " she commented . " I always knew it . No one else ever seemed to . " She continued with inexorable animation : " Now , let 's see . Jules was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , there was your brother , Christopher . He was not born a saint , but your existence made him a devil . He fought for you with your father . They fought for you from the very minute you were born . You knew , of course , that Christopherwas in love with you for many years , Celeste ? So much in love that he could never care too much for any other woman . Not a nice story , is it ? A little ugly ? I 've always been very sorry for Edith , Christopher 's wife . " A look of horrified terror , repudiation and sickness flashed over Celeste 's face . She stood up , catching at the back of her chair . " You are a dirty woman , Agnes , " she said , and her voice was only a hoarse whisper . The sockets of her eyes stretched with her sickness and loathing , so that they were filled with blue flame . Agnes nodded with smiling grimness . " Honest people are always nasty , my dear . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such devastating and improper things . I 'm being an honest woman now . For the sake of your soul . For the sake of things so much more important than you , you miserable white little wretch . I 'm not blaming you for your brother 's passion for you . You could n't help it , I suppose . You were lovely and soft and innocent , a combination that does mad things to men . But because Christopher loved you , and still does , I am afraid , you ruined his life . He 's quite insane , you know . He would kill for you , destroy everything for you , even his life . Under certain present circumstances , that is very fortunate . But I will come to that later . What I am saying now is that your very existence made a fiend out of him , instead of just the average bad Bouchard he would have been . He hated his brothers ; they all hated each other . But you made the hatred worse . " Celeste stood by her chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue wool frock , rose and fell with passionate agitation . Her white forehead , her pallid upper lip , gleamed with moisture . Agnes continued with hard serenity : " Now , let me see . Henri came next , you remember . " She paused now , and waited . Celeste did not move , but she appeared to dwindle and shrink , become smaller . However , she gazed steadfastly , and in petrified silence , at Agnes . Agnes was smiling again , with renewed viciousness . " What you did to Henri ! Oh , of course you could n't help it ! You never could . It was n't your fault that Henri came back to America , that he tried to regain what had been stolen from him . He would have done that even if you had never existed . I grant that . But he came and saw , and you conquered . Of course , you were young and inexperienced , and you had a right to change your mind . Henri was a bad man , to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their irresistible charm . Henri , however , was the worst of them all . Nevertheless , he would n't have been such a monster , if it had n't been for you , if he had never seen you . For it seems , unfortunately , that you have the ability to bring out everythingp309that is evil in everyone . I know you do that to me , "  --  and she laughed curtly . " I thought Henri had escaped , when you finally threw him over and married Peter . I thought he would then become just a naturally bad Bouchard , a normal Bouchard . You went away . And then , you came back . " She stopped , for Celeste had moved , just a little , but even that slight movement was as if lightning had struck her . " I 'll come back to Henri , later , " said Agnes , with cruel softness . " We 'll go on now to poor Peter . In some way , he seemed to have escaped the pestilential nature of the Bouchards . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many . I ca n't recall any other , in my own experience . Yes , he was a good ' Bouchard . " It was n't your innocent little fault that Peter had been gassed in the war  --  by Bouchard gas , at that . It was n't any of your doing that Peter returned here . You did n't know anything at all about Peter until he arrived . He was sick , but he was still alive . He still had courage and strength and purity . He married you , and you both went away . I am not saying that he might have been happier , or healthier , with any other woman . At least , until you came back . But , he is dying now . And he is dying in misery and hopelessness . Perhaps that has nothing to do with you . I 've heard that you have been the tenderest wife , and he seems devoted to you . I 'll give you that credit . But  --  sometimes I wonder  --  You never gave him any peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to give happiness to anyone , only passion and madness and despair and ruin . " She stared remorselessly at Celeste . For Celeste 's control had suddenly and violently broken . Her face , her eyes , expressed supreme terror . She had stepped behind her chair ; she had lifted her hands , palms outward , towards Agnes , as if to fend off some brutal and lethal attack . She cried out , incoherently : " Go away ! I wo n't hear another word ! Get out of my house , now , right away ! " But Agnes was unperturbed . She regarded Celeste with shrewd and significant thoughtfulness . " I see , " she said , reflectively . " I see a lot of things . You are n't outraged , so much , by what I have said about Peter . You are only afraid of what I am going to say next , are n't you ? " Celeste was silent . But she was shaking strongly . She dropped her hands . Then she whispered : " My God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Come back , Celeste , " said Agnes , quietly . She stood up . Her smile was gone . Her features were stark and harsh . " Come back . Sit down . I did n't come out in this beastly weather to give you a lecture on your little kitten morals . You can sleep with a dozen men , for all of me . You can curl up in a dozen beds , and I 'll only shrug over it . That 's your business . I suppose , too , you have some fastidiousness . " Celeste had stopped retreating , but she did not return to her chair . The two women faced each other across the wide and gleaming carpet in the silent room . Celeste seemed no longer to be full of terror and dread . She was as still as frozen ice , and as expressionless . Her eyes were empty , as if the shock she had undergone had driven the soul out of them . For a moment , Agnes experienced a rare qualm of pity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a changed tone , " I 'm sorry for you . You were very young and inexperienced , when you married Peter . That was Christopher 's fault . He wanted to save you for himself . Perhaps you 've been sinned against , too . Perhaps it is n't all your fault . Victim of circumstances , ' maybe . When you came back , you were a woman at last , not a child . You had always loved Henri , had n't you ? You had never forgotten him . I can see that now . I thought you were just bored by your sick husband , and looking for a last adventure . Henri must have seemed very romantic to you , I thought . Besides , he had n't forgotten you . None of the men who loved you ever could . I thought , wrongly , probably , that you knew this , and were taking advantage of it . I am mistaken . And so , I 'm sorry for you . " Celeste tried to speak . And then , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands over her face . Agnes watched her . Her own face darkened , twisted , and those hard black eyes were suddenly gentle and sad , as they had never been before . " My poor child , " she said , compassionately . " It is all so terrible . " After a moment she laughed a little , and there was a tremulous and bitter note in that laughter . " I 'm so sorry for you , my dear . And , believe it or not , I 'm sorry for Henri , too ! That 's incredible , is n't it ? Being sorry for a man like Henri ? " Celeste dropped her hands . Her face was wet with mute tears . Her lips were trembling . " Does Annette know ? " she asked , in a painful and dwindled tone . " Does Peter know ? " If Agnes had any last doubts about Celeste 's true emotions , these selflesswords destroyed them . She hesitated . Then she went to Celeste and put her arms about her with a tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down . I 've got so much more to say to you . " She led Celeste back to her chair , and with her own scented handkerchief she wiped away the younger woman 's tears . " No , " she said at last , thoughtfully , " I do n't think Annette and Peter know . But practically everyone else does , I 'm afraid . " Celeste shivered . She leaned forward and clasped her hands over her folded arms , and crouched forward in an attitude of utter collapse and anguished cold . Her head dropped forward . Her bright black hair fell over her face . " I ca n't believe that Henri was so naive that he really expected not to be found out , " said Agnes . " I think there is another explanation . I think he believes , in his egotism , that no one would dare to talk about him , or whisper about him openly , for fear of reprisal . So long as people knew , and kept quiet about it , he did n't care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows everyone is talking . That does n't matter to him . So long as they do n't try anything inimical . He can cope with enemies . And circumstance . But let them try to injure him , or you , because of this  --  matter , and he will smash them  --  he believes . The trouble is , they are trying . And might even succeed . And that will be very bad . " She paused . " I 'm not thinking of you , Celeste , or even of Henri , when I say it will be bad . I am thinking of things much more important . " Celeste stirred sluggishly , in the depths of her collapse and despair . She lifted her head . Her hair clung in disordered ringlets about her wet cheeks . Fear and panic were alive in her eyes ; her face was gaunt with them . Agnes sat down near her , and leaned forward , speaking with a quiet intensity . " Celeste , my darling , do n't you know anything at all ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you anything about what he is trying to do ? Or , are you only his favorite harem wife , kept in purdah , behind screens and veils and walls ? Does he think you are a moron , who would n't understand ? " Celeste 's haggard expression changed . " He has told me quite a little , " she murmured . Agnes leaned back in her chair and contemplated the young woman for a long moment or two . Her own expression was dark and somber . " I see , " she muttered . " Yes , he must have told you . He is a very clever man . He knew that he lost you once because he was repulsive to you  --  his ideas , his intrigues and his plans were repulsive . Perhaps you came together , once or twice , out of sheer irresistible attraction , when you returned from Europe . But he knew that was not enough to keep you . That was it , was n't it ? So , he had to tell you . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he acquired a kind of stern nobility in your eyes , even a selflessness , God help us ! Imagine that , of Henri ! It would be quite amusing , if it were n't so damnably ominous . Frankly , can you imagine Henri doing anything heroic and noble because of patriotism or change of heart or virtue or greatness ? " She laughed harshly . But Celeste said nothing . She only waited . " Nevertheless , " continued Agnes , changing again to somber intensity , " what he is doing now is the only chance for America  --  for all of us  --  to survive . You know that , do n't you ? And you know who his enemies are , and what they are trying to do ? " " Yes , " whispered Celeste . " I know . He 's told me . " " They 're very terrible enemies , " Agnes went on . " There is only a feeble chance that he will win . He is determined to win . He has brought some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has intimidated them , bribed , threatened , coerced them . No matter . You know , " she added , musingly , " if I were a younger woman , I 'd make tracks for Henri , myself . There is something about him . He 's quite a man . " Again , Celeste 's face changed , became intense with passion and tragedy . She fixed her eyes upon Agnes , and waited , her very breath suspended . " I do n't wonder you love him , " said Agnes , with stern gentleness . " He has everything . There are n't many like him now , in America . He has a frightful fight ahead . Emile 's in with him . Even if Emile is my beloved husband , he 's a bloated black rat . Henri did a good job in bludgeoning him . Christopher 's in with him , and Alex , and Francis . But there 's anotherfaction , and a very pestilential one . You know that ? " Celeste nodded dumbly . " Antoine , that sparkling bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Bouchards , but others just as powerful , in politics , in the newspaperfield , in industry . The lesser Bouchards are just milling uncertainlyalong the fringes of both factions . Henri is trying to boot them into line . Antoine is trying too , with much more finesse . And behind them both is a confused and amorphous America . Things are very bad , Celeste , my dear . You know that . What of the future ? America will trundle along behind the winner . We want Henri to win . You andp313I . And so many others , too . We 'll live  --  with Henri . We , and America , will die with Antoine . " She stood up , as if the pressure of her thoughts was too much for her . She began to pace up and down the room , this elegant and assured woman , clasping and unclasping her hands . " I 've never been patriotic . I 've never been an American . ' How many Americans are there in America ? So terribly , terribly few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I only know that America is inert , stupid , mad , dull and dead . We 've got Antoine 's kind to thank for that . A nation of belly-filling morons is very necessary to them . And a nation of lunatics . Do you know about the organizations he is backing ? Filled with insane women , with haters , with the greedy and the cruel and the stupid and the criminal ? We 've got the makings here in America of a robust Nazi party . Hate is their God , and Jaeckle is their prophet . They 've got priests behind them , murderers , thieves and liars , and madmen . That 's the outlook , in America , and that 's the outlook Antoine is fostering . You know why . " She drew a deep breath . " It 's funny , " she murmured . " But I believe I 'm an American now . Because of America 's peril . Because of the mad-men . " " I know , " whispered Celeste . " The America Only Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools and imbeciles , who perhaps even love America , and do n't want to get her embroiled in what they call foreign ' wars . As if there were ever any foreign ' wars ! You 'd think America was a planet rolling around serenely in her own orbit , instead of part of one world . It 's as if a man had cancer in a remote part of his body , and his mind asked him what it had to do with it . It was only in his belly , was n't it ? What had that to do with his arms , or his eyes , or his heart or his lungs ? By some miracle , such a man tells himself , he can ignore the cancer in his belly . But there comes a day when all of him will die . He forgets that . " And then , hovering around the fringes of the America Only Committeeare the lunatic organizations , the orgiastic women who would like to tear little children apart with their naked hands , who would like to torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sons , who would like to stand , breast-high , in the blood of the murdered . Why do you shudder , Celeste ? Do n't you know anything at all about mankind ? I do , unfortunately . " And then there are the murderous and avaricious priests , who would like to torture the helpless , who would like to steal their possessions , who would like to enslave the world , who are bloated with hatred and madness . And then there are the criminals , who want to rape and torment and kill , and see an opportunity to do these things without punishment . Yes , there is much madness in the world . And much of this madness is behind Antoine . " She stopped now . She stood near Celeste . The snow whispered at the windows . The winter wind rose on the long arch of a howl . Agnes suddenly cried out in a loud voice : " How frightful it is ! How can one endure it ? The Walpurgis Night of fury and death is upon us . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after power . Waiting in Washington , waiting in their great factories . Waiting for the ruin of America . " She pressed her thin white fingers against her cheeks . " Madness , " she said . " Madness . The whole world is mad . There are only a few sane men left . Only a few like Henri . What does it matter if he is thinking only of himself ? He can save us , all of us . " She turned quickly to Celeste . " Does Henri think we 'll get into this war ? " " He does n't know , " sighed Celeste . " A few months ago he was certain we would n't . But , not now . He is trying to keep us out . He was sure it would mean the end of America , as we know it , if we were drawn in . Now , he almost believes it will be the end of America if we are n't . " " Does he still hate Roosevelt ? " asked Agnes , with a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once iritated him , terribly . But now he is indifferent . He says this thing is much bigger than politics . However , he thinks the Republican party has a fair chance of winning the electionif it can find a good and spectacular man who will appeal to all elements . Of one thing he is certain , though : Roosevelt will run for a third term , against precedent , prejudice and tradition , and the Republicancandidate will perhaps be defeated . " But Agnes seemed not to have heard this . She sat down again near her sister-in-law . " And now , Celeste , all this comes back to you . " " To me ? " " Yes . You and Henri . Henri 's enemies will stop at nothing to destroy him . They know , now , what he is trying to do . I do n't know what other things they have in mind , but they are ready to expose you . They 'll do it , too . You think the American people wo n't be interested ? Well , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been destroyed by a peccadillo . The vast mass of American people are very childlike ,  |p315easily  swayed . They believe they are very virtuous , statistics to the contrary . Henri 's enemies can make such a national uproar over this  --  this little affair  --  that anything he tries to do thereafter will be smeared . You think that is childish ? I assure you it is n't . Every enemy clergyman in the country will harp on Henri 's infidelity , ' until the fate of America becomes a small affair in comparison . Of course , the more intelligent men will only laugh . But the mass of puerile , and fornicating , Americans wo n't laugh . In their stupidity , they will argue that a man who sleeps with another man 's wife must be a complete rascal , must not be trusted , and is capable of the most heinous and treacherous crimes , that everything he does must be suspect . Many a hero has failed , many a great leader of the people has been discredited , because his pleasant little private eccentricities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the way of the mob . And Henri 's enemies know it . " Celeste was as white as death . " I do n't believe it ! " she cried . " The American people ca n't be so stupid and ignorant . " Agnes nodded her head gravely . " I assure you they can . Like so many of our class , you believe that your mind , your reason , your intelligence , are shared in equal quantities by all other people . That is our fatal mistake . The little laborer , the little shopgirl ; the little storekeeper , the little artisan , whose lives are in jeopardy in these days , will be titillated , made indignant and furious , because the man who is trying to save them from death and enslavement sleeps with another man 's wife occasionally . You think this incredible ? I only ask you to look at history . Not only Caesar 's wife must be above reproach , but in America Cxsar himself must be a eunuch . That is our Puritan heritage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the matter of Armand , too . Have you forgotten that Annette is his daughter ? What if she is told , and she divorces Henri ? Do n't shrink so , my dear . You must think of all this . If Annette divorces Henri , then Armand will go out to smash him . Armand is a bulbous sick fool , but he is very malignant , also , and he loves his daughter . Remember , Henri is only president of Bouchard because of Armand 's power . Once he is thrown off center , then the work he is trying to do is ended . " She stopped and waited . But Celeste said nothing . " You have only to wait a while , " urged Agnes , putting her hand on Celeste 's shoulder . " Only until Armand dies , perhaps . At the worst , only until Henri has swung matters to a conclusion . It is a small thing , really , compared to all of America , is n't it ? " " What can I do ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He would say that it is ridiculous , that I must let him take care of things , himself . He would laugh me into speechlessness . " " Yes , I know , dear . That 's why you must n't tell him what I have told you . He is such a damned egotist . Frankly , I do n't know how you 'll manage it . Tell him anything else . Tell him Peter needs you . Tell him you ca n't see him again while Peter lives . It 's up to you now , Celeste . " Celeste was all resignation , all renunciation . She sighed , over and over . She murmured : " If he goes , he might never come back . He told me that once , himself . He will never come back . I know that . Once I send him away  --  Later , when he understood , he might not want to come back . " " That 's what you must risk , " said Agnes . " I know how you feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger things . " She stood up , and began to draw on her gloves . She looked pityingly down at Celeste , so broken now , so despairing , so drained and lifeless . Then she bent quickly and kissed the younger woman 's forehead . " Oh , my dear , my dear , " she said . And went away . Celeste listened to the laboring of the car as it roared away into the early night . She listened with intensity , as if to shut out her own thoughts . Then , when everything was silent again , except for the wind and the crackling of the fire , the wave of desolation and grief and agony which swept over her could hardly be borne . In the extremity of her pain she could not move . She could only stare at the fire until her eye-sockets were a glare of reflected light . It was a long while before she could rise and climb heavily and weakly to her room . She turned on the lights . She heard the soft pealing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew a sheet of paper towards her . She began to write , and every word was like a knife in her heart . She began without salutation : " I have come to the conclusion that we can not meet again under present circumstances . Please believe that this time my decision is final . Do n't try to see me , please . It is useless . Perhaps some day you might be able to understand . " She sealed the letter , addressed it to Henri at his office . Book Three . THE ABIDING EARTH " One generation passeth away , and another generation co , neth ; but the earth abideth for ever . "  --  Ecclesiastes , 1 : 4. r ; F # ; ip319ANNETTE BOUCHARD suffered from the common sadness of the gentle andunassuming : she was consistently neglected and forgotten , even if she was loved by many . For even the cruel and the malicious had nothing evil to say of her , and if they were guilty of disparaging remarks about her patience and sweetness , they . made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not that she was unaware of suffering and wickedness and all the foulness that is inherent in mankind . But she had a steadfast awareness of the flow of eternity . And she was endlessly compassionate and understanding . The late February day lay over Robin 's Nest like a gauzy gray curtain of smoke , in which everything was indistinct . But there was a warmth and peace in the great old house which had never known the birth of a child . So old and strong a house , she would think , with so many rooms upstairs which might have been made into nurseries ! Could there be such a thing as a sterile house ? ' Children had lived there , yes . Henri and Edith had played in these grand still rooms , had run up and down the wide spiral staircase , had seen Christmas trees in one corner of the larger drawing-room , had watched the rain running in quick-silver drops down the diamond-paned windows , had slept in quiet rooms , had fought , wrangled , laughed and wept within these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annette had wanted to adopt children , but Henri had been enragedat the very idea , and had given her such a malefic look that she had never spoken of it again . It gave Annette a wistful happiness to know that she lived within the house where Henri had had his early childhood . She liked to think of him as a child . She tried often to think of it . But her efforts evoked no image in her mind . When she tried to imagine him as a little boy her uneasy thoughts returned to the portrait of his great-grandfather , Ernest Barbour , which hung in the larger drawing-room . Then a curious compulsion would come over her ; wherever she was , in whatever part of the house , she would be compelled to go to that room and look up at the portrait . Several times this compulsion had come upon her after midnight , and she had had to creep downstairs , light a lamp , and gaze at the painting for a long time. 319 She remembered that when she had first come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard her with cold and indifferent curiosity , even remote enmity . Those pale basilisk eyes would stare down at her with a strange fixity , and once or twice she thought that they were contemptuous . Later , they were merely indifferent . When she believed her heart was breaking ( and this was often ) she imagined there was an alert liveliness in those eyes , as if the painted face harbored thoughts and interest . But never had she imagined pity in them , or kindness . Fury , yes , icy anger , evil disdain , and sometimes aversion and contempt , but never pity . Sometimes they appeared to understand her , and to scorn what they understood . She had never , in the beginning , believed what others maintained : that Henri was a replica of his great-grandfather , that the eyes were identical , the planes of the large colorless face , the crest of the virile rising fair hair . Sometimes she would concede that there was a physical resemblance , but the expression was different . But now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to acknowledge to herself that Henri was now precisely as Ernest Barbour had been . There was the same deep thick furrow between the eyes , the same heavy indomitable folds about the brutal mouth , the same blunt strength in the short nose , the same look of inexorable determination . Sometimes she was sure that the portrait slowly turned its head with Henri 's own gesture , and sometimes it seemed to her that the lips tightened as Henri 's did , just before he opened them to speak in his monotonous voice . Ernest Barbour had been about Henri 's age when the portrait had been painted , and there was the same shadow of premature gray in the light dull hair . For some mysterious reason , this growing resemblance frightened her . Often , she had the confused thought that it was no longer Henri Bouchardwho lived in this house with her , but Ernest Barbour . She would then wander through the quiet and empty rooms , feeling a stranger , a strange woman who had no right here . The curtain would part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , would appear , in her thick crimson velvet gown , bustled and looped , her auburn curls high on her head , a jewel on her white plump throat , her pretty round dimpled face about to break out into the pleasant and gracious smile which was a legend in the family . ( There was a small portrait of his great-grandmotherin Henri 's room , and it had such a kind expression , so humorous , so twinkling and perceptive , that Annette had felt a nostalgic grief that she had never known this great lady . ) Ernest had divorced May , who had loved him with such strength and passion , and had mar/Iried her cousin , Amy Drumhill , widow of his brother , Martin . There was also a portrait of Amy in one of the bedrooms at Robin 's Nest , and she had been lovely , Annette thought . Amy had had a sweet and gentle face , dreamlike and unearthly , with large soft eyes and brown ringlets . The portrait had been painted when she was a girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory satin of her gown . But she had no reality for Annette . Annette was glad that , after Amy had died , Ernest had remarried May , and that they had both died in the old Sessions house that had been the inspiration and the ruin of that terrible man . The old Sessions house had long been rubble , had long been carted away in ignominious ruin , and May had never lived at Robin 's Nest where her daughter , Gertrude , had known such agony . Nevertheless , it was May that Annette always expected to see , entering through a shadowy arch , gliding up or down the great staircase . If Ernest Barbour was the evil and sleepless haunter of this house , May was its kind and beneficent spirit . Annette would sigh . She would think , mournfully , that Henri ought really to have married a woman like May Sessions , always gracious and beautiful and strong and lively . A woman who would have given him children . No wonder then , that the portrait looked down upon her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often minatory . It would have amazed Henri had he known of Annette 's thoughts . For in her weary and idolatrous love for him , she had often pondered over the thought of giving him a divorce , of enabling him to remarry and have the children she would never have . ( She could often hear those shadowy children racing in the upper halls , laughing in the distantrooms , hurling themselves down the staircase , demanding , caressing , crying . ) Then it was that her pain became unendurable , and she would be thrown into fits of weeping that made her ill for days . But after a year or two of her married life , she knew she could not give Henri a divorce . Not while Armand was alive . Annette knew so much that no one else knew , or of which no one else dared to speak . Once she had heard her cruel relative , Rosemarie Bouchard , say to her sister , Phyllis : " That horrid little twisted creature will never divorce poor Henri . She has her claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't divorce her , because of that smelly bloated old Armand . So , she gloats smugly over him , knowing she has him trapped . " Annette had been terribly ill for six months after that , so ill that she had almost died . No one knew why ; her physicians were puzzled . It was only the thought that if she died Henri might be ruined that had brought her back to life . Shortly after she had been able to rise from her bed , she had visited an obscure lawyer and had made a will leaving to Henri everything of which she might die possessed , and had enclosed a sealed letter to her father in which she prayed that her share , or more , be left to her husband , that Armand would remember him and do justice to him . But she still feared that with her death Henri might be destroyed . It had been only a few months ago that Armand , taken ill again , had whimpered the truth to her , from what he considered his death-bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot her fears for her father . Later , doubt and fear came to her again . If Henri divorced her , or the capricious sick Armand changed his mind , the threat of ruin would remain . Armand had forgotten that he had told her in his semi-delirium , but Annette did not forget . There were three , now , who knew : Armand , Henri , and his wife . It was only lately that a strange and terrible thing had occurred to Annette : she hoped , with sad impatience , that her beloved father would die , and that with him would die the threat to Henri . With horror , she caught herself searching for signs of dissolution in Armand 's sick face , and she shuddered inwardly when the hope of his immediate death invaded her thoughts . Time was so short , she would say despairingly to herself . Henri was no longer young ; if he was to marry a real woman , and have children , he must do it soon . And Armand lingered on with his needle and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her thoughts , her impatience , her sorrow and sadness , were eating away her last strength , were making her flesh more transparent , her large light-blue eyes more haunted and weary . She felt that all evil was in her . But she could not control her passionate desire that her father would soon die . Though the Bouchards pitied their daughter for a bemused and invalidfool , Annette had never been unaware of Henri 's frequent derelictions . She had followed the courses of his love affairs with painful and absorbed interest . Oh , not that one , she would say to herself , with terror , when one affair or another seemed to be unduly prolonged . Not that woman with her shrewd little green eyes and avaricious mouth , not that woman with her cruel sweet laugh and her fluttering stretching hands , not that woman who loved no one but herself . And , dear God , never , never Rosemarie Bouchard , that svelte smart Parisian evil ! Even if Armand died , she would never give Henri a divorce so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him only wretchedness and hatred . Each time that he began another affair , she would manage to meet thep323woman , to study her . And in all these years , she had never met one to whom she would relinquish Henri . Not until lately . Always , from the beginning , she knew that Henri had loved Celeste , that he would never forget her . But when Celeste had returned , Annette had experienced only anguish . For Henri could not marry Celeste . Celeste was Peter 's wife , and Celeste would never divorce him . Never did she dare admit to herself , not even in the dark recesses of the night , what she already knew . The thought was too much agony . Henri would marry no other woman , this Annette now understood . But he could not marry Celeste . And Annette , with the guilt of the hope that Armand would soon die , could not extend this same hope to include poor Peter , whom she loved tenderly . Had the liaison brought Henri joy Annette would have derived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no joy . Often , she would study him from a distance , and she could discern no new freshness in him , no new vitality or pleasure or life . Instead , these last two months , he had become grimmer , older , more savage , more coldly violent . And it was not because of the unremitting work he was doing ; Annette understood that . It was something else . She had realized , for the last few weeks , that he was not meeting Celeste any longer . She was confused and bewildered and frightened at this . She could not believe he had tired of Celeste , nor she of him . Why , then , was this ? Sometimes she would think to herself with sad surprise and humility : Perhaps they are disturbed about me . Perhaps they think it is " wrong . " She took a strange and inexplicable comfort from this , felt a sudden achingof her heart in tenderness , all of which she could not understand though she was past-mistress in the art of self-analysis . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dissolving that would bring tears to her patient eyes . For sometimes , in the past , during all Henri 's brutal and indifferent derelictions , she would start from her trance of serene self-control with a dazed sensation as if being awakened from a drugged sleep . Then she would experience the agonizing pain and despair and repudiation of resignation . Her own human desire for love and peace and security could not be controlled on these occasions . She would ask herself , with frantic misery and rebellion , why she should have been singled out for lovelessness and detestation and ignoring . What had she done ? Was she not a woman , who desired only to serve and to love , and to be possessed of just a little peace ? Why must all the self-abnegation be hers , thep324self-withdrawal ? Could not Henri have spared for her a little affection , a little consideration , a little tenderness ? It had been so much worse when Celeste had returned . She did not confess even to herself how frenziedly she had hoped that Henri and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always so loved and admired Celeste , so trusted her . Celeste , she would argue childishly , but with faith , had too much integrity , too much honor and kindness and sense of duty , to betray her niece and her husband . If Celeste became faithless , then Annette 's last defense against a monstrousworld would be gone . But Celeste and Henri had come together . Annette guessed quite accuratelyat the struggle which must have tormented the older woman . Her pity was deep and profound . Nevertheless , her heart was assailed and torn apart with bewildered pain . If only it had not been Celeste ! Annette could not explain , even to herself , why she should feel such wild despair . She would watch Celeste , note how she averted her eyes from her niece , see how her pallor and silence and coldness increased daily , how her every word was distrait and incoherent or sorrowful . At these moments , Annette 's despair and anger would soften , and she would feel only compassion . Once or twice she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter , darling ! Do n't suffer so . I 'm really glad . " But some virtue in the poor little creature 's soul would ooze and bleed like a separate and wounded organ , and her last faint hold on life , her last faint faith in mankind , would loosen and sicken . And then , she understood that Henri and Celeste saw each other no longer . After her first confusion , she was sharply overjoyed . Celeste could no longer betray her . Her faith and her hope were renewed again , her courage and her tranquility . She was waiting for Henri today . The warm quiet room was fortified with lamplight and fire against the gloom and grayness of the twilight , against its cold and deathlike menace . Annette wore a soft yellow wool dress and her bright fine hair was swirled about her head in ringlets . Her whole appearance was gentle and childlike , and her large blue eyes shone brilliantly . She heard Henri 's approach , and the old painful throb began in her throat . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , dear , " she said , softly , searching his face with inner anxiety . He looked at her in silence , his expression lowering . Then he said , briefly : " Good evening . " He spoke with an effort , when he added : " A miserable day , is n't it ? " He sat down heavily , near the fire , propped his elbow on the arm ofp325his chair , cupped his chin in his hand . He stared at the fire . He had forgotten her . She saw his gloom and abstraction , and was impotent . If only he drank , as other men did ! If only there could be the pleasant tinkle in tall glasses , the pungent odor of whiskey , the heartening hiss of soda ! But , Henri Bouchard had no solace , no escape from reality . He desired none . Was that a weakness , or a strength ? Annette did not know . She only knew that alcohol was loathsome to him , that the taste and smell revolted him . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that one need not taste it , but could get the effect nevertheless . But he had not really been serious . He desired no effect . Annette timidly sat down near him , a fixed bright smile on her little three-cornered face . She clasped her hands tightly together , and said in a light tone : " Would you like a capsule , Henri ? " " Ah ? " he said , gloomily , turning his head slowly to stare at her . He scowled . " A capsule ? " She felt a fool under that long and inexorable look which condemned her for her inanity . She stammered , still smiling fixedly : " You know , dear . You 've often spoken of capsules . For alcohol . It 's such a horrid day , and so much flu about . I thought perhaps you might like a drink . " She waited for his abrupt and annoyed refusal . But , to her surprise , he began to smile . He dropped his hand . He regarded her with an almost friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then . But not Scotch and soda . That 's too extended a drink . Something concentrated  --  and strong . I do n't know what . " She was dizzy with excitement and happiness . It had been so long since he had condescended to speak to her casually , or to notice her . He was staring at her now with a curiously thoughtful expression , and there was a quickening in the colorless and inexorable eyes that were regarding her intently . She jumped up at once and rang for a servant . She gave the order for two Manhattans . " But very strong , please , " she whispered . She returned to Henri and sat down again . Her smile was wide and strained . She knew very well that she had intelligence and eloquence , but with Henri she had always been mute and absurd . She wanted to say , as always , bright and subtle things to him , brilliant things which would inspirehis admiration . But the words that came from her were always dull and awkward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared him even more . She could only gaze at him with the light andp326brilliant blueness of her eyes , and wish desperately that she could approach him , that he would speak to her fully of what tormented him in these wild and dreadful days . She was sure that he would be amazed at the extent of her knowledge . Though Henri was not a subtle man , he was astute and penetrating . He knew much of what his wife was thinking . Annette was quite mistaken : he did not consider her a fool . In many ways , he considered that she was superior to Celeste ; her mind was pellucid , more mature , more civilized . Often , he was very sorry for her , and angered with himself for his own brutality , for no one , he knew , could hurt this poor pretty little creature without suffering some hurt in himself . He was not given to compassion , but he had felt more pity for Annette than he had ever felt for another human being . Though his look was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he allowed himself to relax a little . When the cocktails were brought , he gave them a brief glance of distaste , put the glimmering glass to his lips and gulped hastily . He made a grimace , wiped his mouth hastily with his handkerchief . Annette sipped hers slowly , hoping and praying that the rigidity in her body would lessen , and that she would be able to speak to him in casual tones . All her married life , she had dreamt of an hour when she and Henri might talk together easily , might reach friendliness and intimacy , might laugh together in the firelight . Was this the hour ? She had never been with him before when he was so thoughtful , so ready . The cocktail created a bright and glowing warmth in her , and the tense trembling of her muscles relaxed . It might have been her imagination , but Henri appeared less stony now , and his broad strong hands lay quite easily on the arms of his chair . Her heart became an enormous and quivering lump in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Was that good ? " she asked , in a shaking tone . " I mean , the capsule ? " " Yes , " he said , in a friendly tone . " Not bad at all . Except for the taste . Why do n't they invent drinks that are n't repulsive to the palate ? That would be a god-send . I feel warmer now . I 've been cold all day . " What can I say that will interest him ? thought Annette , desperately . But she could find nothing to say . She heard herself speaking : " I heard from Papa about an hour ago . He 's been ill again . He 's terribly frightened . And he 's gained twenty pounds , which is very bad . " Why should he be interested in Armand ? But to her surprise , he was interested . " He eats too much , " he commented . " What about the List ? Has he been neglecting it ? "  | " I do n't know . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering sadly . " Why should he be unhappy , Annette ? He never liked the business . It 's been a relief to him that he is n't connected actively with it . Is he lonely ? He never cared much for company . " Annette said , without forethought , and with pain : " He 's sick in his soul , Henri . I do n't think even he knows why . " Henri was silent . But his eyes remained on hers , thoughtfully . Then he said , after a long moment : " Yes . Yes , I can see that . It 's too late for him . It was always too late . " His paleness was less . There was even a flush about his eyes , as the alcohol took effect on his unaccustomed stomach . He said : " Sometimes I think it is always too late for all of us . Perhaps I 'm sentimental . But you know what the Chinese say : Each man lives a life of quiet desperation . ' " He smiled a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning towards him : " Henri , do you live such a life ? No one ever knows anything about you . Do you ? Do you , Henri ? " He did not answer her for a moment , but only stared at her . Then he said , with strange quietness : " Yes , I do . " She clenched her hands together , and cried out : " Let me help you , Henri ! I 've always wanted to , you know . " He lifted his hand and half concealed his mouth . Over his hand he regarded her with a strange intensity . " Why ? " he asked . The tears were thick on her golden lashes . She said , with sad humility , dropping her head : " Because I love you . " There was a sudden thick silence in the room . Henri saw that fair bent head , the trembling of the little immature breast , the tense white hands on the childish knees . He saw her desolation and misery , and hopelessness . He frowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , as if he was greatly ashamed and embarrassed , and unendurablytouched . He sighed . She had never heard him sigh before , and the sound pierced her heart . She looked up , and exclaimed in a trembling voice : " Oh , Henri . Henri ! " And now he saw her piteous face , its pain and weariness and loneliness . " Do n't ! " he said , quickly and abruptly , and turned away . He pushed himself to his feet . He began to walk up and down the room , his hands clasped together behind his strong back . His steps quickened . He seemed to have forgotten her . She watched him through a splintering dazzle of tears.  | And now he began to speak in a low tone : " You ought n't to have marriedme , you know . That was a long time ago ; there 's no use speaking of it now . I had my reasons . I thought I might find time to be kind to you . I have n't found the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was . There has never been time in my life for anything but -- He halted . She rose involuntarily , and stood near her chair , grasping the back . She cried out : " Yes , I know everything about that , darling . But I always did love you so terribly . Do n't reproach yourself . You 've made me so happy , really , just being married to you . " He turned his head over his shoulder and stared at her incredulously . He stood , now , below the portrait of his great-grandfather , and it was two identical faces that looked at her with granite disbelief . A wave of dim confusion rushed over her . Her heart was beating wildly . He was smiling again . He came back to his chair and sat down . He looked up at her . " Sit down , my dear . Do n't be so tense . You are quite a romantic , you know . I ca n't imagine that just being married to me has given you very much . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . She sat down on the edge of her chair . Her eyes were glowing , filled with light . Her humility , her sincerity , made him acutely embarrassed . He lifted his hand and bit his index finger , and averted his face from her . His embarrassment increased , and his uneasiness . And again , he felt repulsion for her . It was as if she had touched his flesh with urgent lovingfingers , and all his body tightened in repudiation . He regretted this involuntary sensation , but he could not help it . If only she would not look at him like that , if she would not be so intense , if only she could be casual ! But she would never be what he wanted , and so , all these years , he had repelled her for fear of her intimacy. he alcohol had dulled his normal reactions , however , and so after a moment , he could control his embarrassment and his pity . He said , not looking at her : " You 've asked me , Annette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " " Yes ? " she cried . " Please tell me . " She could not believe that she had heard him rightly . She leaned towards him . Her little hands fluttered as if to touch him . Again , his muscles tightened , and he was ashamed of their tightening . " Do you know what is happening today  --  in America ? " he asked , quietly , denying her eagerness and intensity . " You live such a secluded life , my dear . I 've often wondered whether you were aware of what 's going on , and what it all means to us. "  |p329She  shrank , and flushed . But she made her voice as quiet and impersonalas his own : " I 'm not entirely a fool , Henri . I read , and listen . Yes , I know . I feel terribly impotent and frightened about it all . " She added : " I go to the public meetings of the American Freedom Committee . " She hesitated : " Please do n't be angry , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And one of its largest contributors . " " No ! " he exclaimed in surprise . But there was no annoyance in his look , only interest . " I did n't know that . I 'm not angry , my dear . In fact , I 'm pleased . You see , " and he hesitated only a little , " I 'm the largest contributor . I also finance Gilbert Small , its radio speaker . " A wave of delight and excitement flooded her . This was intimacy beyondany of her hopes . She was drawn into a conspiracy with him . She could hardly control herself . She began to laugh incoherently . " Do you know anything at all about what I am trying to do ? " he asked , when she was calmer . He leaned towards her over the arm of his chair , and he was very grave . " Anything at all , Annette ? " " No , " she said . " Ca n't you tell me a little ? " He was silent . He regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . She listened , hardly breathing , the light wellingin her eyes , her little face very pale and intent , forgetting everything but what she was hearing . Once , only , did she whisper , as if she could not control herself : " I did n't know ! " He slapped his hand heavily on the arm of his chair , and shrugged . " Well , you know now , " he said , flatly . Then he was silent , staring at the fire . She watched him . " And now , " he continued , after a long moment , " there is a way you can help me . If you are willing to do it , without question . Things are very ominous ; they are coming to a crisis . I have n't given you anything , except a brief outline . Now , I need your help . " " Yes ? " she whispered . " Anything , Henri . You have only to ask me . " " It might not be easy . You might wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now he looked only at the fire . " How much do you love your brother , Antoine ? " " I love him very much , " she said , simply . " I was afraid of that . You do n't know , of course , that he is the head of the faction that is opposing me ? " She was dumb with miserable amazement . At her silence , he turned his large head and regarded her with tense grimness . " Yes , " he said , slowly , " that 's right . That 's why I still want to know if you will help me . And , in helping me , help destroy your brother , and the others with him . That 's probably why I ought to shut up now , and not say anything more . " She could not speak . All her joy was gone , and there was only terror and anguish left behind . But she looked at him resolutely . " Your father knows , " he said , with cunning astuteness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she struggled to draw a deep breath . She lifted her chin . She was very white , and the bright rings of hair on her little head were like a shining crest , curiously strong , but curiously piteous and vulnerable , also . " Tell me what to do , " she said , in a low firm voice . He saw the pulsing of her small white throat , so thin and soft , and he felt new respect for her . " I will tell you , then , " he said slowly , watching her . " Tomorrow , visit Antoine and Mary . Just a casual call , you know . You wondered how they were getting along , and you wanted to see your father . Then , express regret that Christopher and I seem to be at odds . Speak impulsively , as if you were sorry and confused . Tell Antoine , but very casually , and in distress , that Chris and I have had a violent quarrel . You do n't know what it 's all about , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused . Annette was looking at him in silence . The firelight glittered on that lifted small head with its indomitable but defenseless curls . Then she said : " Is Christopher  --  ? " " Yes , " he replied , impatiently . " But you 've promised not to ask questions . I can only tell you that Antoine suspects something , and he must not suspect . If he does , then we 'll learn nothing more of what he is doingunder cover , from Christopher . But look , I 'm wasting time . " And then , you must confess that I 've been borrowing money from you . A lot of money . That I seem very worried . That I went to New York to see old Regan , and that I came back in a very gloomy and depressedcondition . You are very concerned about me . You wonder what it is all about . You wish I would give you my confidence . " He paused , and smiled grimly . " All this sounds very foolish to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said , steadfastly . " Well , then , you can infer that old Regan would n't see me , or something . You gathered that , you 'll say . Then , you can add that I 've quarrelledwith Emile , and Nick and Francis about something . Very violently . You are very bewildered . You do n't know what it is all about . You wish you did . You want to help me. "  | " Yes , " she said , simply . " And here 's another thing , " he said , with gathering intensity . " Before you talk like this to Antoine , who will be very sympathetic and interested , by the way , you must see your father . You must tell him this : that he is to pretend that I 've tried to borrow five million dollars from him , with my bonds as collateral . And that he has refused me . Bring him down , then , to Antoine . Have him remark about it pettishly and tell Antoine that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Antoine , beg him to lend me this money . He is to refuse , very angrily . He is to complain about me , that I seem to be losing my grip , and that he is beginning to have doubts about me . He is to say some nasty things . No doubt he can think them up on the spur of the moment , " and Henri smiled grimly with amusement . But Annette did not smile . There was a strange whiteness about her lips , which were rigid and still . After a long time , she asked , steadily : " Will all this finally hurt Antoine ? Very badly ? " " Yes , " he said ruthlessly , watching her . " Very badly , indeed . It will ruin him . " She did not speak . She only looked at him with anguish . " If you do this , it will encourage Antoine to be a little less cautious . He will move more quickly , and openly . That is what we want . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wait . He 's got to lay himself open . " She was silent . He hated himself , strangely , for what he said next : " Look , my dear . I wo n't need to tell you what my success means to America , to the world , to all of us . You 've got to imagine it . Coming down to a deceptively simple statement , it means this : Either I go under , or your brother . You understand now . You 've got to decide between us . " She felt the enormous implication of the things he had left unsaid . It seemed to her that the great warm room was full of significance , ominousand most terribly important . And in the midst of this vast implication , this universal grimness and fury , she heard his words again : " Either I go under , or your brother . " She felt such a huge pain in herself that momentarily , and with abstraction , she wondered whether she could endure it and live . She was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A whole lifetime ran before her inner eye . She remembered herself and Antoine as children . He had been so gay and glittering and full of amusing ways . She had been so neglected , and only Armand and her brother had cared for her . Armand had been too old ; he could not understand much . But Antoine had understood . He had torn himself away from his delightful affairs very often , in order to amuse her and encourage her , and make her laugh . She saw the gay little things he had brought her , to make her smile in her many illnesses : a monkey on a stick , that had squealed and run up and down with a flirt of its tail , a mechanical dog that squeaked and turned over in the most absurd way , a music box that tinkled , that opened to reveal tiny dancing figures , a little book that had no leaves inside , but exploded when opened , a little mechanical man that strutted when a key was turned , and presented arms . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her for hours , patiently plowing through classic romances , patiently helping her with her French , and telling her naughty but sparkling anecdotes in that language . She never saw him , even now , without smiling at the remembrance . He had always made her laugh . He had never sympathized with her . He had always pretendedthat she was " faking . " When she would force herself to rise and sit in her chair , Antoine brought her no flowers , but only the silliest of gay magazines filled with the most improper cartoons . When she attendeddances and parties , he was always there to escort her , to bring her corsages , to pretend that she was the most beautiful girl in the room . He had bought her records of her favorite arias , and had sung them with the great singers , in a voice that was remarkable for its depth and feeling . She could see him so vividly now , his dark sparkling smile , his extravagantgestures , his dancing eyes ; she could hear his voice , resonant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spasm . She was not unaware that Antoine was an evil man . But she had forgiven him that , always . Because she had loved him , because he had loved her . She had pretended that real evil could not truly live in such a laughing and vivacious young man , that what he did he did out of sheer deviltry and gaiety of spirit . Now , she saw him . She opened her eyes sluggishly to see Henri watching her intently , with a gloomy and cynical look . " Never mind , " he said . " I see it 's too much to ask of you . But I want you to forget what I 've said to you . You owe me that much . " He stirred heavily , as if to rise from his chair . But she was quicker than he . She sprang to her feet . She knelt down beside him . She clutched his arm , in the rough sleeve , with desperate hands . " No ! " she cried . " I 'll do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to do it . It is n't only for you  --  "  |p333She  could say nothing more . All the strength went out of her . She sagged on her knees . She dropped her head on his arm , less in surrender or love than in utter prostration . Henri looked down at the little head on his arm , and his face tightened with compassion and sadness . He lifted his hand and placed it gently on that head . She did not stir ; she seemed to have fainted . He felt the soft ringlets under his fingers , so childlike and defenseless , and their softness crept into his nerves and touched his heart with a poignant sorrow . As WHEN the young Henri Bouchard had walked towards him across the rich and somber carpets of his office , and old Jay Regan had had the startling and confused thought that Ernest Barbour ( long dead ) had come to life and was approaching him , so now the old financier had a similar and equally confused impression that this present young man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . He had seen Antoine Bouchard fleetingly on many occasions , but only at a distance , and had exchanged not half a dozen words with him in the past . He had been troubled , then , at the resemblance between the young man and his dead grandfather , Jules , but never so startled , so instantly frightened and ominously depressed , as he was now . My God , he thought , it is n't possible ! Yet , here was Jules again , suave , graceful , dexterous and subtle , with the well-remembered small skull on which the hair resembled that of a sleek seal , the narrow dark face , brown and somewhat puckered , the dry wily lips , smiling now to form the sparkling dark smile which was a replica of Jules ' , the Machiavellian eyebrows , tilted and quizzical , the small sharp ears close to the head , the light swift walk and the whole air of mocking ingratiation . And , most of all , the vivid evil eyes , so full of laughter and gaiety and cruel refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet guests , for he was too old now , and had always been too formidable to bestow this honor upon lesser giants . But now his surprise , and his strange , ominous , and suppressedterror , caused him to rise involuntarily . It was as if a ghost had invaded the cathedral purlieus of his office . He stood there , leaning on his polished desk , staring , immovable as a mountain is immovable . He was at once a younger man , and an ancient one , feeling his age , his weariness , his disgust and fear , all through his flesh , which had awakened to an earlier middle age . He and his father had been so intimately connected with the Bouchard family that he began with no formalities : " It 's Antoine , is n't it ? " He hesitated . Then he lifted his large and solid hand , veined but like heavy meat , and extended it to Antoine . Antoine was all deference , all old-fashioned grace and admiration . " I 've never really known you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , casually . It 's been a long time since we met , has n't it ? " Regan was silent a moment . His shelved and ambushed eyes studied the young man somberly . " Yes , " he said , with strange slowness and emphasis , " a very long time . " He sat down again . He placed his hands , palm-down , flat and heavy , upon the desk . A dull aura , as of heat and perspiration , spread out about them in an outline , on the darkly polished surface . His mountainous bulk appeared collapsed and full of weight . His chest and belly became one huge round mound , and the great domed head was set upon that mound like the head of some ruined and immeasurably ancient Buddha , overcome by the centuries , overcome by evil . Antoine sat down . He gave off an atmosphere of elegant but deadly vitality and delicate exuberance . Everything about him appeared to crackle . " He will explode , one of these days , " the irrelevant thought came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferential . He allowed a thoughtful look of admiration and respect to increase the sparkle of his eyes . Seeing this , Regan smiled to himself . What was the devil up to ? For the first time in a long while he felt an answering alertness and aliveness ; his old sluggish blood quickened , his old piratical instincts stirred again , refreshed . " I will be frank with you , sir , " said Antoine . " Very frank . I owe that to you , for I know you have no time to spare for elaborate preambles . So , I am prepared to be candid . " Aha , thought Regan , happily . " I will be candid , " had been one of Jules ' most dangerous expressions , calculated to make the serpent coil upon itself in cautious expectancy . Regan said , abruptly : " Your grandfather and I were great  --  friends . You remind me very much of him . We did a lot of business together . " Pleased with this opening , Antoine said quickly : " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope we can do  --  business  --  together , as you did with my grandfather . Very serious business . "  |p335He  paused , delicately . He assumed an expression of embarrassment . Regan leaned towards him , delighted , feeling young again . He put on that large aspect of paternal benevolence which was consideredvery charming . " And how is little Mary , Antoine ? I had luncheon with her father only last week , and he spoke of the coming event . " Antoine assumed husbandly indulgence . " Mary is splendid , Mr. Regan . We expect the event about June . I have n't yet decided whether it is to be a boy or a girl . Frankly , I prefer a girl . " " What ? No dynastic ambition ? " " I 'm thinking of the brat 's intelligence , " said Antoine , with another of his gay smiles . " Sometimes Bouchard males are n't very bright , you know . " Regan paused . But his whole great old face broke into a thousand secret laughter lines , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such as , " he suggested , gently , " Robert Bouchard ? " In spite of his insouciance , Antoine was startled . He betrayed this by the merest narrowing of his black eyes , the merest tightening of his mouth , and then only for an instant . Then he was smiling again . " You are omniscient , Mr. Regan , as well as omnipotent . " Regan spread out his hands in gentle deprecation . " To both allegationsI enter my complete denial . I am , let us say , only  --  observant , and affectionate . The Bouchards and the Regans have been very closely knit . " But Antoine was very thoughtful . He studied the immense old man opposite him . His insouciance was shaken , and for a moment or two he felt gauche . The old fiend , then , was not in his dotage , nor fumbling nor easy , as Antoine had hoped . The power of Wall Street was still a terrible power . Antoine saw that his planned campaign would have to be considerably revised and adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . In the meantime , Regan , who understood so many things , understood this also . " Bob and I are great friends , even if we are relatives , " Antoine said , and despised himself immediately for this naive witticism . Nevertheless , he also immediately saw that this apparent naivete might deceive Regan , and make him less cautious . So he added , with a sprightly air : " After all , the younger generation is coming up . We 'll inherit Bouchard eventually , you know , and we must pick our companions in advance . " " And your henchmen , and vassals , and allies , too , " added Regan , with the most affectionate and friendly of airs , as if he felt the most kindly feelings for this young man . Antoine laughed . " Well , yes . Of course ! I 'm not impertinent , I hope ,  | in suggesting that I 'd like to have some assurance that the great Mr. Regan might be an ally , later ? " Regan was silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver box near his hand . He cut the end , put the cigar into his mouth . Antoine , without haste , rose and struck a light for the old man . Regan puffed with concentration for a few moments . Through the gray smoke his Buddha-eyes stared at Antoine with timeless wisdom and unblinking shrewdness . " I believe in striking directly at a thing , " said the devious Antoine . " So , I might as well tell you now , Mr. Regan , that I 've just heard that you 've refused my brother-in-law , Henri Bouchard , a considerable loan . " He leaned back in his chair , and smiled elegantly . Regan took the cigar from his mouth abruptly . He held it in his fingers , and the smoke coiled near the sides of his head like incense . He was immovable . The tiny ambushed eyes glittered for an instant under his brows . What the devil ! he thought to himself . He did not stir , but there was a sudden huge tautness about his body , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  information ? " he said . Antoine lifted his hand airily . " Now , that would be violating a confidence , sir . Please forgive me , but I ca n't tell you . I only know that I received it . Could I ask you , without impertinence , whether this is true ? " But Regan was silent . He was like gray granite in his chair . His mind darted , conjectured , wondered . Had Henri disseminated this lie , and , if so , for what purpose ? He said , finally : " It is n't impertinent for you to ask , Antoine , but it would be indiscreet of me to give you any definite answer , would n't it ? Suppose , now , that you go on from there ? " Antoine leaned towards him with sudden seriousness . " You know my situation , Mr. Regan . I am Secretary of Bouchard . My father , though retired from active participation , is still the power of the company . You will see , then , how this concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomesvital for me to know , you see . " " I 'm afraid , then , " said Regan , softly , " that I 'm not the one to ask . Did you really believe I 'd tell you , Antoine ? Come now , you ca n't really believe I 'd tell you who negotiated a loan with me , or why , can you ? " He went on , smiling humorously : " Why do n't you ask Henri ? After all , he is your sister 's husband . I presume you are on good terms . " " Oh , excellent terms , certainly , " replied Antoine , stinging all over his body , and cursing himself for ineptness . But , it 's a delicate matter . As I told you , however , it is a matter of vital concern to me , and if I wasp337stupid enough to ask you that question , I hope you will understand that it was only because of my natural anxiety . " " Very natural , " acceded Regan . He waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and midnight darkness , he added : " If there is any way I can assist you , Antoine  --  If there is anything that is giving you anxiety , I 'd be glad to help . Naturally , I am interested finer  --  allsides of the question . " And now he allowed himself to look disturbed . He allowed his hand to drop and betray just the slightest tremor . He allowed a look of old disintegration to creep over his features . He said , slowly : " I 've always had a deep admiration for Henri . When I was a very young man , I saw his great-grandfather , Ernest Barbour , in my father 's offices . I  --  I had thought he resembled Ernest . Sometimes I 'm not so certain . The physical resemblance is there , but -- The " but " hung in the air with tremendous significance . Then , thought Antoine , exultantly , it is true ! He laughed lightly . " I never knew old Ernest Barbour . But , judging from the stories I 've heard of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or , I should say , physical . It seems to me that old Ernest 's pure and simple plan was to benefit old Ernest , and the hell with the rest of the world . He had no senile patriotisms , no sentimentalities , no fears or qualms , or hazy idealisms . He knew what he wanted , he set out without fear to get it , and he always did get it . And the devil take the hindmost . Now , Henri , unfortunately , is n't like that , though he occasionally gives that illusion . " " You mean , Antoine , that he does consider the hindmost ? Well , I , for myself , have never known an occasion when the hindmost ever benefittedthe superior man , or ever showed him the slightest gratitude . Come , now , I do n't believe that of Henri . He has n't gone sentimental . " Antoine 's spirits and cunning were rising . Now Jules , thought Regan , would begin to feel some wariness , and would begin to think . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood in him , which leads him to believe that practically everyone is a fool . Or , could it be a Teuton strain ? " Not sentimental , " said Antoine . " I ca n't accuse him of that . I 'd say that he was scared to death . He was one of the great instigators of the plot to rearm Germany , in violation of the Versailles Treaty . Through international cartels , through his association with I.G. Farbenindustrie . But I know that you understand all that . He thought , and quite con- rectly , too , that it was necessary to build up a strong and **25;9617;TOOLONG against the spread of bolshevism , and Hitler was his man . He was , and still is , the man for us , and will soon attack Russia . That will rid us of the Communist threat . Later , we shall deal with labor , especially after Roosevelt is disposed of neatly . " I 'm sure you know our plans . The business of the world , and the world 's business , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is why labor must not , and can not , have any voice in the future . Hitler will win this war , he must be helped to win it . We have given him promises , and he has given us his own promises . " He stopped , delicately . " You agree with me , Mr. Regan ? " Regan assumed an expression of embarrassed concern . He stared at Antoine with reluctant and furtive admiration . " I 'm not committing myself , my boy . Go on . " He said to himself : Jules would have known better . " A democracy controlled by labor simply can not exist any longer , " Antoine said . " After Hitler has signed a negotiated peace with Britain  --  after he has attacked Russia , and conquered her , we will enter into certain agreements with him . In the meantime , we shall have come to control labor , have elected our own choice as President , and shall see our way to a fascistic sort of government in which labor shall have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is our plan . But you have known this for some time . " " Yes , " said Regan , thoughtfully . " But , I 've lived a long time , and I 've been thinking . There is a certain imponderable something in human life . What if Britain refuses to sign a negotiated peace , no matter what happens ? What if Hitler gets bogged down in Russia ? What if we enter the war , ourselves ? You know , there are quite a number of war-mongers ' here . All of this , of course , is only speculation . " Antoine smiled slightly . " Do n't think we have overlooked the imponderables , Mr. Regan . Suppose , then , that Britain does not sign a peace , and that Hitler encounters extreme difficulties in Russia ? Suppose we enter the war , under pressure from irresponsible politicians , or in some other way ? We have our plans , too . For instance , Bouchard &; Sons made a net profit out of World War I of two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain motor corporation , and now completely dominate it . We have an extremely large branch in Germany at the present time , and we are supplying motors to Hitler , and very excellent motors , too .   " Now , my father-in-law , as you know , controls one of the largest oil cartels in the world , supplying Germany with oil at present . Too , he controls a certain extremely good synthetic rubber patent . Incidentally , answering part of your question , America will have a hard time gaining control of that patent to make synthetic rubber , in the event the Indies ' supply is cut off for us . My father-in-law will make certain that we do not get it , on the ethical ground , at first , that Germany has been granted it . War or no war , that patent will remain in the hands of Germany , and our motor branch will still continue to turn out motors for Hitler , even should the remote possibility occur that we enter the war , ourselves . My father-in-law plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from manufacturing synthetic rubber for a long time . All of this will have a bad effect on our own preparations to fight Hitler . " Regan was slowly nodding . He gave the impression that he was endeavoringnot to show much interest , but that he was really extremely excited . Antoine noted this with gratification . " Then , " said Antoine , " my father-in-law is one of the directors of that certain aluminum company which has a cartel arrangement with Germany . This arrangement will permit Germany to acquire all the aluminum she needs for airplanes , but will enormously limit the supply for America . Again , this will have a bad effect on our preparations for war . At the very least , it will have a delaying action while Mr. Roosevelt'smuddle-headed school of professors prepare to get around to the matter . " Regan turned his cigar slowly in his fingers , and stared at it reflectively . " Where , " he asked , " does Henri come in on all this ? " Antoine laughed . " Henri was in on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a change of mind . It seems that he does n't trust Hitler . Hell , who does ? But Hitler , and we , know that it is to our mutual advantage to work together . He is to win the war , with our assistance , and the assistance of the great British , French , and other corporations , and , in consultation with us , be assigned a sphere of influence . Then , in America , we shall put over a fascist form of government , with all the trimmings to satisfy the fatuous and donkey people . That will be the end of democracy , which can not co-exist with us . " Henri was quite agreeable . In fact , he thought up most of the idea , himself . Then , he had a change of mind ; he did n't trust Hitler . He believed that Hitler might set out on the conquest of America . That is quite true . We planned for that , also . After Hitler has conquered America , we will take over the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri . He believes that Hitler wo n't let us seize the control . He ca n't see himself dominated by Hitler . We can . " Regan leaned back in his chair and gazed at Antoine with strangely blank eyes . " The whole plan is bold , and just a little terrible . Plans have a habit of back-firing , you know . You deprecate the American people . I 'm not getting into any discussion with you on the subject of their intelligence . Incidentally , let me ask you this : Are you , and your  --  associates , still supplying Hitler with oil , motors and other materiel ? I understoodHenri had stopped that . " " Henri , " said Antoine , delicately , " does not know everything . " And then , while Regan listened with the most painful attention , Antoine told what had been done to circumvent the orders given by Henri Bouchard . As Regan listened , he allowed a smile , half of incredulity , and half of amazed admiration , to appear on his mouth . Once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , no one on God 's earth ! A half hour went by , and Antoine 's soft voice continued . And then , when he had done , there was a long silence in the immenseand shadowy reaches of the room . Regan began to speak , and he made his voice shake : " I see . I see . I 'm an old man , and I 've had my hands in many plots , but now I 'm astounded . This is the biggest , and the most incredible . I can see your viewpoint : this war is no longer a struggle between nations , but a struggle between one Idea and another . The struggle of the people , in whatever nation , against those who are determined to master , control and rule them . Yes , I see . Frankly , as you would say , the Idea has occurred to me many times in the past , but I gave it up as fantastic . Now , I see that it has possibilities And now he allowed himself to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . He rubbed his mouth over and over with a hand that did not shake too obviously . He gave the effect that he was trying to control himself , that he did not wish to let Antoine discern how much he was agitated , or how grimly exultant . He also , very convincingly , gave Antoine the impression that he , an old man , had become cautious and careful . He said : " I must come back to the American people . What of them ? Can you keep them subdued , while Hitler wins , and unarmed , until he gets around to them ? " Antoine laughed again . " It is n't very hard . We 've got Jaeckle , who 's very potent here , and has a huge following . We 've got the America OnlyP341Committee , and a dozen subsidiary committees , in which the more violent lunatic fringe can have their little excitements . We 've got the Church , with its hysterical bellowings about International Jewish Communists , and international Jewish bankers . ' The banker business was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too obvious ? I 'm afraid , Mr. Regan , that you 've never fully investigated the abysmal stupidity of the Americanpeople . They believe anything , provided it gives them an opportunity to hate something . We have our plans for race riots , for Negro lynchings , and are organizing very strong pacifist organizations in conjunctionwith the others . We have picked speakers who appeal to the timorousand hoarding middle class , who hate labor anyway . We have our newspaper columnists who harp on the iniquities of labor unions , our radio commentators , our clergymen , our newspapers , our politicians , our Senators , our Congressmen . We have our plans for nationwide confusion and disunity , if the people begin to show any disturbing tendency to interfere with Hitler . It wo n't be hard to discredit Roosevelt ; we 've already done excellent work there . He 'll never be elected again . We have our man picked  --  " " I 've heard of Willkie , Wendell Willkie , mentioned as a possible candidate , " said Regan , abstractedly . " Willkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard that rumor , too . He 'll never be put up by the party . We 'll see to that , I can assure you . Not that I 've anything against him personally , but he 's an unknown factor , whereas our own man knows what we want and what we plan . You can be easy on that point , sir . " Again , there was silence in the room . Then , after a long moment or two , Regan said thoughtfully : " You know , I ca n't help remembering that it was the British masses , against the will of their government , who insisted upon war with Hitler . What if that happens here ? You see , there really is such a thing as a vast , dumb and amorphous consciencein peoples , and that is the greatest of the imponderables . " " Not in America , Mr. Regan . There is no national or racial conscience . Only forty percent of the people are of British stock . The others hate Britain . Moreover , the people generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German people themselves , they are amenable to lies and to skillful propaganda . We do n't consider them for a moment . " He paused , then continued : " There is no chance of our failing , either now or in a post-war world . And that is why I 've come to you today . "   Regan did not remove those piercing and ambushed eyes from the young man , even though he neatly moved and rearranged articles on the . polished expanse of his desk . " Yes ? " he said , softly . " It was good news to us , Mr. Regan , when we learned that you had refused a loan to Henri . It might interest you to know , too , that he 's borrowedlarge sums from my poor sister , and that he approached my father , who refused him . He needs quite a lot of money to circumvent us . He wo n't get it . We want assurance from you that he will continue not to get it from you . " Regan lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiouslook pointed his eyes . He said : " I do n't finance lost causes . " Antoine smiled , and the dark sparkle of that smile invaded all his face . " Thank you , " he said , in the gentlest of tones . With a graceful inclination of his head , very deferential and warm , he lit a cigarette , and the two men smoked in quiet amity for a little while . " And now , I come to another small matter , " said Antoine . " Lord Ramsdall'sbrother , James , is a director , as you know , of Logan Hollister , your London banking counterpart . James is a cautious devil , but old Georgie has let me know , very discreetly , that James is watching you closely , to learn your next move , and that he , himself , is holding back on permits to allow the Venezuelan Oil Products Company to ship oil to Hitler through South American ports . He controls Venezuelan Oil Products , as you know , and is also a director of the Argentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires WaterwaysDock Company , the Uruguay Railroad Systems Company , and one or two others . We need their full cooperation just now , very urgently , in the matter of supplying war materiel to Hitler . James , like all the British Tories , is determined that Hitler shall not be overthrown in Europe , or if the war does go against him  --  which is n't very likely  --  that a negotiated peace be signed with him in which he retains political power in Europe . The British Tories , like ourselves , dare not let democraticor liberal ideas survive . However , James is watching you , waiting for your next move . If you can give him the proper signal , the pace of the war will be immeasurably quickened , and Hitler 's conquest of Europe completed in short order . The British Tories are much more afraid than are we of what you have called the imponderables . ' " " The imponderables of the peoples ' conscience , ' " murmured Regan , almost inaudibly . " I beg your pardon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself on what is possibly nothing atP343all , " said Regan . " So , James is waiting for my word , is he ? He 'll get it . I can assure you of that . " He opened a drawer in the desk and brought out the mounted decanter and two small glasses . He filled them delicately . Antoine watched the golden liquor rising in the glasses . " Napoleon ? " he asked . " Napoleon , " agreed Regan . " I always use it to seal a bargain . " He smiled now , affectionately , and with grim charm . He watched Antoine as the young man appreciatively sipped . " I 've said , " remarked Regan , a few moments later , " that I never finance , or associate myself with , lost causes . I 'd like to know the names of a few men who are in this with you , the heads of the corporations . I understand , of course , that they have to move circumspectly , but none has been to see me . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the warmest of handshakes , Regan put in a call for Henri Bouchard , in Windsor . He spoke quickly and tersely : " Look here , when you do a little important lying hereafter , why not inform me beforehand ? I had a few bad minutes an hour or so ago when your relative , our little Antoine , called in . However , I got the drift . Incidentally , it is very important that you come in to see me tomorrow , no matter what you have to leave . By the way , he is n't like Jules at all . " He added , irately : " He thinks I 'm in my dotage . " After the call to Henri , he called a certain great man in British politics , and during the conversation much was said about James Gordon , brother to Lord Ramsdall , the powerful newspaper owner . RICHARD MORSE , President of the Morse National Bank , rolled back to his massive leather chair with a grunt of satisfaction , after he had closely studied the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat down , his legs so short that his feet swung clear a full five inches from the floor . He felt about with one foot for his leather footstool , and smiled grudgingly at Antoine . " Well , perhaps you did n't do any harm , shooting off your mouth that way to old Regan , " he said . " Our friends could n't have moved so fast without that Venezuelan oil . Moved up their timetable a bit . Fact is , though , I could 've murdered you in cold blood , at first . You had no real assurance that Regan was n't pumping you and distributing the informationwhere it would do us the most harm . " But Antoine only laughed . " I know enough about the dear human race to understand that an old pirate like Regan does n't become religious and soft and conscience-stricken overnight . It takes time . And indigestion , gout or ulcers . He does n't have any of those , so does n't feel any urge to save his soul . What has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us doubt him ? He financed Mussolini in 1927 ; he made it possible for Hitler to obtain credits in the most unlikely places ; he put pressure on the Bank of England and the Banque de France ; he extended credits to Japan and advanced money to exploit Manchuria . He and Dr. Schacht are old friends . As late as November , 1938 , he met Schacht in Berne , where profitable arrangements were made for German credits all over the world . " " That 's fine , fine . But what has he done lately ? Nothing . During your precious five years he has sat on his swollen rump in his office and glowered . He always did have a soft spot for England . Yes , yes , " added Mr. Morse , testily , " I 'm remembering the meeting with Schacht in November , 1938 , but that was only to safeguard his own investments . You took a long chance , Tony , a very long chance . " " But you must admit it was a good one . He promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidently given . The oil moved on from Venezuela almost immediately . And now , " and Antoine made an expressive gesture with his narrow brown hands , " Norway . Denmark . Holland . Could n't have been done without that huge supply of oil in a hurry . " Richard Morse grunted , puffed at his cigar . He was a very short fat man with a huge red face , deceptively good-natured and benign in expressionexcept for the piercing blue of his little piglike eyes . His white hair was cropped closely about his big round head , but at the top there was a riot of snowy curls , very beguiling . He had little white hands , daintily kept , and he wore a large diamond on the left hand , a gaudy piece of jewelry which , however , did not detract from his solid appearance . He affected soft gray as his most becoming color , and he was fastidiousdown to the last detail . The two men sat in thoughtful silence for a little while , a rich and satisfied silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less satisfied : " What 'll the reaction of the country be to these new invasions ?

How many people , d' you think , will swallow the new stuff he 'll put out , that he had to defend ' Norway , Denmark and Holland from British aggression , when even the goddamndest fool in America knows that Britain has n't the planes , tanks or men to protect herself , let alone invade any other country on the Continent ? " " I 've told you over and over , sir , that the American people do n't think . I can assure you that the only real reaction of Americans will be a more fearful impulse towards isolationism .

It 's an insanity . It 's a drug , a disease . Unreliable . You can buy it one minute , and ca n't buy it the next .

And now , the countries he has invaded are Protestant countries . Protestant pulses all over Americaare going to be uncomfortably stirred , y'know . They 're going to scrutinize Halliday and his gang just a little more closely , and the leaders of the America Only Committee , and the rest of ' em . " " Jaeckle , our best man , is a Protestant , " reminded Antoine , smoothly . " And one of the leaders of the America Only Committee is a Jew .

How come Hitler 's allies and satellites are Catholic ? And what about the Pope 's role in Europe during the past year ? It wo n't take much to convince them that this is really a religious war , under the surface , a last final deadly struggle between the forces of Catholic reaction and Protestant liberal progress . Y'say it 's fantastic ? My boy , it 's the fantastic element that always comes up inconveniently , when you least expect it . " " But that 's nonsense , sir .

What if we have religious riots in this country ? In the confusion , the people will begin to think , in a rudimentary fashion . It wo n't serve our advantage , I can tell you that . We 've got to have a nation determined on peace , let hell break out anywhere else . A bad thing , gettingmixed up with religion .

" shouted Mr. Morse , turning quite purple . " One of my ancestors fought with Cromwell , and did a good job , too , driving the Irish swine into the sea . God damn it , I would n't mind a few thorough anti-Catholic riots in America , and if they do n't shut up soon , they 'll have ' em ! " He struggled for breath . " Look here , we 've got to have a nation unified for peace , until Hitler is in a position to help us . No more damned Catholicsocieties messing things up . Have I made myself clear ? " Antoine nodded soothingly . " Of course . But that is n't in my province , exactly , Mr. Morse . " Mr. Morse pounded the desk with both fists . " She 's a cursed cousin of yours , is n't she  --  that Phyllis ? Tell her to shut up . My son 's wife is not going to mess things up for us . That 's my final word . " Antoine was amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Bouchards , either , for Phyllis . " Nevertheless , he was extremely uneasy , despite his debonair expression . It was the most damnable thing ! He had always had the highest respect for the ruthless and venal Richard Morse , who could always be depended upon to be avaricious and expedient , without dangerous emotion or doubtfulness . Yet , he had given vent to the most primitive of hatreds , and had exploded into emotional vilification of a Church which had , paradoxically , done much to promote his interests . In the final wild hour , then , it was not reason , it was not even self-interest , that made the decisionsthat shook the world . It was emotion , primordial passions , and the deep inexplicable pulse of the amorphous human heart . Jay Regan had murmured something which he had believed inaudible , but Antoine 's quick ear had caught it : " The imponderables of the peoples ' conscience . " ( In Morse 's case , it had been the imponderable of instinctive hatred for the stranger . ) The imponderables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life , Antoine felt apprehension and doubt . What if , in the final wild hour , the conscience of the American people exploded into terrible being ? What if they started from their beds , their desks , their machines , their tables , with one loud and frightful cry of rage and indignation ? What , then , would happen to their enemies , the men secretlysworn to betray and enslave and despoil them ? Incredible , thought Antoine . However , his apprehension became deep uneasiness . This mongrel race of men called Americans , this spawn ofP348the gutters of Europe , this bewildered , stupid , ignorant horde , bedevilled by Church and by hatred and by lies , could never have one unified voice , could never compel its diverse pulses to beat in unison . Their masters , their betrayers , were too strong , too cold , too ruthless , too clever , for them . The news machine began to tick furiously . Muttering profanity , Mr. Morse pulled himself from his chair , reached the machine , lifted the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read swiftly . And then his red face turned the color of old dough , and his mouth fell open . He stood with the ribbon in his hand , and did not move . Antoine rose swiftly , and went to him . Mr. Morse could not speak . Antoine took the ribbon of paper from his paralyzed hand . " The Honorable James Gordon , of the British banking firm of Logan Hollister , has just been arrested on a warrant charging him with treason against the Empire The two men looked at each other in an enormous silence . The machineincreased the tempo of its clicking . Numbed , Mr. Morse lifted the ribbon again , and read : " Information in connection with Mr. Gordon has been furnished Washington , in the belief that American associates of Mr. Gordon -- Antoine said : " Yes ? Well , we 're still neutral . It 's bad about Gordon , but they ca n't do anything to us . " Mr. Morse spoke thickly through stiff lips : " Except that materiel and oil will be curtailed in South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low steady voice , numbed and incoherent . The machine clicked on . Stupefied , they read : " Mr. Gordon 's brother , George , Lord Ramsdall , the London newspaper publisher , has also been taken into custody for investigation in connection with certain subversive articles which appeared in his publication , which , it is charged , have for their purpose the hampering of the British war effort . More serious charges , it is expected , will be preferred by Scotland Yard against Lord Ramsdall . " " Curse them ! " cried Mr. Morse . " Do n't they know they 're done ? Do n't they know the Empire 's finished ? Do n't they know Hitler will invade them in a matter of months , and smash them ? God-damn fools ! " Antoine said nothing . He stood near Mr. Morse , his dark and puckered face very pale . He said at last : " I do n't know . Are they finished ? I do n't know ! " He heard again , with sudden sharp fear : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chuckling as he sat at his desk and telephoned HenriP349Bouchard in Windsor . " Well , they got Gordon , and Ramsdall . Our little rnanceuver was a great success . Hah ! Hah ! " From all over America , immediately after the invasion of Norway , Hollandand Denmark , came a curious sound , like a gigantic breath sucked in , and held . It was as if a man sat at his peaceful table , idly watching the light of sun and shadow lying on unthreatened fields outside his window , and then became aware of a far-off but terrible sound , doomful and sinister . It was not thunder , for the sky was still serene , the aerial blue still soft and shining , the shadows and the light still held motionless in the tranquil peace . The full plates still steamed fragrantly on the white cloth of the table , the silver still shone brightly , and the birds in the trees outside still twittered and brushed the leaves . Not a thing had changed , after that terrible sound had gone , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat more waiting . The man could hear that waiting ; it reminded him , with sudden horrid unease , of an animal crouching , burrowing into the ground soundlessly , drawing himself together , after the shadow of an eagle 's circling wing had passed restlesslyand seekingly over him . The wing had gone , but the terror and waiting of the animal remained , and its heart continued to pulse in swift horror and dread . That was the waiting and the fear that made America draw in her breath in one universal convulsion , and hold it . She strained her ears . The sound did not come again . Her heart still pulsed ; she felt its unease , its rapidity , through her whole body . From the space from which the sound had come there was only silence now . But it was no longer a serene and sunlit silence . The peaceful light on her fields had a brazen look in the sunset ; the blue spaces of heaven seemed less tranquil than foreboding . When the birds sang their last song to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp with nameless fear . And the very trees , standing so motionless on the grass , seemed less dreaming in the evening glow than hushed in the gaunt and hollow silence that lies at the heart of a hurricane . It was some days before a hundred voices , shocked into speechlessness for a while , began their wild screaming , their hysterical shrieking , again . They cried again that even this was not America 's business , that whatP350 America had heard was only the echo of a storm that had passed harmlesslyfar from her . But millions of Americans , now , once dulled , once too greedily frightened , once too indifferent , too cruel , too stupid , too ignorant , impatiently and absently brushed aside those dangerous and inimical voices as one brushes aside clouds of gnats with a wave of his arm . And these Americanslooked toward that shining space in the heavens from which the terrible and ominous sound had come , and their faces were pale , their eyes staring , in the too bright light of the brassy sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April 's fragile garments was caught in a thousand trees on Placid Heights , near Windsor . In the valley the river was fresh clear silver , running free and swiftly through new fields . The slopes of the hills brightened . The sky had a faint but pellucid clarity that touched the heart with mysterious hope , and from the ground rose the strong breath of the young earth . Workmen were busy about the house which Peter and Celeste Bouchardhad built . They had stripped away the undergrowth down to the rich brown soil , and upon this soil they were sowing grass seed . New young saplings had already been planted . Low mounds of various shapes would soon be flower-beds . Evergreens were suddenly massed together where only straggling timber and weeds had grown . Paths were gravelled ; there was a smell of pungent tar in the clear cold air , for the drivewayswere being laid . In the air , also , was the odor of clean sawdust , the sound of many voices . The conservatory was being built , behind the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winds of spring bent the trees , moaned gently in the pines on the slopes that fell away from the house . Peter , from his window , watched the activity . He had been very ill again . He sat in a wheelchair now , for he had only been allowed to get up from his bed a few days ago . It would be several weeks , he had been warned , before he would be permitted to walk outside . To himself , he said : It will be never . How many days have I left ? he would ask himself , anxiously . He had been ordered not to work , at least not for long . But his desk had been pushed between the windows , paper had been placed upon it , and his writing utensils . His doctors no longer objected . Enforced idleness , they saw , would kill him quicker than work . For some reason they could not discern , he must work . P351He wrote broadcasts . Under an assumed name , he wrote articles , embodyingthe information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines published without recompense . A few times , the pressure of an unseen hand forced more prominent magazines to publish his articles . His book was finished , was soon to be published . He knew he could not begin another . He had no more time . What he must do now must be swift , pungent , telling , like a warning cry lifted in darkness . It must be sharp and loud , so that the sleepers might be awakened . He was writing an article now , called " What Is Our Hour on the Timetable ? " But he felt that he was pushing blindly against a wall that had no gate in it , though behind the wall lay a threatened and slumbering city . His voice was so feeble . Could it carry beyond that wall ? He was one of the first voices that cried out that Japan , like a great carrion bird , was already circling over the city . His articles , upon pressure from that unseen hand , had been published reluctantly in two or three prominent magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being vigorously attacked not only in enemy newspapers and by public speakers , but on the very floor of Congress , itself . His identity was demanded . He was denounced as a war-monger , a liar , a trouble-maker , probably in the pay of armaments-makers and the " international bankers . " He was accused of endeavoring to create strained relations between America and Japan , " our good friend and excellent customer . " Nevertheless , an embargo on oil and scrap was placed on shipments to Japan . He worked on . He counted every hour of the life that remained to him . He felt death in every part of his body . He thought of nothing but his work . That was all that mattered . Celeste , himself , his life , were nothing now . The last straw of self was blazing in the bonfire of his terror for America . Celeste , understanding all this , did not urge him any longer to conserve his last strength . She only comforted him when his pain was too great , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could do nothing to minimize it . When Henri came , she brought him to Peter , and left the two men alone together . She hardly saw Henri these days , though he came very often , sometimesalone , sometimes with Annette . Her consciousness was removed from him . And from herself . She dared not think of herself , for , if she did , she feared she would go mad . For a most frightful contingency was upon her , which she did not think of , even when she was alone . Peter ,   she knew , must die soon . In his death was her only safety . Yet she did not think even of that very often . All her life and her efforts were centered on her husband . When Henri came , and she met him , she looked at him as from a far and empty distance , not seeing him . He was always courteous and cold , and indifferent , passing her on the threshold of Peter 's room , as if she had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faint far twisting in her , like the dulled memory of a pain stifled under a narcotic . But even he did not matter now . As for himself , if he saw that there was a thin white line running from her brow back over her black hair , which had not been there a few months ago , he did not even glance at it directly . If he saw how haggard and gaunt her face was now , how pallid her lips , and how deep the bluish shadow about them , he gave no sign at all . It was Christopher who saw , of course , and who suffered , for all his malignancy . All the other relatives had been asked , tactfully , not to call upon Peter and Celeste during these last days of Peter 's life . They called on the telephone , they invited Celeste for dinner , but that was all . Christopherand Edith came , and Henri and Annette . It was Christopher who knew before even his wife knew , or Annette . And certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for Celeste had always been a great and pure thing in his life . So , it happened , that on a particularly bright soft April day he came to see her , and her alone . CELESTE was resting in her room , after a morning of ministering to Peter . She had almost fallen asleep , out of deep exhaustion , when a maid , softly entering , told her that Christopher had arrived , and that he wanted to speak to her upstairs , alone . Celeste stirred sluggishly , out of the depths of her anaesthesia of suffering and weariness . She was lying on a yellow velvet chaise-longue , and she drew the silk coverlet a little higher over her body before Christopher entered . He shut the door behind him , and then came to her . She looked up at him , and smiled wanly , stretching out her hand . He looked down at her hand as if it were some curious object , then , with the strangest and most convulsive of sighs , he caught and held it so tightly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for her heart began to pound with a sick premonition . P353He had not said a word as yet . He sat down on the edge of the chaiselonguenear her knees , and looked at her . He still held her hand . He could feel its frail chill , its thinness . He looked down at it , and automaticallybegan to rub it in his dry cool palms , which yet were warmer than her fingers . She had always loved him so much , she thought , dimly . He was always her brother , her father , even when she had feared him the most , and hated him the most . That narrow razor-like profile , those cold and enigmaticeyes , those tight and colorless lips , at once so crafty and so subtle , were ageless to her . He was still her young brother and protector , and her friend . If his thin sleek hair was gray now , with only a few faint streaks left of its once smooth brown , that had no meaning for her . There was something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that seemed to loosen the anguished tenseness in her , and she whispered : " Christopher . " And she sighed , over and over , as if something stirred in her heart with unbearable relief , but also with unbearable suffering . He was very grave . Slowly , then , he bent towards her , and kissed her cheek . " Poor Celeste , " he said , gently . " Poor child . " She flushed when he said this , as though he had said something embarrassinglyindecent , or tactless or absurd . She drew her hand away , dropped her eyes , and answered : " Why ? " When he did not speak , she glanced up quickly , and saw that he was smiling just a little . But the silvery eyes were not smiling ; they were very gentle , and unusually soft . She had not seen this softness since she had been a child , and she was poignantly touched . Her indrawn breath was almost a dry sob . Again , she colored . " Celeste , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I asked you to trust me , has n't it ? And the last time , you had no reason to trust me . But I 'm going to ask you to trust me now . You see , I know so much about you that you think is hidden from everyone . It is n't hidden from me , darling . " She had listened to his first words with an attitude of cooling withdrawal , but at his last words she started , looked up swiftly with raw fear white on her face . But she said , calmly enough : " I do n't know what you mean , Christopher . " He was silent a moment or two , then he said , heavily : " Yes , my darling , you do . " He waited . She did not speak . Her face was whiter than ever . When she lifted her hand to push away that white-streaked lock from her forehead , he saw that her hand was shaking .   " I 'm not a child , Kit , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not used since childhood . And as she used it , he winced a little , as if in pain . " I have my worries ; you know that . But so do many other people . Have I been whining ? " " No , " he replied , abstractedly . He sighed . " So , you are n't going to trust me , are you , dear ? I do n't know how I could help you . Now . But I thought it might be some relief " He was surprised when she suddenly burst out with tight but uncontrolledpassion : " Nothing can ever help me again ! No one can ever help me ! 0 God , I wish you 'd leave me alone , Kit ! " And she pressed her hands suddenly against her face , palms-out , and moved violently on the chaise-longue . He waited , not touching her . After several long moments , she dropped her hands , and showed him her face , starkly , and it was haggard and convulsed . " Go away , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to go , but instead , walked slowly up and down the room , his head bent , as if thinking . She watched him , drawing her breath in and out very quickly , as if she were weeping . But her suffering eyes were dry and watchful . Her hands were clenched together , the nails whitening under the pressure . Then he stopped beside her , and he was suddenly stern . " You 've got to trust me , Celeste . You 've got to talk to someone . Who have you , except me ? Do you remember how you used to come to me for everything  --  " He paused , for she had begun to smile with such bitterness and darkness , and the eyes that were fixed on him were bright and hard . " Still , " he said , quietly , " it would have been best if I had succeeded , fifteen years ago , when I tried to make you marry Henri , would n't it ? You see , I do know that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . " What he had said was brutal , but Celeste met it with bitter relentlessness . " If I had married Henri then , it would have been all up with me . You knew it . If Mama had n't interfered , you might have succeeded . You did n't think of me . " His natural cruelty flared up in him , and he lashed at her : " It 's rehashingold garbage , all this , is n't it ? But I want to remind you , my dear , that it has n't been all up with you ' since you came back . Has it ? " He added , when she only stared at him in terror : " You see , I do know a great deal , my pet . I do know that you have n't thought it was endangeringyour immortal soul , or something , to cavort around with Henri for some time . " P355She sat up , stiffly , and her face was gaunt with desperate fright . She could not speak . Her hands fell limply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and sat down quickly beside her . He took one of her cold and rigid hands . But she only looked at him , speechlessly . " Celeste , you 've got to trust me , my darling , " he urged . " Ca n't you see there 's no one else ? Do you actually believe that I 'd be treacherous to you , now ? " He waited . But she still could not speak . He could feel her shivering . In the gentlest of voices , he went on : " You see , I 've known about you and Henri for a long time , from the beginning  --  " But she interrupted him in a hard loud voice : " What I 'd like to know is : Who does n't know about it ? " He frowned , startled . " No one , I hope , except you , and me , and Henri . " " Then , disillusion yourself , Christopher , " she said , in that unnaturallyloud bright voice . " It seems practically everyone does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was enormously disturbed . " No , you are wrong , Celeste . I know it . The people most concerned , for instance , Annette and Peter , do n't know . That 's all that matters , is n't it ? " " Who told you , then ? " she said . He waited a moment or two , then said , very quietly : " Henri . " She stared at him with blank incredulity . Then , forcing her voice through her stiff lips , she cried : " I do n't believe you ! He would n't You are lying ! " " But he did , " said Christopher , inexorably . " From the very beginning . We discussed it . " Now her haggard face turned crimson , and her eyes were suffused . " You  --  you discussed it ! " she repeated , in a stifled voice . " You , mybrother  --  " " Stop being a romantic , sentimental fool ! " he exclaimed . " Of course , I discussed it with him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister , you know . If you were going to trollop around , I wanted to find out why , and I wanted to keep you from getting hurt . I knew what he was ; I 've always known . I 've always known , too , that women are n't important to him , even if he always did want you . I know he is vengeful , and seducing you ( nasty , Victorian word ! ) would make him feel quite high and satisfied , after you had kicked him out some years ago . P356I was n't going to stand by and see you hurt , not if I could help it . So  --  we had the discussion . " Horrible shame swept over her . She put her hands to her throat , and averted her head . He put out his hand to touch her , then withdrew it . " Let 's be sensible , my dear , " he said , more gently . " You know , of course , that he 's always hated all of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smash us . I had a little smashing I wanted to do myself , to the family . He wanted you , and I saw if you married him , I 'd have an ally of sorts , though he 's a damned treacherous swine . You spoiled my plans , and married Peter . Then , you came back . I soon saw that something was up between you . Perhaps you 'd grown up , and saw that you really wanted him . I 'm not blaming you . But I knew you would probably be hurt . I did n't want you to be hurt . That 's why I forced him to discuss it with me . " " You forced him  --  " repeated Celeste , and now he saw that she was smiling contemptuously . And at her smile , his face darkened spitefully . " You 're not telling me the truth , " added Celeste . When he did not speak , she turned to him , and her smile was very malevolent . " You 're not , are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , if he was to relieveher agony and secure her trust . He pressed his lips together for a moment , then looked at her directly : " No , not quite , " he said . " That is , I 'm not telling you everything . But what I 'm not telling you does n't matter . Let us say , for instance , that I found out , and talked to him about it . " She was partly disarmed by his words . She turned her face away from him again . " What did he tell you ? " she asked , almost inaudibly . " He said , " continued Christopher , with renewed gentleness , " that he intended to divorce Annette , after Armand died , and marry you . And I had reason to believe that he was telling the truth . " He added : " You see , he wants children . It is n't only you , my dear . " She was silent . But now all the bitterness and hardness had gone from her expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pressed her fingers to her eyes , dropped them , and looked steadfastly at the windowsthat opened out on the wide April air . " And then , " he went on , " I found out that you have n't seen him since January . No , he did n't tell me . He 's a close-mouthed devil . But I found out , perhaps by intuition . " He paused . " Why , Celeste ? I know it is n't his fault . It 's yours . Was it because of Peter ? " " No , " she said , clearly . " It was n't because of  --  Peter . I know youP357think I 'm hysterical , but I do n't begin something to end it emotionally , without a reason . If it had been  --  Peter , I 'd have never begun it . " He said , with increasing gentleness : " Then why , darling ? You were n't tired of the affair , were you ? " When she did not answer , he said urgently : " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea you did n't tell him why , either . You did n't think enough of him to tell him ? " She still did not look at him , but her profile became rigid and very pale . She twisted her fingers together . She said , quietly : " I did n't dare . There were too many other things to consider , things more important than us . " He was baffled at this , opened his mouth to question her , then did not speak . He fixed his attention on her profile , and his own face tightened , became extremely thoughtful . He was a subtle man , and excessivelyintuitive and discerning . As his thoughts progressed , he became incredulous , shook his head once or twice as if arguing with himself , then , as he read his sister 's face with increasing clarity , his incredulity vanished . He said , reflectively : " I do n't think anyone would have tried to injurehim . They would n't dare . " Yet , even as he said this , doubt and alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk up and down again , with accelerated steps . Finally , he stopped at the foot of the chaise-longue , and said : " Perhaps you are right . I can see that . But , why did n't you tell him , instead of breaking it off like that ? " She said , in a dull voice : " Who could ever tell him anything ? He 's too brutal , too egotistic . Who would ever dare to lift his hand against the powerful Henri Bouchard ? Yes , he 'd think that . He 's always thought it . He forgets that every man is vulnerable , especially a man who sets out to destroy his enemies . " Christopher sat down quickly beside her again . " Celeste , " he said , with low urgency , " just how much has he told you ? " She shrugged , restlessly . " A great deal . Does it matter ? " She added : " I knew if I told him , it would do no good at all . He would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do it myself . " Now a look of extreme pain came into her face , and she sighed , again and again . " And now , I suppose , it 's all over , for him . Even if I explained , after a while , when it was safe , he would n't care . " But Christopher only sat and scrutinized her keenly . Her caution , her control , were gone now . She went on , in a louder , swifter voice , rubbing her hands together , drawing herself together asP358if she were most frightfully cold : " I knew we could n't  --  see  --  each other again , while Armand was living . It would be fatal to him . I could n't see him until he had divorced Annette . And he could n't do that , everything considered , until Armand died . There were so many things  --  People are so vicious She was speaking incoherently . Then she could say nothing more , and was silent . Feeling her impotence , she flung out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , she whispered : " I 'll tell him , some time , when it 's safe . But he wo n't care , then . I wrote him . He never tried to see me again . He told me , once , that if I sent him away , he 'd never come back . So , he wo n't ever come back . " Christopher was overwhelmed with pity for her . He put his hand on hers , and said : " Yes , he 'll come back . All you have to do is to send for him . I know it . " But she shook her head with profound and dreary conviction . " No , he wo n't . " She added : " Even when I explain , he wo n't come back . He will be furious . He will feel I 've insulted him by suggesting that he had ever been vulnerable . You see , I know all about him . " Christopher began to speak , then stopped . His colorless and narrow face suddenly flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Then , with resolution , he put his hands on his sister 's shoulders , and turned her forcibly to him . He looked into her desolate dull eyes . He said , softly : " You do n't think he 'll come back  --  when it 's safe , of course  --  because of the child ? " Now the dullness of her eyes vanished in the sudden frantic lightning of terror which flashed into them . She tried to pull herself backwards from his hands , but he held her inexorably . Her mouth fell open blankly , and he saw the white shining of her teeth . " Celeste ! " he said , sharply , frightened for her . But now she had a frenzied strength . She pulled herself free of him . She swung her feet to the floor , and stood up , trembling as if she had been struck . She cried out : " How did you know ? Does everyone know ? " He stood up . He knew he had to calm her , for she appeared ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her terror . He grasped her arms and held her again , with hands that were both gentle and firm . But he could hardly bear to look at her poor distraught face . " No , I 'm sure no one knows , except me . Who comes here , anyway ? You have n't seen Annette for a month , and as far as I can see , HenriP359does n't look at you when he does see you . Edith has n't been here for some time , either . So , I 'm the only one . And I would n't have known , so far as any sign is concerned . It was just  --  call it my intuition , " and he smiled slightly , a smile which was intended to reassure her . " Sit down , dear . You 'll fall , if you do n't . There , let me help you . " But she suddenly turned to him and clung to him with desperation , dropping her head to his shoulder . She began to sob , wildly and withoutcontrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her weep , knowingit was the only relief for her . He pressed her head against his shoulder , murmuring words of tenderness and compassion and understandingsuch as his wife had never heard from him , nor anyone else . And for the first time in many years , he felt the old sad melting of his heart for his sister , the old sick throbbing and protectiveness . It was a long time before she relaxed sufficiently to let him put her again on the chaise-longue . Beyond the windows heaven had darkened immediately overhead , but in the west the sky was all static , hollow blue , with one small fixed cloud in it , touched at the rim with pale cold fire . Celeste was shivering so violently that Christopher closed the window , lifted the coverlet from the couch , and placed it gently over her shoulders . She sat , huddled together , her head bent . Then he sat near her once more , and studied her with grave pity . " Why did n't you do something about it  --  before ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without lifting her head : " I might have . But , Peter took ill , right after  --  right after I sent Henri away . He was sick for nearly three months . He almost died , you know . I did n't have time  --  to think . I had a vague idea something was wrong  --  in March . But everything was so confused . There were so many nights when we thought Peter would die . And I was so exhausted . No time to think , at all . And , when I did , I could n't leave him , not even for  --  that . I kept waiting , thinking each day that I could leave him . I knew it would have to be for about three or four days , at least . But he kept getting worse . I could n't leave him . " She drew a gasping breath . " Then , last week , when I could leave him for a few hours , I went to a doctor in Philadelphia . " She paused . Her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . He could n't do anything for me . No one could . " Christopher could not help saying , with alarm : " Did the doctor know you ? " " No . I just picked him at random . I did n't give him my name , of course . " " How long  --  ? " asked Christopher .   " Over four months , now , " she whispered . Now that everything had been said , Christopher was appalled . He fumbled for a cigarette , lit it , stared at it blindly . Then he offered Celeste a cigarette . She took it , and he lit it for her . The tears ran down her pale cheeks in childish rivulets . But he saw that she was calmer , now . " You must have some plans , Celeste , have n't you ? " he asked , after a little . " How do you expect to explain this ? To Peter , " he added , hesitatingly . She said , in a voice completely without expression : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Despite what he was , he was sick at her words . He frowned involuntarily . " And , " he said , inexorably , " what , after that ? When Peter is dead ? How will you  --  " " I ca n't go away , " she said , calm with despair . " Everyone will be sure to find out , eventually . So , as far as anyone will know , it will be Peter 's child . " He could not help exclaiming : " Do you expect them to believe that , Celeste ? " When she shrugged heavily , he saw how completely she was undone . " It wo n't matter . They wo n't dare deny it to my face . If I went away , they would have reason to talk about it , openly . If I stay , and I will , they wo n't dare " But , we all know that you and Peter She lifted her head and smiled darkly and fully at him " ' You all know . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked at him with the hard straight eyes and the cold smile that are the products of cornered despair . He felt painful compassion for her , intense and wretched . " You 've got courage , my pet , " he said , staring at her with incredulous and sad admiration . " Yes , I can see what you mean . No one but the family will doubt . But they wo n't talk about it , except in whispers . There 's family pride , you know , and even though we hate hell out of each other , we put up a solid front to everyone else . And after a while , if you keep your mouth shut , and your head up , they 'll pretend with you . A kind of perverted family loyalty . Yes , you can get away with it , if you stick it out and look them in the eye . " And he smiled at her affectionately . " And Edith and I , of course , will stand with you , for what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one knows anything about your affairs . " P361Then he had an alarming thought : " But what if Peter does n't She said , very quietly : " In that event , of course , I 'll have to go away , before it 's too obvious to him . I 've got to spare him that , you know . No sickly confessions , and all that , even though he 'd stand by me , I know . " There was a long silence between them . Celeste finished her cigarette in the heavy serenity of despair and resolution . But Christopher 's cigaretteburned itself away in his fleshless fingers . Then he said : " There 's another thing : Henri will eventually know . Have you thought about that ? What do you think he will do ? " " That 's another reason for my staying , and facing it out , " she replied , tonelessly . " When all of them see that I expect them to believe it 's Peter 's child , he wo n't dare say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually think that he would strike an attitude and shout out to the world that it 's his child ? Not if I know Henri ! " " I see . Of course , you 're right . But there 's another thing : do n't you think he might rush matters , then , about a divorce from Annette ? " She looked at him with sharp fright . Then , she shook her head . " No . Not under present conditions . No . He 'd know that he would n't dare do that , while Armand is alive . While it is n't safe for him to do it . " Then she said , drearily : " I think he 'll be glad he 's out of it , anyway . " She was suddenly crying again , her lip trembling childishly . " I 'll have the child , anyway , " she said , with simplicity . " That 's something . " For some time Christopher amused himself with certain vicious thoughts . Then he became aware of Celeste again , with renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her close to him . " Poor darling . You 're a brave little devil , you know . You always were , God help you . " She drew away from him a little . " Not so brave , " she said , steadfastly . " I 've thought of killing myself , sometimes . " That night , at Endur , Christopher told Edith , without emotion , and with an air of indifference . He knew her strength and lack of emotional upheavals . But even she listened , aghast , though she said nothing until he had finished . " My God , how terrible , " she said . And , characteristically : " How terriblefor Henri . " Christopher smiled unpleasantly . " You mean , how terrible for Celeste , do n't you ? Or do you still have a brother-fixation , sweet ? " She looked at him , her nut-brown eyes filled with an expression he had never seen there before , so ruthless , so minatory was it .   " Are n't you mistaken , Christopher ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister-fixation of your own , are n't you ? Never mind . We 'll get nowhere , bickering . " She looked at him fully , and now her eyes were dim . " You 've never really loved me , have you , Christopher ? " He was about to say something , out of the virulence of his nature , but remained silent . Then he said , reflectively : " I believe I have . Yes , I believe I have . " She swallowed stiffly . She sat before him in her smart plainness , her slender legs crossed . Her brown hair was streaked with silvery lines , but her dark profile was still lean and firm and young . " You are a brute , you know , " she said . But I 've told you that so many times . What do they call you ? The white snake . ' I 've never thought that about you . Sometimes I 've thought you loved me . " He repeated , still reflectively : " Yes , I believe I have . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling the truth . You know , I 've always hated Celeste a little , because of you . I do n't think I hate her now . I 'm glad you told me that you love me , Christopher , " she added , simply . " You never told me before , not in so many words . " He was touched . He went to her and took her hand , then bent and kissed her . " You 're a fool , Edith . But you 're the only bright woman I 've ever known , too . I like bright women . " She lifted her arms and put them about his neck , pulling his head down so that she could kiss his lips . Her smile was soft and tremulous , despite the habitual stern lines of her mouth . " You hurt me all the time , you pig , " she said . " But you ca n't help hurting everyone . I understand you , you see . Well , thanks for small favors , my pet . I know you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed him away from her , with a little laugh , in which he joined . Then she frowned thoughtfully before her . " Your darling little sister has courage , " she admitted , grudgingly . " I never believed that , before . So , we 're in a conspiracy of silence , eh ? You do n't think there 'll be trouble with Henri ? " " No . It 's obvious there wo n't . And when Peter 's dead , and pray God that 's soon , Celeste will be treated tenderly , outwardly , at least , by the family . With you most tender , in the forefront . The family is a little afraid of you , my soft little angel . They wo n't dare laugh in your face . "   PETER knew that each day that he lived was a day borrowed reluctantly from death . He had known that with his mind , but never with his full consciousness of body and spirit together . It was like a fact established by the cold intellect but never accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May day he awoke very early in the morning , just before dawn . Though it still was very dark , the darkness had that thrilling quality of the earth immediately preceding the rising of the sun . It was an aliveness , an awareness , that quality , as if he stood in a dark ante-room looking at a closed and massive door behind which teemed great life and great movement , unseen , and unheard . He had awakened , and though he was aware of an immense lassitude and numbness in his body , his mind was abnormally clear , vivid and alert . When he moved his hands , he could hardly feel the motion , so numb was his flesh , and he was quite amazed to discover that the pressure of the bed under him was barely perceptible to his body . He listened to the darkness , to its clear and hollow substance . The windows of his room could not be seen . Everything was impenetrable , and filled with peace . Then , in that vast and hollow peace , that breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds of dawn , soft , whispering , like the woodwind notes of an orchestra . They murmured solemnly , hardly stirring . Slowly they deepened , became stronger . The newlyleafedtrees moved and lifted up their branches and their voices , strengthening the light far notes . Now , from far and wide , from over the dark moveless hills , from over the distant valley and the far river , other voices advanced and rose . The tremolo of the bird took up the song , until all the dim air fluttered and was pierced by golden notes . Peter lifted himself heavily in his bed and drew aside a drapery . The earth still lay under a black and airy sea , but beyond the eastern hills there was a line of pale bright fire , throwing those hills into silhouette . That fire ran electrically over the rims , and above it the sky slowly pulsed into a tremulous rose , streaked with thin flame . Now the chorus of the thousand voices deepened exultantly ; the wind increased the tempo of its cello notes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poignancy that Peter felt the tears in his eyes .   He had never regretted the necessity of death . He had always been so busy , so anxious , so tormented , that he had never felt that death might overtake him , personally . At least , he had never felt this with his emotions . Now , he felt it . He was filled with sad and active regret , with immeasurable sorrow , with a nostalgia that was like an unbearable pain in his heart . Concerned , as he had always been , with the agonies of men , with injusticeand cruelty and madness and fury , he had been too absorbed to withdrew into himself and indulge in contemplation . He had rarely thought of God . When certain men had spoken to him of God , he had listened with inner impatience . What had " God " to do with the immediate and terrible problems of mankind ? It was an apotheosis to be indulged in only by metaphysicians , by those who had no real regard for their fellows . At its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wicked , the foolish , and the tyrants . If Peter had thought of God at all acutely in his life , and particularly in the past years , it had been with rage and hatred and detestation . If there was " God , " how had He been able to stand by in complacent or evil silence through these years , through the last decade , and see what there was to be seen ? How could He have beheld the degradation and violence of mankind , the torture of the innocents , the death and tears and despair of the defenseless , the multitudes who had died with hands uplifted to the mute heavens , and not have moved in His eternal might and destroyed their enemies ? How many countless prayers must have risen from the ghettoes of convulsedPoland to that silent and heedless God ! How many anguished cries for help must have started from the bloody cells of the concentration camps , from the burning walls of churches and synagogues , from the turgid gutters where children died in torment , from blasted homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been no sign from Him who had declared that it were better that a millstone were hung about a man 's neck and he were cast into the sea than that he inflict sufferingupon one of these " little ones . " Thousands upon thousands of these " little ones " had perished , their mouths stopped with their own blood , their arms reaching for the mothers who were not there  --  and God had slept , or had not cared . The innocent had died unsuccored and uncomforted , in agony , torn asunder by man , deserted by God . Out of his thoughts , then , out of his anguish for the helpless for whom no one cared , there had arisen in Peter a profound hatred and loathing for any " God " who might exist . He had felt his spirit standing nakedP365and alone on a desolate mountaintop , cursing God for the horror He had inflicted on men . There was no excuse ; the apologies and explanationsof churchmen were foolish and outrageous mouthings , the mutteringsof imbeciles who must have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . There were some who declared that God was " testing " mankind by this horrible spectacle of human depravityand human suffering . There were some who promised that those who died helplessly , and in torture , would enter a " better world . " But to Peter no " better world " was worth the last fluttering , dying gasp in the throat of a little child . What eons of eternal bliss could ever erase the final memory of that death , that hopelessness ? If the enemy paid and paid throughout eternity for his cruelty and his madness , it would not be enough to take from the records of time the glazing of one child 's bewildered and suffering eye , as it died in loneliness and pain . There was simply no explanation , no excuse , for the last pathetic lifting of a dying child 's hand , for the last wild shriek of a mother searching in ruins for a little body ruthlessly murdered , for the last groan of a man in a concentration camp . There was no forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no forgiveness for the God who permitted them . Peter 's hatred and loathing for " God " extended to the vile creatures He had created , to all the world . Now , as he watched the morning rising over the hills , he was overwhelmedby his pain . A universal suffering pervaded him . He felt the universal sorrow of the earth . And at last , in him , the hatred ebbed away , leaving only tears and sadness behind . He saw that the tormentor sufferedequally with his victim , that in the end he died in equal anguish . So , Peter 's sorrow , too deep for despair , too profound for words . He felt the universal aching throughout his spirit , felt a grief too enormous for anything but prayer , for anything but compassion . And with this , he knew , with all his emotions , that he was about to die . The realization , all at once , brought him a solemn and bottomless peace . He watched the dawn brightening , heard the louder triumphant voices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no fulfillment . He could not deceive himself that he " understood . " He only accepted . He was glad that he was about to die . He hoped only that there would be no remembrance . How frightful to carry into eternity the memory of the horror of men , of the indifference of God , of the mysterious hopelessnessof the world !   When Celeste came softly into his room at half-past seven , she thought Peter was asleep . But when she approached the bed , she saw that his face was turned speechlessly to the window , where he could see the morning sunlight on the tops of the trees . He turned to her when he became aware of her , and smiled . She said to herself : He is dying . And then it seemed to her that there was a great rending pain in her heart , suffocating and shattering . She knelt beside the bed and touched his hand . She felt its coldness , the skeletal hardness of the fingers . She could not speak . She looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while , looking deeply into each other 's souls and thoughts . Finally , Celeste laid her head beside her husband 's on the pillow , and knelt like that , hardly breathing , not thinking . At last , she felt his hand on her head , gently and slowly smoothing it . When she looked up , her eyes dry and burning , she saw that he was smiling again . His voice , weak and calm , came from his quiet lips : " My darling , you look so tired , so exhausted . Will you do something for me ? Go out today . Go somewhere . Go for a walk . Look , the sun is shining , after a week of rain . " " No , " she said . " You must , dear , " he said , with great urgency . " It would please me very much . I 'm much better , you know . After a while , I 'll get up and work a little . " " No , Peter , you must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so tired . You did n't sleep much , did you ? " He did not answer for a moment , then said , turning his head away a little on his pillow : " No , not much . But then , I get no exercise . Lying here , and sitting in the chair  --  that is n't very much . " She gazed at his profile , so attenuated , so delicate and drained now of every emotion , of every longing . Yet , it was not a peaceful profile . It was one of profound resignation and weary patience . The pain in her heart quickened so that she pressed her hand to her breast , and she was blind with suffering . She saw at last that he had turned his head again to her and was regardingher with deep and penetrating love and compassion . " Celeste , " he said . " Yes , darling ? " she whispered . His hands moved restlessly on the light blanket which covered him . " You know , dear , and I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longerP367to live . I 'd like to know that when you are free , you will be happy , that you will find happiness . Somewhere . " His voice was very gentle and very calm . " Peter , " she began . And then could say nothing else . But her tears came now , very slowly , dropping over her cheeks . He raised his hand heavily , and , with a smile and a faint sigh , and with infinite tenderness , he brushed those tears away . " Hush , dear . Do n't cry . Why should you cry ? In many ways , we 've been very happy together . I like to remember how happy . It 's been no life for you . I 'd like to think that you might be really happy again  --  sometime . " And again , they looked at each other in that deep and unspeaking silence . Celeste was sick with her pain . She lifted his hand and pressed it to her cheek . " You 're still young , my dear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't end for you . You 've had a lot of misery , with me . I hope you 'll forget that misery , and remember the pleasanter things . The things we saw together , the talks we had , the walks , the times we laughed , the new places we visited , the friends . " " If I remembered all that , I 'd never be able to live , " she said , inaudibly . And then it seemed to her that her heart broke and divided on an immense and tormented cry . She pressed her face against the bed . She burst into wild sobbing . " Forgive me , Peter ! " she groaned . " Forgive me ! " Her hands clutched the sheets and blankets , pulled at them , writhed among them . Her sobs shook the bed . She forgot everything but her anguish and despair and remorse . It was not for some time that she realized that Peter had neither moved nor spoken , and had not replied to her . When at last she lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with grave and stern gentleness , and with such sad and passionate understanding . And then he raised his hand and pressed his fingers on the long white streak that ran backwards from her forehead . He lifted that streak and moved it between his finger-tips . He said : " I never saw that before , my darling . " She opened her shaking lips to cry out against herself , but he shook his head . He said again : " I never saw it before . I 've been so blind , so inexcusably blind . " And then he moved his head so that he could kiss the white brand of her long suffering . She felt the pressure of his lips , and closed her eyes on a spasm of agony that struck at her consciousness , and made all things faint and dim about her . When the doctor had paid Peter his daily visit , he went down to see Celeste , who was waiting for him . He said , gravely : " He is very weak . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time . He is resting now . He asked me particularly to tell you to go out for the day . " He paused , seemed about to speak , hesitated , then said nothing . " Did he say why ? " asked Celeste , dully . " There are some people , " replied the doctor , " who want to be alone when they  --  realize . They want to think about it . You see , I do n't think he fully realized all this before  --  not completely . He does , now . He wants to think about it . He 's in no pain . He seems much better , mentally , than he has been for some time . Physically , of course , he is much weaker . " He studied her intently . He remembered what Peter had said to him at the last : " I feel it 's come . I want to spare her . I want to be alone . She must n't be here . " Of course , that was nonsense . Sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " I 'll come in again , in about two or three hours , " he added . " His nurse is with him now . I think it would please him if you were to go out for a while . " He went on , when she did not speak : " Mr. Bouchard is right , of course . You look very tired and ill . " With more compassion than he usually felt for those he served , he saw how haggard she was . Her eyelids were red and swollen , her lips white and parched . She was still young , but she looked old , especially now , when the bleached lock of hair fell in disorder over her forehead . " It would do you good , " he urged . " It does no good , making one 's self ill in caring for an invalid . This is the first nice day in a long while . Suppose you go out for a few hours , Mrs. Bouchard . " Celeste nodded , but he wondered , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his consciousness , the consciousness of a doctor . There had been something about her which he had overlooked , in his preoccupation with Peter . He shook his head , impatiently , puzzled . Then , at last , it came to him , and he was profoundly startled . Yes , there had been a heavier fullness to her breasts , a richer outline to her figure . It was strange that he had not noticed all this before , he exclaimedto himself . How tragic , then , for the poor young creature ! HeP369wondered when  --  He recalled , with greater bafflement , that he had been in personal attendance upon Mr. Bouchard for over six months . During that time , his patient had been very ill , completely bedridden . The doctor pulled himself up sharply , shook his head , grimly . One must not think these things . A physician , especially , must not think these things , and more especially , not of rich and powerful patrons ! It could have happened ! he exclaimed to himself . What other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly ill , in the beginning . Stranger things have happened ! Why , there was that case of Mr. Jonathan , who had been bedridden for two years with a failing heart , who had not been allowed to lift his head from the pillow . Yet , his wife had produced a fine bouncing baby two days after her husband had died ! So , it was not inconceivableAT Two o'clock , Celeste , dressed in a black broadcloth suit and loose furs , and a small black hat with a gay red feather springing up from it , came in to tell Peter that she was taking his advice , and going for a drive . She had powdered and rouged her face , and painted her lips . She looked quite merry and composed . Peter gazed at her , sighed inwardly , and returned her kiss when she bent over him . The nurse smiled benignly . " Do n't hurry back , " he said , pressing her gloved hand . " Are you driving , yourself ? " " Yes . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are certain that you wo n't need me ? " " Not at all , " he answered , with immense gaiety . " Miss Broder is here . She is going to read to me for a while . Then , later perhaps , I 'll sit up and do some writing . There is tomorrow 's broadcast , you know . " She gazed at him , and thought : He is surely better . He looks more rested . There is even some color in his face . She kissed him again , and left the room . He listened acutely until he heard her drive away . Then he raised himself a little and watched her small red car going rapidly down the long driveway . At the bottom of the incline , it turned , wheeled away towards the valley , was lost among the greening trees and shrubbery . Then he fell back on his pillowsP370again , and sighed , over and over . A gray shadow moved across his face , and his light-blue eyes sank deeply into their sockets . Miss Broder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slitting open the letters , which she gave to him . He read listlessly , droppingthe sheets from his hand , as if they were too heavy to hold . " Why , here is a foreign letter ! " she exclaimed . She peered at the stamp . " A French letter ! " He lifted his head eagerly , and took the envelope from her hand , and scrutinized it . " It 's from Israel , " he said . " I have n't heard from him for two months . He 's so damned obstinate . I suppose this is in reply to my letter demanding that he get a visa and come here . " He tore at the envelope with eager trembling fingers , waving away Miss Broder 's offered assistance . A thin sheet of paper , covered with delicate blue writing , fell out . Peter began to read , his eyes leaping over the page : " My dearest , dearest friend , " said the letter , " when you receive this , I shall no longer be in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the German Government have taken two dear friends of mine into custody , as hostages against my return , for trial , they say , for heinous crimes against the Reich . My dear friends are innocent good people . One of them was a professor of physical science in the University of Berlin . Such a dear , kind old man , who had never harmed anyone , who had lived in some gigantic and mystical world of his own , in which he had moved with God . Unfortunately , his God has been unable to protect him , for he is a Jew . The other friend is the writer , Emil Meyer , who wrote those delightful , fantastic , semi-fairy-tales of ancient Teutonic gods . It appears that he had no right to weave his stories of those gods , for he , also , is a Jew . Both my friends are in Dachau . I have been promisedthat when I return , they shall be released . I do not know whether these promises will be kept , for there are no men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it does not matter . No doubt , I shall be confined to Dachau , also , but there I shall see my dear friends , and comfort them , for the time that will remain to all of us . " I ought not to have left Germany .

The agony of one is the agony of all . " Do not sorrow for me , my dear friend . Be glad . I am an old man , and I can not live and look upon the things which are done in these days . Be glad that I have died . Let me quote to you the words of Faust :  | " Eh Bien ! puisque la mort me fuit , Pourquoi n'irais-je pas vers ale ? Salut ! 0 mon Bernier matin !

His features became pinched , his pale lips blue . The alarm of the nurse was greatly increased when Peter looked at her with a dazed and empty expression , the paper slipping from his hand to the bed . Yet , when she bent over him , he said , very quietly : " Miss Broder , I 'd like to be alone a little while , if you please . " " Are you ill , Mr. Bouchard ? " she asked , anxiously , her warm hand reaching out to touch his forehead . But he moved his head away from her , and repeated , very gently : " Please . I 'd like to be alone . " She left him , then , demurring , with long backward glances of anxiety . She closed the door behind her , but stood by it . Finally , she went to telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the door closed , he lifted Baron Opperheim 's letter and read it again , every word , slowly and carefully . At last , his hand dropped ; the letter fluttered to the floor . Peter turned his head and looked at the bright May sunlight streamingin through the windows , touching the rug , the posts of the bed , the side of a chest of drawers , the gay backs of books in a small bookcase near the fireplace . He looked at the intense warm blue of the sky , and the pattern of green leaves that flickered against the windows . Everythingwas silent except for the swift rustling of the trees , the drowsy whirring of a grass-cutter on the wide lawns about the house . He felt no pain in his heart . He felt only a complete deadness , a complete and heavy desolation that was like the crushing weight of great stones upon him . Under that weight he could not breathe nor move . Sorrow was too small a word for what he was enduring . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gone from him forever , leaving him face to face at last with the heart-breaking and speechless agony of eternity . " Hail ! 0 my last morning ! I arrive without terror at the end of my voyage ! " Faust had said , and Israel had quoted him . " I am , with this draught , the sole master of my destiny ! "   But Peter could feel none of the nobility and grandeur of the words . He felt only the dread waste , the fearful and useless anguish , the immortalhopelessness . All at once he could not endure it . He raised himself on his pillows and cried out furiously , and in dying agony , to the sunlight , to the immeasurableblue sky : " Israel ! Israel ! " His body strained in repudiating hatred against the sky and the sun , against the God who had lifted no hand to prevent the tragedy of all the ages . Vast chaos tumbled before his dimming eye . Vast mountainsrose into tumultuous being , collapsed into red mist ; thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of integration ; he was a spark of burning malediction whirled about in heaving and limitless space , a spark that lamented and cursed and imploredin a wild gale of imprecation and dying despair . Somehow , in that immense confusion he felt the taste of hot salt in his mouth which increased to a choking flood . He felt himself falling through emptiness , down into a huge darkness filled with pain . He opened his eyes slowly , as if heavy stones lay on the lids . The sunlightstill streamed into the room . There was no sensation in his body . He was only feeble consciousness . Then he became aware that Annette was sitting beside him , holding his hand . Her bright fine hair was a halo of soft light about her tearstainedface . Her large blue eyes were fixed upon him , and her lips were trembling . He saw her through a haze . Beyond her were diffused shapes . He was not curious about them , though vaguely he understood that they were two of his brothers : the gray and frigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jean . Emile , " the bloated black rat , " and Armand , and Christopher , Celeste 's brothers , were there , also , and Agnes , Emile 's wife . Beyond the door , waiting and concerned , was Estelle , Francis ' wife , and Alexa , the poor fat stupid wife of Jean , and other relatives , and several friends . The doctor was there , also , and the nurse . But Peter saw no one clearlybut Annette . As he looked at her , she smiled sweetly , pressed his hand , and bent towards him . " My dear , " she said , softly . " It 's Annette . " " Yes , " he whispered . He looked at her , and there was a sudden sharpintensity in his eyes . " We 're looking for Celeste , " said Annette , tightening her hold on his hand . " She 'll be found soon . " P373But he still looked at her with that brightening intensity which appearedunder the glazing of his eyes . He felt no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was only supremely aware . He gazed at Annette , and saw , with sudden profound knowledge , that here was another like himself , vulnerable , gentle , compassionate , and despised . The last strong flowing of his spirit went out to her in recognition and brotherhood . And she gazed back at him , her blue eyes widening and deepening , welling and flowing , with understanding of his recognition . She moved even closer to him ; she bent over him . They communicated in silence , in sorrow , and tenderness . " Yes , " whispered Annette . " Yes , my dear . " She touched his cold sunken cheek with her lips . Tears ran over her cheeks . When she could see him again , she saw that he was smiling at her . His eyelids were so heavy . I will sleep a little , he thought . It surprised him , vaguely , that there was no sensation in his flesh . The darkness behind his eyelids was soft and thick , yet full of waitinglife , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . A strange comfort was creeping all through him , the sweetest of consolations , as if a friend had smiled and spoken . He heard a voice , faint as from a distance , but strong and clear . It called his name . He tried to answer , and he heard his own voice echoing back to himself in the night , as from a thousand resounding places . He was suddenly frightened , filled with horror . Then the call came again , nearer , stronger , reassuring . There was the dimmest light visible now , the sound of approaching footsteps . Someone , in the dimness , which was now a silvery haze , took his hand , held it firmly and warmly , and he felt the presence of someone beloved . He knew , now . He was flooded with light and joy and peace . He clutched the hand that held his own . He felt himself moving through space , peering through the shining haze at the face of his friend . " Israel , " he said . From far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of weeping . He hesitated , drew back from the drawing power of his friend 's hand . The weeping lacerated his heart . " Come , " said his friend , urgently . " Come . The morning is here . "   CORNELL HAWKINS looked long and thoughtfully at his visitor . So , this was the most formidable and the most terrible of the Bouchards , this strong stocky man with the light-gray crest of vital hair sweeping up from his broad and brutal forehead , and the pale implacable eyes which were as opaque as polished stone . Mr. Hawkins had long wished that he might see this man in the flesh ; he had had much curiosity about him . That wide and heavy face rarely appeared in newspapers , and rarely was there a mention of his personal life . He had moved obscurely and invisibly , as the gods move , only their portent sensed , only the vaguestof gigantic shadows thrown on the vast horizon of events . In his turn , Henri Bouchard regarded Mr. Hawkins with equal curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much that poor wretch has told him , about me , about the family ? From his first look at Mr. Hawkins , he knew that here was a man it would be useless to attempt to cross-examine , however dexterously it was done . Henri knew his New Englanders , their classic reserve , their cold aristocracy , their restraint and icy subtlety . Any question , no matter how delicate , would be met with frosty evasiveness , or rebuking silence . For this , then , Henri admired Mr. Hawkins , and his face brightened faintly with friendly interest . Above all things , he admired that aristocracy of spirit which the other man personified , an aristocracy which was never venal , never small or mean , never malicious or petty . " Of course , I knew that Peter was very ill , " said Mr. Hawkins , in a low and reflective voice . " He told me , once , that he could n't live very long . But one never knows . I 've seen many people live to a hearty old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and testaments , and summoningrelatives to their deathbeds . I  --  I had hoped that might be the case with Peter . " He smiled slightly , but his expression was sad . " Had we known that you and he were such friends , we 'd have invitedyou to the funeral , " said Henri . " But we thought the relationship between you was purely that of author and publisher . And publishers are n't very often friends with their authors , are they ? " " No , " replied Mr. Hawkins . His smile was a little grim , as he thoughtp375of some of his authors . He thought also he might like to attend the funeral of some of them , provided , of course , they had first delivered one or two last lucrative manuscripts to be published posthumously . He saw some of them now , in his mind 's eye . Miserable , conceited and exigent wretches ! Who ever had invented the legend that authors moved dreamilyfar beyond the realm of ugly finance ? Someone , evidently smarting from recent encounters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out-bargain the longest beard in a Levantine bazaar . Mr. Hawkins had met only one or two great authors in his life , and they had been kind and modest men , without affectation or pose or greed . But the average author , who only considered himself great , was a noxious species with a peculiarly penetrating and demanding voice , an enormous vanity , and deliberately affecting much temperament . Or he was sometimes a fat and untidy beast , with a lofty expression , a taste for bars and rowdy women . These were bad enough , thought Mr. Hawkins . They were exceeded in unpleasantness only by women authors . He said : " Peter and I were very good friends . " And again , his expression was sad . " Where is he buried ? " " In the family plot , in Windsor . Near his mother . His father , you know , died on the Lusitania . There is only a memorial to him . Peter was very fond of his father . " " I know . Peter told me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early June sky was gray , thick with rainclouds , but between some of their folds a faint radiance was streaming in long wide bars . Now there was silence in the office . Mr. Hawkins had some idea of what had brought Henri Bouchard to him , but he had no intention of making the approach easier for this inexorable man . Henri was laying an envelope on Mr. Hawkins ' desk . " We found this letter , addressed to you , among Peter 's effects , " he said . " I 'd have brought it sooner , but I was named the executor of Peter 's estate , and there were some matters to attend to . " " Thank you , Mr. Bouchard . But you could have sent it , you know . " Mr. Hawkins touched the envelope , gently . " Yes . But I wanted to talk to you about Peter 's book , " said Henri , after a slight pause . " I understand it is to be released next week ? " Mr. Hawkins nodded . He watched Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri . He smiled indulgently . " He has a lot of excellent informationthere , from sound  --  sources . But he writes melodramatically . " Mr. Hawkins ' eyes became reserved and withdrawn . " There 's a fal-P229for formal dinner parties . " Her gestures and voice were lifeless , and too quiet . " How about a week from Saturday night ? " " Nearly two weeks ! And in the meantime , of course , we 'll continue to stagnate . I ca n't write , I tell you . I 'm dead inside . I do n't want your consolations and your inspiration , Celeste . Not today , thank you . " His look and manner were frenetic , and she saw , with alarm , that he was frantically afraid of something . " Ca n't you make the dinner sooner ? " " I 'll try . " Her anxiety increased namelessly . She wondered whether she ought to call Peter 's physician . If she did , he must not know , in his present state . " I suppose it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would appreciate a dinner invitation within the next night or two , or perhaps for tonight ? " She had never heard him direct such crude sarcasm to her before , and her fear quickened . " Tor one thing , you know , Peter , I 'm supposed to be in mourning . And Armand and Christopher , too , and other members of the family . Never mind , we can have quiet dinners . Would you like to go out for a drive this morning ? " He agreed , with sullen eagerness . Celeste sighed . A car was brought and she and Peter were driven about the hot brown countryside . The wind was a breath from the infernal regions . They passed wilted fields , corn standing brilliantly in the glaring sunlight , meadows where cattle drowsed . Though Peter was quite still , staring through windows rapidlybecoming coated with dust , she felt his aching excitement and wretched exhaustion . But , later , that afternoon , he could not rest in his shaded room . He was about to rise from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of the room were drawn , arrows and slivers of golden fire darted through the slats of the Venetian blinds . Yet , even in that hot gloom he could feel a tense strangeness about her , a rigidity . " Are you awake , dear ? " she asked . " Annette and Henri have dropped in , to invite us personally for dinner tomorrow night . Shall I tell them you are too tired to see them just now ? " " No ! " he cried , with alarming violence . " For God 's sake , Celeste ! I 'll be dressed and down in a minute or two . " He got up , and forgot the peculiarity of Celeste 's appearance and manner . She left the room in silence . But he found himself unusually weak when he descended the empty stairway to the rooms below . He was forced to pause halfway down . The great white and gray and silver hall below was like a hot vacuum to his swimming eyes , and the unshaded sunlight that filled it stung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he felt himself reeling . It took all his will power to retain his consciousness . He felt an acute nausea at the very sight of the bleak glassy splendor about him . When he entered the large living-room , the nausea was strong upon him , and he hated every inanimate object that met his eye . Here , too , all was white and gray and pastel hues and chromium and polished silver , from the pale rug to the blinding pallor of the walls , from the round glass tables to the faint blue divans and dim coral chairs and frameless motionless mirrors . How could he and Celeste ever have endured these weeks within this appalling house ? Not even a flower stood in the twisted glass and silver monstrosities that perched on the tables . He looked away from it all to Annette and Henri waiting for him . He hardly saw Celeste at a distance , sitting on a small blue chair , her hands in her lap . For a few minutes he had heard no voices . But when he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unshakable as ever . " Hello , " he said . " We thought we 'd come unannounced , so you could n't hide from us . How are you ? You look much better . " His voice was genial and friendly , his pale eye thoughtful and penetrating . He shook hands with Peter , who , relieved of the horror of the house by a human presence , was returning his smile with astonishing pleasure . He found it delightful to see even Henri , in spite of what he knew , in spite of the years of violent hatred and enmity between them . He was like a man who has lived for a long time on a desert where the silence has been unbroken except for the cry of a predatory bird and the rush of wind , and then , at last , hears a human voice , and is overcome with joy , even though that voice was once revolting to him . He turned to Annette , and took her soft little hand . They regarded each other with intense fondness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dear gentle little creature , he thought , so ingenuous and kind and understanding . Her thin blue dress made her small triangular face almost vivid , and reflected itself in her eyes . The bright fine tendrils of hair curled up about a round white hat like a skull-cap . Her air was at once defenseless yet strong , sweet yet firm , intelligent yet innocent . She pressed his hand , answered gently his inquiries about her health , and asked about his own . " Oh , I am doing splendidly , " he replied , with unusual buoyancy ,  |p231almost  feverish in its animation . " Celeste can tell you that my cough has practically gone . Work seems to agree with me . " Henri smiled to himself . Out of the corner of his eye he glanced at Celeste . But she sat in some petrified and abstracted dream , staring before her , her lips very pale and carved in her drawn face . She seemed to hear nothing . " We 're so interested in your new lovely house on Placid Heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat down near her . " Have you been out there lately , to see how the work is coming on ? " No , Peter said , with some reserve . He had been so busy , and had n't felt like it . He understood that Celeste had gone frequently , however . At this , Celeste stirred , lifted her head sluggishly , and turned her face towards him as if she had only half heard . She said : " I was out there a week ago . We expect it to be ready for us by Christmas . " Annette was all shining enthusiasm . She glanced archly at her husband , and exclaimed : " You 'll think us prying , or curious , of course , but Henri and I have often gone out , and Henri was quite stern with the workmen and the architect . There was something about copper gutters . " " You have to watch these people , " remarked Henri , with bored ease . " It 's a good design , Peter . Simple , effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house-warming . " " The view is delicious , " remarked Annette , moving to the edge of her chair animatedly . " The hills all about , and then the valley and the rolling countryside . It will be marvellous in the autumn . I envy you . Not that I do n't love Robin 's Nest , of course , " and she gave Henri a look of touching adoration . " But new houses always excite me . " Celeste rang for tea , then subsided into her profound dull silence . She literally seemed unable to move without a terrible effort . A lock of her bright black hair fell over her petrified white forehead , and another ringlet lay against her colorless cheek . Her shoulders were bent , her whole body had the appearance of heavy collapse . Henri and Peter talked pleasantly , but Henri was aware most acutely of Celeste . He saw her flaccid white hands in her lap , the fallen curve of her thigh and calf , the sunken line of her breasts . She seemed ill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he could have touched her , and he knew that she was as aware of him as he was of her , and that she dared not look at him directly . Annette turned to her young aunt , and exclaimed : " Darling , you look so tired ! You know , I 'm really provoked with you , refusing my persistentinvitations . And so , we 've come to insist upon you and Peterp232having dinner with us tomorrow night . Or tonight would be better . " Peter looked from his wife to Annette , and smiled unpleasantly . " Celeste thinks I 'm a monk , I 'm afraid . I only found out today that the reason we have been so apparently ostracized is because she has barred the doors and pulled in the shutters . But , I suppose it 's my fault , too . I must have given her the impression that I was a Trappist at heart . " " I see , " said Annette , softly . She gazed at Celeste 's motionless profile with the strangest expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled brightly a moment afterwards , and sighed . " You do n't know how happy this makes me to know that you two are coming out of your retirement . I was going to be very disagreeable today , if you had refused our invitation . Tonight , dear ? Or tomorrow ? " Celeste said listlessly : " Tomorrow , if Peter prefers it . " " Yes , tomorrow , " he answered , quickly . That horrible weakness was assailing him again , however sternly he fought it . He could not have brought himself to leave the house tonight . He drew a deep breath . " It will be good to get out of this place ! Not that we are n't grateful to Christopher and Edith , of course . But it 's an appalling house , is n't it ? " For the first time , Celeste appeared fully aware of the conversation . There was even a dim flush on her cheeks now , and her eye flashed with sudden blue fire as she regarded her husband . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and now her voice thrilled with its old resolution . " I never liked Endur , but it was once my home , and Christopher was very thoughtful . " She thought : He is not himself . He does n't know what he is saying . He is frightened and distraught . " Of course , darling , " Peter replied , with feverish contrition . " I 'm sorry . But I ca n't help it if it depresses me . It reminds me too much of your brother . " The tea was brought in now , and Celeste , without the slightest quiver of her hands , filled the delicate cups with topaz fluid . Her thin black dress made her white throat and arms gleam like polished marble . She gave a cup to Annette , and one to Henri , who accepted it with a casual smile and an inclination of his head . She did not look at him . She said : " Peter , ought n't you to have your eggnog instead of tea ? " " 0 God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would n't you prefer it if I asked for a bottle and rubber nipple , Celeste ? " She studied him a moment or two , and her fearful alarm made her heart heat fast . She momentarily forgot Annette and Henri . Henri was laughing with a sound that was not pleasant , and Annette appearedp233embarrassed . But Celeste was seeing only the hectic pallor of Peter 's face , his too brilliant eyes , his dry hot lips . All at once he began to cough violently , and Celeste winced visibly . After a moment or two , she filled a cup for him and gave it to him , as if nothing had happened and she had not heard his remark . Her air of haggard dignity and calm pride hurt Annette 's gentle heart , and her eyes filled involuntarily with tears . She remarked brightly , to Peter : " How is the book coming along ? " The old hauteur and uneasiness of Peter 's appeared again at any mention of his work . He hesitated , shot a furtive glance at Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid , Annette . I 'm getting dry and dull and uninspired . Perhaps I 've been too close to it . " " Or rather , " said Henri , blandly , " perhaps you do n't know enough about your subject matter . " " Henri does n't mean to be rude , " murmured Annette , in distress . But Peter ignored her . He regarded Henri with his old cold aversion and dislike . " No , the trouble is that I know too much , have too much material . I ca n't seem to organize it . I 'd like to put everything in . It 's so enormous , so grim and portentous . I would really have to write a documented library to do it justice . When I see how impossible it is to do more than suggest , condense , telescope together , I feel pretty desperate . It reads like a nightmare , and the innocent and uninitiated would hardly believe it . " Now his look at Henri was harsh and somber , and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , we are n't as bad as all that . In fact , if you wrote the history of any industry or enterprise in America , whether it was dry goods or butchering or steel-making or brewing , it could be so presented , so high-lighted , so exaggerated and colored , that it would sound like the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves . For , you see , the human element is there , inescapably , and whatever the human element touches is likely to have a bad odor or some skulduggery . The end result , however , is usually quite harmless , and in the meantime quite a number of people innocently and happily prosper . " " I presume , " said Peter , in a shaking voice , all his feverish color gone so that his face was once again translucent and full of gray shadows , " that the number of people ' who have profited from your companies and subsidiaries have been only the Bouchards ? What of the rest of the world ? What of the world which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will innocently and happily prosper ' in the kind of civilization you are creating for it now ? "  | Henri laughed lightly . His pale eye shone on Peter indulgently . " Frankly , I do n't know . I have my business to attend to , and that takes too much time for me to have any odd minutes for philosophizing . " But , I can say this to you now : You can not honestly declare to a people , Look , here is your oppressor ; you are the victim . ' The victim , by the way , creates the oppressor . Nothing is apart from the rest of the world . The world as we know it now , and have known it in the past , is the visible result of total human nature , its work and its will . For instance , the German people invented Hitler . He was their desire made flesh , to paraphrase the Bible . So , if certain bad ' men have gained control of America , which I deny , it is because Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mindless , to prevent it , and so they have tacitly allowed it . They do not exist apart from their exploiters , ' nor do their exploiters ' exist apart from them . " Peter forgot everything now but his burning passion , his loathing and hatred and rage against this man . " You make it sound very simple , " he said , his voice now trembling so much that he could hardly control it . " But it is n't simple . Granted that the stupidity and sloth of the people make tyrants possible . That does not make the tyranny virtuous , or inevitable . Criminals take advantage of the trust of the helpless , or of the defenseless . That is your crime . " Henri was silent . But he still smiled . He looked at Annette , who had turned quite pale in her distress , and was twining her fingers together . He looked at Celeste . But she was staring at Peter , with a white still face , and was listening intently . Henri frowned thoughtfully , and tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Peter , in a quieter tone now , " I agree with you about one thing : that nothing exists apart from anything else , and that one must remember the human element . But there is an element , perhaps , that you do n't know anything about , Henri , and that element is the deeply buried desire of every man to believe that he and his work are important . The desire may be conscious or subconscious , but it is there , demanding that he believe that he , and his efforts , are necessary to his fellowmen and their welfare . You may think that very silly . I think it is the only noble thing in man . When that belief is killed in a man , and modern industryis fast killing it , by its monotony , its automatism and deadly mechanical pattern , then a man loses his will to live , which is always very precarious even in the strongest of us . " The men of power have either not known of the piteous human desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve it by work andp235voluntary effort , or they have not cared about it . It is nothing to them that this desire has the profoundest promise of good for the world , a promise of universal harmony and greatness and kindness , and that it has the power to cure much of the sickness and ruin of mankind . " He paused , and said in a lower tone : " Perhaps you are right in another thing . A long time ago you told me that war is one of the strongest instincts in man . I am beginning to believe it is . For war is the expression of the will-to-die of whole masses of people . The problem is to make life so adventurous , so vital , meaningful and important to every man that he will not , in his desire for death , resort to mass-suicide . " " And how do you propose to do that ? " asked Henri , with the same bland and infuriating look , as if he were talking to some raving fool . Peter hesitated , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I said before , by letting men believe , again , that they are important to the world . Religion has a strong hold on man only in direct ratio to the amount of importance it confers on him . You wish me to be practical , I see . Can you show me how modern industry allows a man , for a single moment , to believe he is of importance and that he , and he alone , gives some peculiar touch to his work that no other could ? Our machines have removed the personal joy from handicraft , from individualworkmanship , from creation . What joy is there in making castings or strips of metal identically the same , at an identical machine , by an identical human robot ? When modern industry removed the personalelement from its giant shops and plants and factories , it began to destroy man 's will-to-live , which is based on his individual sense of importance . And so , it laid the groundwork for devastating wars . I believe that is why fascism inevitably leads to war . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added : " War , in the end , is delightful to people , because war is now the only thing which allows a man to believe he is individually important , and that something depends on him , personally . " His thin and exhausted face was suddenly illuminated by passion , by pity and sorrow . " It is a terrible thing , " he said , in a still lower tone , as if to himself . Now , he looked only at Celeste . She was smiling at him , and her eyes were dilated and shining . Henri stared at each of them , slowly , in turn . " You are putting all that in your book , too ? " he asked . Peter became aware of him , after that long exchange with his wife , and he frowned a little . " There is so much , " he said . " Yes , I am trying to tell it . The whole thing is so  --  enormous . "  | He was listless again , exhausted , the brief and burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Annette spoke now , and her voice was trembling , her hands twisting in her lap : " 0 Peter ! I wish there were something I could say now , that would let you know how you 've stirred me . I never have the proper words for anything . But I know you are right . " Her lashes were wet , her lips tremulous . " It ought to be interesting at any rate , " said Henri , with that superior and pleasant condescension which is so enraging to any author , and which puts him nicely in his place . " You can count on me for a copy . Ingham 's are to publish it ? " " Yes , " said Peter , curtly . He drank his tea with abstraction ; it was cold and nauseating to him . His despair was a bleakness and windlessnessin him . How impotent he was ! How clearly Henri had shown him his impotence , in the face of his own great power and physical strength and compactness . During his abstraction , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have amazed him to know how important he now was in Henri 's thoughts , and that the other man was engaged in rapid reflection . " Look here , " said Henri , with abruptness . " You say you have too much material . Are you aware , for instance , with your damned documentedproof , that a certain group of men in Washington , and other places , are determined to overthrow the Government and install fascism in its place ? With the actual help of Hitler ? " Peter looked up with such a start he almost dropped his cup . He could not believe what he had heard . Henri was nodding , with a grim smile . " I assure you it 's true . And I 'm not one of them , I promise you . That surprises you , does n't it ? I imagine you 've had your suspicions . How would you like verification ? " Peter was astounded . His glazed eyes looked instinctively at Celeste . But she was gazing at Henri with a rigid expression of shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , " said Henri , regarding only Peter , " that you have given some vague intimations in your manuscript . But vague intimations can always be attacked and disproved . Facts ca n't . " But Peter was without the power to speak . Henri leaned back in his chair comfortably , and raised his eyebrows with a quizzical expression . But his eyes were fixed with unusual intentnessupon Peter.  | " I mean , it is an actual plot , which has only recently come to my attention . I 'll be frank with you . I 've wanted America to keep out of the coming war because war will destroy the status quo , and I 'm rather attached to the status quo . I do n't give a damn what Hitler does in Europe . But I want to keep him out of America . Unfortunately , there are some men , and it would surprise you who they are , who want Hitler here , or at least , want his influence here . They 're working for it . A gentleman very close to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his efficiency . Put the damned mob back in its place . I say : Bring him over ! ' You may think that very brash and crude . But it is n't . They 've drawn up the actual plans . " Peter pulled himself out of his paralyzed lethargy of amazement , and stammered : " Why do you tell me this ? Now ? You ? " Henri shrugged . " Because , " he answered , blandly , " I do n't want Hitlerhere . I 'm very well satisfied with things as they are . I 'm not too interested in what Hitler does in Europe , but I 'm determined he sha n't do it with any of our materiel  --  if I can help it . I 'm not sure I can help it . I 'm working towards that , of course . I have coerced , " and he smiled a little , " or better , persuaded , some others to join me , for I am sure that I have no desire to be any Thyssen to Hitler . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline . " He paused , wondering if he was being indiscreet , stupid and naive . " I may succeed . As it looks now , I might not . You can imagine the rest . " Peter suddenly got to his feet , and in a deep silence , he walked up and down the room with shaken steps . He kept putting his hands to his face , and then dropping them with a quick gasp . The two women were frozen in their chairs , Celeste watching Peter , Annette watching Henri . Annette 's cheeks were bright red , her eyes too bright . Then Peter stopped before Henri . His lips moved with an effort . " Somehow , I believe you . I do n't know why . I understand , though , why you 've told me . It 's not  --  not patriotism , or decency . You want to protect yourself . That does n't matter . What can I do ? " Henri was very grave and serious now . He leaned towards Peter . " Your book will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is published a year or more from now ? It wo n't do much good . The damage will already have been done , probably irreparable damage . " However , I have just had an idea . Suppose you write for the radio . You ca n't , of course , deliver any such addresses , yourself , for reasons which are very obvious . But , I can have such addresses , warning the people , delivered by two or three competent commentators . I have such commentators in mind . Two have recently been removed from the air for lack of sponsors : I happen to know why they have n't any sponsors now . I think you can guess that , too . They do n't need sponsors . I will pay for the broadcasts . None of the chains will dare to keep these men off the air when I give the word . They 'll have plenty of facts , too , which I will give you . Remember , there 's an election coming up next year , " and the grimness of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care if Roosevelt or any other man equally of his opinion is elected . I am thinking of a man who was mentioned to me lately , by a certain old gentleman . He may not be nominated . If he is n't , and the Republican Party puts up some dolt , some ventriloquist dummy , then , we must have Roosevelt . That surprises you , does n't it ? But I tell you now that not even the greatest of the New Deal 's asininities are important any longer . The only important thing is the preventing of these schemes of which I 've just told you . Everything else can wait . " He continued , when Peter again could not speak : " Go on with your book . But these addresses on the radio are more necessary , more immediate . What do you say ? " Peter 's eyes were blazing in his gaunt and sunken face . He was alive again , burning and passionate . He almost cried aloud , exultantly . After a little , he said : " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll do it ! You have only to give me the facts , a lead now and then ! " He could hardly breathe with his newly awakened sense of potency . All his senses were awake , crying out . But Henri was quite calm , his smile smooth as ever . He rose . " Good . You 'll be discreet enough , of course , not to give the slightest hint where you get your information . That would be disastrous . I must work behind the scenes . I must find out all the plotters , and do what I can , myself , to stop them in their tracks . In the meantime , you might arouse quite a portion of the people to their peril . Study the commentators who are subsidized by the American Association of Industrialists , one of our own organizations . Wright Benson is the ablest . You can get many leads from his propaganda , which is very adequate , to say the least . You 'll see the fine Italian hand behind what he says . Study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have your work cut out for you , and it is n't going to be easy . " Peter pressed his hands to his throbbing temples . Celeste stood beside him now , seeing only him . He turned to her and read the wordless anxiety in her eyes . " My God , darling ! " he cried . " Nothing matters
