In St. Louis last week the rambling Municipal Auditorium bustled with doctors who do a good deal of worrying and considerable arguing about their professional status . Supporting their claim to cover every branch of medicine and surgery , the 2,000 visitors at the annual convention of the American Osteopathic Association heard papers and discussions on neuropsychiatry , gynecology , proctology , techniques in brain surgery . But stamping them as " sectarian , " within the definition of the American Medical Association , was their obsession with the memory and dogma of osteopathy 's founder , Dr. Andrew Taylor Still , whose life and work were endlessly eulogized . <P> Built-in Drugstore . Virginia-born Dr. Still was a lanky ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , bearded frontiersman who studied the art of healing with his father , a medical missionary among the Shawnee Indians . In 1864 , Still lost three children in an epidemic of spinal meningitis . The shock crystallized his dissatisfaction with current medical methods . After ten years of horse-and-saddlebag practice in Missouri , Still proclaimed his faith : <P> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body drugs in abundance to cure all infirmities . . . that all the remedies necessary to health are compounded within the human body . " <P> Still had stumbled upon a crude version of the modern concept of antibodies . The body 's own drugs , he thought , were concentrated in the blood ; therefore , a full supply of blood to the whole system was necessary to health . Dr. Still preached that manipulation of the spine , muscles and joints , to preserve a normal blood flow , could prevent or cure practically any ailment . <P> The emphasis on manipulation exposed osteopathy* to ridicule . Medical history was full of quack bonesetters , and Still 's disciples were lumped with them . Orthodox doctors agitated for state laws to curb the osteopaths . Chiropractors , with less formal education , came along and won a name as spine manipulators , and thus helped bring osteopathy into disrepute by association .. Finally , orthodox M.D s had developed a bone science of their own called it orthopedics , and left the osteopaths high &; dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
