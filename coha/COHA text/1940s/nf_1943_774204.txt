txt  | to prevent the advance , they are a more serious handicap than statements which are simply and demonstrably false ; yet they occur in the nature of things , and are not immune to reason in the long run . But the Marxist terminology reduces verbal expression to literal nonsense on the basis of fact and usage ; this is not obvious gibberish , nor the humorous nonsense which will sometimes elucidate an intrinsic difficulty of expression or indicate a gap in knowledge , but arrangements of words according to the rules of grammar , in which each word taken separately has a customary meaning , but which in the given sequence , the sentence , mean nothing at all . For example , let it be said that : " An isosceles triangle is green . " The several words are in common use , and as parts of speech they are placed in proper order ; but the whole statement is absurd . That is bad enough , but it would be rather worse if one spoke of the " roundness of a triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the " roundness of a triangle , " a contradiction in terms . It has no meaning . The theory of " dialectical materialism " is a misuse of terms of the same type as the statement that an isosceles triangle is green . It posits an inevitable succession of a thesis producing its opposite or antithesis and the fissiparous abstraction reuniting into a synthesis . As nothing in nature does go through any such transmogrification , endless and senseless debate may be carried on by which social relations are said to exhibit in various phases a thesis , antithesis , and synthesis , each credited with " producing " its " opposite " and merging again into something else , like the Squidgicum Squee that swallers itself . Fools might argue solemnly that an isosceles triangle is not green but blue , or that a green isosceles triangle will produce a blue circle and the two will then synthesize into a purple cow or rhomboid ; still these statements are empty . This is specifically the language of fools ; for the deficiency which is indicated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the relation of things and qualities . Marx was a fool with a large vocabulary of long words . Yet he did have an unacknowledged need to adopt the nonsensical " dialectic " of Hegel . A parasitical pedant , shiftless and dishonest , he wanted to put in a claim on " society " solely as a consumer . He embraced Communism because no other theory can be stretched even on paper into promising " to each according to his needs . " Only a presumed " common stock " into which all production is expropriated can be imagined as available for the nonproducer to grab what he wants from it , although this is pure imagination , the dream of the incompetent and vicious or of the child mind unschooled in production . On the other hand , Marx was confronted by the historic fact that in Communism as a general order production never rises above a bare subsistence level . How was he then to even imagine abundant production into Communism ? He could only assume that the " means of production " brought to a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capitalism , could be expropriated and kept going by a successor regime of Communism . True , no such thing had ever happened ; the nearest approach to Communism as the social norm was always very primitive ; but if he first imagined " dialectical materialism , " and then arbitrarily called capitalism the thesis ; and then designated the unpropertied as the proletarian antithesis , he might further assert that the two would " merge " by conflict and produce a " synthesis " which would have to be Communism if he said so . Since it had never happened , he could say that it was inevitably going to happen . He could also , quite as easily , while he was about it , call the capitalist society of contract the class system although it positively was not . Marx 's theory of class war is utter nonsense by its own definition ; it has no reference to either class or war , if it relates to " capital " and " labor . " It is physically im-  | possible for " labor " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital is property ; labor is men . All that can occur is sporadic rioting and possibly destruction of property , for the very weapons of war in an industrial society can be produced and maintained only by " capital " and " labor " in combination . In a true class society , classes are the several layers of a stratified order ; class is nothing but horizontal relative position . Therefore one class can not displace another , nor abolish it by action as a class . When and if classes exist , the persons occupying a given relative position belong to the denominated class . Conceivably the particles might be transposed , but the classes would remain as before ? whatever is at the top is at the top , and whatever is below is below . Though invaders might depose the members of an indigenous upper class and occupy the position , neither would this alter the system ; and such invasion is not a class war . But since the class system is imposed on the creative energy to check its flow , it is inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleavage between the upper and lower strata , by which they break into violent opposition ; this is a genuine class war , and frequently occurred . Nevertheless , as such , a class war can effect no change , and has never done so . Even the transposition of persons as particles from one class to another rarely occurred by violent means . The repeated revolts or jacqueries in feudal society were abortive by their nature ? being true class conflicts . It has been implied ? by the statement that gunpowder abolished the Middle Ages ? that the peasant was defenseless against the knight . On the contrary , the knight was hopelessly vulnerable to the peasant . A man in armor relying for mobility on a horse in armor could be put out of action , the horse hamstrung , the rider brought down , by one or two quick-footed men with scythes and pitch-  | forks . The knight could scarcely mount unaided ; on the ground he was clumsy ; if he fell , he could not spring up nimbly . A human tortoise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no less dependent economically . His armor had to be forged by the smith , his food and clothes supplied and his horse maintained by the labor of the peasant . The knight knew no useful art , and was wholly an end-product of a rigid system . If the system were interrupted for more than a very short time , the knight must perish anyhow. * And in many instances the jacqueries gained an immediate victory by violence . Over considerable localities the peasants slaughtered their lords and took their castles , which they looted and wrecked . Yet they could get no further , and were presently subdued again ; nothing could come of it except more severe repression . The majority of the peasants would have no inducement to raise a few of their number to the rank of seigneurs , while all could not attain to it because the order of chivalry necessitated peasants to support it . Acting as a class , the peasants could have no other than the class principle upon which to re-institute society . Hence the jacqueries were bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rebellion . When the society of contract began to emerge again and dissolve the class system , members of all classes and groups fought on both sides , individuals taking part for or against the order . In the French Revolution , the most stubborn defense of the old regime was made in rural Brittany , by the peasants of the Vendee , under a peasant Footnote  | commander . Their stand was unavailing because the weapons of a class society belong to a lower mode of conversion of energy than the weapons of a society of contract . This was the significance of gunpowder ; it is the product of a free economy , which does not debar inquiry and invention . It is an instrument or effect , not a cause . The invention of productive machinery and its continued use is possible only in a free economy , being consonant with its axioms in relation to energy . The equivalent of the feudal order in the set-up of a machine would be to load the motor with dead-weight so that it could not operate until some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brake so that it should be applied whenever the motor started , or rather , immediately before the start . Probably the popular notion today of the medieval economy is that under it the common people were compelled to work very hard . They were certainly subject to forced labor , and their work was performed by slow , exhausting , and unproductive methods ; but the real hardship was that they were not allowed to work otherwise . Working could be punished as a crime . For example , it was illegal to make , own , or use a handmill at home . ( Essentially the same type of penalty has lately been reintroduced with the farm quota tax and the processing tax . ) Even the medieval ox-yoke was so ill-designed that when the animal pulled it was somewhat choked . So it was with men ; competence and thrift were penalized . The one who tilled the land could never hope to own it ; improvements reverted to the seigneur and would be more than likely to ensue additional dues . Further , on the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chattels , as heriot , always taking the best , no matter how little remained for the widow and children . ( The re-introduction of death duties , estate taxes , is a reversion to the medieval heriot . At first falling only on large estates , it is rapidly reaching down to the least scrap of inheritance . Heriot was recognized as the mark of the serf. )  | In feudal society , when men spoke of rights or liberties , they claimed them as by charter or usage , in either case referring back to a permissive grant in the past , which they must show they had not forfeited by failure to render dues or service . The principle was that a man must pay for license to work or leave to walk about . Finally , restriction of trade limited available materials ; people had n't much to work with . When the productive element at length regained a measure of natural freedom , they indulged in something like an orgy of work , satisfying a theretofore thwarted craving . Free men drove themselves harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produced three times as much even with manual labor , simultaneously devising productive machinery . This unparalleled outburst of energy was beneficial by the increase of goods and of knowledge . But it got under way in Europe while part of the aristocratic structure remained in land tenure . Goods and labor were in the free market , the society of contract ; a great deal of the land was not , being entailed and under long lease for ground rents . The landless laborer had nothing to stand on , and was caught , so to speak , between a motor car and a stone wall , or thrown against a rock by a rushing stream . The wage laborer has never gained a solid footing in Europe . The " mixed economy " invariably includes the onerous features of both status and contract , worsened by combination . In the field of industry , during the early industrial era , the exceptionally shrewd , tough , and capable individuals set the pace for the less able and weaker ones . An employer who got his start by driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The margin of compensation was presumed to lie in the chances of the future ? but the work was done in the present , and the employer could give no guarantees for the future . ) Moreover , the hours of employment were a holdover from the medieval and rural economy , in which men worked  | from dawn till dark ; but the medieval pace was comparatively slow , with slack seasons and as many holidays as the tenants and serfs could win through the church . The free economy quickened the pace , cut down holidays , and kept the long working day , even extending it by artificial light . Yet both the speed-up and low wages were still partly exacted by pressure from the aristocracy , the remains of status . In the full feudal society the seigneurs had to raise and subsist the fighting forces and meet other political costs locally ; and the king was supposed to live at his own expense , from his landed property . In the transition period the army and civil list became a national charge , supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative offices but drew on industry for ground rents without releasing land to the market for improvement by competitive building . Lord Shaftesbury , the celebrated reformer , admitted privately that he accused the manufacturers though he knew the blame rested equally on the land-owners , because he needed a party to pass his laws . What he did not realize was that he also was acting as an aristocrat , for the " reform " laws he framed , however well-meant , were status law in a new guise . The gentry also abused their position by grabbing and enclosing the common lands , which had given villagers a modicum of independence , a physical base . In general , while sneering at the profit motive of industry , the gentry never let a penny get by them , whether it came from a slum tenement or a shepherd 's hut or even a soldier 's food allowance . Thus the upper class absorbed most of the material benefit of the emerging contract society , and was at the same time relieved of its main duties . The only good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was open ; and America existed . ( If America had not existed , it is impossible to know whether or not the door would have been forced open . ) The free working-  | man could change his employment , his residence , even his country , if he had courage for the venture . Yet this possibility was enough , a sufficient number of persons availing themselves of it , in the course of a century , to raise the level of wages and opportunity , of cleanliness and comfort and convenience , to a standard which would have seemed fabulous to the medieval seigneur . Working hours were likewise shortened ; the drive was transferred to machinery ; freedom yielded its fruits . Now , with the contemporary decrease of liberty , hours are already lengthening even in America ; production is lessening ; and the speed-up is being re-imposed on men-instead of machines . The deadlock of class can be broken either by reverting through barbarism ( leadership ) to savagery , or by advancing to the political organization appropriate to the society of contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure had been erected to accommodate the mechanism , including the type of control which is used in motor mechanics by the various applications known as safety devices , whether brakes , governors , or stabilizers . The essential feature of such appliances is that they do not and can not take effect until the actual need arises . They are set to operate only if the motor and transmission go wrong . A railway airbrake locks the wheels if the coupling gives way ; a safety valve opens at the danger point of steam pressure ; a fuse blows out with an overload of current , saving the wires ; a gyroscope is neutral while the plane is in balance . What must be borne in mind is that these are not preventive controls , but corrective ; they are not primary but secondary . Contract law is the same type of mechanism in the political organization . The legal restriction does not occur until after individuals have made a voluntary contract and one of the parties fails to carry out its terms . Contract law has no primary authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it can take  | cognizance only of the point at issue , which is determined by the previous agreement of individuals . It is indisputably nothing but an agency , initiative being vested in the individual . It is the only method of organization which leaves the creative faculty and corollary productive processes their inherent and necessary freedom . The political instrument must be of a secondary character . But any type of organization predicates a permanent base . It must have fixed locality for its structure . This is true even of mechanisms expressly designed for mobility ; an airplane requires a base no less than an old-fashioned grist-mill . The landing-field is the base of the plane ; but in a larger view , the plane is part of the transmission line of a very long-circuit energy system which rests on the base of private property as an institution . It has to be individual private property ; neither group property nor state communism can generate such a high potential of energy . The collectivist nations of today are operating airplanes on energy taken off at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent past . The problem of structure for a political organization delayed the founding of a full Society of Contract for thousands of years . The first political structure men were able to find or devise was that of an aristocracy . Though it must have begun as an extension of the family ( unwarranted in nature ) , it was later supposed to be validated by a concept or theory which had even less relation to fact . The noble came to be regarded , or regarded himself , as of a superior species , elevated to his position by a semi-mystical , semi-physical difference from the peasant or commoner , a difference of " blood " confirmed by divine ordinance . Biology can discover no evidence to bear out this theory ; for though a noble family may have been founded by some person of exceptional talent , it does not breed true ; the descendants revert to the average . Furthermore , the line was frequently  | broken , and the blood mixed with that of recruits from the presumedly inferior lower ranks . Finally , aristocracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favor . It is impossible to define in rational terms just what the aristocratic quality was thought to be . That epitome of the order , the Duke de Saint-Simon , who " believed " in it fanatically , described many of his fellow nobles as scoundrels , imbeciles , lunatics , cowards , liars , toadies , pimps , wastrels , and profligates , deformed , diseased , ugly , feeble , disloyal , and otherwise useless or detrimental ; yet his faith remained unshaken . And there was a fact beneath the fantasy . Though it was obsolete in France when observed by Saint-Simon , and so doubly corrupted , aristocracy in its time had a practical use . It delimited the fixed bases for a political structure , by local sovereignty of territorial subdivisions . The original titles , privileges , and offices of the great nobles were attached to particular areas of land and inseparable from them . It was not the class solidarity of an aristocracy which enabled it to serve as structure , but the separateness of the units , a system of decentralization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order is oppressive not merely by abuse but in principle . However romancers may prettify the picture in retrospect , the seigneur was not above extorting cash to permit a girl to get married or a boy to learn to read , or taking the bereaved widow 's one cow and best bed ; a regular perquisite of the lord of the manor was the manure from the livestock of the tenantry . The aristocracy blocked out light and air . It was bound to evoke hatred , the emotional expression of frustrated energy . The mechanism of government it used , status law , is that of the preventive clutch . Its social atmosphere is tinged with despair ; during the Dark Ages , when aristocracy prevailed , men had visions of death and hell and the end of the world , misery  | here and hereafter . But men tolerated it sullenly because they did not know what to put in its place . If they pulled down the pillars of the structure , the roof fell on them . They had to have some local form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered them to the barbarians . Complete stagnation was obviated by the flow of energy channeled through the modified contract society of the church , with some concurrent trade ; and it is no accident that commerce was carried on in the shelter of the cathedral . The church also preserved learning , since the written word is indispensable to a long-circuit energy system . So the forces of static and of kinetic energy effected an uneasy accommodation , though in constant peril from within and without .  | The Meaning of Magna Carta In the long run , England was to make the most successful adjustment in the Old World , but not without a continuous struggle and recurrent crises of violence , over five centuries . The first crucial effort of the English to set the foundations of an enduring structure is marked by Magna Carta , exacted from King John by his rebel subjects . The provisions of this great document are seldom mentioned today , excepting the sentence : " To none will we sell , to none will we deny , to none will we delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining abstractly the essential purpose for which government is instituted ; but given merely as a promise from the chief executive , the king , it was unlikely to be observed unless the whole organization was designed to work that way against the king 's will . Now even without the contemporary context , the practical features of the Charter still reveal what were the existing bases and the forces in motion . The static political structure was feudal . The larger towns , having obtained their " liberties , " contributed to the national treasury through various money taxes , direct or indirect , and levied somewhat irregularly , therefore liable to dispute . The church was in a dangerous intermediate position , being interlocked with feudalism by the system of land tenure on its immense properties , while in doctrine it asserted and protected the primary principle of contract by which trade was carried on . Necessarily also the long energy circuit of the church , its connection with Rome , was maintained  | in money , funds remitted to Rome ; this could not have been done any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived wholly from the feudal order , which contains its own checks and balances , automatically regulated by the limited energy circuit ; the surplus could only be delivered to the king in men-at-arms and their supplies . But in King John 's time a considerable share of the customary feudal service dues had been commuted into cash fees . These , added to the crown revenues from trade , gave the king a money income , over which the producers had no control . They could neither stop supplies at the source except by forcible resistance , nor exercise any legal check on the king 's expenditures after the money had been paid into his hands . Thus the king could raise and subsist an army composed of men detached from regional bases , fragments of dislocated mass , into which the kinetic energy of the nation was diverted to put them in motion . Here is the formula for wars apparently initiated by the will of a king , executive , or dictator ; the hook-up ensues the result , and can operate to no other end . King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as indicated by the clause of the Charter requiring him to " remove out of the kingdom all foreign knights , crossbowmen and stipendiary soldiers , who have come with horses and arms to the molestation of the kingdom . " In historical references , the gaining of the Charter is usually credited to " the Barons " ; but in fact the document was written or drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Stephen Langton ; and the names which lead all the rest in the preamble are those of the dignitaries of the Church , being the Archbishops of Canterbury and Dublin , seven bishops , the Master of the Templars , and the papal legate ; while the first clause exacts that " the English Church shall be free , " including " freedom of elections " to clerical offices . This was to prevent the king from making appointments to abbeys and benefices , through  | which he could siphon off the revenues of the church . Obviously he had been doing so . Next the interest of the feudal aristocracy was to be guarded against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on military fiefs at the traditional rate ; and leaving the assessment of cash fees and extraordinary " aids " to " the common council of the kingdom . " Similar dues or aids taken by the lords from " their own free men " were also limited . The general purpose was to prevent the gradual expropriation of small holders by the lords of the manors , and of the lords by the king ; that is , to maintain the regional bases against the central authority , and the individual bases against the regional authorities . Since these constituted the static frame of the political organization , the problem had at least been correctly apprehended ; although it would not have been expressed in our terms . But taxation is not the only means by which kinetic energy may break down static structure . As no method of maintaining regional bases was thought possible other than by hereditary succession to land , one clause of the Charter exempted land from passing by title through foreclosure of mortgage . Land could be pledged as security for a loan ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of the debt . Further , if the debtor died and the heir was a minor , interest on the mortgage ceased during his minority . Feudal dues , dower rights , and provision for children of the deceased debtor , also took precedence of payment on a money debt , which could be liquidated only " out of the residue . " Probably this limitation of debt had a double effect , partly contrary to its intent , especially with the short life expectancy of those days ; it would tend to keep down the principal of loans , and equally to raise the interest rate . The high usury of the period should be understood in this context . Then a curious clause indicates the centripetal effect of  | kinetic energy thrown into the political channel ; for the Charter contains a promise from the king that if any man died in debt " to the jews , " or money lenders , " and if that debt shall fall into our hands , we will not take anything except the chattel contained in the bond . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they could conveniently pay ; and that the money lenders , finding collections difficult , especially against the estates of minors , had been discounting their notes with the king , who could then use the royal prerogative to foreclose . The persecution and expulsion of the Jews from various European nations , and the lingering resentment in anti-Semitism , traces mainly to this unhappy combination of the power of the executive and the action of kinetic energy ( money ) undermining the static structure . As it was easy to focus popular anger on " the jews " as non-citizens , the king invariably and promptly turned against them when it was convenient to exculpate himself and loot their fortunes . But the process had no relation whatever to the nationality or race of the persons involved ; it occurred at other times in other countries when the financiers were of native stock , and the public fury was just as easily aroused against finance , or financiers as a group , for the same intrinsic reason . The true remedy for such an injurious condition is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national finances by the central executive . That is what the Charter was intended to do ; with a wisdom in advance of the age , it did not propose either penalization or expulsion of " the jews " or financiers , but restriction of the authority of the crown . Here it may be said that at any time when finance is under attack through the political authority , it is an infallible sign that the political authority is already exercising too much power over the economic life of the nation through manipulation of finance , whether by exorbitant taxation , uncontrolled  | expenditure , unlimited borrowing , or currency depreciation . The final and not least vital restriction of the executive authority ( the king ) is of peculiar significance , as showing that the industrial-commercial group must have been strongly influential in the framing of Magna Carta , though not named as parties to the formal act . For there was a third method by which the king could find a pretext for expropriation of his subjects of every degree ; that is , by exorbitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stipulated that fines might be " amerced " only in proportion to the offense ; with the still more vital exception of " saving " to the free man his " contenement " ( landholding ) ; to a merchant his merchandise ; and to the villein his wainage ( farm carts and other equipment ) . That is to say , no man could be stripped of his capital , and thus of his livelihood , - by a fine , for an alleged political offense . As a solid precaution , it was stated that the amount of such fines might not be fixed by the king nor even by the judges ; but must be assessed by a jury of the accused man 's peers , nobles for nobles and " honest men of the vicinage " for merchants , freemen , and villeins . Further , the interest of industry and commerce was safeguarded by a clause so far in advance of today 's usage that it gives one a shock of surprise . " All merchants shall have safety and security in coming into England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through England , by land as by water , to buy and sell , without any unjust exactions . " In time of war , foreign merchants of enemy nationality might be " apprehended without injury to their bodies and goods , " and must be held in safety if English merchants in enemy countries were " in safety there . " Finally , " it shall be lawful to any person , for the future , to go out of the kingdom and to return , safely and securely , unless it be in time of war , for some short space , " excepting only " prisoners and outlaws " and  | enemy nationals . The kinetic energy was allowed to make the long circuit ; and England was on the way to world power . On the whole , it is impossible to imagine a sounder grasp of statecraft than Magna Carta reveals , given the existing set-up and circumstances . It was rightly looked to for five centuries as a beacon and a landmark of English liberty . Its principles and some of its practical measures remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses and the interruptions of temporary tyranny . Yet since it did not actually terminate the civil war which brought it forth , nor prevent similar and protracted disorders subsequently , it must be instructive to discover in what feature it was defective . One may say that probably , given the circumstances , nothing better could have been devised ; for if it did not take full effect at the time , it laid down some indispensable axioms for future reference . The defect was the absence of the mass-inertia veto , as a national function , both in fact and in law . The enforcement of the Charter against the king was assigned to an elective committee of twenty-five barons , who " with the community of the whole land " were to seize the person , family , castles , and lands of the king , but without harming him ( the latter condition would naturally be rather difficult at any time and might be impossible ) . They were to detain him until he redressed grievances and then resume their allegiance ; another doubtful chance . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that in the strictly feudal order the serfs and other workers on the land constituted the factor of mass , and the function of mass was exerted passively , by inertia , through the inherent limitation which feudalism imposed on production , and which restricted the feudal military effort to the resources of local circuits . The check on the king was a secondary effect . In brief , as the barons were the " pillars of the state " resting on regional bases , their resistance should have  | been static to correspond with their relation to the crown . But this was impossible when the king had large revenues from the mercantile interest ; while active resistance from the nobles was simply civil war . ( For the same reason , the lack of legitimate control over supplies they provided , the merchants were driven to civil war against the king in the seventeenth century . ) Anyhow , one can think of no measure possible at the time the Great Charter was framed , by which the general factor of mass could have been found for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Unhappily , even the immediate emancipation of the serfs would not have supplied this deficiency of the mass-veto and ensured stability ; on the contrary , if they had merely been released from the land , the action would have thrown more men into the wage-army of the king , to smash the nation . The whole land title-system would have had to be altered , to provide individual holdings ; and such a thing can not be done overnight , and re-secured the next day firmly on a new apportionment . The procedure is impossible because it would have to be done by political edict , therefore even if it were nominally essayed , it would actually vest title in the political power and not in the individuals to whom the transfer was supposed to be made . That is , whatever power was assumed to be sufficient to take land from one person and give it to another could forever after take it back at will , and so would always have the real disposal of the land . Thus the serfs got next to nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fines . But the nobles , the merchants , and the yeomen got their positions on record , as validated by previous custom and law , and with the means to make a stand sufficiently secured , so that they could persist in opposition to the royal power until they did forge the necessary instrument of the mass-veto . That was to be the House of Commons , with its control over taxation and the periodic  | grant of supplies . In the course of that long struggle , serfdom was abolished , bought out piecemeal . Money , kinetic energy , washed it away . There was an unexpected deflection , a side-swirl of the current of energy , as an almost immediate result of the signing of the Charter . King John had been successively at odds with the nobles , the church , and the merchants , until they combined against him with the Charter . He then made a deal with the Pope , by which he was to be absolved from his signatory oath ; and in exchange , he vowed temporal allegiance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in the whole kingdom as a fief . But there was no law nor principle of law , canonical or civil , which could cover such a transaction . True that church dignitaries could be lords of the manor , either by their own holdings or in virtue of church lands ; and there were prince-bishops in Europe to whom temporal lords owed feudal allegiance . And the man who was king of England , if he were also lord of a manor in England , having no feudal superior , might conceivably have declared himself a vassal of the Pope . But this relationship would have been valid only in respect of the given manor or fief . The kingdom was no such matter ; it was composed of a large number of fiefs whose holders had each sworn allegiance to the king . Such an oath is not transferable by the recipient to another person . The nature of a Christian vow is that it must be voluntary ; and the person making it must be fully informed of what it covers and imports ; this follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feudal hierarchy it was so understood that a tenant 's allegiance to his lord went with the lord 's allegiance to the king ; but none of John 's subjects , noble or otherwise , had agreed nor understood that the king could make them subject to any further temporal superior . In short , John promised to hand over something which was nontransferable . The deal was tempting not in its nominal terms of feudalism , but because of the  | money revenue . The kinetic current was so strong it almost undercut the structure of the nation in toto , threatening to lift and move it to another situation , as a stream may move a house . Regrettably , the Pope agreed to the deal , and let down the courageous Archbishop Langton and all the other eminent clerics who had wrung the Charter from John . They had exercised the proper and historic function of the church in resistance to the state ; and the earthly head of the church repudiated their action . But neither king nor Pope could make it stick ; the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least arguable that the deferred consequence was the schism , three centuries later , of the English from the Catholic communion . Historic sequences always trace back to causes remote in time ; and such a betrayal is never forgotten . Materially and morally , it left the English church in a perilous position . In the continuing struggle of the king , the nobles , and the merchants , whichever party won temporarily , the church was bound to lose a little every time , having lost its prestige as the mediatory agency . Serfdom obtained on some of the church lands , hence it would seem oppressive to the peasants , and would no longer be identified with liberty . The king still had his money revenue to support his private army . The merchants had grown strong enough to fight for themselves , and thus represent the contract society . The size of the church landholdings really weakened the nobles , by withdrawing the occupants from feudal military service . But as wealth , the church lands and revenues were an obvious temptation to plunder ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again be quite sure he would not be sold out abroad . The kinetic energy flowing to the executive , the king , first destroyed feudalism , the power of the nobles over the king ; then it swung the king ( Henry VII ) into a working alliance with the merchants , identifying their interests ; then it was turned directly  | against the church as a landed institution , and broke up the great Abbey lands , to reconstitute a new aristocracy in conjunction with the new control agency which had been made workable in the House of Commons . Finally , the kinetic energy , under that control , was turned against the executive , the king , and it broke the royal prerogative . But in the process , too many people lost their footing on the land . Taught by adversity in the civil war of the seventeenth century ( which was a culmination of the process that reduced the too-heavy framework of the aristocracy by attrition in the Wars of the Roses , and all but destroyed it with the centralized tyranny of Henry VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as had been made by the aristocratic order in the Roman republic . The hereditary feature was retained in the upper house for the regional bases ; but the effective veto was in the Commons ; and the law was above the crown . In this last development , the secular government learned from the church how to fix a center , a problem which had been insoluble in the Roman empire. * The authority ( since defined as infallibility ) of the Pope existed finally only in ecumenical council and within a prescribed sphere ( of faith and morals ) . So in the English form of secular government as it evolved , the authority of the king existed only in conjunction with Parliament and within the scope of law . When Charles I failed to perceive this Footnote  | distinction , it was imparted to him with the edge of the axe . In mechanism , this is dead center , which is a necessity in a reciprocating action . The king does nothing ; that is what he is for , being the point at which the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set-up , for the aggregation of dominions , colonies , and dependencies of disparate types which formed the British empire , because it obviated political dealings between any two of them , or primary action from the center . Since they did not have to come to specific agreements , they had no occasion to disagree . At the beginning of the nineteenth century , the internal structure of England was essentially that of the Roman republic , with a modified aristocracy adjusted to an elective system ; and as the English-speaking colonies began with a large measure of local self-government , the army was not an active and direct political factor in the administrative mechanism . As with Rome , the world accepted the British empire because it opened world channels of energy for commerce in general . Though repressive ( status ) government was still imposed to a considerable degree on Ireland with very bad results , on the whole England 's invisible exports were law and free trade . Practically speaking , while England ruled the seas any man of any nation could go anywhere , taking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traditional structure adapted to accommodate a high energy potential is continually under severe stress . The condition of the landless laborer poses a problem which is still unsolved . He is a particle drawn into the energy circuit as iron filings will cohere in a magnetic current ; then whenever industry slackens , which is to say the current is weaker , many of the particles must drop off again . Unemployed workmen , aggregated only by inertia , thus become a fragment of dislocated mass within the economy . As such , they are thrown against the structure , and naturally feel  | it only as obstruction . It is equally natural , since they are sentient beings and not mere physical objects , that they should demand that the structure be abolished ; or at least , spokesmen will appear for them who will make that demand , as in the Chartist movement . A man pinned against a stone pier is not likely to consider whether or not the pier is necessary for any purpose , or what else could be put in its place . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . The greatest misfortune of the productive worker who has no base is that when he is dropped by the weakened current he falls into the same material category as the habitually non-productive . The added weight makes the non-productive group feel insecure . Their uneasiness finds emotional expression in anger against the productive element . In the hope of attaching themselves more firmly to the production line , they will then demand restrictive regulation of industry and commerce , on the pretext ( as Shaftesbury innocently admitted ) that it is for the benefit of the working man . But such a proposal requires status law . The peculiarity of status law is that it cuts in and diverts energy at the beginning of the circuit instead of at the end . It makes the non-productive a first charge on production , ahead of maintenance . If the various taxes recently imposed in previously free economies , under the pretext of helping the indigent , are examined , their nature becomes evident . They have to be paid even though the producer goes bankrupt . Such taxing schemes seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who draw their incomes from fixed charges ? from entailed property or from endowed or tax-supported institutions ? and who therefore wish to have their relation to production affirmed as a governing rule . But the unemployed workingman wants to work , to be active , to live . The demands for status law and for the abolition of structure will  | therefore be more or less simultaneous and both may be included in the same legislative measures . Thus both are likely to be put in effect at about the same time . The result is now visible . The true cause of Fascism , or Nazism , or Communism , is the structureless state , * in which the whole energy of the nation , its production line , is thrown into the repressive mechanism of centralized government with status law . It is a deathtrap . The drawbacks inherent in an aristocratic order are so obvious and inherently onerous , that the fact it had a use has been largely forgotten ; but it did supply structure , by maintaining regional bases . Whenever an aristocracy loses this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution . Footnote  | The Structure of the United States The problem then which confronted the founders of the United States was how to maintain regional bases for a political structure without an aristocracy . It was not so stated at the time , for this is a description of the practical means , when only the objective was known . In like case , it could not have been said that a keystone must be designed to complete the form of the arch , or a zero sign for the use of position in numbers , until these devices had been found ; such a statement is impossible until the problem has been solved . The American revolutionaries had declared the axiom of the rights of the individual , the Society of Contract , as the reason and justification for their independence . An indigenous aristocracy would nullify their intention . Such vestige as remained , in the form of entail , which is the root of the society of status , was accordingly abolished . The separate states already existed , and had not ceded their several sovereignties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities in being was strong enough to defeat proposals that their autonomy should be extinguished , and tended to obscure the future danger in that direction . The question immediately presented was how to bring them together in " a more perfect union " ? without lapsing into democracy . What was wanted was a Republic . The objection to democracy was clear and cogent ; but for quite opposite reasons from those of the Old World . It was obvious that democracy must dissolve the European order of society , which was hierarchical , framed to  | hereditary rank . The premise of democracy is supposed to be natural equality . The Society of Status claimed to derive its moral sanction from the family , extended by analogy in political organization ; but this hypothesis ignores the prime fact that everyone in due course becomes adult . In such extension the feudal pattern became fictitious ; outside of domestic affairs it did not and could not correspond to the facts , either in respect of blood relationship or simple seniority . It resolved into the rule of the few over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old " families . In nature , one family can not be " older " than another . Age is personal . But maturity , the condition of being adult , is equality within its definition . By this conclusion , the few can have no hereditary claim to command the many . On the other hand , this is a mathematical order applied only to chronology . It describes men as equals when they have reached a given span of years , the presumed period of maturation . Outside of that single classification , it has no positive or intrinsic significance. * The Greeks were never able to validate their hypothesis for democracy because it is a materialistic concept , and materialism will not admit human equality , nor any other principle of human association . Materialism must regard mankind as simply an animal species whose behavior is predicated and determined by instinct and expedience . On those grounds , there are no rights and no moral questions ; whatever happens must happen , and whatever must Footnote  | happen does happen . But even if this dead-end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phenomena , it can not be found in human beings , regarded as " higher " animals or as objects in nature . Strict materialism must finally deny that a human being is an entity ; it resolves him into a lump of plasmic material " conditioned " to various " responses " or " reactions . " In materialistic terms , psychology becomes a branch of physiology , behaviorism . Then if the responses ( attributes or qualities ) are compared , one man may be demonstrably stronger than another , or gifted with some ability ( music , art , or whatever ) which another lacks or exhibits in less degree at a given time ; but there is no general equation for the diverse endowments , even if they could be fully discovered . The only definition of equality by measure is that of Euclid : things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another . This calls for a fixed objective standard , a perfect typical man , embodying quantitatively all human attributes in absolute scale and proportion as a norm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be translatable into numbers for points which could be added together . Thus men as they are could be estimated by comparison and each one assigned a rating . ( The Platonic theory of archetypes , or the Ideal , was an unsuccessful attempt to get around this difficulty . ) But the American axiom asserted political equality as a corollary of the inalienable right of every man to liberty . Democracy was inadmissible because it must deny that right and lapse into despotism , as it has always done . It does so abstractly , by its own logical contradiction ; and in practice because logic is a statment of sequence . It is not liberty and equality that are incompatible , but liberty and democracy . The distinction is that between a principle and a process ; the confusion arises from an unwarrantable identification of a negative proposition with a positive .  | It is falsely assumed that when the claim of the few to command the many is refuted , the converse claim of the many to command the individual is proved . This is quite untenable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right must be ruled out altogether . Right as a concept is necessarily opposed to force ; otherwise the word is meaningless . Liberty is a truly natural condition ; for life itself is possible to a human being only by virtue of his capacity for independent action . If any living creature is subjected to absolute restraint , it dies . Human life is of an order transcending the deterministic necessity of physics ; man exists by rational volition , free will . Hence the rational and natural terms of human association are those of voluntary agreement , not command . Therefore the proper organization of society must be that of free individuals . And their equality is posited on the plain fact that the qualities and attributes of a human being are ultimately not subject to measure at all ; a man equals a spiritual entity . But democracy is a collective term ; it describes the aggregate as a whole , and assumes that the right and authority reside in the whole , though derived from the adult condition of the individuals comprised . Then it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction and for no reason whatever such right and authority were irrevocably transferred from the individuals to a group which is nothing but a numerical sum , or particles merged into mass . The authority then is not in any part , nor is any part of it in any part of the mass . Thus democracy resolves into pure process , and even the process is fictitious , for individuals can not actually merge , though a group can exercise the function of mass for a given purpose at a given time , by inaction , a negative . The fictitious process imagined as operating in democracy is of a physical and mathematical and non-  | moral order , beginning with an arbitrary number delimited by accident of residence or descent . But if the authority resides in the collective whole , it is evident that with the disagreement of even one person , the whole is no longer existent or operative ; in which case no general action whatever could be legitimately undertaken . The prime presumption has vanished . In practice then democracy must abandon its own pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But majority is only a part ; thus majority rule implies inconceivably that the part is greater than the whole . Furthermore , even majority is not always obtainable ; only a plurality may favor a given course of action ; in which case one minority must command several other minorities which if added together are greater in number or weight . Such is the inherent contradiction in the theory of democracy . In any event , personal liberty is wiped out at the very beginning , with the theoretic transition from particles to mass or from the unit to the sum . Slavery of a minority , or of " foreigners , " is quite consistent with majority rule. * But in reason , if one man has no right to command all other men ? the expedient of despotism ? neither has he any right to command even one other man ; nor yet have ten men , or a million , the right to command even one other man , for ten times nothing is nothing , and a million times nothing is nothing . The material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical defect corresponding to the moral defect . Gravity determines the movements of an aggregation of separate particles over a given surface ; with every disturbance each particle is subject to the discon- Footnote  | tinuous hazard of chance ; if a number of them move together under the same impulsion , it is as dislocated mass . Active difference of opinion in democracy is either the detachment of a particle or dislocated mass . As Madison said , " it affords no remedy for the evils of faction . " Faction is fragmentary mass , the several fragments being thrown into collision by whatever force occasioned the cleavage . At various times , various nations have exhibited certain aptitudes to an unusual degree . Different periods and places have been marked by a splendid flowering of special talents . Such manifestations are vaguely credited to racial genius , but the phrase will not bear analysis . The elements are usually mixed in origin , so that a somewhat eclectic culture has become homogeneous by development , while still open to new ideas . ( Even the rigorously enclosed society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the prerequisite must be the conditions , or mode of association , which do not hinder such development of innate faculties . Now if the works and thoughts of the men who founded the United States are examined , it is evident that they had a highly developed structural sense , a remarkable feeling for and understanding of form , proportion , perspective . However it came about , they were a nation of architects ; and they thought in mathematics as " naturally " as in words . It is by no means an accident , but an indication of the intellectual context of the period , that George Washington was a surveyor ( though a gentleman by family ) ; that Thomas Jefferson , a lawyer by profession , was passionately interested in architecture ; or that Benjamin Franklin , a tradesman and craftsman with no nautical connection , was given to scientific experiment , and saw nothing out of the way in proposing to work out by himself a formula for finding a position at sea . Indeed , the standard textbook on navigation was composed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special  | advantage of education and was not a navigator . This predisposition was nowise exceptional . Roger Sherman , though bred to the humble occupation of a cobbler , taught himself mathematics so well that he could calculate a lunar eclipse . Once he was invited to speak on the occasion of opening a new bridge. * " He walked critically over the structure , " and delivered his oration in one sentence : " I do n't see but it stands steady . " When New Englanders habitually used the phrase , " I calculate , " that was what they meant . They did calculate . Roger Sherman was responsible for the dual method of representation in the two houses of Congress ? by popular vote in the House of Representatives , with congressmen allotted in proportion to population , and by equality of the States in the Senate . His structural sense was sound ; he hit on both the regional bases and the mass veto function at once . He knew what would stand steady . To understand why bases can not be established on popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to try an equivalent with any other physical materials . Let the substance on which the structure must be supported be composed of separate particles of equal size and weight , and each susceptible of movement ? obviously nothing can possibly stand on it . A pillar or cornerstone can not be fixed on a heap of buckshot , or a mound of sand . There must be something solid , self-contained , and immovable . A regional area answers that description , and will sustain a permanent base of political representation . The area must be definitely circumscribed , and the representation must pertain to it , not to the mobile inhabitants , who may wander about and cross the boundaries at will . Failure to discern that a political organization consists of both structure and mechanism , that is , a fixed base to which agencies of action are attached , has caused untold Footnote  | disaster throughout the ages . These components were hopelessly confused in the feudal theory , where the regional areas were the real structural base while the family was supposed to perform that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no heirs to a territorial family , another succession was established ; but still men did not see the point . Needing an immovable base , their almost incredibly irrational recourse was to bind men to the land , crushing living bodies under the weight of the pillars . But all that was actually necessary was to allot the representation to the area . To do this , however , the area must be established as a political entity , and represented as such ; which can be done only by having the representative appointed by the local political organization , not by the popular vote . There must be delimited local sovereignty in the area . On the other hand , the direct representation of the voters in a definite agency of government is necessary to utilize the function of mass , that is , of the aggregate population . The representation of mass can be effected only by delegates in proportion to numbers , regardless of the several areas which form the bases . Thus by using the materials available , in accordance with architectural and mechanical principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the Roman empire had failed . The Constitution of the United States is an architectural and mechanical drawing , in which the design is laid out on its broad general principles . They are as simple as the design of a foundation , an arch , a piston cylinder , or an eccentric transmission ; and like those fundamentals , they embody relations ; and are thus capable of infinitely complex application . But the intrinsic design must always be maintained . If the foundations are removed , or the keystone withdrawn , the arch must fall ; if the piston cylinder head is blown out , the action will cease ; if the eccentric rod is detached at one end , it can only flail about and smash the whole mechanism . A greater  | volume of energy does not and can not alter the necessary relations involved . The belief that it does is the fatal delusion of today . Increased volume of energy has been made the pretext for destroying the regional bases , when they should rather have been strengthened . Let the Constitution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be examined strictly on its merits and in the light of performance , as an architectural plan and a mechanical apparatus of an earlier day might be studied by modern architects and engineers . It will be found amazing in its correctness , in respect of the relation of mass and motion , operative through the association of human beings ; and the release and application of energy . The Bill of Rights and the treason clause taken together establish the individual as the dynamic factor . The Bill of Rights withdraws entirely from political control both the faculties and the instruments of initiative and enterprise . No law might be passed against freedom of the mind , whether in religion , in speech , or in print ; nor to restrict interchange of ideas in peaceable assembly ; nor to prevent the expression of private opinion from individuals to the government , by petition . No law might deprive the individual of the right to bear arms . Soldiers must not be quartered on citizens in time of peace ; nor even in time of war unless under civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on formal warrant in pursuit of a specific charge authorized by law and confined to the named purpose . No person might be tried unless formally indicted for a crime , nor condemned by secret trial or without witnesses and counsel . And most important for the maintenance of these rights , private property might not be taken for public use without just compensation . Finally , forestalling attempts on the part of the government to nullify these safeguards by indirect means , excessive bail , excessive fines , and torture ( cruel and unusual punishments ) were forbidden . ( Excessive bail can only mean bail fixed in a sum that would be beyond the  | means of the average person to procure . An excessive fine would be a larger sum than the offense could involve ; otherwise a fine would be an easy way of confiscating anybody 's property on the slightest pretext. ) * The treason clause remains unique in all the long record of political institutions . In the first place , it declares that there is no such crime as treason in peace time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid or comfort . " Nothing but armed rebellion or joining with an enemy nation ? and nations are by definition enemies only when at war ? can be treason . No peaceful or personal opposition to government or to members of the government , comes under the head of treason . Even the forcible attack or resistance of a single person as such ( having no connection or agreement with other persons or a foreign government to the same end ) , could hardly be construed as " treason , " as it would not constitute " levying war . " Treason must also be " an overt act , " not merely an expression of opinion ; and a conviction can not be had on circumstantial evidence ; two witnesses to the act are required . In the European theory it was treason to attack the person of the king even for a nonpolitical motive . The man and the office are held to be inseparable . A like attempt against a member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this unprecedented limitation of treason , the government or administration was debarred from imposing silence while making encroachments . Its members were allowed no means of reprisal against criticism or exposure . But the treason clause also contains another unique and significant provision . " No attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted . " It is doubtful whether the Footnote  | average American today would readily understand the meaning of the phrase " corruption of blood , " or of the limitation of forfeiture to the lifetime of the person indicted for treason . But the first restriction defined guilt as personal ; and the second defined private property as belonging to individuals . Both are in opposition to the collectivist theory of the group as superior or antecedent to the individual . It is evident , from the bewildered comments of our contemporary press , that Americans have quite forgotten the historic fact that until the United States came into existence , the laws of Europe allowed punishment of all the members of a family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the political unit , and honors were inherited and privilege pertained in some degree to all the members of the family , it appeared equitable and logical that the whole family should suffer proportionately for the delinquency of any member . The capital penalty was seldom visited upon all , even in earlier times , but lesser penalties , such as exile or imprisonment or demotion in status , were not uncommon for nothing but kinship ; likewise the family property was held to be forfeit altogether by the fault of the head of the family , even if he escaped from jurisdiction or died before being brought to trial . It all went together , family honors , family ownership , family guilt , and family forfeiture . The church doctrine of private property was naturally difficult to maintain against the threat of the state , although the church never yielded that position . Family property is of course private property , differentiated from state or communal ownership as a norm ; also by Christian doctrine guilt is personal . But with a charge of treason , the secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscating all the family property ; and under cover of this procedure , the secular ruler could also fall back on the political system of feudalism , and claim that property was not really privately owned , but held in tenancy from the crown or overlord , and that the  | tenure lapsed when the tenant failed in allegiance . Land titles did go so far back , and had so often and long been held on such tenancy from local lords or conquerors , the question was extremely complex . On the other hand , during the period of settlement of the American colonies , the actual practice of severe penalizing of families for the guilt of a member had long tended to fall into disuse , especially in England , whence it largely vanished with serfdom . But even in England , treason might be imputed for a wide range of actions or for mere words ; and forfeiture might follow after death . But the American Constitution said , by its treason clause , that private property belongs to individuals by indefeasible title . If a person indictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his property might be sequestrated ( in forfeit ) , as long as he was alive , a fugitive from justice or unpardoned ; but at the moment of his death , the title passes unimpaired to his legal heir . Nor could any member of his family be punished for mere kinship ; none could be held guilty of the deed of another . This is the meaning of the ban against " corruption of blood . " Until the resurgence of Communism , even Russia had largely conformed to the American practice ; but America first declared the principle as absolute . This also prevented the State from having an invisible and unspecified power over an accused man by means of threats to his family . A man of integrity may face death for himself calmly , yet he might quail before the prospect of torture or even of penury for his wife and children , his parents , his brothers and sisters . It is disgraceful to our educational institutions and to the political intelligence of Americans , that in discussion of the notorious " Moscow trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American constitutional safeguard against trials of that type , and of the base of that safeguard on individual private property ; nor even of the collectivist political  | theory which admitted the Russian procedure until the example of the United States shamed them into desuetude . To Americans , and by the moral axiom of the American political system , such trials are an abominable perversion of justice . But with the return of collectivism the legal imputation of collective guilt inevitably returns also . All these provisions in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are of the utmost importance in relation to the flow of energy ; the fact which they express accounts for the unparalleled expansion of the United States in territorial extent in the given time , by accounting for the even more extraordinary extension of the field of physical science and mechanical invention . In a hundred and fifty years , men suddenly enlarged and corrected their knowledge of scientific principles which had taken many thousands of years to discover at all ; and devised means of application which made possible a concurrent increase of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreams of humanity in the past . Nothing of the sort had ever occurred in the world before ; history reveals nothing comparable to the United States as a nation . It may be pointed out reasonably that the contributions to scientific knowledge and practical invention did not originate only in the United States . But it was the existence of the United States , and the consequent demonstration and spread of liberty , which made the achievements of science possible in Europe . What happened was that the dynamo of the energy used in human association was located . It is in the individual . And it was withdrawn from political interference by a formal reservation , along with the means and material by which it can organize the great world circuit of energy . The dynamo is the mind , the creative intelligence , which our Bill of Rights and the treason clause assert to be free of political control . The material means on which intelligence projects by initiative is private property . Nothing else will serve .  | Likewise the structure of government was established on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation . Regional areas were delimited to which the instruments of political action were attached , without confining any person by law to the given area , or confiding the power of as agencies . They pertained to the several states as such . This effect was secured by the method of appointment to the Senate . Senators were chosen by the legislative bodies of the states ; that is , their office was attached to the state , being derived from the state ; unlike the Roman provincial governors who were appointed by the central authority . The thrust was against the center , instead of from the center ; therefore it countered the weight of the superstructure . On the other hand , the Senator had no political function within the state he represented , hence the office had no intrinsic tendency toward separatism . It took effect only at the center . The stresses were doubly equalized . The several states also preserved their political integrity by keeping to themselves the primary authority to qualify voters in Federal elections. * Nevertheless citizenship , as a general condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one state had the rights of citizenship in all the other states . This effected cohesion of the particles to form a nation , without prejudice to the regional bases . The states were limited to a " republican form of government " by the Federal authority . The citizens , by the institution of private property , were given resistance against all the agencies of government . Private property is the standing ground of the citizen ; there is no other . As the state had to be a regional area with its representatives , to preserve its basic func- Footnote  | tion , so it was necessary for citizens to have a direct vote for the mass inertia veto ; hence the two legislative chambers , the Senate for the States and the House of Representatives for the citizens as individuals . The possibility of legislators using their office for a direct grab from the public funds was forestalled by debarring them from such action in respect of a current term of office . The Senate , having the longest term of office and representing the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ratification , with negotiations entrusted to the executive . The executive was given no specific means of initiating domestic legislation , and only a provisional or delaying veto . The House of Representatives , elected by direct vote of the citizens , was enabled to express the property and function of mass , the ultimate veto by negation , being entrusted with the initiative in laying taxation and granting supplies . All supplies were required to be granted only in denominated sums for allotted purposes ; any such grant must therefore be used up in time and would have to be granted again . If no grant is made , the veto of inertia is in force . It is only necessary to do nothing . To prevent the larger , wealthier , or more populous states from throwing their weight against smaller states , their representation as states was made equal . To prevent the smaller or poorer states from ganging up and fleecing the more opulent states ? throwing their joint weight ? the popular representation was made proportionate to the number of citizens . To prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy out poor states , it was provided that Federal taxation imposed upon persons could be levied only in proportion to population ; while taxes on goods ( tariffs , excise duties , imposts ) must be uniform throughout the United States . That is , no favor could be shown to any one state in respect of manufactures , port dues , or the like . This prevented the political monopolies which were the bane of  | Europe . And the states could not impose port or border tariffs at all . The several states were forbidden to coin money or emit paper currency ( " bills of credit " ) , or to make anything but gold and silver legal tender . Therefore the transmission line of energy could not be cut or tapped by the political agency of any state . And the Federal government was given no power to issue paper currency . Though it has done so , the authority is not in the Constitution , while it is expressly stated in the Constitution that powers not delegated to the Federal authority are reserved from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair contracts , though it has lately done so ; while the states were forbidden in set terms . The Federal judiciary was to be appointed for life ( subject to impeachment for misuse of office ) , in order to keep a check on the legislative and executive branches . The endlessly debated question of " judicial review " is mere stultification ; for the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is specified as covering only cases " arising under this Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made under their authority , " while " this Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof , shall be the supreme law of the land . " No sophistry can evade the proposition that the supreme law must govern the decision ; that is what supreme means . But after arguing for a hundred years against this proper and indispensable function of judicial review , the pseudo-liberals have invented a singularly vicious hypothetical perversion of it . Justice Frankfurter expressed it , writing of " the dangers and difficulties inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle business to decide , not whether legislation is wise , but whether legislators were reasonable in believing it to be wise . " Judicial review is not concerned with deciding whether legislation is wise or legislators reasonable in believing it to be wise . Judicial review is confined to  | finding whether or not a given law contravenes the Constitution , the supreme law ; as it does if the legislature exceeded its Constitutional power in passing the law in question ? the legislature has no authority except in the Constitution . The Constitutional provision for armed defense was consonant with the political structure . The originating authority of the Federal government was sufficient to enlist and provide for a standing army , without direct reference to the several states ; but supplies could be appropriated only for a term of two years . This would tend to keep the professional army of reasonable size . As the original method was by voluntary enlistment , obviously that was the intention . On the other hand , the primary right to bear arms and form militia companies was reserved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve in a declared war , their officers must be appointed by the states ; after which they were subject to call by the Federal government . Throughout , initiative remained with the individual , as a free man ; but formal action rested with the political authorities , as having the formal inhibitory power . Though a defensive war is just and necessary , war involves destruction ; hence the inhibitory power must regulate it . But creative action must be free . For its realization of these moral relations and structural embodiment of them , the Constitution of the United States has been justly described as the greatest political document ever struck off at one time by the mind of man .  | Slavery , the Fault in the Structure The three great ideas were brought together at last without impediment ; the individual and immortal soul , exercising self-government by law , and free of the universe to pursue knowledge by reason . After two thousand years , the resources of science were released for productive application . The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design the Constitution had to admit one prime defect , an irreconcilable contradiction . Chattel slavery was an existent institution . Whatever form of government was adopted for the Union , it must either extinguish slavery ab initio ( as contrary to the moral order of the universe ) , or tolerate it by default of such axiomatic statement . Here the federal form , which is indispensable for stability , unhappily admitted an ambiguous expedient . It was temporarily possible to leave slavery to state jurisdiction . No doubt the opinion of slave-holders was weighted by their wrongful possession ; but there was also colorable pretext for delay . It was honestly feared that the Negroes , many of them newly brought from Africa , might prove a burden and a danger if liberated immediately . There was then no question of the vote , which was rightly by property qualification ; but only of the difficulty of assimilating savages to civilized life in other than a servile relation ; though even that was felt to be none too safe . Nobody knew just how it was to be worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes or sending them back to Africa . Meantime , as the Federal government must control the external borders , it had authority to forbid further importation of slaves from abroad , and indicated that intention indirectly . The implied sentiment was against slavery . On the other hand , slavery caused the inclusion of a clause in the Constitution providing for the extradition of slaves who escaped across state lines . That the subject was embarrassing is perhaps indicated by the language ; the words slave and slavery are not used . The phrase is a " person held to service or labor . " ( At that time , the description would include free white apprentices during their terms of indenture . ) Slaves then were at least persons ; and are also counted as persons in apportioning for the House of Representatives . But the brute fact remained that they were slaves ; and the Constitution did not pronounce them free by right . The lasting injury inflicted by this inclusion of slavery was that it vitiated the principle on which the new nation came into being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by states as an act of authority , could never be exactly equivalent to starting with liberty as the universal right from which authority was derived . Further , the continuance of slavery made it impossible for the Bill of Rights to limit the state governments as well as the Federal government . The existence of slavery necessarily impairs the exercise of their rights by free men . If the state power makes a man a slave , of course it abridges his freedom of speech and assembly , leaves him no security of person , and no right to property ; so it can hardly be forbidden to do those things to anybody . The alleged distinction between " human rights " and " property rights " is a verbal muddle ; property rights are human rights . The true issue is between the individual and the collective . The only arguments ever offered for slavery call upon the collective , either race or state , for authority and enforcement ; whereas if rights inhere in the in-  | dividual , no man can be owned , and every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect caused an equivalent structural defect , as it was bound to do . Logic was stultified , so that discussion was worse than futile . The slave states claimed that their state sovereignty sufficed to make a man a slave . Then the same sovereignty in a free state should have made any person free on crossing the border . But the extradition clause ceded this attribute ; for the extradition of a slave as such is entirely different from the extradition of a criminal . The criminal is no less guilty after he has crossed the border , whereas the slave is presumed to become free ; in delivering him up , the free state is obliged to violate its own basic law. * True that the free states had accepted the inequitable condition to begin with ; union seemed so desirable that the point was yielded . The slave states could say that the free states could have and extradite slaves if they wished . Yet all the states had fought for liberty . Both sides had compromised their moral position hopelessly . If the free states said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or denounce the Constitution ? But the slave states must rest their case on the Constitution , and the Constitution was open to revision . If it came to that , would they be willing to abide by it ? The conflict remained in abeyance , while the hope remained that slavery would be gradually extinguished . Yet from the first apprehension was felt for the permanence of the Union . This was evident in the prosecution of the misty Burr-Blennerhasset conspiracy , which was so largely sheer energy driving westward that nobody quite knew the intention , not even the alleged conspirators . The impulse was to continue until it reached the Rio Footnote  | Grande and the Pacific Coast up to Puget Sound and leaped to Alaska . And the premonition was true ; it tore the nation apart . But where was the real weak point ? Unless the question is put in relevant terms , there can be no answer . Though the Civil War occurred a hundred odd years ago , the controversy is still open ; did the break occur on slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industrial economy ? Did the states reserve or claim too much in state sovereignty ; and if they did , was it on account of slavery ? Division of sovereign powers between a Federal government and its component states is no simple matter ; the past is strewn with the wreckage of leagues and federations . The whole question of sovereignty is exceedingly complex . In practice there is always a debatable margin , on which the gage of battle is thrown down when claims are pressed rigorously . Territorial sovereignty is delimited by the boundaries . This is the virtue of nationalism ; it is a spatial restriction on political power , an ultimate safeguard for the individual , a chance of escape from local tyranny . The rise of " internationalism " always connotes a corresponding encroachment on personal liberty ; but it really does so by leaving no sovereignty anywhere . Sovereignty rests in the nation ; its powers are exercised by the government . By ordinary , all stipulated powers are accounted strength in a government ; and the absence of any conceivable power in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that powers which are essentially improper , being contrary to the moral order of the universe , are weakness ; and so are powers allotted to an inappropriate agency . They impose weight , stress , or thrust which no structure can support . When " weak " or " strong " government is in question , the usual connotation of the terms relates only to the superstructure ; and the usual recourse is further centralization of powers , which is to say , an increase in the bulk of the  | superstructure and the diversion of more energy into it . Beyond the correct proportions and powers , this is fatal ; unless the resistance from the base is greater than the weight and the distributed stresses of the superstructure , the whole must fall . Feeble governments are those which have no adequate and legitimately instrumented opposition from the regional bases and the mass veto . Utter incompetence in government is finally achieved by what is called absolute political power , whether under the name of democracy or as candid despotism. * Then both the states and the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the improper allotment of a proper power . The latter error nullified a vital attribute of sovereignty , its space dimension . Unless this distinction between stipulated powers and intrinsic strength is understood , there can be no relevant discussion of the subject . The function of states in a federation is to supply bases and vertical structure ; this function is static . They are required to stand against pressure from above which tends to thrust them apart , make them buckle outward . Strictly speaking , no part of a foundation or the verticals resting on it can have too much static strength , true local autonomy . A structure collapses from weakness , not from strength . If it is torn apart violently , it must be from uncompensated thrusts and stresses . These must occur because of unequal bases , faulty cross connections , or excessive and unequally distributed superstructure . Now if slavery had not been admitted to the Constitution on tolerance , its original design was marvelously sound ; but the inclusion of slavery introduced all three faults . Primarily it made the bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the extradition clause concerning slaves gave the slave states a variable uncompensated point of pressure against the free states . And in Footnote  | the long run , slavery afforded an excuse for adding excessive weight to the superstructure and distributing it unequally . Thus all three of the disputed causes of the Civil War entered into it , being one cause . And as a crowning evil , again the apparent problem masked the real problem . The apparent problem was the preservation of the Union . But the antecedent condition of federal union is the existence of the states . The real problem was the preservation of the states . If that were impossible , the Union must presently disintegrate or solidify into mass . If a structure is defective , the fact that it was the best the builders could do , or thought they could do , will not avert the physical consequences . Yet since human affairs are in the realm of moral law , which is of a higher order than mechanical law , the outcome may confound all measurable probabilities . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no pre-estimate is possible of what machines man may invent . Machines have no independent active existence , and being creations of the human mind , the system in which they operate must correspond to the nature of the prime mover . It is now a popular cliche that the internal combustion engine has somehow brought about or necessitated some alleged new principle or form in political organization . This is ridiculous . Man himself is an internal combustion engine ; he is the determinant , and his devices are only multiples of his own faculties and powers . The internal combustion engine increased the volume of production , of energy , on the already existent long circuit , that is all . The relations are unaltered . The necessary transmission line is the same ; it is private property . The necessary condition of human beings is the same ; it is liberty . The only change is in degree , which can involve only a requirement of more of the same thing , absolute security of private property , full personal liberty , and firm autonomous regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential of a  | nation can not be appraised quantitatively . It consists in abstract ideas , in its axioms of human relations expressed in organization , not in material wealth computed at a given date . The Civil War exemplifies this principle . In the early years of the Republic , all of the measurable factors were preponderantly in favor of the Southern slave states . They had ample and varied natural resources . Their staple products , cotton and tobacco , were in demand by a world market , affording cash and credit . They had the prestige bequeathed by their great statesmen as a political asset . Practically , they had the Federal government , the wealth , and the legal leverage . The North had the personal enterprise of a free population . As northern industry got under way , it seemed to be contributing to Southern dominance , by commerce and inventions which swelled the profits of slave-owners and enabled them to extend slave territory . The appearance was delusive . Suddenly the free economy reached out and began to take over a greater territory than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power of the free states increased by geometrical progression , doubling and redoubling . Just before the Civil War , William Tecumseh Sherman warned his Southern friends not to provoke war , saying that an agrarian economy can not match an industrial economy in armed conflict . But the truth is that the South was not a real agrarian economy either ; it had no economy whatever of its own , lacking the generator for a local circuit . Looking further than the hazards of a particular war , it was incapable of becoming an independent nation in such conditions . The South lost the Civil War , as it was bound to ; and the question of state sovereignty was dismissed as a technicality set aside by the verdict on slavery . In resorting to war , the slave states committed the moral error of repudiating a contract after taking special advantage through it . The Federal government was clearly obligated  | to maintain itself against aggression or disruption ; having received its authority by delegation , it had no right to abandon its deputed function unless legitimately dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The benefit of union to all the states is so overwhelmingly evident that its dissolution then or now wears the aspect of violent lunacy ; but if the events were described as pure phenomena , an intelligent spectator would realize that there must have been a fault in the structure , as in a falling house , and the inhabitants acted as they did in the panic of desperation . So the operation and consequences of the Reconstruction Act must raise grave doubts whether there could be moral authority for perpetuating by force a union of voluntary origin . Nor is it justifiable to alter the terms of contract when one of the parties is under duress . Being made by force , the rebuilt structure still contained a physical defect corresponding to the moral defect . The Reconstruction Act was immediate evidence ; it wiped out the states as political entities . Though the Act was terminable , and ceased in time , the damage was done . In political organization the specific act implies a continuing power . Even if it be denominated an exception , a temporary expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be used . The Northern states could not consent to any extension of Federal power over the Southern states without making themselves liable to the imposition of the same power in the future . It was not the liberation of the slaves which extinguished state sovereignty . Liberty is a pre-condition , a universal , which the Constitution should have recognized as primary . The destruction was done by the usurpation of state powers by the Federal government as by right of conquest . If the Federal government had fought and won a war  | of conquest , then the states , north as well as south , must have lost it . In place of genuine regional bases , the Civil War resulted in a factitious division with factional interests which would inevitably seek to use the Federal power for partisan advantage . And in that lesson the Western states got their first political training .  | The United States was bound to affect the mind of Europe because it was a projection of European experience and hopes , put to the proof in the supposed conditions of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers brought to this country their crafts and tools , arts and letters , theology , morals and science , customs and law ; but they left behind most of the apparatus of enforcement . They did not bring either the closed economy or sacramental religion ; and the wilderness afforded sufficient recourse against the remainder of official authority . Whatever survived on its own might be assumed to have validated itself . Liberty emerged and triumphed . A subtle critic has said : " The Declaration of Independence blew Europe off its moral base . " * The phrase is exact ; for Europe was not placed on a new base . The American idea never got back to Europe at all ( as in like circumstances the idea of Roman law was never comprehended in Asia ) . Instead , the attendant phenomena encountered a profound misinterpretation , being fitted to a divergent European theory . The physical consequences of this moral discrepancy became immediately evident in the French Revolution , with the Terror and the Napoleonic outburst ; but the full effect was delayed until this century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present explosion and disintegration of Europe . None of the harm was done in enmity . On the contrary , while Footnote  | the antagonism indicated by the Monroe Doctrine persisted , Europe had a chance of adjustment . The friendship of America , which turned in the torrent of energy , was fatal . While the United States was in the making , as a few happily neglected colonies , something queer happened to European thought ; by way of science , it reverted to determinism in the social and political sphere . Free will as positive doctrine was the original affirmation of Christianity . Death is the one inevitable event in every human life ; so it had been taken by the pagan world as final evidence that " the fate of every man is bound about his forehead . " When death was regarded rather as an event in time emancipating the soul from temporality to a wider sphere , free will entered into faith . ( The major heresies from Christianity have always been lapses back toward fatalism ) * Christianity tended toward Rome as its center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will was given legitimate play , not on a precarious margin , but as the operative principle , in contrast to the mass determinism of Greek democracy or the dead-end of Asiatic despotism . But the thousand year regime of status in Europe , in spite of the modification maintained by the church , had bred in its subjects a deep weariness . The breakdown of the Roman empire was hard to forget , since men had struggled unavailingly to keep it going ; their failure left them dubious of their own abilities and faculties . The Footnote  | figure of the Noble Savage signalizes the discrediting of status government , but only by negation . The gradual merging of church and state ? which occurred in the Protestant no less than in the Catholic countries ? deprived the church of its function of opposition to the secular administration , and facilitated the rise of the Absolute State . At the same time , Galileo 's exposition of the solar system , on first view , lent itself to a mechanistic philosophy . Applied science in mechanical invention seemed to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on social relations , including political economy . Altogether , free will practically disappeared from the intellectual context of Europe . Not quite consciously , but in the backs of their minds , Europeans felt that they had tried both politics and religion , and neither would " work . " This is the undertone of Montaigne 's deceptively noncommittal reflections . He did not reach the conclusion , but he stood at the turning point . He would never attack either church or state directly ; he sought a by-pass instead ; his outward conformity was a tacit escape . When he said that if he were accused of stealing the towers of Notre Dame , he would fly the country sooner than attempt to defend his innocence in court , the inference is plain ; there was no justice to be had from the law . The attitude is legitimate as a starting point for inquiry , but rationally it should lead to an examination of the existing system of law and the proper axioms of law , a course which was to be pursued subsequently with useful results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit fragments of evidence of human behavior from which " natural " man might be synthesized . But he never said that either ; though his evidence tended mainly to indicate that man was a product of environment . Later , when the theory of " natural " man was formulated , the mechanistic theory of the universe had gained credence in European philosophy . God was a mathematician ; Descartes and Newton were His prophets.  | To be sure , Descartes allowed man to be an exception in his mathematical philosophy , man being " continually in touch with the Divine Idea , " but Cartesians of a later generation went so far as to assert that animals were mere machines , incapable of feeling pain. * One step further , and strictly " natural " man is also reduced to mechanism in such a mechanistic universe . At this point , some social thinkers said that if the artificial restrictions of society were abolished , man as mechanism would function perfectly and precisely as he was designed to do ; but they did not attempt to explain how an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised and imposed " artificial " restrictions on himself , contrary to his own nature and machinery . When the question was put , how could the rigidly mechanistic school deny that " whatever is , is right , " because it could not be otherwise ? Yet if they wished to change " society , " they must suppose something was wrong with it . At the moment , they were obliged to ignore this difficulty ; and when Marx came up against it later , in his dialectical materialism , his alleged solution merely burked the issue , by postulating that some parts of the mechanism could obey the advice of the whiting to the snail , and move a little faster if they chose , or hang back , if they were obstinate . The perfect and Footnote  | absolute universal machine had a propensity to go haywire . Meantime , it is singular that the English settlers in America , of the Puritan strain , who were predestinarian by religion , should have stood by free will in their secular affairs , against the drift of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intellectual feat by narrowing predestination to its exact and literal meaning of an ultimate destination , heaven , or hell . On this earth , they had managed to get to America by their own efforts in the teeth of authority ; then they conquered the enormous odds of the wilderness , incidentally setting up local government . So they could hold the conviction of political or temporal free will ; and in good time they proved it , with the grand demonstration of the revolution . ( It is not suggested that none but the Puritans or their descendants contributed to this result ; but they did their share , whereas in Europe men who were originally of the same persuasion pressed the determinist doctrine into the service of the Absolute State . ) The mechanistic philosophy is a very late importation to America ; and it is wholly imported . It did not derive from our machinery , any more than it created the machine age . When Americans began inventing and using machines , they were of the firm opinion that they did make and run those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines " determining " or " creating " anything whatever . Machines to an American are still an expression of free will . It is difficult for an American to ride in a motor car as a mere passenger ; mentally he drives it . But what Europeans wanted was something that would run itself and humanity with it , requiring nothing of men except passive submission . Refusing to recognize that even the life of a savage calls for extremely active , voluntary adaptation , Europeans rationalized themselves back below savagery . " Nature " became personified in  | " enlightened despotism " ; before the end of the eighteenth century , Europe was asking in plain words for a dictator . " The central clue to the reform program of the philosophers was their faith in natural law . . . . All that was needed to unlock the millennium was a supreme legislator , a Euclid of the social sciences , who would discover and formulate the natural principles of social harmony . The mathematical generalizations which formed the ground plan of physics had been propounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fundamental laws of human society would likewise be discovered by some inspired genius rather than by a parliamentary assembly . " * Though they talked of science , they did not give themselves the trouble to use the scientific method of definition of terms ; they used the words monarchy , democracy , and republic interchangeably , and most conveniently for any dictator who might take advantage of their standing offer . Napoleon was the answer . " By leaving the ideal form of government undefined , they made it possible for Napoleon to unite the republican and monarchical tradition in a formula of democratic despotism . " Napoleon was the creation of the academic planners . But he was by no means the first attempt , though his predecessors are generally unrecognized . The consort of George II , Queen Caroline , held the same doctrine , and believed she was putting it into execution , unknown to her subjects , with Walpole as her agent ; but no harm was done , since Walpole had to get his policies carried out by Parliament ; the roundabout method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , merely completed the transfer of power from the crown to the Commons , though the landed gentry still retained , during the process of transition , the main share of executive offices . Caroline had got the idea of " benevolent Footnote  | despotism " from her grandmother , the Electress Sophia , who had learned it from Leibnitz . By another channel , it was subsequently imparted to George III , who tried to fill the bill as the " Patriot King . " His well-meant efforts were incomprehensible and infuriating to the English , who had not divorced reason from commonsense ; and when George became certifiably insane , nobody was surprised . But on the Continent , it was in consonance with this theory of an autocratic lawgiver inexplicably empowered to dispense " natural law " that Voltaire made friends with Frederick the Great , and Diderot with Catherine the Great ; and Madame de Stael was eager to flatter Napoleon , and told Alexander of Russia : " Your character , Sire , is a constitution . " Turgot is credited with the statement : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free . " Since France had had a hundred years of despotism , and was not free , it would seem that the only objection the philosophers had to the Bourbons was that they were not despotic enough . These were the advance guard of the modern " liberals . " Europe has never given up this fantasy of the deus ex machina ; it reappears at every turn of events . It is revealed in the words of the Empress Eugenie , speaking of the ephemeral empire of Maximilian in Mexico , when she said that Maximilian should have set up a dictatorship on the pattern of that of Napoleon III , " a dictatorship which should bring liberty , and a man able enough to maintain them side by side . " The words mean nothing at all ; she had them by rote . Maximilian himself explained that he " needed a strong force in order to impose reforms and improvements ; the people here have to be compelled to what is good . " His empress Carlotta , when she went mad , dreamed of Maximilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe . " During the French Revolution , Burke remarked of the French royalist exiles in England that excepting for professions of attachment to the persons of the King and  | Queen of France , these aristocratic refugees " talked like Jacobins . " Obviously they were unaware of it ; and Burke might have added with truth that the Jacobins , along with most of the European revolutionaries of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , talked like absolute monarchists . The slogan of the English Chartists was : " Political power our means , social happiness our end . " The Marxian " dictatorship of the proletariat , " after which " the State would wither away , " was a later repetition . The current version of this fatal twaddle was echoed by an American journalist after a visit to Communist Russia ; in his version , " Russia was laying a new foundation for an evolutionary society , which was to pass through foreseen and planned for stages of growth from an absolute and political dictatorship through industrialism to liberty , democracy and peace . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter and starvation of millions of people , selected as victims specifically because of their productive character and free intelligence , was the long-term result of the mechanistic theory of the universe . And the attendants of the Sacred Juggernaut form a remarkable procession : Frederick , Catherine , Caroline , Mme. de Stael , the two Georges , the two Napoleons , Eugenie , Carlotta , Marx , Lenin , and an obsequious train of journalists . In the meantime John Stuart Mill , professing to be the champion of liberty , sold it out again to " society . " That is , he assumed that personal liberty was justifiable only if it served the collective good . Then if a plausible argument can be put forward that it does not ? and such an argument will seem plausible because there is no collective good ? obviously slavery must be right . The persistent dreams of humanity are of eternal youth and beauty and absolute power . The first two must be sought for their own sake , since they can not be disguised by a moral pretext . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods to some fortunate mortals . With the dawn of science , the hope was trans-  | ferred to expectation of an Elixir of Life , to be discovered by research . Neither of these wishes could do much harm . Bishop Berkeley , the philosopher , was mysteriously convinced that tar-water was a panacea for almost every bodily ailment . One can not guess why he endowed this irrelevant prescription with such magical properties ; he had no ulterior motive . The significant point is not merely that tar-water can not do what Berkeley thought it could . Nothing can . What he desired is unrealizable in the nature of things . There are deadly drugs ; but there is no elixir of life for the physical body . Yet the desire has a residual intelligence , which yields beneficial results in the improvement of health and comeliness through rational study of biology and hygiene . In mechanics a similar impossibility was imagined , a Perpetual Motion Machine . Here genuine science confronts a difficulty , so far unsolved , in defining energy or discovering its ultimate properties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quantitative . Dealing with inorganic matter , science postulates the Second Law of Thermodynamics , which says that energy " runs down , " by conversion from a kinetic to a static manifestation . The two aspects of energy are exemplified in a man walking , moved by kinetic energy , and bumping into a stone wall , in which he encounters static energy . The wall has resistance , which is measurable in terms of energy by the force required to break through it ; and the kinetic energy conversely is measured by what it can move , in static form . Now if the energy of the whole universe , by which it moves , is considered to be fully defined in terms of its properties as manifested through inorganic matter , the universal energy must be a fixed quantity ; and must also be subject to the Second Law of Thermodynamics , by which the whole universe is bound to " run down " ultimately , to become a motionless frozen lightless mass , absolutely static , so to remain forever after . Certainly the  | Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through inanimate materials ; engineering and mechanics must be governed by this principle to get results . But if the same principle is assumed to govern the universal energy as such ? instead of being merely a phase of its transmission through certain inorganic elements ? it evokes an initial phenomenon , the " starting " of the universal mechanism in the first place by the primary existence of a fixed quantity of kinetic energy : how or from whence the hypothesis can not pretend to explain nor even contemplate . The religious hypothesis of the nature of the universe is actually much more rational , postulating a First Principle ( God ) , the Source of energy , which does not " run down , " is not measurable , and is manifest to our rational faculties in both eternal and temporal aspects , by the measurable phenomena of inorganic matter , and through the rational faculty itself , which is of the nonmeasurable order , indicating a divine element in man , the immortal soul . On such a First Principle , the universe need not run down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Law of Thermodynamics would be secondary to the Creative First Principle which completes an eternal circuit , eternally self-renewing , through further processes man has not yet fathomed . Now the " perpetual motion " crank , in a muddled manner , is approximating the absurdity of the strict quantitative mechanistic view of the universe , which does imply that somehow the cosmic machinery was set up in posse , and then kicked into gear with a given quantity of kinetic energy which has to be assumed as " there " already ; after which it- went on running " of itself , " with no further supply , and must continue to do so until it runs down , by exhaustion of the quantity . Thus the perpetual motion crank , approaching his alleged problem , admits that he has to get his engine started by a normal introduction of  | energy from an external source . After that , he says , it will keep on running on its own indefinitely . This is the claim and the demand made by all the promisers of eventual felicity through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dictatorship of the proletariat or the elite , absolute government ? and then no more effort , no need of intelligence , a machine running on ? to a dead end . The theory of Marxist Communism is precisely that of the Perpetual Motion Machine , point by point , for it stipulates that the productive system created by free enterprise is a pre-requisite , to be taken over by the Communist machine . Thus the dream of power is also susceptible of two interpretations , one incalculably beneficial , the other vicious , the cause of infinite misery . When it is directed toward the mastery of nature , the ordering of inorganic matter by knowledge of natural law , it is creative , not only in material goods but in enrichment of human personality . The latter development occurs because in man , the being who thinks , reason is the individuating attribute . Acute observers have found that primitive peoples , such as the Eskimos , do exhibit a " collective " psychology , to such degree that in group actions the consciousness of individuality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged with instinct by habit . It is neither the joint action nor thinking alike in conscious reasonable terms which induces this collective " unity " ; it is not thinking at all at the given moment or occasion . The exercise of intellect in abstract reasoning will lead intelligent men to like conclusions through logical sequences , and at the same time develop their individuality ; because thinking is an individual function . Therefore the collectivist , to attain his objective , the collective society or state , seeks the one type of organization , the political agency , which is directly prohibitory and must tend to stop men thinking . This is the evil interpretation of the dream of power , its perversion into the  | lust for power over other men , instead of mastery of nature . The lust for power is most easily disguised under humanitarian or philanthropic motives . It appeals naturally to people who feel a sentimental uneasiness for the misfortunes of others , mixed with the craving for unearned praise , and most especially if they are non-productive. * An amiable child wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give away half of this illusory wealth . The twist in the motive is shown by the fact that it would be just as easy to wish such a windfall directly to those others without imagining oneself as the intermediary of their good fortune . The child may imagine earning the money , though even so imagination might as well extend to others earning theirs ; but as a rule it is to come from some undefined available effortless supply already extant ? a perpetual motion machine . The child does not even conceive that persons in need of help can also imagine a million dollars for themselves . The double gratification , of personal wants and of power through " doing good , " is innocently stipulated . Carried into adult years , this naive self-glorification turns to positive hatred of any suggestion of persons helping themselves by their own individual efforts , by the non-political means which imply no power over others , no compulsory apparatus . The hatred has a deep motive back of it ; for it is true that nothing but the political means will yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person wholly devoid of talent , skill , accomplishment , wit , beauty , charm , or even the practical ability to earn a living by routine labor , can conceivably become an object of flattering attention , greeted with applause and given a hearing for the feeblest Footnote  | inanities ? obviously nothing will serve except political position . A large private fortune may procure a private circle of sycophants ; but only the imperial decree could have gained Nero an audience for his singing or extorted applause for Caligula from the crowd . But the rationalized dream of the Absolute State has a special historic connotation on its recurrence . The periods in which it has crystallized in literature are vastly significant . The three most famous paper schemes of this type are Plato 's " Politeia , " or ideal state , mistranslated as the " Republic , " * More 's Utopia , and Marx 's nameless Promised Land to come after the destruction of capitalism . What they have in common in their form is that all of them are final ; they are arrangements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their social and economic relations admit neither the biologically natural but mathematically irregular and interwoven order of the family , nor the unpredictable creative faculty of the individual . The mold is set , to preclude variation or change . They are static societies . Plato and More made the individual subject to the civic organization , and Marx made him subject to mechanized industry . But what they have in common in respect of the times when they were imagined reveals their true significance . Each of the three marks an era in which new developments had already occurred which must make a static Footnote  | society impossible . The men who wrote these dreams were seismographic . They had felt the impending change , as if the earth had shifted beneath their feet ; and their minds took refuge in a fantasy of a world which should not be subject to change . Plato lived in the age when the Greeks were formulating the basic principles of science . Sir Thomas More lived in the dangerous years of the Renaissance , the revival of science . Marx witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three fantasies are reactions from the Age of Energy . Plato was a literary man ; it was his artistic sense of form which was disquieted , and which he sought to compensate with a rigorous design . More was an intelligent man and a wit ; he labeled his creation frankly for what it was : Utopia means Nowhere . Marx was a fool ; he offered his scheme as a prediction of the future . It is through this imposed model for clockwork that Europe has observed the United States since its inception ; stultification could go no further . The principle of social harmony is liberty , the rights of the individual ; that is the natural law of man , which the United States had discovered and formulated , before the French Revolution . Henry Adams , who witnessed the Energy Age after it was well under way , spent his life endeavoring to trace the connection between the last century of the Middle Ages , and the modern outburst of energy in kinetic uses . He picked up the clue , pondered it , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the Virgin and the Dynamo ? His question was neither irreverent nor irrelevant . He perceived that after the majesty of Divine Law had been established in medieval philosophy by severe logic , the image of the Virgin then became more prominent in religion , as the recipient of honors and petitions . He recognized that this was because the Virgin represented an unconstrained element , grace or mercy , which implies free will in man , being available to continual choice . Then man was not to be bound by any irrevocably determined  | sequence , as a machine is . Man is not a machine . But at this point Henry Adams failed to realize that it is by freedom of personal volition that man is capable of pursuing his intellectual inquiries and making his inventions . This is the genesis of the dynamo . Being constructed according to the laws of mechanics , the dynamo itself is deterministic ; that is to say , left to itself , it will stop . Then if it is to run , it must be by the will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mechanistic philosophy .  | The Fatal Amendments The United States is the Age of the Dynamo . By carrying over the axiom of free will from religious to political doctrine , a Niagara of kinetic energy was released . The swelling flow calls for maximum firmness of the bases and of tensile strength in the structure , and the minimum obstructive form or action . Unhappily every alteration , except two , in the Constitution , subsequent to the Bill of Rights , * was of a contrary type . The test may be applied to any amendment by general questions : Does the amendment deny the rights of the individual ? Does it weaken the bases by impairing the states as political entities ? Does it add to the gross bulk or tend to improper distribution of the weight of the superstructure ? If it does any of these things , it must turn the beneficial operation of a high energy system into a danger of equal magnitude . Further , all these injurious effects are interacting ; one amendment may inflict dual damage ; and one impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struc-Footnote  | ture cracks , sags , or sways , disrupting the private economy , the alternating attack by the zealous amenders will be plied more furiously . There is a progressive increase in chronological frequency of amendments to the Constitution . And the full consequences are compounded and cumulative , becoming manifest after a lapse of time all at once in a general collapse . They are also aggravated by a concurrent drift in judicial decisions , and extensions of the political power by simple usurpation . A sedition act is such usurpation ; there is no authority for it in the Constitution , and there was wrathful protest on the first occasion ; now it is accepted casually , with little comment except suggestions to enlarge it , frequently at the behest of alleged " liberals . " An early usurpation long forgotten as an event , yet still in force , took effect after over a century , in 1933 , with the confiscation of private property in gold . When John Jay was Chief Justice , the first to hold the position , and as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the Constitution , he gave a verdict sustaining the right of the citizen to sue the government . Jay said that the American theory , origin , and form of government was a departure from the European idea on just that issue , the precedent right of the citizen over the state . By the American theory , Jay said , the government is the agent of the citizen , having only delegated authority ; and it is absurd to hold that a person may not sue his agent . Subsequently Jay was reversed , though he can not be refuted . But since then the citizen has been at the mercy of government in the United States as if he were the subject of a king ; he can not even plead in court for redress of wrong done him by the government , without permission . And the very first amendment ( Article XI ) after the Bill of Rights extends this usurped prerogative to the several states as against citizens of other states . The next amendment ( XII ) is technical . Sixty-two years elapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment was made , the Thirteenth , which limits the political power by debarring slavery . The Fourteenth Amendment confirmed Federal citizenship and the civil rights of citizens throughout the Union . But it would have been better if the Bill of Rights had been explicitly extended to bind the state governments . This would not have relegated various issues to " implied powers , " a wretched and dangerous subterfuge . The Fifteenth Amendment fatally perpetuated the destruction wrought by the Reconstruction Act . It deprived the states of an indispensable attribute of state sovereignty , the exclusive power to designate the qualifications of voters , orginally reserved to them by the Constitution . The proper use of a necessary power and the proper agency for its use are entirely different questions . Control of the external borders of the nation rightly pertains to the Federal government , the organization representing the full territorial extent . The Federal government has certainly discriminated between races in quotas for entry . Possibly the line drawn is morally wrong ; it may be unjustifiable even to reject refugees . Great nations have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary that the Federal government should have the power of the border ; otherwise the nation can not remain in being . To form a true and workable federation , the component states must cede the attribute of sovereignty of the national border . But they must retain a legitimate control over admission to the state 's body politic , to preserve their political entities . This is the power to admit to the franchise . Race , color , or previous condition of servitude are irrelevant . They ought not to be considered disqualifications . The correct qualifications lie in local residence and allegiance and real property . Only in these requirements can a moral principle be found . If the franchise calls for qualification at all , it is clearly conditional not  | absolute . So far as the conditions are practical , they must relate to the function of the instrument . The action is that of measured extension from a permanent base , so it must be attached to immovable local property . Liquid capital will not do. * These qualifications are moral as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a responsible person can fulfill them by his own choice and efforts . But it is absolutely necessary that the power to designate qualifications should also be in the state . If the Federal government has power to fix or alter any particular , even negatively , it has the ultimate full power of fixing all requirements by particulars . And a defect running through the whole structure is much more grave than a localized error . Interference in this manner is by decomposition . It was forty years before the decomposition of the bases became fully apparent ; but it made the next attack possible , when a national function was nullified , by the income tax amendment . Previously no direct or personal tax could be laid except in proportion to the population . Then the action would be equated in every voter and representative . If a tax were proposed , each would know that he must pay a proportionate share ; while if any region were to receive an extra share in expenditure ( as in river or harbor works , etc. ) , its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mass inertia is the stabilizing function ; it inheres in any ponderable material ; but it is best understood when it is supplied separately , as in ballast . The weight ( gravity ) is the power ; its use is in a constant relation to a center of gravity . When the interest of every voter must be practically the same , the center of gravity was a constant even though the particles of ballast were mobile . But when the Federal government could mulct a wealthy state in taxes disproportionate to the population , Footnote  | to buy out a poor state by expenditures disproportionate to the population , the equation vanished . The mass-inertia veto was lost . ( The weight , the interest , thereafter took effect in unbalance , as uncompartmented liquid ballast surging from side to side , dislocated mass . ) Probably the majority of people had no comprehension of these altered relations . They thought of it in simple terms of taxing the rich , perhaps with a vague infantile further expectation that the proceeds would be " given to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except wages is never given to the poor . If it is taken by an ordinary hold-up man , it goes to the hold-up man . If it is taken by a philanthropic organization , it goes to the organization . If it is taken by the government , it goes to the politicians . Neither does increased taxation of the rich lower the rate of taxation on the poor ; it is bound to cause an increase in all taxation , reaching down inchmeal until it expropriates a portion , not merely of the last dollar of a poor man , but of the first dollar he can earn . The tax will have to be paid before he can even touch his earnings . The present tax on wages , accurately described as " the Social Security swindle , " could not have been imposed under the original Constitution ; it is validated only by the income tax amendment . There is no means by which " the rich " can be taxed without ultimately taxing " the poor " far more heavily . And one tax tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because tax expenditure goes into things which require upkeep and yield no return ( public buildings and political jobs ) . Kinetic energy has been converted into static forms , which then necessitate the diversion of more kinetic energy to carry the dead-load . The final and formal stroke in disestablishing the states was the Seventeenth Amendment , which took the election of Senators out of the State Legislature and gave it to the popular vote . Since then the states have had no connection with the Federal government ; representation in both  | Houses of Congress rests only on dislocated mass . The simultaneous abdication of both Houses in 1933 was the result . They were not thrust apart , they did not even fall apart , because they were no longer in any structural relation whatever , neither to mass nor to each other nor to the superstructure . They had simply ceased to function . The immediate appearance of an enormous bureaucracy was the natural phenomenon of the structureless nation . Concurrently and by interaction with these political events , the productive economy was distorted , and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequence . The looting of the defeated Southern states ( under the direction of philanthropists as usual in collaboration with crooks ) was most demoralizing because the political power pretended to legitimacy in the acts of extortion . Scoundrels were immune within the law , while honest men were forced to revert to the primitive prelegal mode of association ; the chief , informal council and posse comitatus . There was no government , there was only force , the moral control having been disconnected . People lived by the moral order ; they can not survive otherwise ; but the ancient and erroneous identification of government with force became plausible again . Likewise politics became lucrative . Generally speaking , up to the Civil War any man seeking political honors expected to do so at some financial loss to himself ; he lived by his private means . It is only when this condition prevails that men of intelligence , integrity , and good taste ? the productive character ? will be inclined to enter public life . Lord Acton was referring to political power when he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Political power has this effect by its relation to production . The productive man is aware that political expenditure is a charge upon production , net expense . He does not like to live at the expense of others . If he is obliged to forego in his private earnings more than he receives in the remuneration of  | office , though he may not be sure that he has earned his salary , he is at least certain that he did not seek office as a parasite . It is to be observed that today the men who refuse to accept any pay for government positions are without exception those who have been most actively engaged in production , industrial managers . The previous " social workers , " professional politicians , and persons with unearned incomes , are distinguished by the eagerness with which they attach themselves to the political payroll , or turn their political position to incidental gain . They are not aware of any objective in political life except parasitism . The parasitical view of politics was formulated unconsciously when the argument began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public buildings , embassies , and uniforms must be provided to maintain the dignity of office . If a position is rated by its expense or display , obviously it must be deemed wanting in intrinsic dignity or worth . The ambassadors who feared that in ordinary clothes they might be taken for waiters were probably right . No one would have taken Franklin , Adams , or Jefferson for a lackey . It is this derogation of values that the productive man dislikes . Further , he knows he will be constantly importuned for favors he has no right to grant , by the parasites he would never meet in productive life . Hence the best men are found in public life only when it is dangerous , burdensome , and at their own expense . The cost and display of government is always in inverse ratio to the liberty and prosperity of the citizens , as with the impoverished nation and magnificent monarchy of Louis XIV . Today , when our agriculture is in distress , the Department of Agriculture grows like a monstrous fungus . The huge Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dived into the depression . Further , political power has a ratchet action ; it works only one way , to augment itself . A transfer occurs by  | which the power can not be retracted , once it is bestowed . In the lowest illustration of this , a candidate for office may promise the voters that he will reduce taxes , or the number of offices , or the powers of office . But once he is elected , he can use the taxes , the officeholders , or the powers to ensure re-election ; therefore the motive of the promise is no longer operative . By cutting down expenditure or the number of officeholders or graft , he will certainly create enemies , so the reverse motive , impelling him to evade his promise , is doubled . The voter can only vote the incumbent out ; but the next officeholder will come into those augmented powers , and be still harder to get rid of in turn . The difficulty of taking back powers once granted is illustrated in the repeal of the Prohibition Amendment ; although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , the article of repeal contained a proviso which would retain numerous Federal jobs ; it was impossible to make a clean sweep of the pernicious usurped power . The Prohibition Amendment was an assertion of absolute government , the indication of complete decomposition of the body politic . The " lame duck " amendment is a triviality indicating nothing but the degradation of the charter , a scribble on the margin .  | The Corporations and Status Law Concurrently with the specific extension of political power , the production system is disorganized , directly and indirectly . The Civil War had far-reaching consequences in economic life . The " reconstruction " of the South loaded the Southern states with debt contracted by the camp-followers of government by conquest , the carpetbag administration . Repudiation ensued ; whether or not the bonds could have been paid , the Southerners felt no moral obligation , and it is not difficult to understand their position . They may have been in error none the less ; repudiation of debt grounds the transmission line of energy , and the South remained economically prostrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War also prompted the Federal government to finance railroads , by land grants and cash subsidies . With this the era in which business was charged with corrupting politics was well under way . Now business can not corrupt politics . The glib retort would be that corruption can not be corrupted . But political organization is not corruption within its right limits , which are approximately indicated by the margin where the alleged corruption by business begins . It is certainly politics that corrupts business , and must do so to the degree of its over-extension . Business consists of production and exchange . These are spontaneous activities , which must be carried on in freedom . Hence individual private property is requisite for a high energy system ; the owner does not  | have to wait for permission to put it in use . The field of business is primary . Politics consists of the power to prohibit , obstruct , and expropriate . Its field is marginal ; but for this reason it always tends to encroach on the primary field of freedom , in such manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can get to work . Where permission is required , or expropriation possible , a consideration may be extorted . Does the element of corruption inhere in business or in politics ? Is it wrong to produce something or to process or exchange the products ? No . Then it can not impart corruption to anything else . Is it wrong to restrain , obstruct , or seize the goods of another ? Yes . It is always wrong if done by initiating action ( instead of recoil action ) . The potential of corruption then lies in politics , not in business . When politics are notably corrupt , it is an infallible indication that there is too much political power , extending beyond its proper marginal field of action . The political power , both obstructive and expropriative , was so extended in respect of the railroads . To bring in the West , the Federal government made huge land grants and gave a cash subsidy for a transcontinental railway . But for the Civil War , probably the Federal government would not have taken such action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it might have been before a transcontinental line went through , if ever ; but indisputably there would have been some years ' delay . Here is the combination of circumstances and sequence of events which lends plausibility to argument for political action extending into the primary field of economics . Was there not a positive gain , at least in time ? Indeed , how could a transcontinental line have been built at all , through the long stretch of wilderness , without Federal subsidies ? To dispose of the last question first , if the political power had merely permitted anyone who wanted to build a transcontinental line to acquire title to the necessary  | right of way on the same terms as any settlers in virgin territory , whether by purchase or by entry , use and record , a railway would have been built as soon as there was a reasonable prospect of sufficient traffic , or perhaps a little too soon . Still , in the existent circumstances , there was the chronological " gain in time . " Development by private capitalism works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long circuit . The solitary frontier trapper was an advance guard capitalist . He might bring a pack of furs to trade only once a year ; then they went by wagon freight . It might be said that he was a year or more away from the market . On the other hand , a year was his production and exchange time anyhow , more or less ; he could get along for a couple of years if he had to . But if fur prices and freight rates warranted , competitive transport would be attracted , in a year or two . Farming also advanced into the wilderness by private enterprise at a self-adjusting rate , whatever the surplus production would pay for in time and distance ( transport ) . If a group of farmers had " gained " time , in terms of distance , into the wilderness , they would have been that much worse off . Throughout the private economy , the costs and risks are self-evident , and the conditions are open to choice . Errors are self-liquidating . There was a peculiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneering , being unable to go beyond the limits of established political authority , of its own kind . If a slave-owner had compelled his slaves to assist in conveying himself and his goods beyond the scope of the collective power by which he enforced his commands ? which in fact made them slaves ? he would have had no further control over them . He could not have got back nor sent his goods back on the same terms as he came . So it would have been with anyone who used the slaves in like manner by favor of the owner . Travelers in Africa have  | recounted how they were supplied with bearers by command of some native chief , and the bearers carried the burden for a certain distance , and then ignored further orders . Whether the travelers had " gained time " or not can be reckoned only by the time it took them to find some other means of transport to get out of their plight . The peculiar position of the Western farmers becomes apparent when their complaints are examined . Railway freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , over the same distance , that there is no comparison . Railway freight was also ten times speedier . Yet the farmers denounced the railways for their high rates ; and if any delay occurred , it caused intense exasperation . Had it been suggested to a Western farmer that if he thought such charges excessive , he should use some competitive line or method of transport , he would have been indignant . There was none , nor could he wait until competition arrived . The time and distance which seemed to have been " gained " was simply the measure of his distance in time from competition ; which means , from the market . The political power had intervened , and such was its necessary effect . The Western farmers , who willingly took what appeared to be the advantage of it , in so doing had surrendered their power of choice for an indefinite future period . The intervention of the political power had created a monopoly . And even its supposed beneficiaries found it odious . Curiously , people made the correct distinction emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a marked ambivalence in the feeling toward the railways . The sight and sound of a locomotive is still evocative to Americans of wonder , romance , and hopeful anticipation . In rural districts and small towns , everyone liked to go on a train journey . People went down to the station to see the train come in . They knew the expresses by number , listened to the whistle as a friendly sound , waved  | as the trains went by . They hated " the railway " only as an abstraction. * What was it then that they hated ? Certainly they did not wish to abolish railways , never see one again . The distinction emerges clearly . Everything that was the creation of private enterprise in the railways gave satisfaction . Private enterprise mined , smelted , and forged the iron , invented the steam engine , devised surveying instruments , produced and accumulated the capital , organized the effort . In the building and operation of the railways , whatever lay in the realm of private enterprise was done with competence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one undertaking . It went through with the unprecedented speed of the high potential long circuit of energy to which it belonged . The same genius for organization of high energy systems went into the operation of the lines . No previous type of business called for one-tenth the ability of this type ; schedules had to be exact , continuous , and yet instantly adjustable in every detail , over time and space , handling unpredictable numbers of persons or units of goods in transit between thousands of intermediate points in a branching system , both ways , at maximum velocity . Probably the railways still represent the peak of efficiency in operating management , because no greater demand has yet been made by any other Footnote  | business . And , on the whole , the public respected this achievement . What people hated was the monopoly . The monopoly , and nothing else , was the political contribution . Even in its proper application , the political power tends to cause irritation ; much more so when it is unwarranted . Life protests instantly against compulsion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cloud of sheer hatred , vindictive despair , which obscures the civilized world at present , is evoked by the omnipresence of political agencies . The Gestapo and Ogpu or Cheka are the slimy spawn of the Absolute State . The direct consequence of the encroachment of political power on the primary field of free enterprise , in respect of the railways , was that new states were admitted to the Union before they had time to develop true regional interests and political entities . In one instance at least , a state was designated solely to secure a political majority in the nation . Being in effect creations of the Federal government rather than of the citizens of the state , the newer states tended to look to the Federal government for special legislation , including charity . The indirect consequence was quite as bad . Obviously , if public funds have been granted to endow anything whatever , on the pretext that it is for the benefit of the citizens at large , every citizen must have the right to use the resultant facilities on equal terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he might even be ruined financially in his private fortune by being unable to compete with the government-endowed corporation ; but he is n't asked about that . ) Then the government must have authority to enforce such equality . ( It has already destroyed the natural power of the individual to bring the corporation to terms by competition . ) " Government regulation " is imposed . To be sure , it wo n't do the citizen any good ; the result is that the railways are not allowed to make desir-  | able improvements or discontinue wasteful expenditure. * But the power is there , and is bound to be used . ( It does no good simply because the " mixed economy " leaves no basis of equity there is no ethical reason why anyone should be entitled to a ten dollar subsidy from the public funds , any more than to a million dollars . ) Successful management and productive enterprise had always been admired and respected , as they should be ; presently they became liable to suspicion and resentment . The change of sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business may be named , after the railroads , as having incurred this obloquy , it was the Standard Oil Company . Yet , like the railways , Standard Oil by its ordinary business operations steadily increased the comfort and convenience of existence in America ? from oil lamps to gas stations . It has been managed with amazing competence ; it has met every financial obligation unfailingly through hard times and kept solvent its products have been excellent and reliable . It might be cited as a model corporation ? if it had not used the political power , at one remove , by taking rebates on railway freight rates . The charge of ruining competitors would have had no point but for the means employed , which were deemed unfair , as they certainly are . If one department store prospers and another fails , the public rightly realizes that better judgment has been used in locating or managing the successful store , and that there is no sound reason why they should subsidize bad judgment . They know that capable competition does not tend to extinguish competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what people want . But the individual taxpayer had no choice about giving rebates on a tax-subsidized " public Footnote  | utility . " Standard Oil had used the political means ; it became an object of execration . Demonstrably there was no other cause of offense , since the people who denounced it still purchased its products willingly . They approved Standard Oil as a business ; they were enraged by its political connection . Now the sole remedy for the abuse of political power is to limit it ; but when politics corrupt business , modern reformers invariably demand the enlargement of the political power . There was a time when people had either more sense or more honesty ; but perhaps it was only that the issue could not be mistaken , as it then appeared . The corporate form obscured the transaction . In an earlier day , monopolies were granted by kings to their favorites . It was evident that a law aimed at individuals would be absurd ; the effective course was to prohibit the political power from granting monopolies . But the proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were mere folly , it would leave things no worse than they were ; but it contains another element ? it reintroduces status law . This was done by diverting attention from the cause to the effect , and finally legislating against the natural process which had been injuriously affected ? a triple perversion . As freak legislation , the anti-trust laws stand alone . Nobody knows what it is they forbid . Their professed object is to prevent or dissolve ( with penalties ) " combinations in restraint of trade . " What is a combination in restraint of trade ? The railroads could not be charged with that imaginary crime unless two or more railway corporations combined ; but their monopolies existed anyhow , and they never restrained trade anyhow . They took all the traffic they could get , and did a good deal to create traffic , by drumming up immigration . Standard Oil did not restrain trade ; it went out to the  | ends of the earth to make a market . Can the corporations be said to have " restrained trade " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they produced and sold the goods ? Were the motor car manufacturers restraining trade during the period in which they made and sold fifty million cars , where there had been no cars before ? Or did the railways restrain the motor car industry ? They had no means of doing so ; what they really did was to bring the raw materials to the motor car manufacturer , and then transport the finished cars everywhere for sale . If two corporations do combine , and carry on all the business both of them previously handled , enlarging it if possible , are they restraining trade ? The accusation has been brought against the corporations that they do n't produce more than they have a reasonable expectation of being able to sell by strenuous efforts . This is " limiting " and therefore " restraining " trade . But , in the first place , any one season 's production is intrinsically limited by the capital available , as well as the prospective market ; and , in the second place , if they stretched that limit to its utmost one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net profit , they would not be able to produce anything next year . They would be bankrupt . They ca n't even eat up their capital by degrees , so much a year . Generally , their paid-up capital is in plant and equipment ; while materials in process of manufacture , or in stock , represent credit ( bank loans or bills payable ) . Even if a manufacturer were to operate strictly on his own capital , owing nobody and with money in the bank , his stock is liquid capital ; and would be depleted the second year . As for borrowed capital , credit , if interest is not paid and bills for materials met , the loans must be called and no more material will be delivered ; then the whole business stops at once ; not by successive percentages ; and the plant is rendered non-productive . If the management should disregard these imperatives , they would be eligible for Mat-  | teawan . It is difficult to believe that anyone could make such a suggestion in good faith . Then what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprised a triple contradiction . They were variously accused of charging too much , of underselling competitors , and of price-fixing ( agreeing on prices with competitors ) . Exactly how much , in comparison with what , is " too much ? " Is it too much if the owner asks more than somebody is willing or able to pay ? Then the great majority of us ought to have a legal case against Tiffany 's . Is it asking more than someone else asks for the same kind of goods ? Then that other person is guilty of " underselling " ; both should be haled into court . But if they agreed to set the same price , they would be criminals as pricefixers . Nor would it be an innocent course for them to sell nothing more and starve to death peacefully ; they would certainly be " limiting the market " if they held their goods or did not go on producing . Altogether , the only acts which could be alleged against the corporations in their business transactions are simply the necessary acts of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint arrowhead and swapped it for a clamshell ornament was guilty of the same crime  --  except that one charge of " combining " two or more corporations . Now it would have been quite possible to pass a specific law to prevent such mergers ; all that was necessary was to limit their charters , and forbid one corporation to buy another , or any shares in it . Such a law might have been either senseless or somewhat harmful ; it would certainly have been in restraint of trade , but the political power is restrictive ; and the law would have been specific in naming the act proscribed . That was the one thing the legislators would not do . Least of all would they admit or name the real offense ? the use of political power . Their object was to secure control of the corporations . It was attained by using a  | phrase which could be construed as covering any business transaction whatever , if a corporation were concerned in it ; with the implication that such acts were to be deemed crimes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those effects could in no case be shown or proved . Take any such case , real or imaginary , and let the question be asked : Exactly where , when , and how was trade restrained ? Was the volume of trade diminished ? Was any person actually restrained from offering an article for sale , or buying an article offered if he chose to do so ? What article ? And what person ? When an individual is indicted for embezzlement , theft , or the like offense , the money or goods involved must have actual existence , and the owner must be named ; with the burden of proof on the prosecution , the accused needing only to refute the evidence presented , if he is innocent . If a person were simply charged with " dishonesty , " or " immorality , " and required to account for his whole life , to bring all his correspondence into court on demand , and prove a general negative , he would be subject to the same kind of law as the anti-trust laws . Individuals were subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Status . Its modern name is Administrative Law . During the nineteenth century , it survived only in Russia , under the Czars ( and was there called administrative law ; travelers from free nations heard of it with astonishment and indignation ) . It is still the law in Communist Russia , but it is no longer confined to Russia . Surely , if an earnest endeavor had been made to decide upon the most imbecile accusation possible against anyone ? such as arresting a rabbit for practicing birth control , or a Marathon champion in the middle of the race for loitering , or Brigham Young for celibacy ? nothing more preposterous could have been imagined than to fix upon the American corporations , which have created and carried on , in ever-increasing magnitude , a volume and variety of trade so vast that it makes all previous pro-  | duction and exchange look like a rural roadside stand , and call this performance " restraint of trade , " further stigmatizing it as a crime ! Another aspect of the imposition of political " regulation " on economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , an economic power which also influenced politics . This is likewise imputed to large private fortunes , as an excuse for heavy death-duties . As a matter of fact , the danger inherent in large fortunes is their weakness against political power . But if it were proved that the corporations did have and exercise such undue power culpably , and a serious proposal made to remedy this condition by handing over the government to the corporation management , would it not be manifestly a lunatic scheme ? Yet that is the net effect of government regulation , beyond the enforcement of contract law as it applies to any commercial transaction between private persons . The political and economic powers are merged , brought under a single control . Thereafter it is immaterial which group of persons exercises the joined powers ( though the politicians will inevitably get the upper hand ) ; the sum of power will be the same . Whether three is added to two , or two to three , the result is five . " Totalitarian government " is nothing but political control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senseless phrase , " production for use and not for profit " ? as if there could be any profit if the product were not used ; did Standard Oil pour its products down the sink ? or did the management of General Motors wear their product on their watch chain ? ? are all approaches to political control and absolute tyranny . Competition can not be eradicated ; in productive or creative effort it is beneficial . If it is penalized in such desirable manifestations , it finds mean and futile expression . At royal courts , where status is rigidly defined , and there is no productive field , trifles become objects of competition ; courtiers will stand on their feet all day so that sitting down may become a  | privilege ; princes will squabble ignominiously over the distinction of walking first through a door . A man who makes a better car than another , or makes it at less cost , is competing usefully ; even a man who wants to make more money than his neighbor , in a free society , will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only in the political field that competition is for power over other men , even to slaughter more of them in war . Individualism alone gives legitimate and creative play to the competitive instinct to increase and improve production . Government can not " restore competition , " or " ensure " it . Government is monopoly ; and all it can do is to impose restrictions which may issue in monopoly , when they go so far as to require permission for the individual to engage in production . This is the essence of the Society of Status . The reversion to status law in the anti-trust legislation went unnoticed . Probably the politicians did not know exactly what they had done ; but they knew what they wanted . They had secured a law under which is was impossible for the citizen to know beforehand what constituted a crime , and which therefore made all productive effort liable to prosecution if not to certain conviction . Because it was imposed at first through corporations , its actual incidence was not realized . Whoever said that " a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be damned " had a glimpse of the truth , which is that any law whatever must bear upon persons . The acts of a corportion are necessarily performed by persons ; the assets of a corporation belong to persons ; the punishment must fall upon persons . And if such acts are liable to penalty , the law can and will shortly extend to include strictly individual effort in its scope . It is in that extension that the naked purpose becomes apparent . The full import of any extension of the political power consists in the field of action which it covers , not in  | the particular act first forbidden . I.e. , if government is morally competent to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor , it must have power to prescribe every item of diet to citizens . After centuries of freedom , such an assertion will seem vaguely absurd ; but it was put in practice in Sparta . The field of action which the anti-trust laws invaded was that of production and exchange ; the first crime alleged was " restraint of trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was applied to individuals , the charge was " over-production ! " Once again , it is deemed a crime to work , a crime to produce . It is even a crime to give away food grown by the donor on his own land , by his own labor . It is not yet a specific crime for a man to eat the food he has grown ? as it is in Russia ? but that is the inevitable next step . Already the primary right of human beings to mere existence has been denied ; since farm quotas , priorities , and ration cards cover all the processes of production and exchange , by which existence is supported , life is made to depend upon daily and hourly permission . In the famous Dred Scott case , which men understood correctly as defining the issues on which the Civil War was precipitated , the decision rested upon a stated axiom ; and the axiom repudiated the Declaration of Independence . Technically , it was found that the Court had no jurisdiction ; and the reason given was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even by birth nor though his parents were not in formal bondage . He might indeed be allowed to reside in the country , and to hold property , but only by favor , not of right . If he were not a citizen , he must be liable to deportation . Yet having been born in the United States , he had no other country , no place to which he could claim admittance . Then he could nowhere enjoy the first benefit of property , which is standing ground . There was no place on earth where he had a right to be ; which is to say , he had no right to be , if that decision contained the truth .  | In Dred Scott 's case , his material condition was deduced from a primary assumption , a denial of the birthright of a human being . By the opposite approach , when the acquisition , possession or use of every material object is made permissive , then every productive action of which a man is capable can be performed only by permission . As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary assumption is implicit ; he has been reduced to the nameless plight of Dred Scott . If he has no right to act , to produce , to exchange , he has no right to be . So the ruling upon Dred Scott has been pronounced upon all humanity , by the denial of every attribute of birthright . Men are presumed to exist only by permission . At long last , the persistent purpose of the nonproducers has been attained , with no reservations , no limitations ; and most extraordinarily , with no other claim than that of their own incompetence . They have got a strangle hold on the producers .  | The Fiction of Public Ownership As language is the faculty which distinguishes man from the lower animals , it is also a ready index to the intellectual level of cultures and persons . The confusion and vagueness of terms always found in collectivist theories is not accidental ; it is a reversion to the mental and verbal limitations of the primitive society it advocates , the inability to think in abstract terms . This defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Property is ownership . Things which nobody owns are not property ; they are merely objects in nature . Perhaps the most senseless phrase ever coined even by a collectivist is that of Proudhon : " All property is theft . " It is indeed remarkable in its own way , for the variety of errors compressed into such brief utterance ; in four words it confuses objects , acts , attributes , moral values , and relations , as if they were interchangeable . Theft presupposes rightful ownership . An object must be property before it can be stolen . Savages and collectivists are notably ignorant of the severely logical branch of language , which is mathematics . The savage does not go beyond simple addition and subtraction of digits . The collectivist may learn formulas by rote , but can not grasp the principle of their application to physical phenomena . He will reckon upon processes and results which could be obtained only from a factor he has theoretically excluded from the problem he is proposing to solve . The problem is to define the  | conditions necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical reality ; nothing may be assumed to exist in physical reality which does not so exist ; nor may any aspect of physical phenomena be excluded which will inevitably enter into the conditions in reality . But when the collectivist rejects private property from his theoretic economy , he excludes those aspects of material phenomena which mathematics recognizes by the third dimension . " The three dimensions of a body , or of ordinary space , are length , breadth and thickness ; a surface has only two dimensions ; a line only one . " With the third dimension , cubic measure is possible ; and the construction becomes capable of solid content . It would never have been possible to conceive of measure abstractly without the previous reality and concept of a unit of measure . The unit of measure of physical energy is established from solids , in terms of time , space , and mass resistance or displacement ( gravity ) . Real physical energy can not exist except in a three dimensional world , nor without its real existence could it have been conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . This is the reason why private property belongs to man as a creative being ( a right both natural and divine ) . Individual ownership answers exactly to the conditions of physical phenomena .. Public ownership is fictitious ; its verbal terms do not correspond to reality , to the properties of physical objects and the conditions of time and space . A number of persons may reside in the same house , but only by allotment of objects in space and time to each , either specifically or by precedence . Nobody could live in a house if the general public were assumed to have the right to go in and out , to sit in the chairs , sleep in the beds , cook in the kitchen . Ten men may be legally equal owners of one field , but none of them can get any good of it unless its occupancy and use are allotted among them by measures of time and space . No agreement can obviate  | this necessity . If all ten wished to do exactly the same thing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be physically impossible , whether they agreed or not . Private group ownership necessarily resolves into management by one person , with division of the product , and ultimate recourse to division of the actual property , in case of irreconcilable disagreement . Theoretically , public property belongs to everybody equally , indivisibly , and simultaneously , which is absurd ; if this assumption were applied , the result would be that any person presenting himself to use the property could be asked : " Are you everybody ? " and he would be bound to reply : " No " ; while he could not assert any claim to use any particular division of the property . The actual use of public property by the public is therefore limited to approximately two dimensional conditions , in which cubic measure , or solids , need not be taken into account , so that a man is regarded as a point in a line which is divisible into an infinite number of points ; and with any number of lines intersecting without interference , on a plane surface . Thus it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to make roads public property , because the use of a road is to traverse it . Though the user does in fact occupy a given space at a given moment , the duration is negligible , so that there is no need to take time and space into account except by negation , a prohibition : the passenger is not allowed to remain as of right indefinitely on any one spot in the road . The same rule applies to parks and public buildings . The arrangement is sufficiently practicable in those conditions to admit the fiction of " public ownership . " To be sure , even in the use of a road , if too many members of the public try to move along it at once , the rule reverts to first come , first served ( allotment in time and space ) , or the authorities may close the road . The public has not the essential property right of continuous and final occupancy . " Public property " which is used for other purposes  | than transit is not available to the public at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open to the public for transit part of the time ; but the conditions were pointedly expressed when two children wandered into the building without permission and intruded into the forbidden space . The wife of the Chief Executive deemed it advisable to print a warning that such conduct was unsafe ; the children might have been shot by a guard . " Public domain " which is leased for revenue is used by the lessees as private persons ; and the rent is not distributed to members of the public ; it is used by officials . Whatever " public " property admits of tenure in occupancy , or bears usufruct , officials occupy it or consume the usufruct , while the public pays the upkeep . " Public utilities " are not available to the public as owners . Any citizen who wishes to obtain electricity from a municipal plant must pay out of his private resources for the measured quantity of electricity he gets . He is not the owner ; an owner does not have to buy the product of his own property . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity is nevertheless charged indirectly with a fraction of the upkeep in taxes , through he can not exercise any property rights whatever in the plant . He ca n't even go into the premises of right , which is the first prerogative of an owner . Public property then admits of use by the public only in transit , not for production , exchange , consumption , or for security as standing ground . Where all property is " public , " under Communism , government ownership , the officials appropriate to their personal use whatever they like , with funds for upkeep ; while the public exists perpetually in the condition of passengers on a road , having no right to remain in any one spot or to use any object ; all the activities of members of the public must be by permission or compulsion . It is impossible to imagine any practical method by which the use or the product of any kind of productive  | property whatever can be made available to " the public " as such . Though anyone who comes along may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not possible to devise any means by which anyone who comes along can help himself to electricity , or for the matter of that to potatoes , as a member of the public , " according to his needs . " The phrase has no application to reality in a productive society . It is an idea limited to the conditions of wild nature , in which primitive man lives on whatever he can catch or pick up in the way of game , berries , fish , or insects. * The collectivist is incapable of understanding this because his concept of the " collective " has no dimensions . The society founded on private property is organized for a man of three dimensions , occupying a space of his own in a world of three dimensions , through which energy flows in action and is put to use for production . The collectivist society is " planned " for a world of two dimensions , in which nothing is conceived as occupying space or causing displacement . Man is conceived to be everywhere at once and nowhere in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world and a society in which there is no energy , neither kinetic nor static . But since in reality every object must occupy three dimensional space , and moving objects do cause displacement , whenever communists seize the political power to try their alleged experiment , Communism is always said to be still in the future , never in the present . The present is described as " a period of transition . " The commonsense of colloquial speech recognizes the facts , with the advent of collectivism , when people complain that they are being " pushed around . " Perhaps the collectivist has a dim notion of his logical Footnote  | difficulty with the no-dimensional collective ; for all collectivist theories begin with the assumption of a productive machinery and system taken over from the society of private property and personal enterprise . Collectivists must feel , though they do not acknowledge it , that their hypothetical society is non-productive , for production creates its own means of production . To obscure this difficulty , they lay stress on distribution and consumption as the crux of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method which approximates to their promise ; they can only offer a paper copy of the forms of distribution devised by the society of private property , while eliminating the moral and physical relations which made those forms workable . That is , they must use quantitative measure for goods , and of time for labor ( measures unnecessary to the savage living on the bounty of nature ) ; and a medium of exchange . But they deny the right of the owner and producer to his property and product . In so doing , they necessarily deny the right of a man to his own labor , which is to say , to his own person . All collective societies demand forced labor . With this there can be no true exchange , but only expropriation and doles . Collectivists use the word " right " but never in any context which corresponds with reality , and is capable of specific application . By the Marxist theory , of course they ought not to use the word " right " at all , for Dialectical Materialism is deterministic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech is communication , but Marxists use words with the intent of causing confusion ; yet they assume that a productive society , which depends primarily on exact communication , can be organized after they have destroyed that means . In this they revert below savagery , and even below the animal level . They have got down to the premise of mere mechanism . Cogs in a machine need no language . Thus collectivists talk of civil rights in a collective  | society , where in fact civil rights can not exist because there is no place in which they can be exercised and no materials on which they can take effect . How can a man speak freely if there is no spot on which he and his audience have the right to stand ? How can he practice his religion if he has no right to own a religious edifice , or to his own person ? How is a free press to exist if the materials are not in private ownership ? With state ownership , nothing can be done except by command or permission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not free . Collectivists talk frequently of " the right to work . " What does that connote in terms of physical reality ? In a free society , any man has by nature the right to work . No one may force him to work ; nor may anyone stop him from working on his own property or in contract with another . But if he has no property , or not enough to yield him a livelihood , he must seek employment from others . It is never within the worker 's power to exact his own terms in full , any more than he can find in nature everything as he would have it ; but since the employer must need to hire labor ( else he would not be at the trouble ) , there is a basis for bargaining and agreement . If neither is willing to meet the other 's terms or to compromise , each may look elsewhere , to another possible employer or workman . But it is said that the workman without property ( land ) is in more urgent need than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold out a length of time for his terms , as the employer can . ( It is not conceded in theory that employers go broke , though they certainly do in fact ; it is rather assumed that they can sit tight forever if they choose . ) Therefore , because land exists in nature and all the raw materials of production are of natural origin , it is said that if a man can not demand and receive employment at a living wage as of right , his natural right to work has been denied . But is there any imaginable production economy in  | which the contingency of unemployment will not occur with much harsher terms attached to it ? Certainly in a savage nomadic society , the raw resources of nature are directly available to every man ( as to the lower animals ) , " according to his abilities . " But the moment he begins to utilize those resources in any manner beyond the abilities of the lower animals , by making weapons or tools , private property in such objects is necessarily established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools from the resources of nature . Likewise , when land is brought under crude cultivation , marginal to a hunting economy ? as some North American Indians grew corn at their summer camps ? there need be no exact boundaries ; and presumably any person might make his own tools and scratch a fresh plot of ground . But natural causes bring about recurrent famine . The hunter has the right to hunt , but he finds no game . Animals may devour the corn ; there is no fence . Buildings are not tight nor durable ; there is no way of storing food . Then everybody starves , and that is that . With permanent settlements , permanent landholdings are recognized , in regular cultivation . The higher the form of production , the more necessary it is to fix ownership , and ownership may take various forms , by persons or local groups or families or other allotments , possibly subject to reapportionment . The two extremes of property title are government ownership and individual private property . The question is , by which system does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man must be born or formally admitted as a member of the group , else he has no property right . If he has , he may in certain circumstances be bound to the soil . Such was the feudal system . It was a three dimensional concept ; a man had a place , a right to work on a specific portion of land . But he was subject to forced labor so many days a year ; he had no right to change his employment ; and he had little chance of increasing his  | production , by improvement of tools . His natural rights were severely restricted ; he lost mobility and choice . The presumed compensation was stability , with a local energy circuit of production . But he still suffered recurrent famine , as in a state of nature . The feudal system could not form the long circuit of energy . A runaway from one feudal group could find no place in another ; he had to seek the contract society . Many did , a proof of which system they found preferable ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man has a natural right to own property . He may inherit it or earn the price and purchase it . Such acquisition is reasonably possible for any able-bodied and competent person , in a natural lifetime , by labor and thrift . When he has got it , it is his own , with the usufruct . He can try out his own ideas , to improve or increase production , build on it for income , or otherwise please himself . He can accumulate provision for his old age or against vicissitudes of any kind . Further , in the contract society , if he has special abilities in management , or creative ideas , he can obtain capital on credit , with no guarantee on his part except honesty of conduct , and repayment if the project succeeds , the owner of the capital taking the financial risk of failure , while the borrower has a chance of considerable gain , and of knowing that he has earned it fairly by increasing production . These are the advantages peculiar to individual private property . Then let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated with the utmost rigor , at its possible worst . Many persons may have inherited no property , nor yet have had time to accumulate any from their earnings before encountering hard times . True that some might have had the chance , and neglected it ; but it is never true that all the unemployed had that previous chance . Some are young ; others worked productively but met with sickness or loss . And even the imprudent can-  | not be deemed to have forfeited their natural rights . That opportunity may recur in the future does not soften the immediate pangs of want . Part of the lifetime of such persons will be a period of hardship , which may seem rather worse because others are more fortunate by no effort on their part . But is it true that the unemployed are in this condition because they are denied access to the land ? In Europe , during modern times , practically all the usable land was owned . There was no wild land to which an unemployed man could have " access " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use it rent free . But in the United States , there was never a day , in " hard times , " when the unemployed could not have had " access " to wild land , or even to owned land which the owner would have let them use for production . Yet in hard times men did not go into the wilderness . The statement that the land frontier took up the slack of unemployment during industrial depressions is a wholecloth falsehood . On the contrary , the frontier was settled from the capitalist production overflow of good times . During hard times men withdrew from the frontier , even abandoning homesteads , and turned back toward the areas of more advanced development , the towns and industrial regions . They looked for wage jobs . So it is said that the unemployed are denied " access to the means of production , " which includes the land . But the means of production of an industrial economy are not to be . found ready made in nature . The man who wants employment then requires something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tools , accumulated capital , and organization of a high productive economy , to apply to the resources of nature . But this definition still does not cover the whole difficulty . The owners of industrial property occasionally run at a loss , to keep up their plant and business connections for the future . In the United States , during times of  | stress , many employers would certainly be glad if they could run in full employment for the time being at the bare cost of materials , maintenance , and wages of labor and management . Dividends can wait , and often are deferred . But if an idle plant , including even a stock of raw materials , were handed over to unemployed workers , thus giving them free " access to the means of production , " the workers would be unable to get continued production out of it , to pay for their labor , because that depends on continued exchange at a profit ; they could only use up the stock and stop work . Then the unemployed man in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suffering no greater hazard or privation than he would in a state of nature . He is free to quest for what he needs , but it is scarce for the time being , hard to find . Would he be willing to return to a state of nature as preferable ? No . His refusal is rational . The hazard has in fact been greatly reduced ; for the United States , the one great free economy the world has ever developed , has never known famine , although the Indians in the same territory were subject to it . There is no loss , but net gain . The hardship of the unemployed man is not that he has been denied his natural rights , but that for the time being he is not provided with something he did not have in nature . But what he lacks can not be defined merely as access to the land or to the means of production ; it is an immediate connection on the long circuit of energy . The gravamen of the collectivist complaint is that in hard times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and men in want of work and goods . Though the goods are in fact rapidly distributed , at a loss to the owners if need be , and productive employment resumed , this is not deemed to constitute an optimum for a working system , allowing for possibilities of improvement in its specific operation to get better results along the same main line . Then the real accusation against  | private capitalism must be that it does slow down occasionally ; breaks and stoppages occur along the line . It does not function with absolute , unvarying , mathematical regularity to supply everybody 's wants continuously and unfailingly and without exception , regardless of the infinite risks of human fallibility , moral and intellectual . The collectivist promises an organization that will never break down even temporarily . He insists that he has the plan of the perfect , " automatic " machine . On its own terms , this theory is insane . If reduced to specifications , it must be like the wonderful One-Ross Shay , in which every material , part , and detail was exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part could break down . The imaginary One-Ross Shay did wear out , but all at once , completely , in utter disintegration . The collectivist absolute government is expected to " wither away " and disappear in the same manner ; but although the government is the only specific form the collectivist has in view , he insists that on its dissolution there will be some other kind of organization to take its place automatically , he ca n't say exactly what ? the proposal trails off into incoherencies and mutterings of revelations to be made later . There is just one more alleged objection advanced by the collectivist , his final argument , against private property . It is said that after a given stage of capitalistic development there will necessarily and always be more men seeking employment than there will be jobs ; therefore the workman will have no real power to bargain and get a fair wage , but must take whatever the employer offers . This is a variant by reversal of the Malthusian theory . Malthus thought there was a " law " by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers must be forever " pressing against subsistence " ( as animals might in nature ) ? nothing but immediate limitation of population could remedy the evil . Theoretically , of course , the world could be overpopulated ,  | beyond what its natural resources could support ; but Malthus was arguing particularly about the problem of poverty with a going productive system in a world which still had plenty of unoccupied space . Now his supposed law does operate in a collectivist economy , because that economy will not admit improvement in the means of production ; hence collectivist societies have legitimized infanticide in the past . Although Malthus lived during the period when industrial production was getting under way , he seems to have fallen into an arithmetical catch , like the fallacy of Achilles and the tortoise ; or else he thought production had already reached or almost reached its highest capacity , and could be so figured . Anyhow , the collectivists were forced to admit that production had refuted Malthus , increasing prodigiously , year by year . Then they had to say that the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a job pretty soon ! This theory has evoked the phrase " technological unemployment , " which is said to be caused by mechanical improvements in the means of production . That is , if a machine is invented by which one man can do the work previously done by ten men , it must put nine men permanently out of employment . It sounds plausible , but is it true ? Malthus imagined a fixed limit of productive capacity per person , an arbitrary quantity . ( He must have had that in view , for there certainly is a limit to the number of children any adult can bring into the world . ) The collectivist , with the theory of " technological unemployment , " assumes a fixed number of jobs , another arbitrary quantity . In the feudal system there was such a fixed number of jobs , established by allotments of land in a given area , and ratified by the feudal lord and the community . This condition did not have to be stated in theory , it was factual and inevitable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into theorizing on free enterprise , in which it has no meaning . In feudalism , the  | specific limitation on the number of jobs might stretch or shrink a little , but it was fairly constant . No such rule can be applied or even imagined as applicable to a private capital free enterprise system , if the facts are examined . In the free economy , there can be no fixed number of jobs , not for one minute . Employment , production , and consumption in a free enterprise society can not be figured on the same ratios or relations as are assumed by collectivists ( which have in fact obtained in collectivist societies ) . The ancient collectivist societies assumed that a given number of persons could produce a given quantity of goods ; which could then of course be divided pro rata . ( What it always came down to in practice was bare subsistence . ) Then if all the available land or materials were in production , the maximum number of jobs were filled ; somebody would have to be put out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra quantity were produced , on total reckoning , for the given quantity of labor , it would diminish to that extent the demand ( necessity ) for labor . Theoretically , it would put somebody out of employment . This reckoning is really made on a strict subsistence basis , in which " consumption " is just what people eat and wear . But in a free enterprise economy , increased production increases the number of jobs . It might be said that one job creates another , which is true as far as it goes , but open to misinterpretation ; for only productive employment does that . If a man were paid to pick up pebbles on the beach and throw them into the ocean , it would be just the same as if he were in a " government job , " or on the dole ; the producers have to supply his subsistence with no return , thus preventing the normal increase of jobs . Putting the unemployed on the dole does not increase " purchasing power . " The dole divides up whatever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ se , is  | exchange . Increasing production does increase " purchasing power , " and therefore creates jobs . Are there fewer men employed in the great steel industry than there were in hand forging ? or in rail and motor transport than in wagon and pack transport ? or in the building trades with steamshovels , concrete mixers , and so forth , than in handicraft building ? No . The real result is not only that people have more tools , larger houses , and travel more , which must tend to maintain employment ? they also want and have things they never had before . Motor cars need tires , roads , gasoline ; houses are equipped with new conveniences ; when people travel they want hotels , amusements , more clothes ? all of which means the creation of more jobs , new jobs . Nothing increases the number of jobs so rapidly as labor-saving machinery , because it releases wants theretofore unknown , by permitting leisure . In a pre-industrial economy , jobs are made by simple division of labor ; acquired skill and organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people literally have not enough surplus energy to want much . What does any person who is thoroughly fatigued want ? The answer is just nothing . And if he works very long hours , he has no time either , to use what he might conceivably want . By conserving human bodily energy , multiplying the production from a given expenditure of muscular strength , the free economy enables men to want things which are unimaginable in a state of nature . Here is a strange exemption of human organization from the general implications of the Second Law of Thermodynamics . Physical energy manifested through inanimate mechanism ? gasoline introduced into a motor car , electricity in a vacuum cleaner ? does not cause that mechanism to want , or require , either more or less than a given quantity , known beforehand , which it can accommodate , of which a fixed percentage will be " lost " in transmission , and the rest will go through to perform a meas-  | ured task . A man can absorb only a limited quantity of physical energy in food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incalculably for other things : and he himself is capable of creating devices to augment his energy and then to put it in use for his novel purposes . His circuit is intrinsically different from any specific circuit composed wholly of inanimate materials . Strictly quantitative mechanical calculations , by ratio or number , can not be applied beforehand to human free productive organization as a whole . The free enterprise system starts correctly with a concept , corresponding to reality , of a three dimensional man in a three dimensional world , having free will , the moral capacity for contract ; therefore it predicates individual private property , by which he may secure his own place , from which point his relations in time and space are left to agreement and self-adjustment . The economic sphere is reserved from the static political clutch , because it is understood that the quantity of production and changes of position are not calculable in advance . The collectivist theory starts with a no-dimensional man in a no-dimensional collective and a two-dimensional world , excluding private property , yet it assumes threedimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elucidate the innumerable contradictions implicit in this muddle . The collectivist does n't even try to work out a practical system of his own , consonant to his theories ; he merely goes back to barbarism for distribution by edict , while at the same time he says he will use the productive machinery of free enterprise , which in fact can operate only by the inductive pull of distribution by free exchange . In arguing against free enterprise capitalism , the collectivist always adopts the false assumption of a fixed number of jobs in that system . Conversely , in arguing for collectivism , he always assumes that there will be as  | many jobs as there are workers . The government will make the jobs . The one definite and unequivocal stipulation of the collectivist is that all property shall be in government ownership for the collective . In that case , everyone must ask for work from the government ; and no one can have any resources which would enable him to make better terms by waiting . Neither is there any other employer to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spontaneously created by the productive system . The person who wants to work is hired directly by the person who wants work done , each being free to seek the other ; each is interested personally in the benefit . ( If it is said that a contractor hires men to do some work someone else wants done , it is still a fact that the contractor also wants the work done , for his own benefit . ) Every want operates directly to stimulate a supply ; every supply is a stimulus to discover a want . ( Supply creates demand as much as demand brings out supply . ) Throughout the longest series of exchanges , every person has a direct interest in getting the goods through , or producing them ; so that the general sequence creates the long circuit of energy , by an unbroken transmission . The collectivist 's theory of inevitable " class conflict " in the free economy rests on the economic fallacy of the " wages fund . " It assumes a fixed quantity to be divided between " labor " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more except at the expense of the other ; therefore their interests must be diametrically opposed and antagonistic . Certainly individuals must always have their separate interests ; but in the free economy , there is nothing to divide until " capital and labor " have come to an agreement , hence their separate interests draw them together . And increased production can increase both shares , not one at the expense of the other . Where the government is the sole employer , someone  | may certainly want to work , or want work done , or want a certain product ; but he is never in direct exchange with any other person who has a like interest in the transaction . The man who wants work must ask the government for some kind of a job and for a portion of the alleged " general " production . Thus between what he offers and what he wants an agency intervenes which has no interest in the transaction . The immediate incentive is really the other way ; officials wo n't want to be bothered by taking on more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the government distributes the product . It is of no interest to the persons employed in distribution whether the quality is good or not , nor whether the stuff is handled for the convenience of either the producer or the consumer ; because neither the producer nor the consumer has the power to decide which distributor he will patronize , or how much he will pay for an article . He must go to whatever depot his ticket indicates , and take whatever there is , on the fixed terms ; or do without ; while the persons employed in distribution will wish to handlle less rather than greater quantities . The officials will get theirs first and best . Yet all these persons must ask the government for employment all their lives . It is idle to demand it as a right , for they have not the least power to enforce such a demand . They can not accumulate materials and land by which to make themselves independent ; and certainly they can not pick up any tools offhand and go to work upon the first material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for everything , day by day , hour by hour . If it is true that with private property some persons , having no property at a given time , have no " access " to the land or to the means of production , and are thus at a disadvantage in seeking employment , then under collectivism everybody is in that condition . Every workman has lost all his natural rights , and gained absolutely nothing in return . He is still subject to famine , and gets at best  | bare subsistence ; but he can neither stay in one place of right , nor move about of right . Long trains of prisoners transported in cattle cars to a place where they do not wish to go are in the logical condition of members of the collective . It is specifically against the interest of officials in a collective to increase production above bare subsistence level , for " the people . " It would only give them more bother ; and it would ( if consumed ) tend to increase the energy of the miserable population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the interest of the officials does call for increased production of war materials ( the officials being desirous of saving their own necks ) , the need has to be met by importing machinery and goods at the cost of a reduced margin of subsistence , or on credit , a debt which will never be paid . What power , in what circumstances , can the individual have against government ? In a free economy , there is a government of limited powers . Individual citizens own the productive property . Whether or not it is expressed in a formal charter , the limitation of the power of government is kept in effect by the fact that the government must get its supplies from the citizens by taxation , and the taxation can be kept within limits by a proper division of the political agencies ( checks and balances ) and a proper representative system , the representatives being obliged to seek re-election . Nobody is presumed to have the right to demand employment from the government , because it is well understood that government " jobs " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizen without property has a means of bribing the government Footnote  | to make a job for him , by expropriating the property of another citizen . Such bribery depends entirely upon the ownership of private property by other citizens . If the process is carried on until all property has been expropriated or made subject to expropriation , no citizen , no voter , has any power left against the government , or any bribe to offer to the government . In the collective , where there is no private property , the government owning everything and the individual nothing , the power of the government is absolute ; and it is immaterial what claim the worker may make , he has no means of obtaining it . The government certainly can " make jobs , " but there is no connection of supply and demand , no induction on the flow of energy . The only effective demand is that of officials for what they personally want ; but as they are under no necessity of producing in return , there is no exchange ; it is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy is cut with every transaction . Further , if the no-dimensional concept of the collective did approximate to reality ? which is impossible ? the " right to work " would be utterly meaningless . No part of the collective could act without the whole acting in accord . If a person is supposed to be only a component of the collective , and one person wants to do even one thing , he must theoretically get the consent of every other person , be it a thousand , a million , a hundred million , or two billions . It is ridiculous . Of course , what the person really has to do is to get the consent of certain officials . Now in the free society any person wishing to undertake an enterprise in which capital and various persons will be employed , must obtain the consent of the owners of the capital and of the persons who will do the work . That is not always easy , but he can apply directly , and those concerned can make their own decision according to their view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately ; innumerable ideas fail expensive-  | ly ; but those concerned have the right to take a chance and the loss . How can any official even be granted explicit authority to take a similar chance ? He can not . The matter requires personal judgment on every single proposal . Can every official of the collective have authority to dispose of all available materials ? No . Can each official have authority to dispose of a given portion of available materials for ? what ? For a proposal of an experimental innovation , made by anybody , while nobody knows what the result will be ? Of course not . What is the official to do ? He may deal out a favor , but it must be at a risk to himself with no particular inducement in the prospective returns . And what inducement is there to the innovator , the man of creative ideas ? None . Hence the collective society is static . Whatever productive machinery it contains must be inherited or borrowed from a primary field of freedom elsewhere , a free economy . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the decision and expenditure involved in the period of original invention . The machinery can be taken over at a fixed cost . It can even be copied at a fixed estimate ; but it ca n't be invented . The history of small nominal collectives within a free economy leads to extremely misleading conclusions because the relation to that free economy is not recognized . Many fail forthwith , but few such group experiments have " succeeded " in a remarkable way . Where the founder of such a collective prescribed a rule which cut the group off from social relations with the free society ? as by celibacy among the Shakers or the " community marriage " of the Oneida community ? a strict internal limitation on consumption and a discipline of regular labor could also be prescribed . In these " successful " experiments , the communities not only got a living ; they actually got rich . Why , then , it may be asked , is not collectivism at least a practicable system by which people can be secure and rich  | at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their liberty ? The answer is , because there would be no surrounding free economy from which they could get rich . These enclave groups sold their products to the free economy and converted the gain into real property , land and buildings , static forms . But the individuals concerned never surrendered their liberty ; it was impossible to do so , while the free economy existed . Any member of the collective could walk out any minute he chose . No member of the collective could really be subjected to personal punishment , imprisonment , or even the prescribed discipline of labor , as by deprivation of subsistence , by the collective , while the free economy existed . Only those who voluntarily submitted to it were in the collective , and only for such time as they chose . Nothing in their economic procedure was peculiar to the collectivist system . Anyone in the free economy could get rich by the same labor , thrift , and accumulation as the collectivists practiced . Everything in these groups which is pointed to as the fruit of collectivism was owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market whereby production was converted into static wealth ; the laws by which life and tenure were secure ; and even the habit of self-discipline by which the rules were observed and labor performed . Above all , there was no power whatever of actual compulsion , of the brutalities , torture , starvation , exile , execution , which collectivism inflicts when it has the power . Altogether , private property is the only basis of a productive society , the only means by which anyone can ever have free " access to the means of production , " not of permission but by natural right . In any society , or if there were but one man on a desert island , work must be done ; that is a law of nature . But only in a society of individual private property can a man have a say as to the conditions in which he will work , or acquire property on which he can work just as he pleases , or accumulate property by  | which he may ensure subsequent leisure , or improve his skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The incidental hazard of a free society , which is that of nature , that some individuals may be temporarily unable to command a livelihood , is the permanent condition of every man in a collective society . In giving up freedom , the individual gets nothing in return , and gives up every chance or hope of ever getting anything . Private individual property is not only the most favorable condition for a high production economy . It is the only transmission line by which high production is possible at all . What does any collective society promise even in its most extravagant propaganda ? Simply that it will copy the production of the free societies ? which in fact it can not do . In the nineteenth century some Socialists promised a return to handicrafts , although handicrafts developed with private property , not government ownership . Workingmen were not attracted . The Communists then promised machinery . During the past twenty-five years , collectivism has been imposed on one European nation after another . During that period considerable improvements in machinery have been made in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? None . The Nazi collective promised workingmen in Germany cheap cars , which American workingmen have had in increasing numbers for twenty-five years . Has even one cheap car been produced for or obtained by a workingman in Germany ? Or in Russia ? Or in Japan ? Not one . Has the standard of living risen in either country ? No , it has fallen far below the nineteenth century level . As a reasonable test of the respective claims and performances of the collective society and the free society , when they exist simultaneously , which will individuals join if they have the choice ? Millions of persons came to the United States and remained gladly , as long as they  | could gain entry ; they stand in line now for admittance under immigration quotas . How many persons have sought admission for citizenship and permanent residence in Russia , Germany , Italy , or Japan under collectivism ? Have professed collectivists from Germany sought admission to Russia ? No , they seek the United States none the less , if they can contrive to get here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent their own people escaping , as from a jail . And the happy collectivists crawl through barbed wire to get out .  | Why Real Money Is Indispensable Another statement about property reveals the primitive mental level of collectivists : the proposal to " abolish inheritance of property . " Since property is in tangible , objects , * there are only two ways by which inheritance ' could be abolished . The objects must be destroyed or else declared to be no longer property , debarred from use , a dead man 's land let go back to wilderness . Savages or barbarians sometimes adopted this course , as when the goods and gear of the dead were buried with them and their huts burned , or the Viking 's ship became his funeral pyre , or former camp sites were abandoned . What the collectivists mean , but do not say because if it were stated truthfully it would hardly appeal to any rational person , is that on the death of an owner the government should seize whatever property he had , a piecemeal expropriation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural lifetime . No moral or intelligible reason can be adduced why Hitler , Stalin , or any other government official should inherit the product of every man 's thrift , labor , and care , rather than his wife , children , or whomever he wishes to have it ; but that is the proposal . Death and taxes arrive hand in hand . The economists who advocate fiat money ( paper currency not redeemable in gold ) , or else an arithmetical sign which they call a " commodity dollar " ( perhaps because it Footnote  | is neither a commodity nor a dollar ) , * are below the mental level of savages . The savage applies number , but he has not advanced to the abstract concept . The advocate of fiat money has forgotten how to apply number . Sir Isaac Newton was asked by the British Treasury officials and financiers of his day why the monetary pound Footnote  | had to be a fixed quantity of precious metal . Why , indeed , must it consist of precious metal , or have any objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not notes be issued without ever being redeemed ? The reason they put the question supplies the answer ; the government was heavily in debt , and they hoped to find a safe way of being dishonest . But Newton was asked as a mathematician , not as a moralist . He replied : " Gentlemen , in applied mathematics , you must describe your unit . " Paper currency can not be described mathematically as money . A dollar is a certain weight of gold ; that is a mathematical description , by measure ( weight ) . Is a piece of paper of certain dimensions ( length , breadth , and thickness , or else weight ) a dollar ? Certainly not . Is a given-sized piece of paper a dollar even if numerals and words of a certain size are stamped on with a given quantity of ink ? No . They took Newton 's word for it , possibly conceding that the greatest mathematician of their age might know the primer of his science . But the fact that educated men were ignorant of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce and finance ; and the further fact that Newton 's answer has since been forgotten many times , in spite of the disastrous consequences which ensued each time , indicates a very grave problem of civilization . Mathematics is the world language of the energy age . Its use goes far beyond that of Latin in the Middle Ages ; while it expresses international relations , it is also the instrument of practical thought and communication in daily life . Anyone who operates power machinery has to think in mathematical ratios ? time , speed , distance . The men who organize and perform the practical tasks by which modern civilization is kept going ? whether they are truck-drivers or aviators , mechanics on the assembly line , engineers , or industrial managers ? think correctly in the practical language of modern civilization while they  | are on the job . If they reverted for one day to the primitive level of intelligence in respect of their work , at the end of that day the whole country would be a scene of wreckage . But if those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast system which depends throughout on the correct knowledge and use of the language of mathematics actually do not know , or do not understand , the most elementary statement in that language , how can the system function ? If politicians and financiers will believe neither logic nor evidence for a rule as primary as that two and two make four , what will convince them ? The verbal language of a high civilization is also a precision instrument . When words are used without exact definition , there can be no communication above the primitive level . If those who are supposed to express or influence " public opinion , " the writers , economists , social theorists , and pedagogues , think in the concepts of savagery , what can be the outcome ? What is most astonishing is that when the enemies of civilization have openly declared their intention to destroy it , to break down the circuit of the high-energy Society of Contract , and have explained how they mean to do so , those who are to be destroyed will deliberately carry out the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Keynes : " Lenin was certainly right . There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency . The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction . " The requirements of a sound currency are simple . If five apples are exchanged for a pound of cheese , and the cheese for two yards of cotton , and the cotton for a peck of potatoes , and the potatoes for two hours of labor , by what common measure can these various items be reckoned ? Each is worth any one of the others , and all  | of them are worth five times what any one of them is worth ; but it signifies nothing to say that any one of them is worth one , or that five of them are worth five . One what ? Five what ? Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another . As the several items can be exchanged , they must be equal ; but in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are equal in value . Then what is wanted is a unit of value to reckon by . Any of the items could be designated as the unit of value if the sequence of transactions were considered closed on the spot . But these are perishable goods , and have been considered as fixed quantities . General exchange must go , on in an endless sequence through time and distance , to include variable quantities of raw materials existent in nature , labor applied to them , and end-use , consumption or inactive possession . Then what is wanted is a medium of exchange , something for which everything else can be exchanged , so that it enters into every transaction as the unit of value , and serves for an indefinite number of transactions , an endless use . If the pound of cheese had been exchanged for a certain weight of precious metal , a dollar , and the dollar for two yards of cloth , and then again for a peck of potatoes , and again for two hours of labor , and again for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them would be worth five dollars . If all the goods were consumed , the dollar would remain , to continue the sequence of exchanges . Further , if a man who has perishable goods , say apples , does not want any other goods immediately , he can sell his apples for money , and the money will keep , enabling him to buy a sack of flour the next year ; though the wheat which went into the flour was not yet sown when he sold the apples . That is the use of money . It facilitates immediate exchange ; it is a repository of value ; and it carries exchanges through time on the long circuit of energy . The use of things depends upon their intrinsic qualities .  | Cheese is edible . Leather is used for shoes because it is pliable , tough , long-wearing . So the material used for money must be durable , divisible , incorruptible , portable , not easily imitated , and found in nature in sufficient but limited quantity . Nothing but the precious metals answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the Society of Status . The free economy produces its money as it produces steel , by going and getting it , digging the ore out of the ground . Neither is it an accident that the supply of real money increased as production of goods increased ; the advanced methods of production permitted low-grade ore to be smelted at a profit . Nevertheless , the quantity of gold available is always limited . Gold was not and is not given value by fiat , any more than cheese or cotton or leather were given value by fiat . It has value because it serves a vital need . Nothing can be given value by fiat . If a gold coin of the Roman Republic were dug up now , it would have its original value , though the Roman Republic perished two thousand years ago . So would a Russian gold rouble minted under the czars , or a gold coin of Germany or France dated before 1914 ; though the last czar was shot in a cellar , the last German emperor fled the country and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But paper currency of Russia , Germany , or France before 1914 is now waste paper . A dollar is a certain quantity of gold . That is not a matter of opinion ; it is so by definition and by law , Federal statute . All the gold held by the government belongs by right and law to individual citizens , who placed it on deposit originally ; just as money in a private bank account belongs to the depositor . A dollar bill is a certificate of deposit , a warehouse receipt for a dollar . The value is in the metal on deposit , just as the value indicated by any warehouse receipt is in the goods it calls for . If the goods do not exist , or are destroyed , or will not be delivered , the  | paper has no value . That is what happened in Germany when paper currency was printed though there was no gold to redeem it ; and a cartload of paper currency would not buy an egg . Neither are checks money ; they are promises to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods for nothing . If it is said that anything will do for money , as long as people accept it , let it be asked , why will not people accept " anything ? " Offer the man who says " anything will do for money , " a handful of pebbles in payment of a debt . The absolute necessity of real money , the unit in precious metal , for any extensive sequence of exchanges , has been proved by the very theorists who said it was a mere convention , and by the nation whose agents are still spreading propaganda to persuade other nations they wish to destroy that a " managed currency " consisting of nothing but printed paper is just as good or better . Communists and other advocates of government ownership argued for a century that vouchers for labor would be the " just " medium of exchange , and that real money was a capitalist device to exploit the workers . Then they tried their own scheme in Communist Russia , and could not make it work even by terror and starvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vouchers " ; the poor wretches were forced to accept them ; it was simply that the necessary application of arithmetic to goods and labor could not be made at all without real money . In applied mathematics , you must describe your unit . Communist Russia had to go back to the gold unit . Why can not even slave labor and forced transfer of goods be carried on with labor vouchers instead of real money ? The transactions need only be followed through to discover the reason . To be sure , if a single slave-owner held land with natural resources to supply every need and slaves to perform all the work of production , he could distribute to the slaves whatever he pleased , but he would not need labor vouchers . But suppose ten men , slave or  | free , should work to grow wheat in a certain field ; it is perfectly possible to divide the product by vouchers for the number of hours of labor . Then suppose ten other men work in the adjoining field growing sugar beets ; the same division can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exchanged for a labor-hour portion of beets . But the quantity of wheat or beets which a laborhour voucher represents has been established only for the given product of the given fields for that one season . In other fields beets or wheat grown by other groups would yield different quantities per labor-hour . Further , when the wheat went to the mill or the beets to the sugar factory , more labor hours would have to be included , not to mention the labor hours represented in the machinery . Then what quantity of goods would a labor-hour voucher call for ? The whole scheme is impossible . Nobody but a collectivist could be so feeble-minded as to imagine such a system . In applied mathematics , you must describe your unit . With a gold unit of value , labor hours and material and depreciation of machinery and everything that goes into the whole process can be reckoned by a common measure ; and they must be reckoned somehow , in order to move anything at all from field to factory to shop ; so the prices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given sum in currency . But if the paper currency is not actually redeemed on demand in real money ( gold ) , if the citizen can not regain possession of his own property when he presents the certificate of deposit , because the immediate incumbents of political office , members of the government , refuse to obey the law ( as they have refused ) , then what difference does it make whether the gold really exists or not ? What difference would it make if all the gold in the world should vanish utterly , dissolve into air , or be sunk at an unknown spot in mid-ocean ? Or if there were only one gold dollar in existence to be described as the unit of exchange , would not that do ?  | There is in that question ? which has been put by those who should know better ? an implicit assumption that seizure and sequestration of gold by governments , does not or need not " make any difference . " If that is true , why do governments seize gold ? Unless the action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of street loafers who snatch things at random , obviously it must make a difference . Probably most people do not recognize any difference between temporarily suspending payment of gold and seizing gold ; although the difference is precisely that between a bank suspending payment and a banker going through a depositor 's pockets for whatever he may have left after the bank has failed . When money is left on deposit in a bank , there is the contingent risk that the bank may not be able to pay promptly on demand . That is default . The bank has assets which may be sold to pay depositors . The citizen who holds a dollar bill has real money on deposit with the government . Somebody brought in raw gold to the mint ; for which by law he was entitled to receive coin in the same quantity minus a small percentage for the cost of minting . But instead of taking the real dollar , someone accepted a certificate of deposit . The government never owned any gold ; but was permitted to hold it until called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , and spends the money , if many people want their own money at one time , the government may be unable to pay ; it is in default . The government has no assets with which to meet its debts ; government property would not bring much even if it were sold , because it is non-productive ; and besides , the creditor has no recourse in law . The contingency of suspension of gold payments by government is unavoidable as long as governments are permitted to issue paper currency and borrow money . These are intrinsically dangerous powers ; but it is doubtful if the question will ever receive intelligent consideration ; or at least , not until men  | learn to think more boldly . At present it is taken for granted that governments must have such powers , just as it was formerly thought necessary that kings and nobles should have certain powers which are abolished in a republic . Be that as it may , it does make an immediate difference when governments seize gold ; it is the prevalence of this government gold monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War inevitable . It enables governments , as in Germany and Russia , to subvert the the private economy into a war machine , rendering the citizens powerless . The method by which the surreptitious objective is achieved is a steady abstraction of value from the money , and an increase of the national debt through borrowing from the banks. * Still , why is it necessary that the gold should actually exist , once it has been expropriated by the government ? Let the governments bear witness . Even in Russia , at the time the Communists said gold was merely a convention , and that they would not use it , they took care to seize the gold nevertheless . The pretext is offered , by the paper currency theorists , that people are simply accustomed to gold , and persist in using it only by habit ; therefore it must be taken away from them for their own good . True that no one government could get hold of all the gold in the world and sink it in the sea , and close all the gold mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in the country , and stop the entry of any more . The problem would be much easier than it was with liquor , because gold can not be manufactured . Why does the government keep the gold , after it has taken it away from the owners by force ? Because real money is indispensable ; the exchange values , prices , are established by the total quantity of Footnote  | gold existent . Roughly speaking , if there were in exchange fifty pounds of sugar and ten pounds of butter , five pounds of sugar would be given for a pound of butter ; one quantity divided by the other . As gold is the medium of exchange , the quantities of goods are divided by the quantity of gold ( dollars ) , to find the price . The process in general exchange is immensely complicated by the numerous kinds of goods , the varying supply and demand , distances which add cost of transport , and deferred exchanges ; but the total quantity of gold is nevertheless the determinant of prices , by comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , it could not be used as the unit of value , because it would not give any number for the divisor . How many paper notes should be printed ? One ? An unlimited quantity ? There would be no proper number . If the ancient dreams of the alchemists had been realized , so that gold could be manufactured in unlimited quantity , gold would also have become useless as a medium of exchange . There was once a government which really prohibited gold , and kept none itself , in the belief that gold was bad for people . That was Sparta . But the Spartans believed that comfort , convenience , industry , were bad ; and work was ignoble . The Spartans used iron for money , because nobody could carry enough of it around for general exchange . The object was to keep the nation poor , to keep the citizens on a bare subsistence economy . The plan succeeded perfectly . That is just what the prohibition of gold will effect ; it will reduce a nation to a dead level of poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sparta were willing to remain poor themselves . They enjoyed no more luxury than anyone else ; no more than the very slaves who did the work . Yet even in Sparta , where food was doled out at a common soup kitchen , something had to be used for money , and that material had to have . intrinsic value . The modern despots do not wish to be poor themselves .  | They wish to grab every luxury an industrial economy can supply . What they want is to keep the producers poor , by taking the product and doling a little back again for subsistence . That is why governments seize and keep gold . When paper currency is depreciated , the difference has to come out somewhere ; and the main cut is in wages . The fact is that heavy government expenditure must always be taken from the workingman 's wages ; there is no other possible source . But the depreciation in currency comes out of wages immediately ; whatever anyone gets in his pay envelope will simply buy him that much less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum in money is the same ; it will buy more . Aside from the immediate loss , the worker is deprived of a repository of value . Whatever he gets , he can not save any part of it for the future , if it is in depreciable paper currency . Real money is the only means by which the worker can have any independence . That is the difference it makes when governments seize gold . It makes the worker helpless . He can only live from day to day , with an expectation of getting less and less as time goes on . Nowhere in the world now is any worker as well off as he was before governments seized real money . That is true even in respect of high-wage labor in the United States ; if the workman has any possessions , they are wearing out ? his car , for example ? and he does not know when or how he can get another . If he has insurance , he does not know in what valuation of money it will be paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market as luxuries tend steadily to come within reach of everyone , and are then regarded as necessities . That is one general benefit of considerable private fortunes , which must be invested for income , which means increased production . The remaining margin will be spent to buy things of recent invention which are still expensive , but  | capable of being improved and made at less cost . The whole process is most evident in the development of motor cars for general use . Related accurately , the story has elements of comedy . First , various inventors and engineers put together a lumbering contrivance nobody could want except to gratify his taste for mechanics . Presently it was " improved " into a luxury ; that is , it was still expensive , inconvenient , and of no practical use , because there were no suitable roads , no gas stations or repair shops ; and a car was more than likely to leave the owner stranded a long way from home , an object of derision . Those were pleasure cars ! Wealthy purchasers paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital ( of which an enormous sum was sunk without return ) , and then buying the cars . Presently various ingenious men thought they might make cheaper cars . Throughout , those who had put in money and time were impelled to go on in the hope of getting a return . So the rich supported the nascent industry until cars were good enough for people of moderate means . When the cheap car got into mass production , the manufacturer saw that he had to have a correspondingly extensive market . If the workingman was to buy a car , wages must be higher . The manufacturer raised wages voluntarily , and so forced other employers to do the same . Where , in such a sequence , would any government have had the same inducement ? Nowhere . More than that , if currency had been subjected to depreciation during the given period , the process must have stopped , because the rise in real wages was necessary , along with lowered costs in materials . At a given time , a manufacturer in a growing enterprise has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not replace his stock at the same cost , he must raise his prices for the product . At the same time if the cost increase is by depreciation of the currency , real wages are lowered , so that his market is gone ; nobody can afford to buy the product . Production must cease .  | But the most dangerous fallacy regarding money which has been put forward recently pretends to find an argument in the German war gamble . It has been variously expressed , but one statement covers all the points . It is that Germany is " winning the war because it has been fighting with an industrial and engineering economy , " while the Allies " have been fighting with a money , or financial , economy . " * It is further said that " Thorstein Veblen knew all about " this economy , and " in Germany Walther Rathenau tried to put it in practice " first . It is described as " taking the heavy financial boot off the brakes , and letting the productive machinery run freely . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental level of savagery is again evident in the terms used ; they are animistic . A savage might , on first seeing a motor machine , think of it as a kind of Djinn in a bottle , a captive creature . But the idea is nonsense . A machine can not be either enslaved or liberated ; the terms apply only to human beings . It is true , however , that Rathenau did all he could to organize Germany so that it was bound to go to war , willy-nilly . ( He thought that only government should have so much power . The power he helped to give to government has expropriated , exiled , or put to death the Jews in Germany ; they owe their misfortune largely to one of their own race . It is unlikely that the fact will ever be acknowledged . ) But what kind of economy is Germany actually running on ? All the resources that Germany is using in war were produced by a money economy . The machinery was invented in a money economy ; Germany was equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians were trained , by a money economy . While preparing for war , Germany borrowed all the money she Footnote
