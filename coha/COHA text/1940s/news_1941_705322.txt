txt " Arial " allowable Ernest R. Clark is not quite accurate in saying , in a letter you recently printed , that there has been no question regarding the pronunciation of " aerial , " and that " all dictionaries agree " that it must be pronounced as four syllables . Webster 's New International , Second Edition , 1934 , gives as an allowable second pronunciation " a-ri-al " ; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives it as the preferred pronunciation ; and both Jones and Wyld set it down as the only pronunciation . Webster similarly allows the clipping of a syllable in " aeronautics , " " aeroplane " and other words beginning with " aero- " as a second pronunciation , " especially in popular words . " ( See entry under " aero- , " page 41 . ) There seems to be no cause for the " Federal action " against broadcasting stations of which Mr. Clark speaks . MAX J. Heassinvi .
