The odor of fresh-baked bread lured Dr. Edward Deming Andrews into a Shaker colony at Hancock , Mass . There &; then ( 1920 ) he began collecting Shaker art . Last week , in two big rooms in the Berkshire Museum at Pittsfield , Mass , his collection , the most complete in the U. S. , was put on view . <P> " All beauty that has not a foundation in use , soon grows distasteful , and needs continual replacement with something else . " This maxim would sound serviceable to most modern designers of functional furniture . It was devised by devout , unlettered members of the communistic religious sect who called themselves Shakers . Kindled by the ardor of Ann Lee , a mystic Englishwoman who led a band of six men and two women to the U. S. in 1774 , the Shakers took as their motto " Hands to work and hearts to God . " They labored , shook away their sins , grew and flourished mainly in colonies in eastern New York and New England until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully wrought cupboards , chests , beds , trestle tables , chairs with ball- &-socket; joints that could be tilted backward , coopersware , woven articles , primitive drawings of saints and heavenly visions , a complete herb shop . Since the Shakers despised anything so " giddy " as decoration , were even leary of curves , the collection was functional to a t . <P> Ann Lee taught the Shakers to believe in a dual , male-female God and Christ-spirit , enjoined them to remain celibate . Sister and brother Shakers lived together as large " families , " in communities headed by elders and elderesses of equal authority . Their large frame houses , in which the floors were divided to segregate men &; women , still stand as marvels of pegged construction . They worshiped , with ritual marches , dances , gesticulations , in great meetinghouses . At a Shaker dance , brothers &; sisters lined up facing each other , with palms upturned to receive God 's blessings , singing songs like Shake Off the Flesh : <P> Come let us all unite , <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> And labor for the power of God <P> We 'll raise our glittering swords and fight <P> And war the flesh with all our might <P> All our carnalities we now will break , <P> And in the power of God we 'll shake . . . . <P> Shakers were content to let the race die out pending the arrival of a new order , thought to keep their colonies going by taking in orphans and children of dissolute parents . It did n't work . Before the Civil War , the four big Shaker colonies had 6,000 members . Today there are about 75 . Part of the colony at New Lebanon , N. Y. , whose meeting house is supposed to be the only early building in the U. S. with a barrel roof , has been sold . The rest is for sale . But its dozen or so oldsters stay on . The sisters wear the bonnets , severe dresses and cloaks of their predecessors . Buxom Sister Lillian makes fine chairs . Frail , nearly toothless Elderess Sarah Collins , 85 , putters among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea " and " nay , " makes and sells braided rugs . She is one of the orphans who stuck with the Shakers . When a visitor last week remarked on the variety of Shaker work , Elderess Sarah explained : " Yea , we made everything except babies . "
