Last week the U. S. Army published and furnished to its new soldiers a handy pocket volume full of whys &; wherefores for the fighting man , Model 1941 . Its title : Soldier 's Handbook . Its purpose : " to help you over . . . rough spots in the transition from civilian to military life as rapidly as possible and to lay the foundations for your successful career as a soldier . " Since 1919 the hard-boiled sergeant , the bull-roaring officer have been fading from the military scene . Their replacements are officers and noncoms taught that intelligent teamwork , not dumb obedience , is what an army needs to make it hum , that enlisted soldiers must know ( at least generally ) the whys &; wherefores of what they are told to do . <P> Excerpts : <P> " Before you joined the Army you were a member of a family of closely related individuals . . . shared the same dining room , the same bathroom . . . . You learned that to get along well with other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . You have the same obligations in the Army . . . . Several hundred may have to live together . . . eat in the same mess hall , use the same bathhouse or latrine , bunk together , work together and play together . . . . <P> " The military organization ... is a team that must be constantly trained . . . . Military discipline is nothing more than this same spirit of team play . In civil life lack of discipline in a young man may result in his getting into trouble ... it may cause a member of an athletic team to be sent to the bench , or cause an employe to lose his job . In the army . . . lack of discipline in a soldier may not only cost him his life and the life of his comrades , but cause ... his team to be defeated . " <P> Dos and Don'ts of military courtesy ( Do n't salute an officer in public places or with bundles in your arms ) , the care and maintenance of small arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic military subject , are you-and-me subjects to the Soldier 's Handbook . It all winds up with care of the soldier himself ( brush teeth twice a day , see the doctor if you feel ill ) and a glossary of common military expressions , some hangovers from World War I. <P> Samples : <P> Blind : a court-martial fine . <P> Jawbone : credit . <P> Kick : dishonorable discharge . <P> Over the hill : to desert . <P> The old man : commanding officer .
