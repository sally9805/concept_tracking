London 's famed Sadler 's Wells company was putting on a new ballet . The orchestra struck up Haydn 's cheerful " Clock " Symphony . Onstage , the audience saw a twelve-foot grandfather clock with human hands and a swinging pendulum of dancers ' legs . But to go with Haydn 's rippling music , Choreographer Leonide Massine had scraped up a trivial love story between an insect princess and a human clockmaker , and set it dancing with steps that were largely borrowings from a dozen Massine ballets . About all that made the evening enjoyable , particularly to the men in the stalls , were the pretty legs and graceful dancing of the princess , redhaired Ballerina Moira Shearer , who has become the pin-up girl of British ballet . <P> Moira Shearer 's pert , clean-limbed dancing is by no means up to the superb technical and dramatic skill of Sadler 's Wells ' prima ballerina , Margot Fonteyn . But Moira does have what one starry-eyed London critic called " deerlike littleness and midsummer coloring . " <P> Daughter of a Scottish civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southern Rhodesia from a former member of Diaghilev 's famed company . Two years ago she made her first big London hit as Princess Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty . <P> Though she is only 22 , Moira Shearer has already decided that a ballerina has too little future ; she 'd rather become a stage actress . Says she : " It 's so awful to become a ballet dancer who is past her prime and have the audiences make allowances for you . I 'd rather leave ballet before I begin to drop off .
