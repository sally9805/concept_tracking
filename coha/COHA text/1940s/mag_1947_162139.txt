With the other , he sweepingly beckoned six American notables " to visit the Yugoslav frontier of Greece , and such other parts of Yugoslavia as they may deem necessary , to see for themselves what the true situation is .

Byrnes ; former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. ; Harold E. Stassen ; Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick ; John Gunther ( Inside U.S.A. ) ; Hanson W. Baldwin , N.Y . Times military analyst and frequent target of Moscow ire . <P> The Communist Marshal also found time for more important business . In Belgrade , before the People 's Front Congress , which included delegates from Communist parties all over Europe , he revealed the latest wrinkle in international Communist tactics . It was a revival and stiffening of the People 's Front strategy ( i.e. , Communist posturing as the great friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose : to get a lion 's share in democratic governments , thus saving the chancy wear &; tear of violent seizures of power ) . <P> Tito called for the unity of " progressive " forces " throughout the world " against the " international reaction headed by American financial magnates which is ... reviving fascism in various countries , including western Germany .
