I HAD heard so many tales of the Russians at the Alaskan base where they took over our planes , that I selected this as my first assignment when our War Art Unit arrived in Alaska . The stories had them supermen ? huge fellows , tremendous drinkers , who drank our poor boys under the table , then went off to their planes , did a few loops over the field , and headed for Russia while our pilots were carried off to bed . The place was supposed to swarm with Russian glamour girls too ? Amazons and Venuses in one , who were test pilots and mechanics as well . Altogether , it seemed our boys were up against so much they were in danger of acquiring real inferiority complexes , and something must be done about it . The gates to the post ( Ladd Field ) lie just outside Fairbanks , a town with great character and charm . The quiet , deep Chena River flows through it . When I arrived the first day of June , the air was sweet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the new buds of the aspens . Beautiful , soft skies like those over all great interior lands , carry endlessly drifting white clouds . Along the river , above and below the tall arched steel bridge , are the old bars , cafes , and hotels of the town , and further down are the well-finished , neat little log houses , each in its little yard , where everyone was busy in the evening making gardens and sprinkling the dirt road to keep the dust down against the unaccustomed heavy traffic of army trucks . And across the road was the river , reflecting the incredibly prolonged sunsets and curving off through cottonwoods ? much like the Kaw River at my home town in Kansas . There were girls and women about in surprising numbers , well dressed and with the soft , relaxed air of women at home . At the gate to the post the MP 's insist on seeing , each time , the credentials of officers , as well as the passes of enlisted men . And after driving two or three miles along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open meadowlike tundra , you come to the post itself ? one huge silvery hangar , with wide concrete aprons at each end , and stretching east and west beside them , the two-mile-long concrete runway . The post lies in a wide shallow bowl with low hills on three sides , but to the south a low fringe of forest gives a definite sense of the earth curving away to the very distant snowy range of Mt . McKinley . Beside the hangar is the central square of the post , a small city block in size , green with newly sprouted oats , a tall flagpole in the center , and the dozen or so barracks , hospital , and other buildings set with their ends facing the square ? radiating from it on the three sides away from the hangar . They are long , two-storied , frame buildings , gleaming white , with roofs irregularly patterned in two shades of cream , as a concession to camouflage . I always wonder who makes these foolish compromise decisions as to where camouflage shall begin and end ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would an aerial observation be made except from exactly above , whereas oblique shots are always the favorite of the photo-interpreters . Altogether it 's a handsomely laid out , well built , and well kept place , afloat as it seems on this wide-stretching , endless Alaskan tundra . AD THE Russians , the saviours of the world , the supermen who so shortly ago were " the bears who walked like men , " and then " the red hordes of Bolshevism " ? Well whatever they would really turn out to be , they , their presence here , and their country off over the hills to the west gave point and meaning to this field . The first two I saw came walking along the concrete sidewalk , and even at first glance were unmistakably Russian ; for they wore the loose , belted smock and tight neckband which has always characterized Russian dress . Then two young men in olive drab blouses like our own walked toward me , both short , not very heavy , and moving with a sort of dipping , swinging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue trousers tailored tightly in at the knees , and high , black-cuffed boots ; the other straight O.D. trousers tucked into high boots . One wore an overseas cap with a red star , the other a small visored cap like the old German student caps , and on it a red star in a wreath of laurel . The blouses of both were made gay by flat white epaulets marked with gold stars and bars and edged with pale blue . Their faces were ruddy and like those of American boys ? but minus the ease and softness that a life of peace and security and abundant food has given to our boys . This heightened tension which made their different types seem more pronounced , I found was the one ever-present point of difference from us . Their range of racial type is as wide as ours ? dark , light ; wide , long ; blunt , sharp ; tall , short ; gay or sober ? the same sharp contrasts and differences that characterize the men of our citizen army , they also had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of our men . Instead ? thick necks , barrel chests , energetic , purposeful , nervous movements . In all their lives they had known only work and revolution and war , and this stamped their faces and their bodies with tension and toughness . But , even so , if you put them into American uniforms they would be lost in the shuffle of our varied types . At the little oval bar in the basement of the comfortable B.O.Q. where beer was served , they came to drink and to play the slot machines , which fascinated them . They have the natural shyness and reserve of men in a strange country ? but something more : an attitude of reserve by order . I always greeted them , risking a hello , and they either hastily saluted or nodded and smiled , and some even " helloed " back . I wished I knew Russian , for I wanted to stop them and say , " I am proud and moved to meet any member of your gallant army . Permit me to shake your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . But even though our conversation never went beyond " Hello , " in the course of a few days I was on very cordial drinking and sign-Ian gu age terms with them . In the long mess hall where a twenty-four hour service is maintained because of the necessarily irregular hours of both Russian and American personnel , the Russians sat at the tables on the left and the Americans on the right . Very seldom did any Russian , even with a little English at his command , sit with the Americans ? more often I saw Americans who knew a little Russian make an attempt at fraternizing. rrHE FIRST day I spent looking , bumping into Russians everywhere ? singly and in groups . They were quartered together in one of the long buildings divided into apartments of four or five large rooms with bath , each room having from two to eight cots ? the same accommodations as those of the American officers . It surprised me that practically none of the Russians spoke English any more than we Americans spoke their language . I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolboy had some English at his command , and I had expected a limited knowledge of English to be rather common among the Russians ; but it was not , and my own complete ignorance of Russian made me ashamed and very conscious of the great barrier which lies in the lack of a common language . A few of the Russians permanently stationed here , the mechanics , testing engineers , and executive staffs , were picking up some English , but it was obvious that all these men had been selected for their ability at their job ? not for their English ? and all official communication was done through interpreters . This , I came to feel , was the mark of a proud and self-confident people , perhaps a little too stiff and unyielding , for certainly no careful and studied attempt had been made to ease over this language difficulty . It was even clear that their commanding officer , a very stern and conscientious taskmaster , welcomed this detachment . It left everyone free to attend to business with a wholehearted concentration and devotion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , employing as small a personnel as possible . But Americans are a very provincial people . Too many of them still feel that if a man does not speak English , he 's an ignorant , uncivilized man . One of the Russian interpreters told me with scorn and indignation that a brash American soldier had one day tapped one of the staff officers on the shoulder and said , " Hey , why do n't you learn to speak American ? " and the Russian officer had replied in perfect English , " I do n't need to . We have interpreters for that purpose . But why do you not learn respect for your superior officers ? " In view of the fact that this is probably the only place at this time where our two peoples are in contact , I was sorry that the tensely serious and concentrated Russians did not take advantage in an official way of the chance to be gracious . Before my stay was over I knew better why they did not , and appreciated the prevailing sternness of mood which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Russian girl interpreters . Not Amazons or Venuses , but very serious , good looking , and quite feminine young women , who were slightly self-conscious and stagey alone among all the men . Attached to the American personnel as interpreters were two young American lieutenants of Polish ancestry , a big Russian-born sergeant formerly in the Russian navy , and a big blunt-featured civilian , looking so much like Earl Browder I felt he must be very sympathetic to the Russians . Fraternizing between our interpreters and the Russians did not go far in spite of an obvious attempt at it on the part of our interpreters . I felt the Russians smelled the White Russian background of these Polish-American boys ( interpreters for us ) . I asked our interpreters if they would help me to get some Russians to pose ? to come to my room for about an hour , for more careful and finished studies than I could make otherwise . " Sure , they 'll be glad to . Who do you want ? " I replied that I did not want spectacular or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my surprise I made no headway at getting models . American boys , though shy and embarrassed at the idea of posing , are still flattered and ready to pose at the drop of a hat . The Russian boys were shy and embarrassed too , but worried and uncertain , and ended by making excuses . The girl interpreters exhibited the same reluctance , and finally said they would have to get permission from the commanding officer . When I realized how strictly under orders even in such informal matters they felt themselves to be , I presented myself to their commanding officer , Colonel M ? . He was a small , very serious , and rather dour fellow , dressed with extreme simplicity . He wore no insignia whatever on his blouse , never the gay epaulets the return of which to the present-day army uniform had not been welcomed by the strait-laced party members . Through my interpreter I explained that I would like to make studies of a lot of his men , including himself ; that I felt their being here , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a vastly momentous and historic thing , and that I wanted to make these studies as part of the permanent record of our army . I do n't know how eloquent the big civilian interpreter was . One has a peculiarly helpless feeling as one listens to a pet idea being explained through a disinterested interpreter , this explanation complicated through being made in the wash of air and roar of motors from a big bomber nearby . At any rate the idea did n't at all appeal to Colonel M ? . For himself he refused , saying he had posed for a lot of photographs and nothing had come of it . But for his men he rather grudgingly consented , and said he would send them over whenever he could spare them . They were all working so continuously and under such tension , and the Russian pilots arrived and departed so rapidly , that I felt this was concession enough for a nonessential thing like drawing . So I thanked him and returned to hovering around the field and watching in wonder the flood of magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its blood-red star already painted on the fuselage , and immediately checked and tested by alert and deadly serious Russian engineers . There was feverish activity on the field , a tremendous roaring of motors as a large convoy was getting ready to take off . The Russian pilots climbed into the planes after a last check-up . The medium bombers , one after another , with a final racing of the motors , left the neat and exact line-up along the apron , taxied down to the end of the runway and took off , the first ones circling the field until the last one should join them . Then the half dozen P-39 's , their bellies swollen with the detachable auxiliary gas tanks they carried to enable them to make the flight with the bombers , took off , one after another . And all together they moved into tight formation and disappeared over the western hills . nE endless roar of motors being tested rr is the nervous sound accompaniment in the background of all life and activity at the post . In this endless daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twelve o'clock midnight with the bright glow of sunset in my room I put myself to bed , then at two or three or four o'clock such a roar of motors would fill the air that I would jump to the window to see a convoy of planes gathering in the brilliant light of the sun now in its upward arc along the northern horizon . Never have I seen such skies , or had such a sense of a blue world of space around the curving top of the whirling earth . Worlds and infinities of clouds , gathering and shifting and drifting off ? the weather breeder for the whole hemisphere lying down to the south . One of the Russian girls , Helena , was my first formal model . I felt that she , speaking English , would report back about this strange business of drawing , and as to what were my real intentions , so / explained to her that I wanted to do these careful studies because I did not want the Russians to be seen just as types . I wanted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their sacrifices had been so great that we in America almost forgot that every dead Russian was a person like ourselves ? loved life just as dearly , had just as many ties of parents , wife , and children . Helena listened very soberly , nodded , and said , " Yes , we have paid very , very dearly for everything we have done . " She was from northern Russia ; and a graduate of the Moscow School of Languages , and was very happy to speak English on subjects other than technical ones . " You know , " she said , " I spoke better English when I graduated from school than I do now . Now I only speak of propellers and magnetos and batteries and guns . It must be a wonderful life to be an artist . . . I wish I could see New York , " she said . " Well , maybe you can go there while you 're here , " I said . " No , " she answered , " not till the war is won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half , and I had great pleasure in drawing this fine , serious , sensitive face , with its soft eyes and a mouth and cheeks showing such definite Mongolian and peasant stock . She was very pleased with herself in the drawing , and at once wanted it . . . " Oh please . " " No , I ca n't , " I said , " but do another for you . " " But you 'll forget . You Americans make such easy promises , " she protested . I promised word of honor I would draw her whenever she could come again , and Helena said she would come that same night after she was through at the hangar . In the afternoon she returned with a young engineer and remained long enough to ease him over his first embarrassment until presently he began to drag out his few words of English . He was too embarrassed over the sight of himself on paper to do more than laugh . " You Russian ? " he asked me . " You look Russian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing for her . We had another pleasant talk ? about life in Russia , about Dostoievski 's novel The Possessed ( which I was reading ) , about the Russian love of the opera . Here at the post their chief entertainment was the playing of endless operatic records on their phonographs . She told me about some of the pilots who had died here , but she was very reserved and reluctant to talk of anything verging on politics . The following morning she came with a genial , talkative master-mechanic , whom the Americans called " Butch . " He ex. amined with a very critical eye the drawings I had made . Seeing this , I asked Helena to tell him that I would try my best to make him very handsome . At this he blushed scarlet . All the men blushed easily , were much more shy and impulsive than the girls . Also , I discovered they all used perfume ? Iots of it . So thenceforth Helena brought me wonderful models and I was happy . Pilots were hardest to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would arrive ? twenty or so piling out of a big transport in from the west ? and take off again within a few hours . If they had a chance they would go to Fairbanks and buy lavishly of shoes , women 's silk underthings , stockings , and such luxuries ? probably commissions from many friends . The pilots were of all types , and of a much wider range in age than our pilots . Only one was bearded ? he was a Cossack ? and when Helena asked him to pose , he said an artist in Moscow had wanted him to pose and he had consented and after all the artist did not show up -- so I was glad not to put him through such a strain again , and only sketched him at mess . its Russian pilots are dressy , as our pilots are inclined to be , and wear all the hardware they can ; pistols on their hips , and some wore the Red Star of Lenin on their breasts . They are a leather loving people . They wore high boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered at the abundance of leather in a country so stripped down to essentials . In flying they were skillful , but abrupt and rather unorthodox . Instead of circling the air over the field when gathering into convoys they would cut dangerously across ? natural habits from combat flying . But every plane which the Russians flew out had been flown in by an American pilot , on its maiden flight too .. These same easy-going American boys who looked so soft compared to the Russians , take at least a fifty-fifty chance , and they have a better record of delivering the planes safely , which is their job . One Sunday afternoon a P-39 , after circling the field , left its convoy , tried to land again , but plunged into the river which flows by only a hundred yards from the end of the runway . The pilot , a 20-yearold Russian boy , and one of their best , had radioed that his oil pressure was dropping . Wrecking trucks and crews , cables , rubber boats , all were rushed to the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , gathered on the bank . The plane was located just under the surface in the middle of the swift , icy current . Several attempts by our crews to get a cable around the plane were bungled through too much hurry , and the Russians gathered in a knot , looking on glumly and critically . There were so many failures and so much time went by that their ten sion relaxed into ironic mirth , and Colonel M --  offered some impatient suggestions , which were received , however , with more courtesy than they were given . At last the wingless , torn fuselage was drawn to shore , the tail heaved up like a whale , and in the transparent nose crushed against the instrument panel was the pilot . American boys in the icy water to their necks pulled the body out ? dead from a crushed skull . In everybody 's mind , like a specter , is the thought of sabotage , or at least indifference and carelessness . This plane had just been conditioned by American mechanics and checked by Russian inspectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American test pilot would have been called upon to take it up . But tension is simply inherent in such a situation , and like envy , does not grow out of logic . For a while this heightened tension hung over the field , but planes came in and convoys left for the west even into a black and stormy sky . I thought how on an average Sunday afternoon back in " The States " probably five hundred equally serious automobile accidents occurred , but did not check the flow of traffic , and that in war death is made much of , while deaths incidental to industry and traffic far outnumber those of war and still pass unnoticed ; and I realized with horror how , at a certain pace , war could become a practically permanent way of life , and still life would go on , as it has in China . I believe , from what I have seen of the reaction of our soldiers to death , that we are more indifferent to it than the Russians . They face it with more personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe that in war the horror of death , of planned and deliberate death , grows instead of diminishes . One evening in the mess hall I was much interested in the unusual sight of a table full of women on the Russian side of the room . They had the air of hardworking , pioneer people , dressed in their unaccustomed and awkwardly worn shoddy best . My first thought was that they must be from some remote town up the Yukon . Then 1 was struck by a prevailing Slavic quality in their faces , and realized they were Russian . At the next table were the men of this party , with the same air of serious workmen ? with knobby heads , fresh and bad haircuts , and cheap , shoddy clothes . They were an embassy party en route to Mexico . They all ate with typical European peasant table manners ? that is , spread their elbows wide on the table and lowered their heads to the plate , instead of the erect sitting with much manipulation of tableware which we call table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . One , how completely their whole national wealth of industry and materials and concentration was turned to the war ; the other , to what an astonishing degree they had brought about and were living in a people 's and workmen 's world . Not one among these civilians was of so-called intellectual or aristocratic type . But every face had intelligence , alertness , and the great gift of complete and serious purpose . I REALIZED now why no more concessions were made to fraternizing and graciousness and the planned promotion of good will at this post . They are a very simple , very honest nation of workers who , up to the time of their stand against Germany , were very unsure of themselves and very much snubbed and patronized by other nations . Now they are proud and self-conscious , and who can blame them if they carry a chip on their shoulders ? We Americans should know that it will not take long for these workmen to become intellectuals and aristocrats , since there are no physical characteristics that distinguish these different categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confidence . ( And a little instance of social progression was thestatement of American officers that in a single month a revolutionary change had occurred in the table manners of the Russians stationed at the post . ) They have a rich background in their history and art and literature , which they have not thrown away by any means , but they also have the eager and formative character of people starting fresh again . They are disciplined ? there is no doubt of that ? with a discipline that has bitten deeply into their naturally impulsive , hearty , and careless temperament . They are devoted to work and progress with religious zeal , and our own mechanics here admitted that their mechanics were as good as ours . They have grown impatient of our past easy promises ? they interpreted those phrases literally which we have come to take as statements of our good intentions . They are conscious that they have paid heavily in blood and that we , comparatively , have paid in money . This is one of those things that can not be helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put us through their ordeals . The attempt in some places to build them into the bogey of " Our Next Enemy " makes my blood run cold . In all my contacts with the Russians I felt strongly their likeness to us as a people ? as individuals surprisingly like us , as a people very close to us in the problems they face and in the aspiration with which they face those problems . And I felt very keenly the immense responsibility of our leaders and their leaders to promote good will and understanding and tolerance between our two vigorous , mixed and hybrid races who face the future with such high hope .
