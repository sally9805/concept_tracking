Big , progressive Timken Roller Bearing Co. , a railroad supplier for 37 years , last week went out of its way to offend one of its best customers . In full-page newspaper ads , run in 23 U.S. cities , it stingingly rebuked the railroads for technical backwardness , urged them to avoid " serious freight congestion " by converting all their freight cars from friction bearings to roller bearings at once . <P> Roller bearings , said Timken 's intrepid ad , would permit " one-speed " railroading ( identical speeds for freight and passenger trains ) , would accelerate the whole defense program , save building many new cars . Other roller-bearing claims : 1 ) starting resistance reduced by 88% ; 2 ) elimination of hotbox delay ; 3 ) reduced maintenance costs . <P> Father of this brain child was a hulking ex-artilleryman from Georgia named Walter C. Sanders , who has bossed Timken 's railroad division for 20 years . During all that time Sanders has had one passionate reverie : all U.S. railroad equipment on roller bearings-preferably Timken . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under its passenger trains . Now scores of U.S. streamliners , hundreds of crack passenger trains roll on rollers . But the whole U.S. coach and Pullman market is only 39,000 cars . <P> So Sanders went after the U.S. railroads ' 1,750,000 freight cars . Results : practically zero . Railroad men thought roller bearings ' proved success on passenger cars and locomotives was no sign they were the best thing for freight cars . Furthermore , they thought them much too luxurious for freight cars , would as soon put Pullman roomettes in cabooses . <P> To roller-bearing a single car ( excluding new trucks ) costs $750 v. $40 for friction bearings . To convert the whole car supply , as Sanders ' ad urged , would cost well over $1,000,000,000 and take two-thirds of the whole U.S. 1940 output of alloy steel , which has plenty of other defense uses . Furthermore , road speed is not the chief railroad bottleneck . Freight cars average only two hours a day in transit ; what slows them up is not their friction bearings but standing in terminals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad men were miffed at Sanders this week . He had reopened an old fight ; worse , he had picked a time when the railroads were already in hot water with Government officials , were breaking their driving rods trying to prove they could do their part . Worse still , he had violated a century-old understanding between the roads and their suppliers : never break ranks . Said one Eastern railroad executive : " It was very bad taste . " <P> But Sanders had not expected his ad to bring in a first-morning sheaf of orders ( it did n't ) . He did it as a missionary gesture . Like most transportation bugs , Sanders expects a revolution in railroad equipment - perhaps after the war , when men and materials will be more obtainable , when vast fleets of cargo planes may force the roads to run 80-to 90-mile-an-hour freights or get off the tracks .
