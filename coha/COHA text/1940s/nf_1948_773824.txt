txt 8o SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN One of the great achievements of twentieth-century physics , as fundamental to our understanding of the nature of matter itself as nuclear physics , has been the demonstration that the electron exhibits dual properties ? those of the wave or vibration , as well as those of the particle Yl This important idea was presented first as an abstraction by the French physicist , Louis de Broglie , and was verified experimentally in 1927 by G. P. Thomson in England , and by C. J. Davisson assisted by L. H. Germer , the latter pair working in New York in the Bell Telephone Laboratories . Obviously , nothing was further from the minds of de Broglie , Thomson , Davisson , or Germer , than the problems of lubrication or the formation of oxides . But it soon became apparent that the diffraction pattern obtained was produced by the surface layer of the material . An electron beam used to obtain a diffraction pattern does not usually penetrate into a metal target to distances greater than 20 A units , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depth of 1oo,000 A units ! 12 The reader need not concern himself with the exact definition of the unit , which the physicist uses to measure very , very small distances , but he should see immediately that the minimum penetration of x-rays is to a distance at least 5000 times greater than that of electrons . Thus the technique of electron diffraction , as Dr. Clark tells us , " performs the same thing for the surface layer . . . that x-rays do for metals in bulk form . " " The General Electric Company now manufactures an electron diffraction camera for the use of engineers , and the electron microscope produced by RCA can be adapted to the same purpose . With the aid of this tool , we are now beginning to learn what happens to surfaces that are lubricated as well as those that are polished , how rusts are formed , just how in electroplating one metal is deposited on top of another . Application of the new technique has also solved several riddles important to the use of ball bearings and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the way in which the search for abstract truth and its experimental verification finds the answers to pressing questions and problems whose solution is essential to our advancing technology . There is many an important problem faced by engineers and // doctors whose solution awaits some new fundamental truth ; but , alas , no one knows in what special field of scientific activity each will be found . We have referred several times to the important fact that the examples which are used for illustrative purposes in this book are not unique . To varying degrees the same pattern may repeat itself on many occasions . We have already described the significant invention made in the Middle Ages , by means of which the man who carried the front of a handbarrow was replaced by a wheel . A somewhat similar innovation is the replacement of the horse in front of a buggy or wagon by an internal combustion engine . It is an interesting social datum that , although everybody knows Edison as the inventor of the electric light ( and some know Swann as an independent inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inventor of the sewing machine , and Marconi as the inventor of the radio , few , if any of us , know the name of the man who invented the gasoline engine which powers our automobiles , nor even the name of the man who first thought of applying such a device in this way . Yet , as Maurice Holland tells us , " It is quite safe to venture the assertion that no basic patent , granted by the United States , has so profoundly influenced the social and economic life of so many people in so short a time as the Selden patent of 1895 which covered the principle of using an explosion engine in a road vehicle . " " We must not lose sight of the fact that the difference between those early horseless carriages and the streamlined automobile of 1948 is not merely one of successive mechanical inventions , such as make possible the location of the gear-shift lever on the steering-wheel post ; but ? this development also reflects the application of scientific discoveries , many made with no such practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , however , if we neglected to point out the reverse side of the coin . We have been discussing the way in which the discovery of new scientific truths makes possible new inventions . We have contrasted inventions based on science with the purely mechanical inventions that could be made // by any skilled technician with sufficient mechanical ingenuity . Yet the progress of science itself frequently depends on mechanical inventions , just as much as on the work done in science by one 's predecessors and contemporaries . As an example , let us consider the telescope which was invented in the seventeenth century ; there are several claimants to the honor of having been the first to put together two lenses in order to make an instrument which would enable one to see objects clearly at a great distance . Not one of those whose claim to this important invention has been put forth was a skilled scientist in any sense of the word ! Lenses , in the modern form of a lenticular-shaped piece of glass , were unknown in classical antiquity , and were first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use some time in the twelfth century , but not for some five hundred years did anyone think of , or come across accidentally , the principle of using two lenses , separated by a certain distance , as an optical instrument . Interestingly enough , one of the first patents to be applied for in Holland was one covering this principle . " As soon as he had heard of the new invention , Galileo constructed a telescope , and immediately thought of using it to study the heavenly bodies . He soon made a host of important scientific discoveries , such as the existence of many stars invisible to the naked eye , the fact that the planet Venus has phases just like the moon , the existence of three moons circling about the planet Jupiter , the fact that the moon 's surface appears to contain mountains and valleys just as are found on the earth , and many more . Indeed , it may be stated unequivocably that the invention of the telescope and its use for astronomical purposes by Galileo marked the beginning of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomical science since that time has been done with telescopes . ' By combining two lenses in a slightly different way , one produces a compound microscope . By its aid , biologists have studied plant and animal structures otherwise invisible , as well as various microorganisms . The work of such a man as Pasteur would have been absolutely impossible without a good compound microscope . Professor Percy W. Bridgman , who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his studies on the properties of materials at very high pressures , was able to achieve a greater pressure in the laboratory than any of // his predecessors largely because of a special kind of packing or seal which he invented . Yet , when he tried to obtain a patent for the method , he discovered to his astonishment that a patent for a very similar type of device had been granted some years earlier to a manufacturer of sausage machines . " In the case of Bridgman , as in that of Galileo , the success of the investigations depended not only on the instrument available , but also and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly the way to use the new instrument in studying nature . The list of important new instruments responsible to a high degree for the rapid progress of modern science can easily be extended . Two of the most important that come to mind are the spectroscope ( the tool of the chemist and the physicist , and second in importance only to the telescope for the astronomer ) and the photographic camera . Improvements in the art of making photographic plates have vastly extended the range of spectroscopy , and it is hard to think of any branch of science today working without photography . The late Professor L. J. Henderson used to remark that prior to 185o the steam engine did more for science than science did for the steam engine . ' ? The experimenter of today is in a vastly superior position to that of his predecessors of one hundred and fifty years ago , thanks to the fruits of modern technology . He can obtain glassware of any size and description , and wire of all sorts . Joseph Henry , only a century ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding about them strips torn from his wife 's petticoats . A scientist working today has merely to turn to the catalogue of any one of a number of suppliers . He can get wire of almost pure copper because the industrialists have found that such wire is a better conductor of electricity than wire made of impure copper , with traces of arsenic or other impurities . Instead of having to make his own galvanic batteries , he has merely to turn on a switch . He may obtain " rare " gases and other chemicals in a pure state , and a host of materials of all sorts prepared for industrial uses . President J. B. Conant remarks on this score that " the connection is a two-way street . The practical arts at first run ahead of the sciences : only in very recent years have scientific discoveries affected practice to a greater degree than practice has affected science . " ' Today , no large industry is without its research laboratories . But , // some three hundred years ago , Robert Boyle wrote a hopeful treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by the Naturalist 's Insight into Trades . " I shall conclude this , " he wrote , " by observing to you , that as you are , I hope , satisfied , that experimental philosophy i.e. , science itself may not only be advanced by an inspection into trades , but may advance them too ; so the happy influence it may have on them is none of the least ways , by which the naturalist may make it useful to promote the empire of man . " The purpose of this preliminary survey has been to illuminate the relation between mechanical inventions and technical progress , and fundamental research for new truths of nature . It should be clear that the advance of science affected technics , in wholly unpredictable ways ; that the development of technics raised many problems , which the scientists could solve only by the discovery of new and unsuspected principles ; and reciprocally ? the scientist was provided with tools and materials for his own investigations by the same development of technics . Now that we have had a cursory glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us turn to three case histories developed at full length : the weed-killing chemical compounds ; the use of electric power , radio , and radar ; and nylon ; let us study in detail how these extraordinary practical achievements grew out of what was purely fundamental research . These chapters have been written to give the uninitiated reader the experience of the scientist himself , so that his judgment may be informed by a true understanding . In each example , we will trace the history of the ideas under discussion , how they were discovered , what effect they had on the state of science , and how they were put to use in the service of mankind . Then we shall be able to see in just what way these three examples are typical of all applications of fundamental knowledge , and in what way they form a category distinct from others . // Auxins and Agriculture Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground , The emptiness of ages in his face , And on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reprinted by permission . ) THE PROSPECT of a world without weeds , of gardening without tears and agriculture without pain , marks the beginning of one of the great revolutions produced by science in the twentieth century . We are rapidly approaching a time when , as the result of the splendid research work of a relatively small number of plant scientists , the world 's table will be supplied by the labors , of a comparatively small number of people . Agricultural machinery of various sorts , a better knowledge of soil and fertilizers , and new and improved types of plants ( some of which we shall discuss in later chapters ) , have already resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of people employed in the production of food . Only a hundred years ago , 8 out of every io Americans were engaged in food production ; today , this number has been reduced to 2 out of every zo ! If we can successfully eliminate weeds without using cultivators or hand labor , this figure can be made even smaller . The weed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant out of place. ? ' 1 A weed may be either an unwanted wild plant , or an equally undesirable plant left over from a previous crop , such as last year 's wheat growing in the midst of this year 's patch of tomatoes . Weeds occupy space and compete with the harvest crop for a " place in the sun . " They also compete with the farm crop for nutrients in the soil . Their presence thus reduces not only the yield of farm crops , but also their quality . Weeds may be either woody or herbaceous plants . // The action of weeds has been described as " an unseen tax on the crop harvested . " ' In California , the losses from weeds amount to sixty million dollars annually , and , according to F. J. Taylor , the total annual loss to farmers in the United States from weeds alone is in the vicinity of three billion dollars a year 3 Still another way of seeing the economic importance of weeds is in terms of the cost of production of crops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeding operation may comprise 30 per cent of the production cost . The hand labor involved in the first weeding of carrots and onions is very tedious , and the cost of this careful initial weeding is about thirty dollars an acre . ' Quite obviously then , any rapid , inexpensive method of killing weeds is a boon to farmers , and constitutes a discovery of the utmost practical importance . One of the most recent applications of fundamental scientific research has been the development of a type of selective " weed killer " which may in time eliminate once and for all the labor of the man with the hoe . Actually , the day may not be far distant when hand weeding will be referred to as a curious , backbreaking activity of our forefathers . The new weed killers , already being advertised in garden journals and the garden pages of Sunday newspapers , operate on an entirely fresh principle . Most of the weed killers known in the past have been chemicals which attacked the plant itself , or mechanical devices like flame throwers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer is an " auxin , " or " synthetic plant hormone , " and the very knowledge of the existence of hormones in plants is but twenty-five years old . Not only may our fields be freed from common weeds by the use of the new auxins , but already the auxins are being applied on a large scale to a host of other important practical problems in agriculture , horticulture , and silviculture , which we shall describe at the end of the chapter . As far as the practical world is concerned , then , there is no question but that the investigators in the field of plant hormones have really hit pay dirt . Let us go back in time , and briefly trace the history of this subject in order to discover how this most practical field of endeavor started and grew . We will see that not one of the // early investigators had the slightest idea that his results might , in so short a time , be of interest and importance to anyone outside the laboratory . No scientific story ever has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific ideas , it usually turns out that as we go further and further back in time , we end up with some concept of the Greeks . The ancient Greek thinkers are considered to have been the first scientists because in classical Greece , some five or six centuries before Christ , men first had the idea that the observable phenomena in the external world permitted of a complete rational explanation . Thus , the idea of atoms goes back to the Greek , Demokritos ; and the idea that the laws of nature should take the form of numerical relations goes back to the Greek , Plato , and to his predecessor , Pythagoras , whose theorem in geometry is still one of the requirements of the high school study of that subject . But the notion of plant hormones , or , more particularly , of growth hormones in plants , is of recent vintage and was entirely unknown not only to the Greeks , but also to the plant scientists of the last century . The significant work marking the beginning of our knowledge of this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin asked himself the question : Why do plants bend toward the light ? The experiments Darwin made in order to find the answer to this question were embodied in his last work , published two years before his death , entitled The Power of Movement in Plants . Darwin 's experiments , carried out in collaboration with his son Francis , were as simple as they were illuminating . He grew oat seedlings in total darkness save for a few seconds during which he held a lighted match near them . The seedlings responded by subsequently curving in their growth so as to point toward the place where the light had been . Furthermore , if he cut off the tip of the oat seedling before exposing it to the light , or if he covered the tip with a small black cap , no curvature took place . In other words , // even though most of the curvature occurs in the lower part of the seedling , the portion essential for a response to light is the tip . " We must therefore conclude , " Darwin wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral light , some influence is transmitted from the upper to the lower parts causing the latter to bend . " So radical were Darwin 's findings that they met with considerable opposition until other workers , chiefly W. Rothert ( 1894 ) and H. Fitting ( 1907 ) , established beyond any doubt Darwin 's observation of " the separation between the zones which perceive and the zones which react " to the light s The next step was to determine how this influence might be transmitted from the tip of a plant in order to affect other parts of the plant itself . At that time similar influences in animals were thought to be transmitted by a nervous system , and quite clearly an analogy to plants would have offered a simple explanation . No one was able to give a satisfactory explanation of Darwin 's experiments until the decisive investigations made during the years 1910 ? 1911 by P. Boysen-Jensen in his laboratory in Copenhagen . Like Darwin 's experiments , Boysen-Jensen 's were very simple . He cut off the tip of an oat seedling and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not grafted onto the stem , to become again a part of the seedling 's living structure , but was merely held in place by the gelatin . He then repeated Darwin 's experiment of growing the seedling in total darkness , save for a few minutes when it was exposed to a source of light . The result ? This seedling responded to light in exactly the same way as did all the others , and grew curved , pointing to the spot where the light had been . Whatever the " influence " might be that caused the seedling to respond to the light , it was certainly not a nerve impulse ; no nerve impulse ever passes through jelly . But a soluble chemical substance would do just that ; every college student of biology knows that salt and sugar pass easily through a thin layer of gelatin . Boysen-Jensen correctly concluded " that the transmission . . . is of a material nature . " Because of the importance of Boysen-Jensen 's experiment , it was repeated and extended by the Hungarian botanist , A. Paal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War . Paal showed that although the influence or stimulus of light could cross a layer of // gelatin from the tip to the rest of the plant , it was effectively blocked by mica , as well as by platinum foil . His next experiment was even more decisive . He showed that even without the influence of light , curvature could be induced in the base of the seedling by the simple process of cutting off the tip and replacing it off to one side of the stump , as in the figure . The curvature was caused by the fact that the side of the plant below the tip grew at a more rapid rate than the opposite side , which had no tip above it . From this experiment he correctly deduced that the " growth substance , " secreted from the tip even without the light stimulus , promotes the growth of the tissues in the lower part of the plant . ' The curving of the plant thus obtained by Paal was not only similar in appearance to that which occurred in Darwin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light , but evidently was caused in the same way . In Pad 's experiment the dis placement of the tip made one side of the shoot grow more rapidly than the other because it had received a greater quantity of the growth substance . The action of light had not produced the substance , but merely made it migrate to the dark , or shady side , and the shoot curved so that the tip appeared to point towards the light . Since the rate of growth of plants was apparently affected by a chemical substance , produced in the tip and acting upon the lower part of the plant , physiologists came to think of it as being similar to the hormones found in animals , which were already being ex tensively investigated . The concept of hormones had been developed by zoologists to ac-count for the many phenomena in which a secretion of one organ of an animal influences tissues in other parts of its body . It is eloquently described by Thimann : " The heroine of the dime novel , who is sud denly confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns as white as a sheet , her hair stands on end , and her eyes widen with horror . These effects result from her having received a dose of hormone ( adrenalin ) which is secreted in a special gland and travels about in the blood stream , causing the capillaries to contract all over the skin and scalp . " ' Many similar hormones are known and have been studied by physiologists . One such is the secretion of the pituitary gland , a subject investigated by the late Harvey Cushing , and brought to fruition by the labors of Herbert Evans and his associates in CaliAUXINS // fornia . The secretion of this gland determines whether animals and human beings will be giants , dwarfs , or of normal stature . The peculiarity of hormones , according to the authoritative definition given in 1904 by Bayliss and Starling , is " that they are produced in one organ and carried by the blood stream to another organ on which their effect is manifested . " ' Furthermore , hormones are characterized by the property of serving as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of others . Paal 's experiments seemed to indicate that a similar type of substance controls the growth of plants , although it must be noted that there is no blood stream in plants . Nevertheless , the ideas are similar , for a substance produced in one part of the plant apparently affected the growth in another . These substances are now known as " phyto-hormones " ( from the Greek word phyton , meaning plant ) , or growth substances , growth regulators , or growth hormones . Substances which belong to the type of growth hormone whose reaction may be measured by the curvature of seedlings are usually called " auxins , " a nomenclature first suggested in 1931 from the Greek word auxein , denoting increase , which is also the root of such words as augment and auction . The step following Paal 's in the development of our knowledge concerning plant hormones should be obvious to all readers : If plant growth is in fact promoted by a substance produced in the tips and distributed from them to the rest of the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties in detail . This important task was begun by the Dutch plant physiologist , F. W. Went , now of the California Institute of Technology , but who in 1928 was still in Holland . Went discovered that if the tips of seedlings were cut off and placed on a jelly of agar , the jelly itself then acquired the property of hastening the curvature of a shoot , when the jelly was applied to one side of it . The auxin evidently diffused from the tip into the agar , and from the agar back again into the plant . The curvatures which resulted were so regular that Went found the reaction could be used as a test for the existence and quantity of the auxin . Went 's brilliant researches indicated a means of obtaining auxin from the plant . But soon other and more plentiful sources were un92 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN covered . During the years 1930-1934 , two other Dutch scientists , F. Kogl and A. J. Haagen-Smit , found that certain cultures of bacteria and the urine of animals and human beings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Dutch scientists found three plant hormones : auxin A , auxin B , and indole-acetic acid . Meanwhile , cultures of fungi , another source of auxin , were being investigated ; in 1935 K. V. Thimann , working with Went in California , isolated the substance produced by fungi and showed it to be identical with one of the three substances found by Kogl and Haagen-Smit . An animal which eats a large quantity of plant material has no use for the growth substances in the plants , so it gets rid of them again in its urine . Since urine is easy to obtain in large quantities , and since it is well adapted to chemical treatment , it proved an ideal source for such material . Kogl and Haagen-Smit started with about forty gallons of urine , from which they were able to abstract several hundred milligrams of pure growth substance , an amount compared by F. S. Taylor to about one eighth of an aspirin tablet . " Small as this quantity may be , ten girls would have had to work ten hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth substance from the tips of seedlings . Improvements in the method of chemical analysis of small quantities ( discussed in a later chapter ) made possible a chemical study of the auxins . A great step forward took place just as the auxins were being isolated . This was the understanding of the distribution of auxin in the whole plant . Investigation showed that auxin is formed mainly in growing buds and young leaves ; the sequel to this was very important . Plants usually have a " leader " or terminal bud . If it is cut off , one of the other buds on the stem begins to grow , and takes its place , becoming the leader . In other words , this other bud was equally capable of growth all the time , but it did not grow so long as the terminal bud was present . Its growth seemed to be inhibited by the terminal bud , which produces relatively large quantities of auxin . Skoog and Thimann made the ingenious experiment of removing the leader bud , and putting in its place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were then inhibited to the very same exAUXINS // tent that they had been by the terminal bud itself . Thus it was revealed that the auxin which is produced by the terminal bud has two separate and distinct functions . First , it causes the stern below it to grow , and second , it prevents the buds below it from growing . This phenomenon proved to be but the first example of what was later recognized as a general principle : that auxin elicits different responses from different parts of the plant . Normally it causes the stems to grow while the buds are inhibited , but the reverse is not necessarily true ; that is , that if the buds grow , the stem does not . By using the right conditions , Skoog and Thimann found that the growth of the buds could be prevented without causing the stem to increase appreciably in length . At the same time another problem was being investigated : the formation of roots . Most readers know that under certain conditions , isolated parts of stems , called cuttings , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young buds or leaves on them . Therefore Went and Thimann thought that perhaps the formation of roots is controlled by an auxin . They undertook a series of investigations of this problem and discovered that certain preparations could be applied to cuttings which were not in condition to root , having been kept in the dark . These preparations not only caused roots to be formed , but the number of roots so formed was roughly proportionate to the concentration of the material used.12 Work was undertaken on the purification and isolation of the rootforming substance . Soon it was clear that the richest sources of this root-forming substance were the very same materials which had already proved to be the richest sources of auxin ? namely , urine and cultures of fungi . Went and Thimann became convinced , as they obtained the root-forming substance in a more and more purified form , that it must be identical with one of the auxins . This was proved when these two workers synthesized an auxin called indoleacetic acid , and found it to be highly active in producing roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been isolated by Kogl and Haagen-Smit from urine . This substance , known also as hetero-auxin , seems to be derived from protein and may be produced when tryptophane is exposed to ultraviolet light . The important feature of the discovery of indoleacetic acid is that , as organic compounds go , it is a fairly simple // chemical substance and can be synthesized from well-known and easily available chemicals in the laboratory or factory , and need not be obtained from gallons of urine , or from literally bushels of plant material . Indole is a material contained in coal tar and has been used for many years in making perfumes . The crude material has , according to F. S. Taylor , " a most unpleasant odor of the lavatory , but when highly purified has a delightful and persistent odor of flowers . " 13 One curious aspect of its synthesis is that it had been synthesized by two Japanese scientists ( Majima and Hoshino ) in 1925 , some eight years or so before it was found to be a growth substance . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability of , growth hormones would enable us to obtain larger plants . " Had , " asks F. S. Taylor , " the food of the gods really been found ? " But the vision of wheat plants as large as bamboos , and cabbages beneath whose shade a regiment might shelter , proved illusory . " Experiments showed that growth substances did not make the plants larger , but directed the point at which growth was to take place . The capital of the plant is made by the labor of leaf and root , the growth substances are the board of directors who give orders that the capital shall be expended in building an addition to the factory at some particular point . " 14 Normally , a root can not grow of itself , independent of the food provided it by the part of the plant above ground . But how independent are the parts of the plant above and below the ground ? For example , can we cause roots to grow all by themselves in a medium containing water , salts , and sugar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William J. Robbins reported in 1922 that isolated root growths might be obtained in some cases if one added yeast extract to the nutrient solution . Many years later , Dr. Robbins and another independent investigator discovered that vitamin B1 was the most important constituent of the yeast extract 16 It is now possible to grow flax roots indefinitely in a medium that contains salts , sugar , and vitamin B1 . Pea roots , however , require nicotinic acid as well as vitamin B1 , while tomato roots do not need nicotinic acid , but do need vitamin B6 . Thus , vitamin B1 is a general root-forming hormone in plants and is supplied to the root from the leaves , which produce it in the presence of sunlight . As // Went tells us , ' 8 growth hormones in plants may be vitamins for animals . " This means that the animal organism has completely lost the ability to form these substances and therefore has to derive them from its food . In plants this process has not progressed so far , and certain cells ( in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows how closely vitamins and hormones are connected and it also indicates the essential unity between plants and animals . " Plants produce vitamins , not in order to supply them to animals , but rather because they are " essential factors in their own lives . " The investigations begun by Went , and carried out by Went and Thimann , on the root-forming hormone indicated that one possible use of the growth substances would be to promote the rooting of cuttings . If a little indole-acetic acid and a given quantity of lanolin are made into an ointment and rubbed anywhere on the stem of a tomato plant , within a few weeks a bristling array of roots grows out from the stem at that point . Almost any kind of plant can be made to put forth roots in abnormal positions by the application of the growth hormones . Rooting from cuttings is of great importance in horticulture . The important flowers are not races or species , but rather hybrids , or single individuals , with particularly desirable characteristics . Flowers such as chrysanthemums are hybrids ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be identical to the parent chrysanthemums . The result of sowing a seed from such hybrids would be a miscellaneous batch of flowers , somewhat similar to the original perhaps , but far from being identical to it . On the other hand , if a small part of the stem ( that is , a cutting ) is taken and made to grow roots , the plant which results will be an exact replica of the " parent . " Thus , most of the fine varieties of plants can not be raised from seed , but only from cuttings . Furthermore , many species of trees and shrubs , which , unlike the hybrid flowers , could be raised from seed , are raised from cuttings instead ; because in this way a more rapid growth is obtained , with a saving of anywhere from two to four years . Hence , since most of the stock of the fancy gardener and nurseryman is raised from cuttings , he must make sure that the cuttings which he obtains will // actually take root and grow . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enshrouded in mystery , a person skilled in this profession could command an enormous salary , since the success or failure of a nursery might depend upon his skill . His knowledge was based on " experience " and on certain tricks which he had acquired from his father , or perhaps from other gardeners . Today the ready availability of commercial solutions of auxin enables anyone with a reasonable amount of skill to use a prepared solution of plant hormone , which will almost guarantee that cuttings soaked in it will take immediate root . Curiously enough , gardeners do not purchase pure hormone in bulk to make up their own solutions , but prefer to buy ready-made solutions . The reason is that the concentration of the hormone is extremely important . If the solution is too weak , it has little or no effect . If it is too strong , it will actually retard growth , causing the base of the plant to spread and the top to be retarded , so that even if the plant survives the strong solution , it will be stunted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as efficacious , he is sadly mistaken . ) The concentration is very small , being about one part of growth hormone to ten or twenty thousand parts of water ? no more than a teaspoonful of salt would be to five gallons of water ! It must not be thought , however , that the taking and planting of cuttings has now become an entirely mechanical job . To take cuttings from some herbaceous plants , such as delphinium , is still very difficult , whereas others , such as dahlias or chrysanthemums , may be rooted as easily as seeds may be planted . While the use of auxin will generally cause the rapid appearance of a bristling array of roots wherever it is applied , there is one major exception . In some plants , including notably pine , spruce , oak , and apple trees , one finds what is known as the " age effect . " Cuttings taken from such varieties as the northern red oak or bright pine will root with the application of auxin if they are taken from a tree three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from a tree that is much older , say twenty years old , it will not root at all , no matter how much auxin is applied . Why this should be so , nobody yet has any clear idea . Here is a problem for the future'T // The transformation of the gardener 's art which we have just described was the first practical application of the new knowledge . Another , now receiving wide use in horticulture , depends on a fact we ' have referred to earlier , namely , that auxins may inhibit , as well as promote , growth . In apples and many other fruits , the long shoots are purely vegetative , while the flowers are born on short shoots or spurs 18 Mature leaves or fruits fall from the main part of the plant itself , because of the development of a special layer of cells at the base of the leaf or fruit stalk . The walls of the cells forming this special layer fall apart readily , so that the whole stalk is severed . The formation of this special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively produce auxin . An external application of auxin to the fruit stalk or petiole prevents the falling of the fruit , just as does the presence of the auxin normally produced in the plant itself . Many acres of apple trees are now annually sprayed with auxin during the early fall , in order to keep the apples on the trees a few weeks longer , enabling them to reach fullest maturity , and reducing the losses which orchardists used to suffer because of windfall and pre-harvest drop . Another interesting and useful application of the auxins stems from the research made many years ago in Germany by Fitting ( whose work we have discussed earlier ) , in which he discovered that when certain varieties of orchids are fertilized by the application of pollen to the stigma , the petals soon fall off and the ovary begins to swell . Further experimentation by Fitting showed that the pollen itself is not needed to produce this effect , but that an extract from the pollen will produce the same effect . The swelling of the ovary is not due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance in the pollen grains . This substance is also an auxin , which is present in the pollen in very considerable amounts . The phenomenon is a general one . By simply applying auxin to the ovary or stigma without pollen , that organ can be made to swell up into a fruit which has not been fertilized and which therefore does not contain seeds . Seedless tomatoes , seedless squash , seedless peppers , and even seedless watermelons have been produced in this way by Dr. Gustafson and his co-workers in the University of Michigan . This interesting application of auxin to produce seedless fruit // and vegetables has not as yet received the very wide use in horticulture which is certain to come about in the future . But the most dramatic use of auxin is that one which eventually will straighten the back of the man with the hoe , by killing the weeds against whose encroachment he eternally struggles . Theologians have always held that man would not return to the Garden of Eden until he had achieved the state of grace befitting God 's paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return to a possible state of Eden ? at the same time that the physicist , his brother scientist , has uncovered the formulas by which the earth itself may perhaps be totally destroyed by an atomic blast , an event that would necessitate a new Creation and a new Eden if life were to continue . So it is that Science sharpens the inner meaning of the ancient prophecies . It is recorded in the majestic cadences of the English Old Testament how , after the fall of man , God said , " Cursed is the ground for thy sake : in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life . " The descendents of Adam , laboring in the fields , were to be plagued by insects and weeds . " Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee . " During the last few years two developments achieved by the chemist give promise to lift , in some measure , the curse put upon Adam . DDT provides an effective means of combating insects , while an auxin with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the weeds , including the thistles . This new weed-killing chemical , applied in a spray , or dust , or aerosol , and in such a small quantity that it may be measured in parts per million rather than in pounds or gallons , will kill most of the broad-leaved annuals in fields , a category that includes almost all important or common noxious weeds . Yet at the same time 2,4-D produces no deleterious effect on the most valuable of all plants to man ? the principal fodder for his animals , and his own most important food plants ? the grasses , grains , and cereals : including corn , wheat , rice , barley , millet , and many others , as well as sugar cane . 2,4-D has proved successful in destroying such common weeds as // lamb 's quarters and pigweed . Fields of young oats and wheat containing a variety of weeds , such as mustard and wild radish , have been treated with 2,4-D and the weeds successfully eliminated without adversely affecting the wheat or oats . Rice fields have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an airplane . Of particular interest to home owners is the ease with which an application of 2,4-D frees grass lawns of dandelions and narrowleaf plantains , without injury to the grass . 2,4-D will also destroy poison ivy plants . 2,4-D is effective against noxious weeds ? that is , weeds that are so efficient as competitors of useful crops that they have thus far thwarted the . efforts of man to control them by any other means . These include , among many others , wild thistle , knapweed , English plantain , wild oats , quack grass , and so on . In one of the first tests , a dilution of only several hundred parts of 2,4-D per million killed perennial bindweed on nursery fruit trees : a notable achievement , as it was pointed out in a report in Science , because bindweed " is considered the number one enemy of crops ( herbaceous and woody ) . " " As test after test indicated the effectiveness and the cheapness of this easily applied weed killer , new areas in which control was needed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them eliminate climbers and woody plants from their rights of way . Sewage engineers discovered that 2,4-D would , for one year at any rate , clear the sewers and streams of the southern part of the United States , which are annually clogged with water hyacinth . It was found that common sources of pollen allergy ( hay fever ) , notably ragweed , could be easily eradicated from parks , vacant lots , and back yards , by spraying with 2,4-D ; while , at the same time , the vicious marihuana plant would also be destroyed . In the summer of 1946 the Health Commissioner of New York City embarked on a large-scale program to rid New York of irritating and dangerous weeds by spraying 2,4-D , using the regular equipment on the trucks used for other purposes by the Department of Sanitation . The success of that campaign convinced the Commissioner of the advisability of repeating it in 1947 , and of enlisting the co-operation of neighboring cities and towns . T00 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN So remarkable were the first tests of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies in America and in England undertook extensive experiments . Within a single year , interest on the part of commercial companies had been aroused to such an extent that large-scale manufacture of 2,4-D was undertaken and the price per pound dropped from $I25 to $3 . The fact that this reduction in price was possible reflects not only the increase in demand , but also the more important fact that 2,4-D is relatively easy to manufacture , as compared to many organic chemical compounds2 ? Last summer the average cost of the new weed killer was well under $5 an acre , and more than thirty different preparations containing 2,4-D were on the market . This summer , an even greater number of preparations are available to the farmer , gardener , and home owner . Barely out of the first stages of experimentation , 2,4-D seems to offer almost everything we ask of a weed killer . It is cheap . It is not difficult to use . It is noncorrosive , nonexplosive , and generally nonirritating to the skin . 2,4-D may be handled without undue precautions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the minute quantities necessary to kill weeds , it apparently produces no harmful effects on fish , animals , or human beings , who eat it . Fish have continued to live unharmed in water treated with 2,4-D for the elimination of water hyacinth . Cows have grazed in pastures sprayed with 2,4-D without showing any ill effects . Applied in small amounts ? in a quantity , remember , measured in parts per million ? no traces of 2,4-D have been found in the milk of such cows , although a very small quantity has been detected in the bloodstream . However , if animals imbibe an enormous quantity of 2,4-D , a marked physiological disorder will ensue , with symptoms very like certain well-known muscle diseases 2 ' The full name of 2,4-D is " **26;423;TOOLONG acid . " Its discovery was made known a few years ago when it was included in a list of chemicals having " growth-regulative properties , " in a patent assigned by Lontz to E. I. du Pont de Ivlemours and Company22 In other words , 2,4-D is an auxin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . // The latest aspect of the subject of auxins has been the production in the laboratory of chemical substances which affect growth in much the same way as the three naturally occurring auxins : auxin A , auxin B , and indole-acetic acid . The best current practice reserves the expression " plant hormone " for these three auxins found in growing plants , and uses the more general word " auxin " to denote the whole class of substances that affect plant growth ? irrespective of whether they are produced by nature in the plants , or by the chemist in his laboratory . It had long been known that whereas small doses of auxin would promote growth , larger doses were toxic and killed the plant . Some of the auxins affected some types of plants more than others , thus giving the key to possible weed-killing . " Naphthalene-acetic acid " was first used in England with good results , but proved to be too expensive for any large-scale application . " 2,4,5-T " also has been used . But no substance has yet been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its many other superiorities , is stable against soil bacteria . Knowing that 2,4-D is an auxin , many people have had the mistaken idea that it acts by producing such rapid growth that the plants , so to speak , " grow to death . " We have not yet discovered all the secrets of growth , in either plants or animals . No one knows exactly by what mechanism the auxins affect growth in just the way they do , any more than anyone fully understands why certain cells in cancer grow suddenly and at an unprecedented rate . We do know , however , that when a seedling is killed by 2,4-D , this action may occur in so short a time that very little growth takes place at all . It is still a mystery why 2,4-D should produce a toxic effect on some plants and not on others . The plants it destroys , the common weeds , are broad-leaved annuals ; they are also of the class known as dicotyledons , whereas those it leaves unaffected are monocotyledons . 2,4-D is not the only synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stability against soil bacteria are the factors that have caused it to be adopted , rather than other known weed killers . Considering the large number of research " workers in this field , we shall probably know soon just why an auxin such as 2,4-D acts in the selective way it does . When that time comes , we may be in a position to manufacture in the laboratories weed-killing auxins of an IO2 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN even greater selectivity , by applying the newly discovered knowledge to this problem . The important point is that 2,4-D is not only a new and better chemical for weed killing ; it represents a whole new ap proach to the problem ? that of using auxins to control weed growth. * This account by no means exhausts the present applications of auxins . Some others are : to stiffen the stalks of plants that would otherwise bend over owing to a heavy load of seeds , or the action of rain and wind ; and to prevent bud formation in stored plants . The development of the auxins exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both plant and animal physiology . First , a naturally occurring substance is isolated . Then , the chemist produces one or more of these substances synthetically in the laboratory . Fi nally , the chemist synthesizes new compounds , never found in nature at all , but which act in much the same way as the naturally occurring ones ; they may be easier to manufacture or to use , cheaper , or more effective for certain purposes . The first scientists investigating this field certainly had no idea that the results of their research would yield so soon a practical result of great importance in agriculture . Part of the original work , as we have seen , was concerned with photo-tropism , or the effect upon plant movement of the action of light . Initiated by Charles Darwin and his son , such research was extended primarily because plant scientists were curious as to the cause of this strange phenomenon , whereby so little light , as that from a match burning for only two or three minutes , could cause such a marked effect on plant growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators showed conclusively that the light itself did not produce this effect , but simply caused a non-symmetrical distribution of a growth substance in the plant . That this substance and others like it might eventually be used for the practical ends we have described was an astonishing result , even to those plant physiologists who had investigated the plant hormones , isolated them , and gradually uncovered their properties . After all , // the only obvious end product of such research was to find the answer to the nursery rhyme , appropriately placed at the beginning of the standard treatise on Phytohormones by Went and Thimann : Oats , peas , beans , and barley grow , Oats , peas , beans , and barley grow , Can you , or I , or anyone know How oats , peas , beans , and barley grow ? Had anyone in the early ' twenties gone to the laboratory of Boysen-Jensen , Paal , Kogl and Haagen-Smit , or Went and Thimann , to enlist their aid in the practical problem of finding weed killers , and had these same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fundamental research in which they were engaged would have been stopped ; they would have pursued the more conventional methods of approach to the problem , such as the use of poisonous chemicals , oils , mechanical devices , or flame throwers . Only because these investigators were not interested in the practical problem of killing weeds , and because they were interested in investigating a series of plant phenomena , with the aim of increasing knowledge and adding to the scope of fundamental research , did mankind gain the simple solution to the problem of killing weeds , as well as all the other benefits accruing from the application of the auxins. // The Electric Current and Radio If there is no other use discovered of electricity , this , however , is something considerable , that it may help to make a vain man humble . ? BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ( 1747 ) UNTIL ABOUT a hundred years ago , power could not be transmitted more than a few feet from the point at which it was developed . The use of electric power , by contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of miles from the point at which the power is applied . The steam engine operates by converting the potential heat energy of coal or wood into mechanical energy , or the energy of motion ; harnessing the forces of expansion and contraction as water vaporizes into steam and steam condenses into water . A plant or factory run by steam must have transported to it the coal which is the source of power . A plant run by electricity , on the other hand , has transported to it not the source of power , but the actual power itself . The source , whether a hydroelectric system located at a dam , or a dynamo or generator operated by steam , may be , and usually is , situated far from the plant where the power is delivered and used . As those emi nent historians of technology , Hugh and Margaret Vowles , tell us , " The coming of steam was revolutionary enough , changing the whole face of industry and creating an altogether unprecedented type of civilization . But without electricity , steam power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The conversion of energy from one form to another is a fairly common phenomenon in our industrial civilization . We use the mechanical energy developed by a steam engine to run a generator , send the electrical energy along wires to the point where it is needed , // and there use it to run a motor ? that is , convert it back again into mechanical energy . The technical age in which we live , drawing heavily on the re-sources of electrical power , owes a great debt to the electric generator and motor . But , although the generator run by steam or water power provides an economical means of producing electrical energy as compared to the chemical action in a battery , we must be able to transmit that energy cheaply and efficiently . When we send electrical energy from one place to another , a cer-tain amount of it is always used up " in heating the wires . " In any electrical circuit , the energy used in this way in a given amount of time depends on the square of the current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied . Thus , if we send ro amperes of cur-rent over a certain system for a period of 20 minutes , the energy used up in the transmission is roo ( that is , ro X ro ) times as much as if we sent only r ampere of current . But , the reader may ask , can we get as much work done with r ampere as we can with ro ? The answer depends on the voltage at which the current is supplied . The electric energy available to do work ( unlike the energy losses in transmission , which we saw depend on the square of the current ) is a function of the voltage multiplied by the current . For example , an appliance that is rated at ioo watts requires r ampere of current sup-plied at ioo volts , or 2 amperes of current at 5o volts , or 20 amperes of current at 5 volts , or %Z ampere at zoo volts , or even 1/too am-pere at Io , 000 volts . In our homes and business establishments in most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 115 volts because it is dangerous to use the higher voltages , which also aggravate the problem of proper insulation . But we need not ad-here to such a limit when transmitting the electrical energy from the power station to our homes . Suppose we wish to provide electrical energy to a small residential village , consisting of roo homes . If , during the evening , each home owner uses ro amperes of current , then the village must be supplied with moo amperes at rro volts . During each second , the village uses up moo X rro units of electrical energy , rro , 000 units per second , called " watts , " that is , the village consumes energy at the rate of rro , 000 watts . But we can send that same amount of energy to the village at a voltage of rro , 000 volts and a current of only r ampere ; Io6 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN and then the losses in getting the energy from the power station to the village would be reduced , not by a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by I000 X woo or t , 000,000l The efficient way to use electrical power generated at a source some distance from the place where it is to be used is to have a device for transforming energy delivered at low current and high voltage to energy available at a relatively higher current and lower voltage . Such a device is aptly named a " transformer . " By its use , we can take advantage of inexpensive sources of power to run our generators , such as natural waterfalls ( Niagara Falls ) or man-made dams ( TVA ) , even though they are located at a great distance from our cities , where most of the electrical energy is to be used . Anyone who travels in the country has seen the high-voltage or " high-tension " lines ? 3 or 6 copper cables of about 3/4 of an inch in diameter , suspended about 75 feet above the ground on giant steel pylons , transmitting electrical energy , sometimes at as high as 22o,000 volts . From the hydroelectric power plants at Niagara , electrical energy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 6o,000 volts . Outside the city limits , the transformers in the substations reduce the voltage to about 2000 volts and the electrical energy is then distributed throughout the city to factories , homes , and the city lighting and traction systems . Before entering the buildings , additional transformers step the voltage down still further to Ito or 220 volts . Since a transformer works only on alternating current ( A.C. ) and not direct ( D.C. ) , we may understand why it is that whenever we send electrical energy over long distances , we use A.C. and never D.C. The realization of our modern electrified world depended , to an extraordinary degree , upon the discoveries of Michael Faraday . His brilliant researches uncovered the principles of the generator and the electric motor , making it possible to produce electrical energy by inexpensive mechanical action rather than by expensive chemical action , and at the same time making it possible to use the electrical energy to do mechanical work , such as propelling an elevator or trolley car , running a lathe , and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate and use electrical energy , they also uncovered the principle of the transformer , which has enabled us to send A.C. efficiently over long distances . Before delineating Faraday 's career , let me reassert that I have no interest whatever in pitting in contest , one against the other , the genius of the scientist , like Faraday , who makes fundamental discoveries , and that of the inventor or engineer who , like Edison , works out ways in which such discoveries may be used . Yet it must be pointed out that a fundamental discovery in science may be mother to a multitude of different inventions . The principles discovered by Faraday have been used in a thousand different ways and form the basic knowledge on which hundreds of thousands of patents have been issued . Nevertheless , Faraday 's work , like that of other contributors to electrical knowledge ? Maxwell , Hertz , Volta , Galvani , and Franklin ? while vastly productive of innovations which have greatly affected our daily lives , was carried out simply in the desire to increase fundamental knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . At the end of the eighteenth century , electrical knowledge consisted largely of what we denote as " static electricity " or " electrostatics , " the subject of electricity at rest , as on charged bodies , and in motion only in large sudden discharges as in the case of a stroke of lightning or the rapid discharge of a " Leyden jar " or condenser . This is the part of electricity with which , as we saw in Chapter 5 , Franklin 's name will always be connected . Soon after Franklin had finished his work , Galvani , the Italian doctor and anatomist , made the chance observation which his compatriot Volta extended so as to complete the " discovery " of the electric current . Volta 's research showed how to make an electric battery and provided experimenters with a means of obtaining a continuous or steady electric current . Sir Humphry Davy used it to isolate in a pure state , for the first time , such chemical elements as sodium and potassium . Many scientists wondered whether there were some relation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , by the use of an electric current it might be possible to produce magnetic effects . The way in which an electric current affects a magnet was discovered in 1819 or 182o , as the result of a I08 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN " happy accident , " just as Galvani 's original observation of the frog was made by chance . Like many other experimenters , Hans Christian Oersted had tried to produce an effect upon a magnetic compass needle by placing a wire carrying an electric current at right angles to it , but to no avail . One day at the end of a lecture on electricity , " as he had used a strong Galvanic battery for other experiments he said , Let us now once , if the battery is in activity , try to place the wire parallel with the needle . ' As this was made he was struck with perplexity by seeing the needle make a great oscillation , almost at right angles with the magnetic meridian . Then he said Let us now invert the direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original quaintness , comes from a letter written to Michael Faraday by Professor Chr . Hansteen , who frequently assisted Oersted in his experiments . He continues : " Thus the great detection was made , and it has been said , not without reason , that he tumbled over it by accident . ' He had not before any more idea than any other person.that the force should be transversal . But as La Grange has said of Newton in similar occasion , Such accidents only meet persons who deserve them . ' " 2 This great discovery of Oersted 's probably has the unique distinction of being the only important scientific discovery ever made before students in the lecture room . Oersted 's experience demonstrates why an apparently simple phenomenon may not be observed for a long time . Most of the experimenters had supposed that the current in a wire would act on a magnetic needle in such a way as to make the needle turn until it was parallel to the wire . This was a logical enough conclusion , because if you placed a magnet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic needle , the latter would orient itself parallel to the bar . Following the analogy , and thinking that a wire carrying a current might behave like a long wire-shaped magnet , the experimenters had placed their wire at right angles to the needle , expecting to see the magnetic needle swing about . Oersted , happily , not only placed his wire parallel to the needle to begin with , but also had a sufficiently powerful battery to deliver the extremely large electric current necessary to show that an electric current can affect a magnetic needle . // Once magnetism had been produced from electricity , or rather a magnetic effect had been produced by an electric current , the next problem was to discover whether or not an electric current could be produced from magnets . This step was taken by Michael Faraday . Faraday 's biography reads like a Horatio Alger story and might well be entitled " From Newsboy and Bookbinder 's Apprentice to the Greatest Scientist of His Time . " Completely self-educated , he rose by dint of his innate ability , perseverance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution in London , where his experiments over a considerable period of years set the seal to his eternal fame . One of the interesting aspects of greatness in science is that the truly heroic figures are celebrated for many discoveries , never just one . Isaac Newton 's greatness would survive had he made but one of the four important contributions with which his name is associated : the calculus , the law of universal gravitation , the laws of motion , and the nature of white and colored light . Likewise Albert Einstein 's name would be great in the annals of twentieth-century science even if he had never expounded the general theory of relativity and had only discovered the equations of the Brownian movement , the Einstein-De Haas effect , the corpuscular theory of light in the explanation of the photoelectric effect , or the equations governing the relations between mass and energy which resulted from the restricted theory of relativity . The case is the same with Michael Faraday . Had he done nothing except in the field of chemistry , where he discovered the fundamental laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzene for the first time , he would still be remembered as one of the great men of the nineteenth century , if not of all time . His motto in scientific inquiry was , " Let the imagination go , guarding it by judgment and principle , but holding it in and directing it by experiment . " ' Thus he wrote , " Nature is our kind friend and best critic in experimental science if we only allow her intimations to fall unbiased on our minds . Nothing is so good as an experiment which , while it sets an error right , gives as a reward for our humility an absolute advance in knowledge . " 4 IIO SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN Faraday 's electrical researches were motivated by a conviction " that the various forms under which the forces of nature are made manifest have one common origin , or in other words are so directly related and mutually dependent that they are convertible , as it were , one into the other , and possess equivalence of power in their action . " ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gravitation . The phenomenon whereby the plane of polarization of light in a crystal of heavy lead glass is related to a magnetic field , in honor of its finder , is called the " Faraday effect . " The principle of induced currents will likewise always be associated with his name although some independent observations of the same effect were made contemporaneously by Joseph Henry in the United States . These discoveries form the bedrock on which contemporary science , technology , and civilization are reared . Stripped to its barest essentials , Faraday 's great experiment may be reduced to the following terms . Faraday wound two separate coils of wire around an iron ring . One he attached to a battery through a switch , and the other to a sensitive galvanometer , an instrument which records the flow of small currents . When he closed or opened the switch , he noticed that the current flowed through the secondary coil ( the one attached to the galvanometer ) ? but only at the instant of closing or opening the switch in the circuit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus in one experiment Faraday discovered the principle of induced currents and the instrument we call today the " transformer . " He was quick to recognize that the reason why current flowed only at the instant of opening and closing the switch in the primary coil circuit was the fact that , as the current built up or decayed , the magnetic field threading through the secondary coil was in a state of flux or change . To prove this point , he took a coil connected to a galvanometer and inserted into it an ordinary bar magnet , which he then withdrew . He found , as he had expected he would , that while the magnet was in motion a current flowed , but if the magnet were held still , the flow of current would stop . Furthermore , he was able to show that moving the coil instead of the magnet produced the same effect . In another experiment , Faraday placed a metal disk between the THE ELECTRIC CURRENT AND RADIO III poles of a horseshoe motor . Two wires were pressed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mounted on an axle , and the other at the outermost edge ? and the wires were connected to a galvanometer . As the disk turned , a small current was generated . Faraday 's experiments uncovered the principles of induced cur-rents , and also the theoretical basis of the generator and the trans-former ? that is , the basic knowledge which made possible the production of electrical energy and the satisfactory transmission of A.C. Every generator that has ever been built makes use of Faraday 's " induced " currents and is , in some form or other , merely an adapta tion of the fact that an electric current is induced in a wire whenever it is waved in front of a magnet ( whether a steel magnet or an electromagnet ) or a magnet is waved in front of a wire . An electric motor , furthermore , is simply a generator run in reverse . In an ordinary generator * we apply mechanical energy ? steam or water power ? to make the motor turn , thereby releasing electrical energy . But if we apply electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor to turn and harness that motion in the form of mechanical energy ; in other words , our generator is now an electric motor . Faraday made his great and wonderful discoveries because of his quasi-religious conviction that the forces of nature , such as elec tricity and magnetism , must be convertible one into the others His belief in the essential unity of apparently diverse natural phenomena was vindicated by other discoveries of his . For example the successful liquefaction of chlorine , which is a gas at ordinary temperatures and pressures , showed that the distinction between common liquids and gases was not one of kind , but merely of environmental conditions . And he opened up a whole new field of scientific research by show ing that magnetism is not an isolated phenomenon confined to iron , and perhaps also cobalt and nickel , but that magnetic effects of vari ous sorts could be demonstrated in all solids ( and even in gases ! ) , in a smaller degree . C*0 While Faraday took but little interest in applying his discoveries , he was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II2 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN who wished to apply the new discoveries not for commercial use , but for the so-called " magneto-electric light " to be used in lighthouses . Faraday himself wrote in 1831 , " I have rather been desirous of discovering new facts and new relations dependent on magnetic electrical induction than of exalting the force of those already obtained . " If his own interest was primarily to advance the outermost fringes of knowledge rather than to put his own discoveries to use , he nevertheless declared that he was assured that practical applications " would find their full development hereafter . " ' We know that Faraday did not spurn the world of practical affairs . One would hardly expect that he would , he who had begun life as a manual laborer in a bookbinding establishment . He was , for example , primarily responsible for the adoption of gutta-percha , so-called India rubber , as an insulator for conducting wires in preference to the commonly used cloth windings ' He also served on many practical commissions , such as those to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacture of optical glass . Faraday was once consulted by Cyrus Field in connection with the proposed Atlantic cable . Faraday told the American entrepreneur that he doubted the possibility of getting a message all the way across the Atlantic . Intensely disturbed by his doubt and knowing that the principle of the telegraph was closely associated with Faraday 's own work , Field pressed him to investigate the problem thoroughly , offering to pay him any fee he desired . Faraday declined remuneration but worked on the problem and finally replied , " It can be done , but you will not get an instantaneous message . " Field , somewhat but not entirely encouraged , inquired , " How long will it take ? " " Oh , perhaps a second . " " Well , " replied Field , " that 's quick enough for me , " and proceeded with his heroic project . ' Although Faraday had discovered the principles by the 183o 's , not until the 187o 's did the cumulative efforts of a vast number of inventors , of which the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly successful dynamo and motor and make the use of electricity commercially feasible io What a long step it was from the principles to the practice ! The world can hardly be said to have become electrified until the beginTHE // ping of the twentieth century . The electrification of Russia did not begin until after the Bolshevik revolution . And today , despite our vaunted progress , most of Asia and great areas of continental Europe as well as our own United States do not yet have electric power available for either commercial or household use . Considering how many years of first-class thinking were necessary before the development of the modern electric motor , dynamo , and generator , one may well wonder whether even the genius of Faraday would have been sufficiently great to have allowed him to solve the problem had he turned his mind to it . The development of practical electricity , especially the use of alternating currents , demanded not simply the devising of new gadgets , but the discovery of new physical laws and effects ; also the introduction , into practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of the time of Faraday , with Faraday 's background and training , if present at a power engineering conference of today would understand as little of the talk as a man from Mars . Yet the record is clear that the discovery of the electric current , with its many practical aspects in our society , derived entirely from the work of scientists like Faraday , who , like those who investigated the reaction of plants to light , had no other aim in view than the increase of knowledge . In the same way the discovery of x-rays by Roentgen derived from an interest in a new effect which seemed so strange that his natural curiosity was sufficiently aroused . It is highly to be doubted whether x-ray analysis could ever have been discovered by any group of men , however well-trained and however brilliant their genius might have been , who decided at the turn of the century to seek a method for examining the interior organs and structure of the human body , or for testing metal castings . A most startling example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is afforded by the development of the electromagnetic theory by Clerk-Maxwell , who extended Faraday 's ideas about the way in which electrical " action " occurs . n4 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN One body may affect another in two different ways . One is by contact , as in the case of a stick pushing a box which it touches or a horse pulling a wagon with which it is connected by traces . The other is called " action at a distance , " in which one body draws another to it or pushes it away , even though separated from it and with no apparent physical contact . An example of the latter may be found in the universal gravitation discovered by Isaac Newton , according to which every body in the universe attracts to itself every other body in the universe , whether it be an apple attracted by the earth or the earth attracted by the sun . In the seventeenth century many scientists found the idea of " action at a distance " repugnant because it smacked of an occultism or mystery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies supposedly exerted upon the lives of human beings . So abhorrent did this idea seem to Galileo that he rejected completely the possibility of the moon 's influencing the tides , even though there seemed to be a close correlation between tidal phenomena and the position of the moon . Newton himself , considering the whole problem in a famous series of letters to Bentley , came to the conclusion that the " action at a distance " of one heavenly body upon another must arise somehow from an alteration of , or strain in , the medium which separates two bodies gravitationally attracting each other . Faraday believed that electrical attraction and repulsion could be explained in the same way . In order to explain this abstraction let us consider a simple example . If we run a comb through our hair on a dry wintry day the comb will become electrically charged , usually negatively . This charged comb then has the property of attracting to itself small bits of paper , dust , hair , or straw . If we take two such charged combs and suspend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will repel each other with considerable force . We say that each of these two charged bodies " acts " on the other . But this does not explain how the action is produced . We know also that such a charged comb will attract to itself a piece of glass which has been rubbed with silk . We explain this phenomenon by saying , following the terminology introduced by Franklin , that the comb is charged negatively and the glass positively , and that two positively charged bodies will repel each other , // as will two negatively charged bodies ; but a positively and negatively charged pair of bodies will always attract each other . By experiment Coulomb determined a quantitative law , by means of which we can compute the value of the force which two charged bodies will exert on each other . But , exact as this knowledge is , it does not explain how one charged body affects another at a considerable distance . We likewise can compute the force with which one magnet will attract another , but this law of attraction likewise does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are certainly related , because the experiments of Oersted and Faraday showed how electricity can give rise to magnetic effects and magnetism to electrical ones . And the work of the great French scientist , Ampere , whose name is celebrated in the unit of current , showed how even the natural magnetism of a lodestone could be reduced to electrical terms . Faraday conceived that bodies affecting each other electrically or magnetically were separated by an elastic medium ; and that there were " lines of force , " very much like stretched rubber bands , which originated in north poles of magnets or positive charges and ended respectively in south poles of magnets or negative charges . Extending through space , these lines of force , being under tension like a stretched rubber band , drew the bodies together ; but , since these lines of force were mutually repellent , they pushed bodies apart in cases of repulsion . These lines of force came to be understood as strains in the " ether , " an all-pervading medium whose chief property was to transmit waves or vibrations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium , but many did not accept Faraday 's ideas because they doubted whether the medium necessary to the transmission of light waves could also adequately account for electrical and magnetic action 's Maxwell was a great admirer of Michael Faraday , and was firmly convinced that Faraday 's genius had provided new and lofty standpoints from which to consider electrical and , therefore , magnetic phenomena . He asked himself what properties a medium such as the ether would have to have to account for the transmission of electromagnetic effects . He discovered , amongst other things , that such a medium would transmit a variety of electromagnetic waves I16 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN with a velocity exactly equal to that of light . His careful measurements showed that a system of electrical units based on electricity at rest ( electrostatic ) was related to a system based on electricity in motion ( as in a current , electromagnetic ) by exactly the factor of the speed of light . Maxwell built an imposing mathematical structure based on these observations and pointed out that any medium which could truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , his famous electromagnetic theory provided a unity between theories of electricity ( including magnetism ) and theories of optics . One interesting conclusion to which his theory led was the statement that electromagnetic effects are transmitted with a finite velocity . Everyone knows that the position of a delicately suspended needle in a compass is affected by a magnet placed near it . If the magnet is shifted , the needle will turn to one side or the other . So far as our senses can judge , the action happens instantaneously ; the needle turns at the very instant that the magnet is displaced . But Maxwell said , " No ! Not at the same instant , but only after a certain definite interval of time . " If this seems to contradict the experience of our senses , he explained that if the distance between the magnet and the compass needle were one foot , the time of transmission of the effect would be only one billionth part of a second i2 But if Maxwell 's theory were true , then certainly we should expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such an experiment was not made in England . The reason for that may well be , as suggested by Sir Arthur Schuster , that Maxwell was surrounded by a number of young physicists who so firmly believed in his electromagnetic theory that it did not seem necessary to furnish an experimental proof of their master 's theoretical deductions 13 But on the Continent , others had a different mind . The great Helmholtz , pioneer in many different branches of science , suggested to one of his most brilliant pupils , Heinrich Hertz , that he take up the experimental investigation of the problem . Hertz was faced with formidable experimental difficulties . A whole book could be written about the way in which he accepted the task and succeeded in convincing the scientific world at large of the truth of Maxwell 's theory . Hertz not only showed that the time of transmission required by Maxwell 's theory was correct , but // he also demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves in space , which we now call Hertzian Waves . " Today we know that this category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , radiant heat , cosmic rays , x-rays , and certain types of radiation from radioactive substances . These are all examples of one fundamental type of electromagnetic radiation . Although they differ in the frequency or wave length , the speed with which all move is the same . This speed , 186,000 miles per second , has proved to be one of the fundamental constants of the universe . It is the limiting velocity that no motion can exceed . It is , furthermore , the constant that tells us the relation between the mass of any object and the energy which can be obtained from it , a relation which is the very basis of any considerations of atomic energy . The Hertzian Waves , their discoverer found , had very interesting properties . They could be transmitted through the walls of a building , and they could also be reflected from metal surfaces . Soon after their discovery , a great many investigators conceived the idea that they might be applied to problems of communication , and the success of Marconi in devising the first wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Yet it is interesting to see that the radio , which has so profoundly affected the world in a variety of ways , derived from the experiments of Hertz , whose primary concern was to discover whether or not an experimental proof could be had of Maxwell 's conclusion that a medium which would account for electrical action would also account for the transmission of light . Clearly , it is not entirely correct to state that the radio begins with " the experiments of a German professor . " Hertz was bringing to experimental fruition the theoretical conclusions of Maxwell , which were a sophisticated mathematical improvement of Faraday 's more primitive ideas . Hertz 's great experiments of 1887 were made possible by the knowledge that a spark obtained from the discharge of a Leyden jar is oscillatory , a fact derived by calculation from the principle of the conservation of energy by Helmholtz just forty years earlier , but suspected by Franklin more than a century before . But II$ SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN the invention of the radio was made by Marconi , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement from that time until today was made possible by the contributions of countless physicists , engineers , and inventors . The development of radar , one of the great innovations of the recent war , goes back also to Hertz 's experiments , those in which he showed that radio waves ( Hertzian Waves ) are reflected from metallic objects . The results of these experiments , however , were applied for the first time not during the years of the recent war , but in 1904 when a German engineer was granted a patent in England as well as in Germany on a proposed method for using the principle discovered by Hertz in an obstacle detector and navigational aid for ships . " One important difference between the radar developed during the war and the proposal of the German patent of 1904 is the fact that wartime radar used very short wave lengths , whereas the German patent used the very much longer wave lengths of the sort produced by Hertz . Yet as early as June , 1922 , the great inventor of radio himself , Marconi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineers held in New York that short waves be used in the future for detecting purposes " Although the entire history of radio and radar illustrates to a high degree the great truth that important practical innovations frequently derive from research whose avowed aim was simply the increase of knowledge , let us not forget that the applications are usually not made by the original research workers , in this case Maxwell and Hertz , but by the practical men who are keen enough and sufficiently well educated to appreciate the possibilities latent in a new truth . // Synthetic Rubber and Nylon The greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the method of invention . - ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD ( 1925 ) THE TRANSFORMATION of industrial processes and products which scientific research hath wrought is at once both profound and farreaching . The Du Pont Company , for example , in 1942 did a business in gross sales of which nearly half ( actually , 46 per cent ) consisted of products that either did not exist in 1928 or were not then manufactured in large commercial quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company has an extensive research program , the history of which begins with the founder of the company . Eleuthere Irenee du Pont de Nemours , founder of the Du Pont Company , was a pupil of the founder of modern chemistry , Antoine Lavoisier , who lost his head on the guillotine during the French Revolution . From his teacher , Du Pont learned not only the art and science of making gunpowder , which was long a staple of the Du Pont Company , but he also learned the importance of research as an instrument for improving old products and the methods of producing them . Throughout the nineteenth century most of the research done by the Du Pont Company was undertaken in the actual works plants ; one of the achievements was the production of a cheaper blasting powder which was used extensively throughout American iron and coal fields . The first formal research laboratory erected by the Du Pont Company , in 1902 , was for research on explosives , and a great deal of attention was devoted to the development of nitroglycerine and forms of dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today this company operates thirty-eight distinct research laboraI20 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN tories . These are devoted to reducing costs in manufacturing pros . esses , to the improvement of existing processes and products , and to the development of new products . In addition , considerable fundamental research is undertaken ? the object of which is to discover new scientific facts without necessary regard to immediate commercial uses . All industrial organizations which maintain research laboratories have programs more or less similar to that of the Du Pont Company . Although much of the work classified as " applied research " adds nothing fundamentally new to scientific knowledge , nevertheless , even in this type of investigation , valuable information accrues to the body of knowledge . The contributions to scientific knowledge from such organizations as the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the laboratories of RCA , Du Pont , Eastman Kodak , General Electric , and Westinghouse can be compared , with honor to industry , to the contributions of many of our universities . Charles M. A. Stine , who started a program of fundamental research in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducts fundamental research today in order that it may be prepared for tomorrow . Such research , according to Dr. Stine , is carried out not merely for the purpose of contributing something of value to science , but " is conceived to be sound business policy , because fundamental research has proved to be indispensable in assuring continued earning power . " ' The leaders of industrial research know that a program devoted to the increase of knowledge pays cash dividends to the stockholders . Some of the ways in which this occurs are simple . For example , the very presence of top-flight scientists in an industrial research organization insures a high intellectual or scientific level , and attracts to the particular laboratory some of the best young men produced by the universities . The comprehensive knowledge and healthy attitude of curiosity of such research workers are valuable assets : occasions arise in which knowledge must be quickly obtainable , and the easiest way to obtain it is to have immediate access to an authority in the field . Or again : if one were to survey the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon find certain gaps , perhaps small ones or perhaps whole vast areas , in which fundamental work SYNTHETIC RUBBER AND NYLON I2I was needed , not to advance any particular art , but simply to fill in that portion of scientific knowledge . A chemist working for an industrial corporation never knows what knowledge will be needed on the morrow . He hopes that when he needs it , it will be available . If it is not available , he may have to find someone , either in his own research organization or in some university , who will obtain it for him . Such a procedure would be satisfactory if the information desired were of a limited character . But if a whole branch of science remains a great unknown terrain , and if very few scientists throughout the country or the world are working in that particular area , it may then be very sensible for the industrial concern to embark on a research program of broad scope , with no immediate or predictable economic aim or practical result in view ? simply to be prepared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fundamental research , he looked around to find a suitable man to head the section of organic chemistry . After much deliberation and investigation , Dr. Wallace Hume Carothers , then an instructor at Harvard University , was chosen . ' Carothers found the decision to leave his academic post was a difficult one . But the freedom of university life was overbalanced by the temptation which the industrial appointment offered to do nothing but research , as well as by the opportunity to have as assistants and co-workers a number of trained research scientists , and resources in equipment and materials on a scale such as no university could provide . Although there were to be but nine years of work before his death , Carothers made major contributions to the theory of organic chemistry , and his discoveries led to the production of materials of extraordinary commercial importance . Yet , as President J. B. Conant tells us , " Those of us in academic life always cherished the hope that some day he would return to university work . In his death , academic chemistry quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace Carothers was born in 1896 . His early death in 1937 was a tragedy . He was brought up in Iowa , and most of his education was obtained at the cost of earning his own way e He completed his studies for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at the I22 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN University of Illinois under Dr. Roger Adams in 1924 . By that time Carothers had already published several independent contributions to the science of chemistry , an unusual achievement for a predoctoral graduate student . He came to Harvard in 1926 . His achievements were recognized , one year before his death , by his election to the National Academy of Sciences . He was the first organic chemist working in industry to be so honored. fr . One of the first tasks which Carothers undertook for the Du Pont Company was in connection with the development of a synthetic rubber . The problem of making synthetic rubber depends upon our knowledge of the composition and structure of the molecules of natural rubber . As far back as 186o , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had subjected rubber to destructive distillation and had obtained a substance which he named " isoprene . " Each isoprene molecule is made up of 5 atoms of Carbon and 8 atoms of Hydrogen , and the chemist indicates this fact by writing the formula for this molecule as : C5H8 . Williams found that if he allowed this isoprene to remain in contact with the oxygen of the air , a viscous liquid would be formed , from which he could obtain " a pure white spongy elastic mass . " When he burned the " elastic mass , " it gave off the characteristic odor of burning rubber . ' The next important step was taken some twenty years later by William Tilden , in 1882 . Tilden began with common turpentine , whose vapor he passed through a red-hot tube . In this way , beginning with turpentine , he was able to produce isoprene ; and by subjecting the latter to the action of concentrated hydrochloric acid , and of nitrosyl chloride , he was able to convert it into a rubberlike mass . ' He stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years , and , as he reported in 1892 , he found that it had changed into " a dense syrup , of a yellowish colour . Upon examination this turned out to be India-rubber . " Y0 Thus , beginning with turpentine , the first man-made rubber was produced . Not only had Tilden produced synthetic isoprene from turpentine , but he had shown how the isoprene molecules might be caused // to join together , in the process that the chemist calls " polymerization , " to form a rubberlike material . This process is one in which small molecules join together to form a larger molecule , but without changing the proportion of the component atoms . For example , let us suppose that in polymerization , io isoprene molecules " link " themselves together to form a " polymer . " We may denote the polymer by the formula C50H80 , indicating that there are present 50 atoms of carbon and 8o of hydrogen . But note that the ratio of carbon to hydrogen atoms is still 5o to 8o , or 5 to 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had polymerized . Another example of polymerization is the change of acetaldehyde , a white , aromatic liquid , into paraldehyde , a much heavier , colorless liquid with a contrastingly different , pungent odor . Each molecule of acetaldehyde is composed of 2 atoms of carbon , 4 atoms of hydrogen , and r atom of oxygen ; its formula , therefore , is written C2H40 . But the formula for paraldehyde is C6H1203i indicating that the polymer is formed by the union of 3 molecules of acetaldehyde . The chemical compound resulting from polymerization has quite distinct properties , as contrasted to those of the original molecules . Acetaldehyde and paraldehyde are both used medically , the former as an inhalant for catarrh , the latter as a soporific in sleeping potions . " Today we produce many types of synthetic rubber . The type of rubber depends , in addition to other factors , on the number of separate molecules that have linked up end to end . The springiness of natural rubber derives from the fact that there are present chains of anywhere from 200 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the bottle , the isoprene molecules polymerized and linked up end to end to form the type of long chain we associate with rubber . This process has been well described by Williams Haynes , one of the best writers on the subject of chemistry for nonchemists , as follows : " What had happened was that great numbers of C5H8 molecules had linked themselves together for all the world like a chain of paper clips hooked together end to end . " 12 I24 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN Organic chemists have a method of writing chemical formulas " structurally " which explains a great deal about organic chemical compounds and their reactions . The formula for the isoprene mole-cule is : Figure in which each carbon atom is again represented by the letter C , and each hydrogen atom by the letter H. Let us compare this structural formula with our previous formula for the isoprene molecule , which was C5H8 . In the structural formula , the letter C occurs five times , and H eight times , so that the two agree as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " valence bonds " that hold the atoms together are indicated in the structural formula by the short straight lines emanating from each letter ( or atom ) , C or H. It will be observed that one such bond emanates from each of the hydrogen atoms , and that four of them emanate from each of the carbon atoms , and that each such bond represented by a short straight line emanates from one atom and terminates at another . The carbon atoms at the extreme left and right are joined to the adjacent carbon by two straight lines , which we call a " double bond . " We can see what happens during polymerization by examining the structural formula of the central portion of an isoprene polymer : // The individual isoprene molecules that have joined together in polymerization are indicated by a brace ( L ? Y ) . The reader should check the following points : ( I ) in each unit marked off by a brace , there are still five atoms of carbon and eight atoms of hydrogen , just as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each carbon atom ( represented by the letter C ) there emanate four valence bonds ( indicated by the lines ) , while from each hydrogen atom , there emanates but a single valence bond ; ( 3 ) bonds emanating from any atom always terminate in another atom . An early form of synthetic rubber , made in Germany as a rubber substitute during the First World War , was based on butadiene , a hydrocarbon very much like isoprene in structure , but somewhat simpler , and easier to polymerize . The similarity between the two molecules ( and therefore the fact that butadiene , like isoprene , can be polymerized into long chains ) may be seen from a comparison of the two structural formulae : The German rubber was inadequate and expensive , and since no one knew very much about how and why polymerization took place , progress in making synthetic rubber seemed to have reached a dead end . We take up the story again in December of 1925 , when Dr. E. K. Bolton , director of the chemical section of Du Pont 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the meeting of the American Chemical Society at Rochester , New York . There he heard a paper , read by a Catholic priest , Father Julius Arthur Nieuwland , professor of organic chemistry at Notre Dame , which dealt with some of the reactions of acetylene . Dr. Bolton was extremely interested in the possibility of applying Father Nieuwland 's results to the problem of synthesizing rubberlike polymers . I26 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN Father Nieuwland was an extraordinary man " whose graduation essay had been a paper on Keats ' poetry , whose hobby was botany , and whose avocation was mounting and selling biological microscope slides to raise funds for Notre Dame 's chemical research . " " Father Nieuwland spent a lifetime of research on the chemical reactions of acetylene gas , his hobby since undergraduate days . He was in no way interested in the search for a satisfactory synthetic rubber . His only aim was to advance knowledge . In his paper , Father Nieuwland showed how , by using a catalyst , he had produced from acetylene a polymer made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colorless liquid called divinyl acetylene . The presence of a strange odor led him to believe that he had also produced monovinyl-acetylene , a polymer made by the union of two molecules of acetylene gas . It was not at all apparent that Father Nieuwland 's investigations might contribute to the solu tion of the synthetic rubber problem . However , Dr. Bolton was in terested in this possibility , for only that year he had initiated in the Du Pont laboratories a study of the possibility of making rubber from acetylene . It could be that " Dr. Nieuwland 's divinyl-acetylene might serve as a starting point for making a satisfactory synthetic rubber . " 14 The results of attempting to use divinyl-acetylene as a starting material for synthetic rubber were negative , although this material did prove useful for another purpose : the preparation of a valuable type of corrosion-resistant finish . Dr. Carothers and his group of co-workers , to whom the problem had been assigned , had better luck with monovinyl-acetylene . They sealed this substance in test tubes with many different chemical reagents , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was hydrochloric acid , which produced a substance called " chloroprene . " The similarity of chloroprene to isoprene and butadiene may again be seen from the structural formulae : // The chief difference between the chloroprene molecule and the other two is that an atom of chlorine ( Cl ) replaces the atom of H hydrogen ( H ) in butadiene and the H-CH group in isoprene . But what a difference that single atom makes ! Chloroprene could be polymerized much more quickly and more easily than either isoprene or butadiene , and it led to a product vastly superior to all previously known synthetic rubbers . Known widely as " neoprene , " the chloroprene polymer had one of the most important characteristics of rubber , namely , that of developing " fibrous orientation when stretched and instantly reverting to the amorphous condition when released from stress . " 16 As Dr. James K. Hunt of Du Pont writes , " What the chemists had actually done was not to synthesize rubber , but to synthesize a material having rubber 's desirable qualities and , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resists the action of most chemical reagents ; it has a greater resistance than ordinary rubber to sunlight ; it can be milled like rubber , mixed in any proportions with natural gum , molded and colored ; it has great resistance to heat , gasoline , and lubricating oils . The new synthetic rubber , neoprene , was introduced formally at the annual dinner of the rubber section of the American Chemical Society at Akron in 1931 . Dr. Carothers and three of his associates presented a paper describing it ; they showed samples of it , and announced that the Du Pont Company was building a plant at Deepwater , New Jersey , for commercial production . The reader should be warned that , in the words of the Rubber Survey Committee , composed of James B. Conant , Karl T. Compton , and Bernard M. Baruch : Strictly speaking , no material has yet been produced which warrants the name of synthetic rubber ? at least in the sense in which we speak of many other synthetic substances . Synthetic indigo , for example , is identical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise synthetic camphor may be manufactured which is identical in every way with the substance obtained from the camphor tree . On the other hand no one of the synthetic rubbers so far developed ? and at least a thousand more or less rubberlike substances have been produced ? is exactly the same as natural rubber either in its chemical make-up or its physical properties 17 I28 SCIENCE , SERVANT OF MAN The original clue came , as we saw , from the years of patient research carried out by Father Nieuwland , who was not interested in practical applications but simply in discovering the properties of a group of chemical substances and the nature of their reactions . In the course of his work , Father Nieuwland had shown how to obtain the acetylene polymers , and this was the clue that enabled the Du Pont chemists to solve the problem of synthetic rubber . In addition to producing the practical end product , neoprene , Carothers 's part of the investigation brought forth theoretical knowledge of great importance . Although this is of too technical an aspect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance by quoting Dr. Carothers 's teacher , Dr. Roger Adams : " Fundamental information concerning the character and formation of the various polymers . . . was revealed and their structures clarified . The real activity of vinyl acetylene and the mechanism by which products formed was studied in detail . " 18 This experience set the stage for the most outstanding scientific accomplishment of Carothers , one which not only established a new field of chemical research but also laid the foundation for a new industry which has vastly affected many aspects of our daily lives . Carothers was interested in the general problem of polymerization and polymeric molecules . His part in the rubber program may be thought of as a sort of preparation for his later work , which not only constituted an important advance in the chemistry of large molecules , but also led to the development of the new family of synthetic compounds known as nylon . Most people know that purely mechanical inventions , such as the " spinning jenny , " had revolutionized the textile industry at the end of the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to the highly mechanized plants today so familiar a part of the contemporary industrial landscape . But in order to appreciate the significance of the invention of nylon , we must first consider that there have been only five major scientific discoveries in the history of textiles that have affected our knowledge and practice 19 The first was the process of bleaching . Until the end of the eightSYNTHETIC // centh century , bleaching required many months of the action of sunlight , and the application of naturally occurring substances , chiefly urine . The development and use of chlorine bleaching powders has been discussed in an earlier chapter , * and constitutes the first chemical innovation in textile history . The second was the development of synthetic dyes derived from coal tar . In the middle of the nineteenth century , these largely replaced the dyes hitherto obtained from roots , barks , berries , and insects . The third was mercerization : a process discovered by an English dyer , John Mercer , who was born in Lancashire in 1791 and died in 1866 . A self-educated chemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chem istry " and the " self-taught chemical philosopher . " The process discovered by Mercer consists of altering the natural fibers of cotton fabrics in order to give them qualities more closely approaching those of the more expensive linen . Mercerization is the immersing of woven fabrics in a solution of caustic soda where they are held under tension while the caustic solution softens and swells the individual fibers . The caustic soda is later washed out in water , and the fabric retains the power of absorbing moisture , has a glossier finish , and will not shrink as much as unmercerized cloth 2 ? The fourth great innovation was the production of rayon yarn , using cellulose , the skeletal or fundamental structural material of all plants , as the basic raw material . The largest volume of rayon is commonly obtained by the " viscose process , " in which caustic soda and carbon bisulfide act on purified cellulose , obtained largely from wood pulp or cotton linters . The result is a syrupy material which is then squirted through tiny holes in a platinum plate into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it form long fibers which , after chemical and physical processing , are then used to make cloth . This method of forming a fiber filament may be described as a man-made adaptation of nature 's own method . The silkworm forms its filaments of silk in somewhat the same way , by squirting a thick viscid fluid through tiny holes in its head 21 Another type of rayon is made by the " acetate process , " in which cellulose is treated with the anhydride of acetic acid ( the same acid used by photographers as a short-stop solution , and familiar to most of us as the most important constituent of common vinegar ) . This // produces a compound called cellulose acetate , which is then dissolved in acetone , forced into filaments like ordinary rayon , and dried in hot air where the acetone evaporates , leaving the fine threads . In contrast to viscose rayon , which is simply regenerated cellulose , cellulose acetate is a new compound , and one not found naturally occurring in nature . Because acetate rayon requires a different type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cross-dyed " effects can be obtained from fabrics comprising both types of yarn . Still another type is cuprammonium rayon . Nylon , unlike rayon , is formed by taking such products as coal , air , and water , and combining their constituent elements to make a wholly new material . Viscose process rayon is naturally occurring cellulose which has been chemically modified and then regenerated as pure cellulose ; only the physical form of the starting material has been changed . Acetate rayon , although a new compound , is a simple derivative of natural cellulose . Nylon , on the other hand , is a completely new creation , having no counterpart in nature , and made by putting together atoms of carbon , nitrogen , hydrogen , and oxygen , to form the desired molecules and then causing these molecules to polymerize . Nylon is , therefore , the first textile material of which we can truly say that it has been wholly created by man . The actual development of nylon can best be understood by dividing it into three distinct periods . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of Wallace Carothers , provided the foundation for its development . During the second , attention was concentrated on polyamides , which led to the synthesis of a polymer whose properties were suitable for use as a new fiber . The third period was marked by the development of practical processes for making intermediate materials as well as polymers , and perfecting methods for spinning fibers " Carothers set out to explore the general subject of polymerization ( by methods of condensation ) and the general problems connected with the structure of substances of high molecular weight . He had no idea , nor could he possibly have known in advance , that his research would lead him to a wholly new product , nylon . He was conducting an exploration into the unknown , and in a field whose literature was very meager . In fact , so little was known about this SYNTHETIC RUBBER AND NYLON 131 whole general area of chemistry that it looked very promising to a man of Carothers 's talents , backed up by the resources made available to him by Du Pont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 14 February , 1928 , to Dr. John R. Johnson of Cornell University . He wrote : " One of the problems which I am going to start work on has to do with substances of high molecular weight . I want to attack this problem from the synthetic side . One part would be to synthesize compounds of high molecular weight and known constitution . It would seem quite possible to beat Fischer 's record of forty-two hundred , and it would be a satisfaction to do this . Facilities will soon be available here for studying such substances with the newest and most powerful tools . " " The rest of the letter ( of which a portion too technical for the general reader is printed below as a footnote * ) further empha-sizes the fact that what attracted Carothers to the field of polymeriza-tion and the synthetic production of large molecules by polymeri-zation was simply the fact that so little was known . Carothers referred in his letter to the fact that the highest known molecular weight of a substance that had been synthesized was 4200 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to indicate some molecular weights . // Our knowledge of substances of high molecular weight has in-creased vastly since Emil Fischer 's death in 1919 . The highest mo lecular weights known today are found in the proteins ; here are a few of them : 26 On the theoretical side , Carothers 's ideas bore fruit in thirty-one papers in the field of polymerization , in which he proposed " a gen eral theory of condensation polymerization and a logical and syste matic terminology suitable for use in this previously disorganized field . " ' He illustrated the implications of his theory with a series of experimental studies on different substances , and these provided the material for correlating chemical structure and physical properties of substances of high molecular weight , and they furnished evidence of a view now generally accepted for the structure of such naturally occurring high polymers as cellulose . Carothers 's results were of great importance in increasing chemi cal knowledge . He was successful in producing molecules having higher and higher molecular weights . Eventually he applied the term " super-polymer " to materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carothers 's work depended on the vision of such men as Dr. Bolton , who allowed him to continue his investigations in this relatively unexplored field of chemistry without any insistance on the production of immediate practical results . Of course , the Du Pont Company 's industry was based on chemistry , and both Stine and Bolton knew that any increase in fundamental chemical knowledge might well provide the basis for new products and new industries . Carothers obtained some super-polymers ( called " super-polyes ters " ) which were tough opaque solids and which at high tempera ture became transparent viscous fluids . The observation was made // that filaments could be obtained from these materials if threads were pulled from the molten polymer with a rod . Even more important was the later observation that after these filaments had cooled , they could be drawn still further , to several times their original length . Such cold-drawn fibers had physical properties quite different from the initial mass of polymer , and even from the fibers pulled from the molten polymer . This cold-drawing developed transparency and a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elastic and had a much greater tensile strength than the undrawn filaments . Whereas the latter were inelastic and fragile , the cold-drawn filaments could be tied into hard knots and then untied again . It was later found that filaments could be formed not only by pulling threads out of the molten polymer with a rod , but also by dissolving the polymer in chloroform and then dry-spinning it like cellulose acetate rayon . This type of fiber , like the ones pulled from the molten polymer , had a marked orientation of the crystals , but these too could be drawn further when cold , so that the crystals would be oriented in a straight line along the fiber axis . Hence the name " linear super-polymers . " Dr. Bolton tells us : " Up to the time that the above superpolymers were made , this study was wholly fundamental in character and was designed to throw further light on certain aspects of polymerization . The rather striking properties of fibers obtained from the superpolyesters aroused the hope that it might be possible to make a fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Research was accordingly directed to this practical end . Continued investigation showed , however , that fibers from the polyesters were of only theoretical interest , as their melting points were too low for general textile purposes and their solubilities were too great . " " Carothers had been able to form linear super-polyesters having molecular weights above Io , 000 and from which fibers could be formed . Nevertheless , hope was aroused that further research might develop a more useful synthetic fiber . Effort was therefore concentrated on synthesizing a new type of polymer which might form the basis for a commercial textile fiber. // Thus far the work of Carothers had been of greater interest to chemists than to industrialists . Dr. Bolton says that a large amount of time and money had been spent on the work , but the only results to date were of purely " theoretical " interest . To determine what practical use could be made of the scientific information that had been acquired was therefore of considerable concern . Dr. Bolton 's statement affords proof that the researches of Carothers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying the foundations for a fiber industry . Carothers 's motives had been quite other than providing the basis for a simple practical development . His reports , presented in papers delivered to the American Chemical Society , were well received as contributions to knowledge . The members were interested in the additions to chemical knowledge contained in these papers , even if they appeared to be of no practical use to the Du Pont Company , which had supported him . Now , however , Carothers was encouraged by Dr. Bolton to direct his future work on super-polymers as specifically as possible toward the development of a product which could be spun into practical fibers . The synthetic rubber development was already in the production stage , and the directors of the Du Pont research were interested in fibers as a new field of conquest . Carothers therefore surveyed his scientific work and decided to center attention on super-polyamides . After some time there were clear indications that by building on Carothers 's fundamental work on linear polymers , it might be possible to synthesize a material for producing fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No. 66 . " Like the earlier polyesters , " 66 " fibers could be drawn when cold to produce material of great elasticity and high tensile strength . Furthermore , these fibers were insoluble in common solvents ; there was no danger of cloth made from them being dissolved during processing or even washing . They melted at z6o ? Centigrade , which gave a margin of safety well above the temperature commonly employed in ironing . Carothers continued to explore other polymers to see if polymer // " 66 " was the best suited for the production of fibers . This later work simply confirmed the wisdom of the original selection , which had been made at a time when only a small number of the many possible super-polymers had been examined . The period of research we have just described constitutes the second period , in which , with a practical end in sight , the work was directed toward the actual production of a synthetic fiber . In contrast to the first period , which culminated in Carothers 's presentation of his findings to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the research effort was directed to increasing knowledge , the second period was specifically directed to using the new knowledge for a practical purpose . The third period included the development of manufacturing processes for the intermediate materials ; and the gathering , on a semi-works scale , of the chemical and engineering data necessary for the erection and operation of a large-scale plant for production of the intermediate materials , the polymers , and the nylon yarn itself . The Du Pont Company 's Executive Committee wanted these processes worked out as quickly as possible to reduce to a minimum " the time between the test tube and the counter , " 29 to quote W. S. Carpenter , Jr. , President of the Du Pont Company . A large number of chemists and chemical engineers were transferred to the " 66 " project in order to speed up the development , and a great many important contributions were introduced by chemists and engineers who until now had no connection with " 66 . " The new material was given a coined name , nylon , selected from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was not likely to be mispronounced . Also , because of cotton and rayon , the ending " on " suggested a textile fiber , and it was anticipated that a major outlet for nylon would be in the form of textile-fibers . On 27 October 1938 , nylon was formally announced to the world by Dr. Stine at the New York Herald Tribune eighth annual forum on current problems , as the climax of his address on " What laboratories of industry are doing for the world of tomorrow ? Chemicals and Textiles . " 80 Nylon is a generic term much like glass or leather , and is applied // not to one particular product , but rather to a large family of re lated polyamides . The term " nylon " is thus used not only for the yarn of which stockings and ladies ' undergarments are made , but also for the bristles used in toothbrushes , surgical sutures , fishing lines , and a host of other products. * Nylon yarn was produced at the beginning of 1942 at the rate of 8,000,000 pounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual output was increased to 16,000,000 pounds . The fortunate develop ment of nylon at this particular time was of great importance to the war effort , since it made us independent of lightweight , tough-fibered silk which had hitherto come almost entirely from Japan and was es sential for such vital military products as parachutes . The development of nylon affords a clear picture of the way in which advances in pure knowledge lead to unexpectedly great prac tical results . When Carothers came to the Du Pont Company he was interested in producing substances of high molecular weight and in investigating their structure and properties . Since no one knew very much about linear super-polymers ? in fact , they had never before been produced systematically in the laboratory ? no one could have predicted their properties . Certainly at that time no one could have foretold that a super-polymer , or giant molecule , would be produced having a long threadlike structure ? a chain , so to speak , whose physical properties of great elasticity and tensile strength would enable it to be used in the manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course convinced of the fact that in time all scientific research yields results likely to be of in-estimable practical value , and that it was sound business policy to encourage fundamental research with no immediate practical end in view , especially in those chemical fields where there was little existing knowledge . Since the Du Pont Company is founded on chemistry , and since there existed in 1927 vast gaps in chemical knowledge , Dr. Stine was fully convinced , when he inaugurated a // program of fundamental research , that any program of sufficiently broad scope would add greatly to the store of chemical knowledge on which the industry was based . He was also certain that in the long run such a program would turn up processes and products of a commercial value at least sufficient to cover the costs involved in ob taining that fundamental knowledge . The Du Pont Company did not sponsor its fundamental research program because of any vague idealistic motive , such as repaying a debt owed to fundamental science because of its commercial suc cesses in the application of such knowledge , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , the fact remains that Du Pont 's program of fundamental research yielded results which not only con tributed to a better understanding of polymerization , but also gave the world a wholly new and useful family of materials . The Du Pont Company embarked on its fundamental research program fully convinced that knowledge acquired in the relatively unexplored field of polymerization would , over the years , yield practical results meas urable in dollars and cents. * The development of nylon may be likened to the discovery of selective weed killers and other auxins , to the development of radio and radar , and our system of electric power . In each of these ex amples , fundamental research directed towards increasing knowl edge produced , as by-products , results of economic importance to a practical world . The only surprising aspect of the story of nylon may be that , in this case , the fundamental work was done in an industrial laboratory rather than in a university or a privately en dowed institute of research . Most of us do not expect the fundamental advances in knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attitude which is a vestigial remain from the Victorian period , in which too great a distinction was made between // " pure knowledge " and " practical knowledge . " The contributions of so-called " industrial " scientists loom large in the body of fundamental knowledge acquired by science in the twentieth century . We may confidently expect that further contributions to fundamental knowledge will be made by the laboratories of enlightened industry , just as by those of the universities . Nevertheless , there is good reason to suppose that in the future , as in the past , the greater part of industrial research will be carried on in the " applied " end of the spectrum ; and that the burden of advancing basic knowledge will still rest on the shoulders of university scientists . PART THREE Fundamental Research in Which a Practical Application Seems Likely The underlying problems of science , from the solution of which all great industrial advances spring , must be attacked no less vigorously than the more obvious practical questions . - GEORGE ELLERY HALE ( 1919 )     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
