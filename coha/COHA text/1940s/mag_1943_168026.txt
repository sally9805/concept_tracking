The first warm breezes , traveling north , carried the familiar small sounds of spring : the honk of wild geese , the liquid whistle of red-winged blackbirds . But they were drowned in greater sounds : factory whistles , rivet hammers , the sound of tractors , axes , exhausts . Greenup time was only a pastel shade among the primary colors of the revolutionized American landscape . There was no winter 's slumber to awaken from , this year . <P> Unnoticed Change . The nation was full of confounding bustle . The U.S. was wholly in motion for the first time . Every night was like Saturday night . People filled the Broadways and Main Streets , crowded streetcars , buses , factories , restaurants , post offices , stood in line at bars , theaters , nightclubs , bowling alleys . In their tin hats , they worked together in San Francisco shipyards : ex-college professors , white-collar workers , women , Chinese , Italians , Negroes , WAAC uniforms marched two abreast down the narrow sidewalks of Des Moines ; WAVE uniforms swished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's hotels , spilled over into boardinghouses , slept in railroad stations , pool halls , sometimes tramped the streets all night . <P> The U.S. had greatly changed , was changing immeasurably more . Whatever the U.S. had been , this was not that land . The change could not be gauged or checked or anywhere seen as a whole-it was both wide and deep . Every citizen could see his life and his town 's life changing around him , but who could see the whole physical change of the nation ' ? <P> Unnoticed Adjustment . A major process in the change had been the U.S. adjustment to the war . Once the heartbeat 's needle had fluctuated violently at every little victory or defeat ; a picture , a story , a speech , a bulletin was enough to drive the country to its knees or raise it to strutting tiptoes . Now the national pulse was quieter ; the people had partly steeled themselves , had partly grown accustomed to the changes &; chances of war news . Only the most violent of shocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. people had asked themselves great questions every week . Where is the Fleet ? they had asked , not long after Pearl Harbor . How about the second front ? they had asked all last summer . Now they worried about more personal matters : drafting fathers and drafting farmers , about ration points , coupons , regulations . Now they wondered why the Americans were not moving faster in Tunisia ; once they had known very well the U.S. had , in effect , no Army at all , and Tunisia was a far-off name on an unknown map . The people had even got used to the scrappy little casualty lists . <P> The nation had not suffered as the British had-here the transition had been by little jerks and tugs and nudges , not by a cataclysmic and continued onslaught of bombs and fire and death . The U.S. saw its returned heroes , excellently groomed , limping a little , surrounded by silk-stockinged chorus girls ; the British saw their maimed husbands and sons crutching through the streets , smiling chins up , surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
