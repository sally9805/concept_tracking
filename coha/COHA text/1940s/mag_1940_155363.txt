Every Sunday night a group of worried characters step up to a mike in the studios of Manhattan 's WMCA . Some of them are unhappy about their love life , some are moody about lack of cash . But whatever their problems , they are usually unabashed in discussing them , which gives the Good Will Hour , in which they participate , a fine confessional flavor . All they get for reciting their troubles is the advice of a small , damp-eyed , foxy-looking gentleman , sharp in manner and dress , who is the current top in aerial soul searchers . <P> John J. Anthony is a man of somewhat obscure antecedents , as are most of the problem wizards of the air . Manhattan-born , now 44 , Mr. Anthony boasts that he has dabbled in law , studied psychology under Freud , claims that he holds three degrees from assorted universities . On the ground that he does n't want to be looked upon as an academician , he refuses to divulge the names of his alma maters . He abhors the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarks , " worth a goodgoddam . " <P> Although he is profane and frequently ribald away from his mike , Mr. Anthony when wired for sound is as full of virtue as a revivalist . Ladies periodically knocked around by their husbands , men whose wives tend to wander indiscriminately , are uniformly advised by Mr. Anthony that life is beautiful and love will conquer all . The ill winds that blow through his microphone bring Mr. Anthony an estimated $3,000 a week . <P> Mr. Anthony 's clients are selected through correspondence . Each week he assembles 30 to 40 bothered people , selects from the group the most interesting cases . Identifying these customers only by initials , he proceeds on the air to grill them about their difficulties . The Good Will recitatives are often startling . Once a woman began her story : " I murdered my husband . " Turned out she had murdered him all right , but had been acquitted . <P> On another occasion a youth appeared who said : " I am going to kill a man . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cutie , Mr. Anthony passed a note to his announcer suggesting that the client 's coat be searched . In it was found a foot-long jack handle- " a fine instrument for murder , " as Mr. Anthony now points out . From this distraught juvenile , Mr. Anthony won a promise not to do anything until the next day . By that time Mr. Anthony had a psychiatrist ready , who subsequently worked a cure . <P> Pleasantest dialogue of recent weeks was provided by a colored lady whose husband beat her . " Are you a mother ? " inquired Mr. Anthony softly . " Ah is , " the lady said . " And have you any children ? " " Ah has . " " How many , madam ? " " Twenty-three . " <P> Only once in his career has Mr. Anthony been compelled to cut a client off the air . That was when a judge from Pennsylvania got so worked up about his marital problem that he kept bleakly describing it in uninhibited language . The Good Will Hour dates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC network since early this year . Last fortnight it finished its 200th performance on the air .
