txt President Roosevelt delivered today to a new Petroleum Administration for War , headed by Secretary Ickes , his wartime powers to control the petroleum industry and centralize government policies affecting it . Secretary Ickes preferred to retain his present Cabinet post and his war responsibilities affecting oil and solid fuels rather than accept a Presidential commission as Secretary of Labor and Manpower Director . The executive order signed by the President at the White House just before noon in Mr. Ickes 's presence vests in the Petroleum Administrator for War the powers to regulate all the operations of the petroleum industry , including among other things , authority to direct pooling of petroleum stocks , transportation equipment and facilities , equipment and refinery facilities . Where petroleum rationing is necessary " for the purpose of maintaining adequate supplies of petroleum for war and essential industrial and civil requirements , " Mr. Ickes was authorized to " determine , after advising with the WPB , the areas and the times within which such rationing should be effective and the amount of petroleum available for such purposes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operating as Federal Petroleum Coordinator under a peace-time Presidential directive , has had only advisory powers concerning such rationing , and there often has been conflict between him and Leon Henderson , Federal Price Administrator , who administers rationing under the direction of tire War Production Board . On the question of petroleum rationing in non-shortage areas , where the purpose of curtailing sales is solely to conserve rubber , the power to make Federal policies continues to rest with William M. Jeffers , Rubber Director , but he is required to advise Mr. Ickes of all plans or proposals for civilian rationing . Under the order , the power of the WPB to distribute critical materials remains unchanged , but after WPB determines that a given amount of materials may be allocated to the petroleum industry , Mr. Ickes has the authority to distribute these quantities of materials among the various branches and companies engaged in the oil industry . Oil Leader Hails Appointment His appointment as controller of the oil industry was hailed by the industry itself , whose leaders had urged Secretary Ickes to retain his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William B. Boyd Jr. , chairman of the Petroleum Industry War Council , said that the delegation of expanded powers to Secretary Ickes " is deeply gratifying to me personally and I am sure it will be to every oil man in the country . " Secretary Ickes has won the support and cooperation of the oil mdustry , " Mr. Boyd added . " We have been working harmoniously . His inspiring leadership has been matched by the firm determination of the oil industry to do everything necessary to win the war , regard ' less of the economic repercussions I upon the industry . " It is no secret that many oil men have felt for a long time that the job ahead of us could be accomplished even more diligently if some of the scattered controls of petroleum matters were concentrated in the Coordinator 's office , and we are grateful to the President for his action . " In taking on the new job , Secretary Ickes announced that Ralph K. Davis , Deputy Petroleum Coordinator and former vice president of the Standard Oil Company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . Mr. Ickes issued this statement : " In assuming the duties of Petroleum Administrator , I desire to accent two major facts : first , that the supplying of oil to our armed forces and those of our Allies is no less than a prerequisite to survival ; and , second , that the successful carrying out of this task is one of enormous proportions  --  one which calls for tireless effort , unending study and continuing sacrifice , affecting directly or indirectly in some way every man , woman and child . " The new order was issued by the President " by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy , and in order to cooreinate and centralize the war policies and actions of government relating to petroleum with a view toward providing adequate supplies of petroleum for the successful prosecution of the war and for other essential purposes .
