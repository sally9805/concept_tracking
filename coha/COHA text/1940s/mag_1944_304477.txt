For weeks the Germans had noted allied landing boats piling up in Mediteranean harbors , had nervously trumpeted their findings to the world . Then distinguished visitors began arriving in Italy for front-row seats-Prime Minister Winston Churchill , U.S. Navy Secretary James Forrestal , Undersecretary of War Robert P.

The beachhead grew to 100 miles , from Nice to Marseilles . <P> As the attack began , " Jumbo " Wilson stated its obvious aim . Said he in an official proclamation : the objective is " to drive out the Germans and join up with the Allied armies advancing from Normandy .
