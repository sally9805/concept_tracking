If only the world would adopt Esperanto or some other universal language , life would be so much simpler for people in the news business . ( Shown above &; below this letter , for example , are just 15 ways in which people of other nations say " Dear Sir " when writing about the news to our editors . ) <P> The job of translating such letters and a host of foreign periodicals ranging from the Russian Krokodil to the Neue Schweizer Rundschau may fall to almost anybody in TIME 'S employ-in or out of the Editorial Departments . TIME 'S Personnel Division keeps a file of everyone in the company who speaks any foreign language fluently . ( In case there is a sudden need for quick translation , we can be fluent at the drop of a telephone in 28 languages ranging from Afrikaans to Ukrainian . ) <P> But only seldom must our researchers go outside their own ranks for translation help , for 85% of them speak one or more foreign languages . This versatility gets more useful every day now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , articles written for foreign audiences in their native tongues are a rich source of background information and local color . ( Most difficult to translate , observes one Foreign News researcher , are the captions under the cartoons . The reason is a wry one coming from TIME-she says the lines are " too condensed , too colloquial . " ) <P> Naturally , proper names are one grand mal de tte . Unfamiliar names of newsmakers erupt into the headlines almost daily-Marshal Fevsi akmak . Princess Sukhodhaya , Sir Ofori Atta . And rare is the week that strange place names do n't pop up , as the news shifts around from earthquakes in the Caribbean to incidents in the air over Yugoslavia . For months now the research librarian in charge of the Biography files in our Morgue has been working on a great continuing project to assist researchers in checking the proper names and titles of foreigners . It 's a tough job . For example , one Siamese name , recently added to the files , was transliterated seven different ways by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files ( there are over 300,000 in all ) contain names that can not be found in Who 's Who or in any other standard reference work . TIME 'S record for getting foreign names spelled right has been none too spotless , but as this tailor-made directory moves toward completion , we expect to do better . <P> But not all of our language problems grow out of news-gathering and news-writing : Readers overseas write us in their native languages asking us to do all sorts of things for them-to find a long-lost brother in Wisconsin , to get an interview with President Truman , to tell them how to buy a Fifth Avenue trousseau for a daughter bride-to-be . Two girls in our Letters Department spend most of their time just translating and trying to follow through on such requests . <P> Then there is the business of overseas production for TIME 'S foreign editions and getting supplies across the oceans-translating and converting weights and measures , postal rates , etc. - and watching to see that foreign printers do not just use hyphens like that last one ( putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of English syllabification.
