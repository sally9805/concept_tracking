The horse of the year , chestnut-colored Busher , has none of the foibles common to fillies . She outeats every colt in the stable ; far from being a high-strung prima donna , she is a lazy worker who never does anything more than is asked of her . <P> Last week , Busher was asked to give away plenty of poundage to her male competitors in Hollywood Park 's $25,000 Will Rogers Handicap . She shouldered her 123 lbs . like a workwoman , got away fifth from her No. 1 post position , scarcely needed the gentle reminders from Johnny Longden 's whip , drove hard for her 14th victory in 18 starts-but failed by a neck to make it . <P> Nevertheless , by earning the $6,000 place money , she boosted her earnings to $276,120 , and became the top money-winning filly of all time . Runner-up : Top Flight with $275,900 . <P> Regarding her more as a broodmare than a racer , Moviemaker Louis B. Mayer bought Busher from Kentucky-Colonel <P> E. R. Bradley this spring for $50,000 . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered . Mayer hopes that she will get motherly after she is bred to his 18-year-old Australian stallion , Beau Pere , next year .
