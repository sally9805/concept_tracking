My Fifty Years in the White House By IRA R. T. SMITH with . JOE ALEX MORRIS " Mr. Wilson had to run the whole show himself . " The show , as described here by a man who saw it from a front scat , included the gyrations of William Jennings Bryan , the President 's marriage to Mrs. Galt , the hitter League of Nations quarrel and Wilson 's hushed-up illness . PART FOUR W OODROW WILSON had n't been in the White House a week before a plot was being hatched against him in the executive offices . It was a friendly plot , however , and the idea was to keep him from wasting his time on routine work that somebody else could handle . I do n't want to give the impression that Mr. Wilson was a slave to his desk , because he was n't ; at least , not in those days . Although energetic and businesslike , he believed a man needed a certain amount of intellectual recreation and he did n't let the job of being President crowd other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it difficult to adjust himself to the complicated and confusing machinery of the White House offices . He brought into his private office an old-fashioned typewriter which had an unorthodox keyboard and made a peculiarly disagreeable tapping noise when he used it . He would walk past a secretary 's desk , notice an unanswered letter or a document and carry it back to his office . We were likely to find him later sitting at his typewriter , pecking away at an answer or a memorandum that should have been handled by the secretary without any reference to the President . He knew shorthand and frequently made his own notes during conversations and transcribed them later , although he needed only to press a button to have such work done by an expert stenographer . After a while we began keeping papers of secondary importance from him and avoiding reference in his presence to a great many matters which could be handled by the staff . I think he soon caught on to our conspiracy , but he took it smilingly and without comment . Mr. Wilson took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House , but not all of them with a smile . Sometimes he was a very stubborn man . He was also the first Democratic President since I began handling the White House mail , and I was not sure at first that I could hang on to my job . But I did . I was pretty stubborn sometimes myself . As we got to know the President better we were more and more impressed by his coldly logical mind and by his determination . Mr. Wilson , like Theodore Roosevelt , had to run the whole show himself . He could not work with men who disagreed with him on important matters , and he got rid of them  --  even Colonel House eventually  --  whether they were clerks or Cabinet members . Perhaps the most interesting instance was that of William Jennings Bryan , who disagreed with Mr. Wilson 's policy about war with Germany . Bryan was an almost unbelievable character as Secretary of State , a man who was far beyond his depth in that job , even with the President himself handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Bryan was at a political rally in Ohio when he was running for the qwq Presidency . I listened to his speech and every word and every gesture was a revelation . It is not my nature to be awed by a famous name , but I felt that Bryan was the first politician I had ever heard sneak the truth and nothing but the truth . I went away convinced that he should be President . It was the next day before I began to react . I read the speech in the newspaper and I disagreed with almost all of it when I saw it in print . I finally decided that I had fallen under the spell of the most remarkable orator of the century , which I still believe to be correct . If Bryan could have made a radio speech on election eve and if every voter had been forced to listen , I think he would have won in a walk . Fortunately , there were no radios in those days , and history got one more lucky break . It was after Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was as a statesman . He would stride into our offLes , a smile on his wide lips , and go in to see the President ? usually to discuss petty political affairs instead of the state of foreign affairs , which were rapidly heading for a grave crisis . He scribbled memoranda to the President on scraps of paper which he sealed in envelopes and sent to our office . I remember a typical one , written in Pencil on the back of an old envelope , that said , So-and-So deserves appointment in the Postal Service because he will be able to influence a large number of voters in his community . " This was at atime when war was raging in Europe and we were almost in it . Bryan was out when we did get in . In contrast to the austere President Wilson was his jovial , political-minded secretary , Joseph Turnulty . It was Tumulty who kept the place alive and moving and sometimes in turmoil , especially when he was scouring the various branches of Government to find jobs for his friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs . Soon after Mr. Wilson became President I began to notice his correspondence with Mrs. Thomas Peck , which eventually became a choice item with the rumor mongers of the day . The President had become acquainted with her some time previously and had visited her home in Bermuda . He wrote to her occasionally  --  perhaps once every two months  --  after he came to the White House . The first letter from Mrs. Peck was opened in my office , and I read it and sent it on to the President . It was obvious that they were personal friends , and as other letters arrived I merely glanced through them at first to be sure there was nothing for the office to handle . Later I sent them the President unopened , although he never suggested that I do so . Soon rumors began to spread about a romance between Mr. Wilson and Mrs. Peck , and eventually some of the newspapers began to take note of the rumors , hinting that the President had gone to BerPHOTOGRAPHY BY HARRIS AND EWING muda especially to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gossip became so widespread that the Wilsons ' pastor , the Reverend Doctor Beach , of Princeton , New Jersey , finally wrote to the President . Addressing him as " Dear Woodrow , " Doctor Beach called attention to the rumors and asked the President 's permission to refute publicly such scandalous talk . The President 's well-known stubborn streak , however , stopped any such public statement . He replied pleasantly but firmly that the rumors were ridiculous and that it was beneath his dignity to pay any attention to them . He did n't either , and neither the letter from Doctor Beach nor the President 's reply was ever made public , so far as I know . There was no doubt in my own mind that the friendship between Mrs. Peck and the President was on a purely intellectual level . There was unquestionably a congenial and happy meeting of minds in their correspondence , since not only could Mrs. Peck 's letters have been read by Mrs. Wilson but they probably were . The gossip finally died out , but it was typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept up the correspondence . Mr. Wilson took the same attitude of indifference toward criticism of his marriage to Mrs. Galt in December of 1915 . The first Mrs. Wilson had died in 1914 . Most of the President 's advisers urged him to delay his second marriage until after the 1916 election . He paid no attention . ( Continued on Page 51 ) // ( Continued f Pen !

" It ai n't anything tough , " he told me . " That Mrs. Ledford has half the money there is , and is in the way of being man crazy . Her lawyer , Marran , is a handsome guy . She give him power of attorney over her affairs and he done what he pleased . There 's close to half a million in securities gone out of her safe-deposit boxes that he used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . " " Yeah . Marran hada lady friend , that Miss Delmar . There was a lot of jewelry in them safe-deposit boxes and Marran could n't resist letting Miss Delmar wear some of it sometimes . Him and her were in that restaurant when Miss Ledford and Nellis dropped into the bar connected with it . Miss Ledford went to the ladies ' room and seen Miss Delmar wearing her mother 's bracelet . " " I realize that . " " Ever since she was a kid that Miss Ledford had been keeping her mother out of trouble . How come a woman like Miss Delmar was wearing her bracelet , she meant to find out . But not knowing what kind of scandal she might run into , she did n't want Nellis to be in on it . Besides , the guy had just told her he wanted to marry Miss Loring . When he tried to get into the car with her , she pushed him out , and when he got in anyway she drove only a little way and stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parked near that bar to follow Miss Delmar . " " I see , " I declared . " Yeah . When Miss Delmar , come out , Miss Ledford saw it was Marran that was with her . She followed ' em to Miss Delmar 's apartment and waited for Marran to come out . He got in the car with her . Miss Delmar had de-. scribed to him the girl that asked to MY FIFTY YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE ( Continued from Page 31 ) The debate over woman suffrage was raging then , and the second Mrs. Wilson was responsible for bringing a woman clerk into the White House office for the first time since I had been there . She persuaded the President to appoint Mrs. Maude Rogers , who had previously been employed in the Galt jewelry store in Washington . I believe all the office force resented the appointment and looked forward to trouble . That attitude soon changed . Mrs. Rogers was one of the best and most likable employees in the office , and she stayed on long after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general run of the mail coming into the White House . The trend of opinion as reflected in letters or t he arrival of gifts was of no particular importance to him . His attitude was that he did not want anyone to give him even so much as a cold potato . - The rest of his family took much the same attitude and , after his second marriage , this led to a peculiar little mystery . Since nobody seemed to care , it had become customary for some of the ushers and servants in the White House to divide gifts of food and fruit that came to the President . As far as I know look at her bracelet , and he knew what to expect . He give her the bracelet and Miss Ledford put it on . Miss Ledford had n't never liked that lawyer anyway , and now she wanted to know of him what other of her mother 's jewelry might be missing . He was n't worried about the jewelry . What worried him was if they looked in the safe-deposit box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securities was missing . The market had been against him , but now it was corning back . If he had time , maybe he could put the securities back and even make a profit . It ai n't my idea they can prove murder premeditated . The guy was in panic , he seen ruin ahead of him , he figured nobody knew the girl had followed him . Well , he knocked the kid off . " " There was no evidence of it , " I stated . " Why , no . What was funny was that the dead kid had asked to look at a strange lady 's bracelet . She did n't like jewelry . A cop on a case looks for what ai n't natural . Well , that was n't natural . The kid would n't have did it . " " Did you suspect Marran ? " I asked . " No . I just wanted to see if Mrs. Ledford still had her bracelet . I and you and him went to the safe deposit . I seen he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It come to me , if the bracelet had been out of the box , he was the guy that could have put it back . They keep a record of who goes to them boxes and Marran had been to the box the first thing on the morning after the murder . The kid 's hand had been scratched like a bracelet had been pulled off of it . " " Uncertain reasoning , " I stated . " Sure . Cops thought I was nuts . Once we begun to think about Marren , we did n't have no trouble locating his lady friend . Waiters , doormen and taxi guys give us that . Mrs. Ledford would n't believe nothing against Marran , but her daughter had been killed and she agreed to go along with us. " there was no objection to the practice and , of course , all such gifts had always been acknowledged by the office before they were sent to the White House living quarters . On one occasion , however , Mrs. Wilson sent over to me a note from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had sent her some grouse , ham and sausage of which she was particularly fond . She asked why she had never received the food . I showed her that the food had arrived , according to my records , and had been delivered to the living quarters . We traced it that far , and then it seemed to vanish into thin air . I could guess what had happened , but the food never was found and nobody ever admitted having received it in the kitchen , probably because it had long since been eaten . Mrs. Wilson was more than a bit miffed . The years of the first World War , of course , put a heavy strain on the President , and when the armistice came we all felt , mistakenly , that we had reached the end of our troubles . The so-called false armistice came along several days before the agreement for cessation of hostilities was actually signed . When the newspapers carried the story , we knew at the White House that the negotiations were in progress but that there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , were informed , but it was too late to restrain the public generally . There was a great " The . address book ? " I asked . " Sure . We pinched that Miss Delmar and held her as a material witness . We took one of her yellow gloves that she had been wearing the night of the murder and put some blood on it and put it with the things from the girl 's car . Mrs. Ledford asked Marran to go get the address book for her , so we could have him see the glove . We was worrying the guy . We figured he 'd know it was Miss Delmar 's glove . Miss Delmar 's apartment faces on the park . She could have seen him get into the car with Miss Ledford . She could have been jealous and followed ' em into the park . From Marran 's point of view there was n't raio other way the glove could have got into the car . " " Ingenious , " I granted . " Yeah . He figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much she knew . Well , he could n't see her because we had her locked up . So he went out there . He found the mate to the glove which we 'd left there for him to find , and some letters he 'd wrote to her . Then we pinched him . A guy like that Marran , if he worries enough , blows up and goes to pieces . He do n't know yet the glove was a fake , and he thought we had so much on him that he confessed the whole business . " " Very clever , " I said bitterly , " but I 'll thank you , when you set a trap , if you 'd let me in on it so I do n't feel like a fool . " " Yeah ? You ai n't got the face for it . If you 'd knew about the glove , Marren most likely would have guessed it . " Miss Loring came to us . She took both O'Malley 's hands . There were tears in her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , lady , " he told her , " it 's me that ought to thank you for giving me credit . To hear them cops tell it that made the arrest , all that I done was sit on a balcony and look at the park . " spontaneous outburst . People paraded through the streets . The bars served free drinks . Girls whirling along the street kissed bystanders indiscriminately . Clarence Hess and I said , " What the hell , we know it 's not true , but there 's no point in missing the fun , " so we went out and joined in . Hess kissed the girls . I had a couple or three drinks for free . It was more exciting than when the real signing came along a few days later . While Mr. Wilson was in Europe for the peace conference , there was a great deal of suspense at the White House  --  and a great deal of mail too . The mail demonstrated that most people did not understand the League of Nations , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President was enthusiastic and excited when he returned home . He was pleased , too , and felt that he had achieved his goal . Even before he had taken off his hat he came into the offices and shook hands with each of us , which was probably the most warmth he had shown us since he became President . His bearing gave us all a lift . We felt that here was a man who had willingly thrown dice with destiny , had won a victory and had listened to the acclaim of Europe without losing his head . He had come back and shaken our hands even before he took off his hat , in order to prove , I think , that a man need not forget where his feet were planted , even though he had ( Cuntinnee1 on Page 57 ) ( Continnrdfrom Page .54 ) stood in the high places . He seemed to need to prove it not so much to us as to himself . We felt very close to Mr. Wilson in those days , and he never lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was little time left for his hopes of success . Senator Lodge began to peck at the peace structure which the President had foolishly be-lieved he could create almost single-handed . As the weaknesses began to appear , that inimitable obstructionist , Senator Borah , started an attack on the league in collaboration with Sena torJohnson of California . No man could attack moreefficiently or viciously than Borah and soon the President 's satisfaction was replaced by despair , and he decided to carry the fight to the People on a speaking tour . This tour was cut short by his illness . ? When they brought him back to the White House it was known only that the President was suffering from a collapse that somewhat restricted his schedule . It was several days later that we began to hear rumors that he was completely paralyzed . The official bul-letins and newspaper stories , however , merely said that he was suffering from a nervous breakdown and was very sick . In my office it became apparent that Mr. Wilson was in a far more helpless condition than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sending documents requiring his signature to his private quarters and they had been slow in coming back . Even they ceased to come back at all . zven emergency letters that went to the White House seemed merely to vanish . When we asked about them , there was no reply . Tumulty , of all men at the White House , was presumably closest to the President , but he had no explanation for the delay . He inquired of Mrs. Wilson and of Rear Admiral Cary Grayson , the President 's physician , but they put him oft I was directly concerned , because documents and letters continued to Come to my desk and inquiries were piling up as to when some action would be taken on important matters requiring Mr. Wilson 's signature . I watched Tumulty grow more and more worried . He walked from office to Office , picking up papers and putting them down again . He talked to important visitors , stalling them off with vague explanations . Finally it became obvious that Tumulty was as much cut off from the President as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . He had accompanied him to Europe and he had told me how Mr. Wilson would return to his hotel suite in the evening and pace the floor , going over in great detail all the conferences of the day and repeating the conversation of each participant . Grayson would take notes as he talked , and then go immediately to dictate a full report to a secretary . I knew Grayson well because he was a breeder of race horses and I had often gone with him to the race tracks . He was also my family physician . The next time he appeared at the offices , I made a point of running into him in the hall . I inquired about the President and got a vague reply . " Well , " I said , " perhaps I can ask you about this : I just received a personal letter for the President , and I do n't believe anyone else can handle it . There are some other matters in the same category . What do you think I should do ? " Grayson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to me over at the House ( the White House living quarters ) and I 'll talk to Mrs. Wilson and see what we can do . " I avoided telling Tumulty anything about the conversation , but I sent the letter over to Grayson . Later , I sent other letters and documents directly to him . If Tumulty discovered my action , he never said anything to me . His own efforts to see Mr. Wilson were rebuffed and he was very uncertain of his position . At this time , a letter came to the President from Judge Learned Hand , of New York . It enclosed a letter signed by Bruce Bielaski , who had been head of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice . Bielaski 's letter concerned grave charges against a high official in the Wilson Administration in connection with the handling of property during the war . I knew that it was a matter to be taken directly to the President , but under the circumstances I was not at all certain how that was to be done or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought everyone else had gone home , I showed the letters to Charlie Sworn , the President 's personal stenographer , and asked his opin- ion . While Sworn was reading them , Tumulty unexpectedly wandered into the room and paused to read over Charlie 's shoulder . He read only a few lines and then reached for the letters . " Let me have those , " he said . Swem held on to them . " No , " he replied , " I 'm handling this . " He tried to jerk away , but Tumulty was a bigger man and he had a good grip on the letters . There was a brief , brisk struggle and Tumulty pulled the letters out of Swem 's hand , turned quickly and walked into the Cabinet room . I went down to the telephone switchboard , which was near the end of our office , and watched the operator connect the Cabinet-room phone with the Department of Justice . Five minutes later the Attorney General , A. Mitchell Palmer , hurried into the offices and went directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last I ever heard of the Hand or Bielaski letters . Mr. Wilson never returned to his office . After a few weeks in which our business came to a standstill as far as it concerned matters requiring the President 's personal attention , there was a demand by members of Congress for an investigation as to whether the President was incapacitated , which would have meant that Vice President Marshall should take over his duties temporarily . Mrs. Wilson and Admiral Grayson never admitted that he was incapacitated , but for a period of about a month almost no one else  --  not even Tumulty ? saw Mr. Wilson and he was unable to sign his name . Grayson later told me of a conversation he had with the President following the first grave attack . He intimated that Mr. Wilson asked him to promise that he would never disclose to the public the gravity of his condition , presumably because he hoped he could carry through the fight for the League of Nations , and felt that the facts about his illness might weaken his influence . This attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his physical condition , but Grayson and Mrs. Wilson ignored them , for the most part . It appeared to us in the office that the President was unquestionably unable to carry out the duties of his office as set forth in the Constitution , but by the time a committee from the Senate was successful in its insistence upon seeing Mr. Wilson , he was able to sit up and had begun to scribble his signature on certain documents . Slowly , very slowly , the machinery of the White House office began to move again . Tumulty never admitted how completely he had been severed from connection with the President , but even after Mr. Wilson was able to leave his bed for short periods , Turnulty continued to send papers to Mrs. Wilson , who discussed them with the President and returned them with notations or signature . It seemed improbable that Mr. Wilson improved very much in the year and a half that he remained in the White House . In that year and a half the political wheel was turning back toward a new Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome face concealed a surprisingly incendiary temper , andCal vin Coolidge , who never missed a trick and became my favorite President . After Mr. Harding was inaugurated , Mr. Wilson purchased and took with him to his home on S Street the big old open car which he had used when he was President . Occasionally I saw him in the years before he died , riding through the streets of the capital with a shawl
