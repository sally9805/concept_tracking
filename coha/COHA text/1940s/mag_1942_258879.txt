( See Cover ) <P> One of the decisive sea battles of history was fought last week in the placid waters between Java and Borneo . It was the naval battle for Java . It was a battle for the last bulwark against Japanese conquest of the Indies , a battle for the Southwest Pacific , a battle for a great chunk of the world 's seas and sea power . It was a battle fought too late and in the wrong place , lost before it began . <P> The commander of the allied Dutch and U.S. Fleets* knew that the battle was lost . Vice Admiral C. E. L. Helfrich 's orders to the Dutchmen and the gentle , excited Indonesians on his own ships , to the hard young men on the U.S. ships , said as much . His orders were to attack the oncoming , superior enemy at all costs , to kill Japs and sink Jap ships regardless of the risk to Allied lives and outnumbered Allied ships . If the Jap could not now be stopped at sea , almost within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to pay . <P> The Jap Paid . Dutch and U.S. cruisers and destroyers sighted a great Japanese convoy of 40 transports , 20 warships . The transports stayed well away from the naval combatants-a precautionary measure which they seemed to follow throughout the Java invasion . At twelve-mile range the Allied cruisers loosed their main batteries on the Japanese . Destroyers closed with shell and torpedo fire . A Japanese heavy cruiser sank . Another Jap cruiser-the Mogami , whose main batteries had apparently been converted from 6.1-to 8-in. guns-retired in flames . Hits crippled a third 8-in. gun cruiser . Three Jap destroyers blazed up , appeared to be sinking when the attackers last saw them . <P> Allied bombers reported hits on two more Jap cruisers ; at least 17 Jap transports were bombed , shelled or torpedoed . <P> But in the Batavia accounts , there was a strangely light accent on air attack . Perhaps the always insufficient Allied bomber force was reserved for the land battle . Perhaps it had been depleted in earlier battles . <P> The Allies Paid . A lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going until she ran aground . In the night , when the Japanese were converging on central Java from east and west , two Dutch cruisers ran straight into an enemy fleet . Both cruisers sank , apparently torpedoed . Two Allied destroyers went down ; since Batavia did not say they were Dutch , they were probably U.S. ships . Tokyo boasted that the Japanese had sunk eleven Allied warships , but clouded its claims by ignoring known Japanese losses . <P> Outnumbered , outgunned , sorely in need of heavy cruisers to bolster their light naval units , the Allies took a beating off Java . The Dutch had started the war with five cruisers : the loss was a severe blow to total cruiser strength in the Indies . For his losses , the Jap got his landings on Java ( see p. 16 ) . For the Allies , graver than their total loss in ships was the immediate threat to their last naval base in the Indies . <P> These things the stolid , seawise commander of the Allied fleets in the Indies weighed at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Helfrich , he does not rant or snarl or gloom . He goes grim . This week he was very grim .
