WALT WHITMAN - Henry Seidel Canby-Houghfon Mifflm ( $3.75 ) . <P> By the time of the Battle of the Wilderness ( 1864 ) , Walt Whitman had been working in the hospitals of Washington for more than a year , a familiar figure by this time , tall , red-faced , hairy as a buffalo , moving gently and capably through the 50 one-story sheds that , because of disease , intrigue , and what went on inside them , were more dangerous to the wounded than any battlefield on earth . <P> He watched the bearers bring in a boy who groaned as they carried him to the hospital gates and who , by the time they stopped to examine him , was dead . He was unknown ; there was nothing on his clothing nor anyone with him to identify him . <P> He was one of the thousands , and of him Whitman said : " I could not keep the tears out of my eyes . " Statesman of the Intellect . During that time Whitman was subjecting his prophetic and poetic vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history has knowledge . Few poets of that age considered their verse mere ornaments of daily existence ; they were rather generals and statesmen of the intellect and emotions whose creations had a tangible , profitable and practical application to ordinary life . Yet even among them Whitman was exceptional ; he alone insisted that he knew what America was for , why it had been founded , why it had developed as it had , and what its future should be . <P> With a fervor unmatched since the days of the Old Testament prophets , he went further and insisted that if his vision were followed it would bring victory , and with victory an end of human unhappiness when " all these hearts as of fretted chil dren shall be sooth 'd . " ; The vision began to take form at the meeting point of life &; death . The hospitals were halls of agony . Walking through them , visitors fainted . The men who had beaten back Pickett at Gettysburg and been burned when the caissons exploded at Chancellorsville here faced a more deadly menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemons and sugar for lemonade ; tobacco , and money . <P> He read to them - never his own poetry . <P> Through the years that reeled and trembled beneath him , when it seemed to him that no cause was being fought for and he was horrified and disgusted at the mutual butchery in the vast slaughterhouse of war , he came to know the Northern soldiers , probably better than any man alive .
