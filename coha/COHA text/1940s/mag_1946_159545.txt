Six months after the Russians entered Mukden , industrial metropolis of Manchuria , U.S. correspondents were allowed to enter . Reported TIME Correspondent William Gray : <P> The main street of Mukden 's former modern Japanese area is now " Stalin Prospect . " The Yamato Hotel is " Hotel of the Intourist Travel Agency of Moscow , U.S.S.R. " Near Mukden 's railway station is a granite-mounted Red Army tank , a memorial to Russian soldiers . Russian and Chinese flags fly together everywhere , but there is little doubt which flag dominates . <P> The atmosphere of Mukden is charged with a degree and kind of fear that Americans should never experience , and find hard to believe until it infects them also . We toured this depressing city one cold bright morning in a Chinese Army truck . In one street we came upon ten blackening Chinese or Japanese corpses , a fortnight old and partly gnawed by dogs . Grisly as this sight was , it was more easily forgotten than the sight of Mukden 's ravished factories . <P> This week Russia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Red Army men carted off machinery from the Mukden ice plant , the city 's new Chinese mayor , Tung Wen-chi , protested to the Russian garrison commander , Major General Andrei Kovtun-Stankevich . A man of remarkable statements ( see INTERNATIONAL ) , the Soviet officer blandly replied : " The Red Army is very powerful . I can not stop them . " <P> Dismantled Factories . The gaunt facts of Mukden 's sacking are there for anybody to see , but it is a rare man indeed who will tell what he knows about the days last fall when looting was at its height . By chance we met a young Japanese engineer who had witnessed the dismantling of the Japanese-built Anshan Steel Works , about 60 miles from Mukden , and Manchuria 's biggest industry . <P> The Russians , he said , took 70% to 80% of Anshan 's equipment , including foundry tools , machine shop , steel rolling and milling machines , chemical equipment , trucks , locomotives . The booty was sent by rail to Dairen and to Russian-occupied Korea , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese , a Chinese official burst into the room and warned : " The Chinese manager of the British Tobacco Company who talked to American correspondents here last week was shot and wounded by a Chinese gunman the following day . " Our informant said he was not worried ; he could take care of him self . Nevertheless he was removed to a place where there was some assurance of his safety . <P> Planned Chaos . These are the dominant facts about Manchuria today : <P> After six months of Russian occupation , Manchuria 's industry is destroyed ; it was apparently the Soviet Union 's dual desire to rebuild Russia 's own factories with Manchurian equipment , and to weaken China on her Asiatic flank . Mukden has been reduced from a great industrial city into a tragic , crowded way station on the Russian-controlled railroad to Dairen . A strong China is not Russia 's aim .
