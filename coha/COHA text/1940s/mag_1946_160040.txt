Massachusetts ' stolid , solid Senator Leverett Saltonstall smelled something fishy last week , and it was not Boston cod . <P> The Senator sat down and wrote to the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship : " The Council ... has been taking positions on matters of policy affecting our Government 's relation with the Government of Russia . ... I became a sponsor of the American-Soviet Friendship during the war . ... As you know , I have never been consulted by your officers or executive committee on any position that your organization has taken . . . . Please withdraw my name . " <P> Chairman of American-Soviet Friendship is Rev. William Howard Melish , 36-year-old associate rector of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity of Brooklyn . The Rev. Mr. Melish makes no bones about admiring the not-so-holy trinity of Marx , Lenin &; Stalin . He wrote in the Communist New Masses that he was " impressed by the substantial truth of Marxist methods of social and economic analysis . " He is a supporter of Manhattan 's Jefferson School of Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Council 's four-page bimonthly which Rev. Mr. Melish edits , he took a 100% pro-Russian stand on virtually every question now agitating U.S.Russian diplomatic relations . <P> It was some of these little stink bombs which Senator Saltonstall smelled . Some other equally respectable " sponsors " of the Council caught the whiff and withdrew : Harold Ickes , executive chairman of the Independent Citizens ' Committee of the Arts , Sciences and professions ; Judge Learned Hand of the Circuit Court of Appeals ; Congressman Joseph Clark Baldwin of Manhattan ; William L. Batt , wartime vice chairman of WPB ; Kansas Republican Senator Arthur Capper . <P> But at week 's end the Council still had a respectable list . It included : Christian Gauss , dean emeritus of Princeton ; Mrs. Thomas W. Lament , wife of the board chairman of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , Inc. ; Gerard Swope , honorary president of General Electric ; the Most Rev. Henry St. George Tucker , presiding bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
