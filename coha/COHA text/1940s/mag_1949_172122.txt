The story , like so many others of the mid-20th Century , came to its end in a courtroom . But its beginnings were more auspicious . It began , more or less , on that day in 1926 when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand and German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann . Putting aside the enmities of World War I , Briand and Stresemann had signed at Locarno a mutual security pact . <P> To support their diplomacy of good will , the two men encouraged Franco-German youth congresses , literary and scientific conventions , exchanged theater companies , formed a Franco-German Society . In Paris , Briand subsidized a newspaper edited by gifted Jean Luchaire . <P> Luchaire was well prepared as an advocate of French-German reconciliation . His father had served Briand at the League of Nations , his stepmother was Stresemann 's secretary and biographer . Jean 's wife waved the flag of rapprochement in her own way : she became Stresemann 's mistress , took Jean 's daughter Corinne to Germany with her . Little Corinne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the rich old man took her into his home . <P> A Clean Passion . Outstanding on the other side of the reconciliation movement was a blond , blue &; starry eyed young German drawing teacher , Otto Abetz . Under his leadership , the two countries exchanged students , published a Franco-German magazine at Stuttgart . Abetz attended a vacation camp in the Black Forest where French and German youths pledged themselves to pacifism and eternal friendship . <P> Otto Abetz met Luchaire , became his friend , married Luchaire 's secretary , Suzanne de Brouckere . In those days , Abetz loved France with a clean passion . The passion endured even while , on both sides of the Rhine , the foundations of rapprochement were crumbling . Hitler , backed by money from Banker von Schroeder and others , had come to power . <P> Suzanne bore Otto a son . To famed French Novelist Jules Remains , visiting Abetz ' shabby Berlin apartment in 1934 , the child seemed " touching , born as he was , not of a chance meeting between two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Obsessed with his ideal , Abetz convinced himself that the " reasonable and peaceful elements " in Naziism would help him realize it . Eagerly , he went back to Paris . This time he had 350,000 francs a month expense money from the Nazis . He used it to subsidize pro-German writers , to make himself the intimate acquaintance of powerful French politicians and industrialists . He paved the way for Munich and the failure of French arms . <P> Criminality &; Corruption . Jean Luchaire shared Abetz ' feelings , helped him mightily . As " men of good will " under Briand and Stresemann , the two had failed to bind France and Germany together in peace and prosperity . In the Nazi era , they forged a lethal link between German criminality and French corruption . <P> Now a piquant and beautiful film actress , Corinne Luchaire had grown up among the " respectable " Nazis that frequented Banker von Schroeder 's mansion . There , too , she had met Otto Abetz . Politically , Otto was faithless to France ; personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that symbolized their pre-Nazi ideal . Before he was expelled from France in 1939 , Otto Abetz made 17-year-old Corinne Luchaire his mistress .
