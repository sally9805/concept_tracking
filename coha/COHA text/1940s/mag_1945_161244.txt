A Matter of Pride Los Angeles ' rubber-tire industry had come to life again . Absenteeism , which had made the Firestone , Goodyear , U.S. Rubber and Goodrich tire plants production disappointments , was reported cut in one month from 12% to 3% . Production was up 50% . The apparent reasons : Tire workers had gone to work on a seven-day instead of a six-day-week ( as part of a War Department-sponsored , four-month drive which began Jan. 1 ) . The Germans ' December breakthrough had revitalized complacent workers . The emergency furlough of 600 soldiers to fill in gaps in the tire plants over a month ago seemed to have touched civilian workers ' pride . The presence of uniforms made them work harder and faster than ever before . ( Another 900 soldiers were proving equally successful production boosters in other rubber plants . ) <P> When the soldiers reported for work Dec. 27 , the civilian workers ran out no red carpets for them . Most of the soldiers were grass-green . They had to be taught tire-building work , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their Army pay . Most of the civilians belonged to C.I.O. 's United Rubber Workers of America , while the soldiers were nonunion . <P> To make matters more difficult , the soldiers worked with unabashed fervor to make good ( and possibly win furlough extensions ) , and to make as much as $100 a week , with overtime . They worked as if they had never heard of anything but a seven-day week . <P> While the plant managers and the Army waited to see what would happen , the civilian workers decided that they liked their soldier helpers . The C.I.O. voted soldiers honorary memberships in U.R.W.A. , which meant they could attend meetings without paying dues . Union members taught them trade tricks in the plants , formed special housing committees to find the new workers rooms . <P> At Goodrich , the civilians promised not to shave until the drive was over , shaved absentee civilians on their return to work and cut their trousers off at the knee-signifying an ignominious return to boy status . Workers at the U.S. Rubber plant chipped in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in departments with the highest " presenteeism " rate . <P> At week 's end , nobody would predict how long this unexpected good-fellowship would last , or how far it could be extended over the rest of the country . But the production bottleneck was broken .
