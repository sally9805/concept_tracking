The company doctor was a 33 - year- old woman , and good-looking ; her name was Betty Hayes . Last July Dr. Hayes looked over the sanitary conditions in the company-owned mining villages of Force , Byrnedale and Hollywood , Pa. , and decided that conditions were bad . The water had to be boiled before it could be used ; sewage overflowed into yards and streets ; the streets were mud bogs . <P> The state health officer told Dr. Hayes to wait until there was an epidemic before she made a formal complaint . The Shawmut Mining Co. said they could do nothing : they had been in receivership since 1905 and in another six years the mines would be worked out and abandoned . But her father had doctored the 400-odd miners and their families for 40 years before her time and she felt responsible for them . Dr. Betty resigned . <P> The miners struck in sympathy ; they wanted Dr. Betty back . During the long deadlock , which lasted all summer and fall , Dr. Betty gave emergency medical care . The mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably enough , says Dr. Betty , to have cleaned up the sewage ) , locked up Dr. Betty 's office , on which she had paid the rent , took out some of her medical supplies and books and put a policeman at the door to keep her out . She haled the mine managers into court . <P> At this point , Federal Judge Guy K. Bard , who has jurisdiction over the receivers , stepped in . The judge made a visit to the towns to look and sniff for himself . <P> Said he : " Pure water should be the first requirement of a community . I think it would pay in the end to clean up . It is economically wise to make a better community . " He appointed new receivers , who agreed to fix up the wells and the sewage . The miners were expected to go back to work . Dr. Betty is already on the job .
