Nine-year-old Carnation Ormsby Madcap Fayne , an aristocratic Washington cow of Holstein-Friesian parentage , completed last week a new annual world 's record for milk production . Carnation , called Capper by her chums , last year gave 24 times her own weight ( 1,750 lb. ) in milk , a total of 41,944 lb. , an average of 55 quarts a day-more milk than nine ordinary cows can manage . <P> Capper wrested her title from an English shorthorn named Cherry . Cherry had taken her record from Capper 's older half-sister , Carnation Orrnsby Butter King , who-according to Capper 's press agent-died shortly afterwards of a broken heart . <P> Capper lives in style : her escort and sole milker , Carl Gockerell , 60 , always wears white while petting , pampering , babying and milking her . <P> For her record-breaking finale on May 21 there was hurly-burly and hubbub on a first-night scale . Lush young models in picture hats drove 45 miles from Seattle . Half a dozen dairy greats flew 1,743 miles from Chicago for the event . Reporters swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milker Gockerell took his place , started to milk . A nervous photographer interrupted to ask him to move Capper 's stern a few degrees to port . Infuriated , Gockerell shouted : " You ca n't shove a cow like this around . She 's got ideas of her own . She 's got feelings . " Capper calmly chewed her cud , gave down her winning quarts.
