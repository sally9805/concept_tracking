 | watery blue eyes flickered down at it . " My name is Michaels . Dr. Daniel Michaels . " The face relaxed with shaded recognition . " The reason I 've been so inquisitive , Doctor , is our house rule against pets . This building does n't , as a rule , accept them . " Mr. Hughes 's smile took on a persuasive twist . " I thought you might be checking for the owners . A man has to be careful . " Danny grinned . " Nothing like that . " " I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I have no idea when the Sorensons will return . " " But if you could just keep the dog until they do  --  " " Unfortunately there 's no room here . We do n't know when the Sorensons will be back . Besides , that dog is vicious ! " " Vicious ? " Danny laughed gaily , but it strung out a little thin . Mr. Hughes seemed unconvinced . Danny went on : " I 've got to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how I can help you . " The narrow , sloping Hughes shoulders hunched . Danny 's voice got deeper . " This is a good dog . Your tenant put out a good spot of money for him . He 'd really be burned if you tossed him out into the street . " The mustache twitched as the face behind it went into a frown . " I 'm sorry . I have n't anything else to suggest . " " When did Mr. Sorenson leave ? " " It was last Sunday ; four days ago . " " And Mrs. Sorenson  --  did she leave with him ? " " No . " Mr. Hughes ran a pudgy finger inside the tight striped tab-collared shirt . " Not with him . She left about a week or so before he did . " " They did n't give you any idea where they were going ? " " No ! " Hughes 's round face went indignant , his light eyebrows drawing together . " I do n't make it a practice of snooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his man-to-man smile . " Oh , I did n't mean that .  | I just thought perhaps something you could n't avoid noticing ; his luggage , or ? " The loose skin over the vacuous face trembled as Mr. Hughes shook his head . An idea struck Danny suddenly . " Say ! This dog has certainly been to a veterinarian . They could n't have bathed him in the apartment , a big dog like this . " Mr. Hughes looked horrified . " I should hope not ! " Danny went on as the idea grew in his mind : " Well  --  if he 's been to a vet , perhaps there 'll be medicine up in the apartment . The name of the vet would be on the bottle , and we could board the dog with him . " " Well , I do n't exactly know . " Mr. Hughes thought it over . " I mean , I do n't know that we should enter the apartment . " " But certainly your maids must go in and out to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well " ? Danny shrugged ? " it 's our only chance to take care of the dog . I 'd hate to take a nice well-kept fella like this down to the dog pound . You know they do n't hold ' em there very long , and Sorenson will have a fit when he comes back and finds you let the animal go . " Hughes thought a moment , then looked around at the door behind him with uneasy concern . He sauntered over and opened it . " I 'm going upstairs for a minute , dear . " The key rattled in the lock , and then the door swung open quietly . Danny peered over and past Mr. Hughes 's slick round head as it disappeared to the right . " Just a minute , Doctor . You wait out there . I 'll see if I can find anything . " " Okay . " Danny looked down at Hans ruefully . " This sure must be kindness-to-animals week , " he observed . " Just what I deserve for chasing rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the chink of open  | door before him . Then unexpectedly the leash , loTed loosely around Danny 's hand , slipped , and the dog flashed through the door into the room . " Hey ! " cried Danny . " Come here ! " Hans had no intention of obeying . Danny hurriedly followed into the large disordered living room , kicking the front door closed behind him . He stood for a moment . Hughes was in the kitchen , rattling around the pots and pans like a third-rate chef . Through a door across the room to the left he could hear the sound of the dog 's loose panting . He followed the dog 's sounds into a small lavish bedroom . The flowered wallpaper , too heavily designed for the walls , was carried up over the ceiling . Danny glanced at the furniture . It was blond wood , moderne . One of the pink chintz bedspreads showed the imprint , in wrinkles , of a suitcase . A rose-pink carpet and a frilly dressing table .. . Signs of hurried departure were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stupid kid 's mouth , trailing out spaghettilike strands of rumpled clothing . A narrow door stood open , revealing the small bathroom , finished in vivid green tiles . The glass shower door was half opened . Two chartreuse towels hung limply from a chromium bar , and at the end of the room Hans was standing motionless before a black-and-white porcelain bowl at the foot of the washbasin . Danny grinned . Of course . The dog had n't had anything to drink for hours . He filled the bowl from the tap . The dog nearly knocked him over going at it , and the big red tongue lapped at the water with rhythmic sounds , like water splashing against a boat . Danny looked down at the dog apprehensively and then looped the handle of the leash over the water turn-off beneath the basin . No use losing the hound a second time . The dog still drank . When the bowl was empty he looked up at Danny expectantly . Danny filled the small bowl a second time and then stood waiting , looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , people usually do n't keep dog  | medicine along with their own . But here he was , and here , behind the shining mirror , was the cabinet . He might as well take a look . The mirror was cold against his fingers as the door swung open quietly . Danny 's eyes ran expertly through the rows of bottles on the glass shelves . Simple household remedies : aspirin , shampoo soap , hair tonic , shaving soap , an almost empty bottle of Bromo , boric crystals , an eyecup .. . On the top shelf was a small narrow bottle filled with a clear oily liquid . Danny reached up and turned it to read the label . The bottle nearly slipped out of his hands . The label read : " Chaulmoogra Oil . " The small room was so quiet that it rang in Danny 's ears . He slipped the bottle into his pocket and returned to the bedroom . The steel casement windows were tightly shut , and the room was so stuffy he felt dizzy . Someone had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily through the closed room like a sweet blanket . He looked down at the floor . Beside the bureau was a wastebasket . Against it leaned a cigarette carton . The brand name was printed in English script across the end of the carton . It said : " Old Virginia Ovals . " Old Virginia Ovals ! Judas ! Maybe . . Maybe his mind was jumping to conclusions . But if it was , it was like a boxful of fleas , all jumping in different directions . John Doe ? 347 smoked Virginia Ovals . That could be a coincidence . But the dog was no coincidence . Hans belonged here , all right , and he had raised the ruckus at the morgue as the sergeant had gone to work over John Doe ? 847 . Not only that , but Danny vividly recalled the welter of scars on John Doe 's thin fingers and a significant group of symptoms on the dead body . Add those symptoms to this bottle of chaulmoogra oil , and what did you get ?  | Danny 's mental chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lock that came to him through the doorway leading to the living room . Unhooking Hans , Danny looked out of the bedroom door across the wide , modern living room and paused . Someone was fumbling with a key at the front door , which swung quietly open , and a young woman stepped quickly in . Her dark-skinned face was framed by a tight-fitting turban of bright green , in vivid contrast to the shining blue black hair that hung in loose folds down to a beautifully luxurious silverfox cape . Her lips , a heavy crimson gash above the curve of a soft chin , were slightly parted . Long black lashes accentuated by a tracing of black on her lids rose to expose startled dark brown eyes . " Hullo . " Danny 's voice was sheepish , despite his effort to make it casual . The girl looked up at him in startled surprise . A large bright green suede purse hung open from her arm , and she was auto- matically tucking a ring of keys into it . A green-gloved hand snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps backward toward the door . " I 'm sorry , " she said hastily . " I must have got off at the wrong floor . " Whatever Danny might have said was interrupted by Hans , who started whining loudly and straining at the leash to get toward her . The girl spun around and disappeared into the hallway , and by the time Danny , dragged along by Hans , reached the doorway the girl had disappeared around a corner . Hans was barking loudly , angrily . Mr. Hughes scurried in from the kitchen and asked angrily : " What 's going on here ? " " Oh  --  a woman just came into the apartment by mistake . Said she got off at the wrong floor  --  the dog scared her . "  | Mr. Hughes 's lips pursed . " I 'm not'surprised . What 's he doing in there ? " " He got away , and I came in after him . " Hughes grunted with disapproval . ' Well , let 's get along . There 's no sign of who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key into the lock and the bolt clicked as he threw it , locking the door . ' Well , " he said , " that 's that . Guess you 'll have to make other arrangements for the dog . " Danny nodded . His fingers closed around the medicine bottle in his pocket . " Only one thing I can . think of , " he said . " That 's to take him to Sergeant Myers . " Hughes looked up dubiously from a ring of keys through which he 'd been sorting . " You mean you 'd palm off that brute on the Army ? " Danny shook his head . " No . On the police . " December 17 Sergeant Myers heaved across the wide reception room at the morgue like a giant bull . Charlie Hankenmeier looked up at him wistfully . " Sort of a quiet day , Sarge . " The sergeant nodded and made for the door eagerly . The clock above Charlie 's head said five-thirty . After standing up his old lady last night on account of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night it had looked for a while as if Dorothy Lamour and the double bill at the Sterling might be the rocks on which his marital vessel would flounder . In desperation he 'd agreed to forego the comforts of a cigar and the fur-lined slippers tonight . Anything to remove the police-siren whine out of his old lady 's voice . And to the sergeant , a promise was a promise . He was lumbering hurriedly down the wide steps as a familiar voice called out to him .  | " Hey , Sarge ! " The sergeant stopped dead in his tracks , his big arms swinging at his sides . Only one voice he knew had that youthful ring . It was Danny , all right , being towed up the sidewalk by what looked like a wolf . The sergeant groaned as he saw the uncertain grin on the handsome Irish face . " Judas , Sarge . I 'm glad you 're still here ! " " Well , as it happens , I ai n't . I just left . " The sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd end up as a veterinarian . The kid leaned down and patted the dog 's head . " I 'm just practicing to be a blind man . " " After last night , you should ! Now look , Danny , much though I 'd enjoy exchanging the time of day with you , it just so happens that due to a little whim of yours I missed taking my old lady to a show last night . So I had to promise to take her tonight . So I 'm already late . " " But , Sarge ! This is important . " The sergeant thought of so many swearwords all at once that none of them could edge out . " Important ! Now look , Danny . My old woman wo n't stand for no nonsense . Neither will I ! " Danny cut in abruptly : " But what if you exposed something big , Sarge ? " Danny 's head made an enthusiastic , admiring switch . " Just think ! Your picture in the paper , your name in the headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't one to be hasty . " Yeah ? " he said skeptically , but he listened . " I can just see it , Sarge . " Danny 's dark eyes narrowed inventively , and with a sweep of a hand he managed to create headlines , pictures , captions , which set the sergeant 's nerves tingling . " Why , " Danny went on , " I 'll bet the chief 'd have to let you be Santa Claus at the orphans ' party . You could write your own  | ticket . Why , there 'd even be people who 'd say that a man of your caliber ought to be chief ! " The sergeant sighed . Then he squared his shoulders . " No ! " he bellowed . " It 's no dice , Danny . " He started for his car . " Okay , Sarge . " Danny 's voice followed him casually . " Oh , by the way , could you tell me how to get in touch with McWalters ? " " McWalters ! " The sergeant spun around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've got to give someone this story . I was hoping it 'd be you . " Danny surveyed his nails carelessly and shrugged . " I suppose as long as McWalters is going to be Santa Claus I might as well give it to him . Those kids at the orphanage 'll like having their Santa Claus a big public hero . " " Well , after all , " the sarge said pettishly , " the morgue is my detail . If there 's any stories here I 'm the one to know about them . " Danny shrugged . An expression of complete unconcern twisted the dark face , jutting out an ample underlip . " However you want it , Sarge . " The sergeant sighed . " Okay . Now give . " Danny looped the dog 's leash over his arm and rubbed his hands together . ' Well , to begin with , after last night I decided that hereafter the only business I mind is strictly my own . But today I seem to have blundered into something big . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go on , we 've got to make a deal . I 'm in Dutch with Doc Elliot over at the hospital . " A flickering gleam of acknowledgment lighted Danny 's eyes . " All I want in return for this information is your promise to fix me up again with Doc Elliot . " " I got to hear more before I promise anything . If you 're on the level , you 're in . " " It begins with this dog . " Danny indicated Hans with a flicker  | of his eyes . " As you may recall , this is the baby that howled at us when we looked at John Doe ? 847 last night . " The sergeant nodded impatiently . " I did n't know what to do with him . There 's a tag on his collar for an apartment on Lake Shore . " The story caught on a snag as it swept through the sergeant 's mind . " But you said last night that some girl took the dog with her . Said it was hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mistaken . The dog was returned to me this afternoon , so I decided to cash in on the reward . " The sergeant listened intently to the rest of the story . How Danny went to the Lake Shore apartment . How , while Hughes went in to investigate for the name of a veterinarian , the dog broke loose and Danny went after him . How , in the bathroom cabinet .. . " And here it is . " As Danny completed his story he drew a small bottle from his pocket and handed it to the sergeant . The sergeant read the label puzzledly : " Chaulmoogra Oil . ' What does that add up to ? " " I ca n't be sure until I make a little test on John Doe ? 847 . If he has the same thing wrong with him that I think , you 've got John Doe identified . Also , you 've got a big story . A hell of a big one . " " And where do you come in ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole business , and it 's all yours from there on in . " " Well , what are we waiting for ? " Myers asked briskly . Once in the inspection room downstairs , the sergeant tried to conceal his admiration for Danny 's deft activities , but it was hard . Danny had quicksilver , the fluid easiness to be found only in good doctors , and even then , rarely . An intangible something : dynamic , skillful , inherent . . . First Danny felt expertly at the bones and nerves in the elbows .  | The sergeant grunted as Danny hesitated a moment , then picked up a slender scalpel . " You ai n't going to cut , Danny ? " " Just scrape a little culture off the inside of the nose . " In a moment the scalpel tapped gently on a small slide of glass . The sergeant felt like a wonder-struck child at a Punchand-Judy show as Danny moved quietly to the pathology room and snapped on the light and then as he took a small bottle from a cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Danny ? " The sergeant was shocked at the reverent subservience in his voice . Danny surveyed the slide carefully to see if the bacteriological smear was dry . " Carbolfuchsin stain . " A bright carmine-red dot of dye hit the slide . Danny set it down carefully , struck a match , and held it over the Bunsen burner which lighted with a little puff and jetted up an even blue-white flame . When the culture was faintly steaming he took the small glass to the tap and rinsed it in water . Then he took a second bottle from the shelf , poured a little into a small flat basin . " And what 's that ? " " Acid alcohol . " " What is this ? Black magic ? " " No , Sarge . You see , some bacilli are acid-fast . ' We catch them first with the red stain . Then this acid alcohol takes the color out of all the other substances except the bacilli we want to study . Then we dip the whole works in methylene blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It stains everything but the bacilli ; makes them stand out by themselves , so you ca n't miss ' em . " As Danny spoke he held the slide under water , then took a third bottle from the shelf ; a small drop of bright blue hit the slide and diffused across the small shining surface . He took it to the microscope . " And what 's all this going to prove ? "  | Danny looked up an instant soberly . " Maybe we 'll find the guy 's engine number . " He adjusted the focus with steady fingers . The sergeant noticed that the kid breathed more rapidly . " Here ! Let me look ! " The sergeant crowded at Danny . It did n't look like much down there , although the colors were pretty . Outlined in bright , glittering red against a sky-blue background he saw a series of minute clusters of long , slender rods . " It do n't look like no monogram or draft number to me ! " " But it 's all right there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microscope . " John Doe ? 847 is one Alex Sorenson . Alex Sorenson of 1403 Lake Shore Drive . " Danny looked up at the sergeant intently . The fleshy eyebrows had lifted ; the round , lined face was puzzled . " Sorenson ? Lake Shore Drive ? " Danny nodded . " Jeese ! " The old man 's voice was impatient at Danny 's pause . " Go on , Danny . What 's the rest of this story ? " " You 've got the rest of the story right in the palm of your hand , Sarge . " Danny indicated the small bottle which the sergeant was still clutching moistly . " Chaulmoogra oil . Dammit , Danny , get to the point ! " " I found that bottle in Sorenson 's apartment , which 'd indicate he used it . " The sergeant nodded . " These slides prove John Doe ? 847 had a damned good reason for using it too . And for a very rare disease . So rare , in fact , that it proves they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . ' " But what ? What 's so rare ? What does it prove ? What 've they got , rabies or something ? " " No , Sarge . You use chaulmoogra oil  --  " Danny snapped out the light under the microscope . " You use it for leprosy ! "  | FIVE December 17 AT THREE MINUTES PAST MIDNIGHT Danny walked slowly up the stairs of the interns ' dormitory . A crack of light shone under some of the doors , but the hallway was dim and quiet . Danny pushed open the door to his room . The lights were out , and heavy rhythmic breathing from the cot in the corner indicated that Pete was asleep . Danny closed the door behind him and crossed the room . As he slipped his coat onto a hanger in the closet Pete 's light snapped on . " Hi , kid . " Danny grinned when he saw Pete 's tousled head . " Thought you were asleep . " " Never too sleepy to take a cut on twenty bucks . " " Roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Danny slipped out of his cotton undershirt nonchalantly , then sat on the edge of the bed and worked on his shoelaces . " I vaguely recall a little business deal . If you 'll be so kind as to explain  --  " Danny scratched his shoulders contemplatively . " I 'm in no mood for annual reports to the stockholders . I have nothing further to say . " " Oh yes , you have ! " Pete surveyed Danny suspiciously through heavy lids . " Seems we had an asset in the person of a man-eating monster . Seems I enriched the treasury with two fine old etchings of President Washington , surrounded by mundane little remarks like : One Dollar  --  Payable to Bearer on Demand . " " With your two bucks , little man , you bought an interest in a business proposition . Well , your stock just hit bottom . " Danny ducked into the closet to hang up his pants and to  | snatch his pajamas off the hook . When he re-entered the room Pete was awaiting him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks ? I spent those for a very pleasant ride over the streets of the fair city . I also bought some cigarettes ; that brand that gives you a headache . I had a cup of coffee and a doughnut at Wahlgren 's . I had three cents left . I gave them to an urchin . " " So . For two bucks all I get is eight cents ' worth of Michaels ' prose ! " " That 's right . Well , good night . " " Good night , hell ! How about the dog ? " Danny slipped out of brightly striped shorts and kicked them expertly onto a chair beside the cot . Then he slipped into his pajamas , sheathed his feet in tattered slippers he located under the bed , and went to the closet , where he took a large blue flannel robe  --  Pete 's  --  slipped into it , and tied the belt around his thin waist thoughtfully . " It 's a long story . " A tone of contemplative seriousness had sobered his voice . ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Our sole asset at present is an improved relationship between me and the local constabulary . " Pete sat up quickly . " You did n't tangle with the sarge ! " " I wouldn t put it that way . You might say he and I reached an understanding . " Danny nodded sadly . " And before I go on remember how I promised you could kick me in the rear if I ever again interfered in anyone else 's business ? " Pete rubbed two big hands together . " Do I ! " " Well , if you want to collect , this is your chance , while you have n't got your shoes on . " " Ah , " said Pete . " Things are looking up ! Looks like we 're going to collect dividends , after all . Explain . " Danny hastily sketched the visit to the Lake Shore apartment and the tests at the morgue . Pete was excited . " Talk about psychic diagnosis ! "  | " What was so psychic about it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang ! You diagnose leprosy . Maybe you have n't been keeping up in your studies , Dan . Chaulmoogra oil is used by some doctors in treating arthritis , various cutaneous diseases  --  " Danny interrupted impatiently : " Nothing psychic about it . Y'see , when I looked at John Doe 's hands down in the morgue I happened to notice his finger tips were covered with small scars . That 's what set the old ball rolling ; sort of shorted a fuse . I did n't give it much thought until I ran into the chaulmoogra oil . " Pete shook his head enviously . " I still say you 're a lucky little character . " " I kept telling myself : Hands off ; Danny  --  mind your own damn business . ' But what would you have done under the circumstances ? " Pete 's face was sober . Most of the sleepy lassitude was gone . " About the same thing you did , I guess . " " Well , all hell broke loose . In the first place , the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medal . Wanted to get me on the force . Wanted to adopt me . I declined , of course , in that smooth way I handle situations . " Pete said : " Humph ! " " I was all ready to blow . Far as I was concerned , I was finished with the whole mess ; I 'd done everything I could . All I wanted was to have the sarge fix me up again with Dr. Elliot . But the old man did n't see it that way . He 'd snatched the coroner in some trouble because the boys should have caught the leprosy when they did the autopsy , and now he wanted to rub their noses in it . " " Yah . The way they ride the poor sarge , I can understand that ! " " In the second place , they shot out a squad car to pick up Hughes at the Sorenson apartment . And they called in the Federal Health Services , a Dr. Seaver . " " Wow ! Some fireworks ! "  | " But fireworks was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Danforth , an attorney . " " Sounds like a Kiwanis convention . " Danny nodded . " Hughes got there first . They took him down and he positively identified John Doe ? 847 as his tenant , Alex Sorenson . Said there was no question of it . " " And how did he like the thought he 'd been running a leper colony ? " Danny snapped a finger and pointed at Pete . " He does n't know . They want to keep that quiet for the time being , so for Judas ' sake , do n't spout off . " " If I had a hat I 'd keep all this under it . So then ? " " So then Dr. Seaver arrived . They 'd called him out of a medical meeting . He 's quite a guy , Pete . Tall , slender , handsome as hell , and no fooling around . I told him everything I knew . Of course they 're in on the deal in a big way because of the leprosy . And one very queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have had , of any Alex Sorenson . So now they 're out to locate Mrs. Sorenson , because maybe she 's contracted it too . Maybe she never knew her old man was carrying the bug . And they 're also out to locate the doctor who diagnosed leprosy and prescribed chaulmoogra oil , and then did n't report the case to Federal Health . That 'll mean his license . " " And what theory do they have for the fact a guy who lived in a ritzy Lake Shore bagnio ends up four days later as a downand-out bum ? " Danny smiled grimly . " The sergeant thinks that Sorenson , discovering he had leprosy , committed suicide when the futility of it all struck him . He thinks Sorenson left his cushy apartment , took to drinking to drown his troubles , was rolled by a bum somewhere , and ended up in rags . Sort of a junior temperance lecture . " " Sounds phony . " " Sure it does . So does everything else . Dr. Seaver is n't convinced . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked  | ion Sorenson 's past activities , and that wo n't be easy . " Danny gave : Pete a wink and took a toothbrush and tube of paste out of a glass on his dresser . As he reached the door Pete said : " And how ' , about the dog ? " " The police are holding him at the pound . Sort of a silent witness . I guess it stumps the sergeant . You ca n't stand over a dog with a piece of rubber hose and say : So you wo n't talk ? Well , then , take this ! ' " Danny closed the door behind him quickly and set off for ' the bathroom . When he returned Pete was still propped up on one elbow . " You know , I was just thinking , Dan . " " Bragging again . " " How about the little episode with the queen of Evanston ? Where does she come in , if at all ? What did you tell Sergeant Myers and Dr. Seaver about her identifying the dog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Danny sighed troubledly . " I tried to soft-pedal it . Judas , Pete , I do n't want to get her on the rack . " " If you ask me , she 's a little haywire . Maybe a little talking would cleanse the soul . " " That 's her problem , not mine . I told Dr. Seaver the bare facts . I told him that Ferguson brought the dog back and said Marian had been mistaken . I even bowed my head a little and said that she naturally was hysterical and upset as a result of my . , having sneaked her into the morgue as I did , that she could have been mistaken . " " Did that satisfy Seaver ? " The close-cropped head shook . " No , I 'd already talked too much . Seaver said as long as there was any doubt , just as routine , tomorrow they should get in some of the people who originally ' identified the burned body out in Hubbard Woods as Sutton . That 's where Danforth came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton 's former attorney before the accident .  | He and some dentist made the identification at that time . So the sergeant called Danforth 's office to make an appointment . Danforth was there ; he was just leaving ; he offered to drop by on his way home . Right then . " " Oh-oh ! " " Seaver had to leave . His meeting was that big medical conclave over the Kenney treatment and he just could n't miss it . Of course Seaver did n't have to be there ; it was straight routine . Danforth 'd say yes  --  or no  --  it was , or it was n't , Sutton . " Pete held the thoughtful pause for a moment , then dropped it like a hot light bulb , shattering it . " Yeah ? " " Well , I wish Seaver could have stayed , because this is the part I did n't get . Danforth seems to be okay . One of those big hearty guys  --  hail fellow well met . But there 's something ? something  --  " " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the word ; neither is tricky . Maybe it 's just that he 's got a big booming voice and a wonderful flow of words that pour out like warm oil . But inside he 's sly , as smart as a whip . He does n't quite match . " " You do n't know it , but you 're describing half the lawyers in the country . " Danny 's words came carefully , slowly : " Hughes had already left . So had Seaver . Only the sergeant and I were there . Well , Danforth came busting into the morgue like it was a lodge room and he was candidate for Exalted Master . We were a bunch of old buddies in three minutes . He gave me one of those warm , sincere grips that cripples you for life . Just like all his life he 'd been waiting to meet me , and by God , here we were at last . " Pete chuckled . " He no doubt added rather loftily that he considered it a duty  --  nay , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives protecting our lives , our homes , and our womenfolk with their splendid work , irrespective of inconvenience , loss of time , or financial remuneration . "  | Danny grinned . " Right on the button . You must have been there ! " " hope , it 's just that he 's a fine judge of character , that Pete Aldrich , " said Pete modestly . " But of course the sergeant ate it up . " " Sure he did . Well , we took Danforth downstairs . For some reason I watched him ; his face , his expression . He ' did n't bat an eye when they yanked off the sheeting . He just stood there , his eyes like a couple of steel ball bearings . Damn it all , Pete , he was shaking his head-no  --  before he even saw what he was looking at . " " What 'd he say ? " " He said : Oh no . No , that 's not Alfred . Strange , though . There is a resemblance ! But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not Alfred . " Danny lowered his youthful voice in imitation . Pete could hear the undertone of the glib attorney 's voice . " Sort of like he was reading a will , handing down a decision . And meanwhile thinking about something else , " Danny nodded . " He put on quite a little act , about how gripping and dramatic the sergeant 's work must be . You know , the battle between life and death , the two great realms . " " Oh Gawd ! " Pete slapped a flat palm resoundingly against his wide forehead . Danny again imitated the great booming voice , dramatically thrusting a legal palm at his pillow . " This poor soul here , for example . Alex Sorenson , you say ? What were his hopes , his dreams , his fears ? What was his story , hidden behind the still , white mask of death ? " Danny grinned . " It was just rhetoric , but the sergeant was in the mood of the thing , I guess . With that tired , brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danforth that the investigation was n't thoroughly completed ; that none of the details were established , and the case could therefore not be discussed . Period . "  | " Good for the sergeant ! And I 'll bet he upstaged Danforth doing it . " Danny smiled . " So Danforth left , and that was that . Marian was wrong in identifying 847 as her father . And so was I. And God 's in his heaven and all 's right with the world . " " That little poem does n't rhyme . " " You 're right , it does n't . " " You still think it 's Sutton ? " Another sharp nod . " I know damned well it is ! " " Y'know , Danny , I 've been thinking . You sure butted into someone else 's business , all right , but it was sort of in line of duty . " " So what ? " " So , because the floor is cold and it took me two hours to warm my feet up in this damn bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forego the pleasure of that kick in the rear . I 'll give you a slight pinch . " " The hell you will ! " The springs in the cot squealed as he slipped beneath the covers . " Now turn off the light and let 's have some of that blissful quiet you always hear about . " Obediently the light went out and the room was plunged in darkness . Danny had felt sleepy and tired , but now he was wide awake . He found himself thinking of Marian standing beside the marble slab ; of her pale , drawn face ; her widened bluegreen eyes . He could still hear her voice : " That 's Father , Danny ! It 's Father . " He could feel her hand clutching his arm for support ; could hear her sharp , irregular breathing . " Danny ? " Evidently Pete was n't finding much sleep in this abysmal darkness either . " I 'm asleep . " Pete was unabashed . " Have you seen Marian 's mother in the last year or so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because maybe you ought to . Maybe you were able to soft-  | pedal that part of the story and with Danforth 's help keep them out of it . But , Danny , maybe that is n't as great a service as you think . " " Meaning . . . ? " " Meaning that just assuming that Sorenson , , so-called , is Marian 's father ; that somehow he was n't killed up in Hubbard Woods three years ago . . . " " Yeah ? " " He probably had leprosy then ; it 's slow-working stuff , Dan . And if he had it then  --  well , it 's possible Marian 's mother might have it too . " Danny felt his heart beating against his ribs ; the pounding seemed to echo up into his throat . " You ought to be damned sure it is n't Sutton before you go overboard shielding them , Danny . " Danny tried to see the ceiling through the throbbing darkness . " Remember me ? I 'm the guy who just resolved to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious than that . " Pete 's voice was thick with irritation . " This is the real McCoy , and you 've no right to pussyfoot around . If you ask me , and as long as you 've got them in this deep , they deserve to know . It 's your obligation as much as it is to protect them from a couple of questions from the cops . " There was a moment 's silence . " You damned well know that 's Sutton down there , and yet you 'll sit around on your frit ' like a mother hen watching over her eggs while the barn burns down . " " Sure . They 're my eggs and I 'm minding them . And , y'see , what happens to the barn is no affair of mine . I 'm only interested in my own snug little henhouse . " December 18 The day zanged past Danny as only days at County Hospital could . When a place is Misery Headquarters for more than three  | million people , it 's no romp in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with only a seventeen-minute break for lunch . He worked , keeping his mind too full of his job to meander into the shady realm of conjecture . But that shady realm was awaiting him as he stepped out of the tall gray building into the early darkness of the cold December evening . Pete had been sent out on an emergency in the sticks . He wished Pete were here right now to beat off the insistent voices that sang in his ears . Only Pete would disapprove of this handsoff policy too . Pete 's voice would be only another voice ; a louder one , seasoned with impatience . He started walking ; walking fast , straining the tawny muscles in his legs , trying to leave the small voices behind . Winter was in the air , and Christmas . Most of the stores were still open and the crowds were out , roaming , milling , searching for things . Searching for things , just as he was . Only everyone else was searching for such mundane things as a gift tie for some far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to so many people that no matter what answer he found it 'd probably be wrong . So , for that matter , would Uncle Herman 's tie ; only Uncle Herman would n't hang himself with it . He 'd just keep it till next Christmas and hand it on , in another box , with another card . The Loop was covered with a dark winter gloom . All around him lights shone from store windows , and high above him offices gleamed . It was beginning to rain . Danny pulled his coat around him and began to walk more briskly . The teeming crowds were shoving past one another to the dry , steaming protection inside the stores . Groups of soldiers hurried past , hands buried deep in thick drab-green overcoats , their heads lowered to avoid the slanting rain . Even the Volunteers ' Army Santa Clauses stopped ringing their bells and took shelter . Now and then an automobile sloshed  | by on the black , shining pavement , windshield wipers ticking off the time like giant metronomes . At Van Buren Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people and fuller of a dank , pungent odor of wet shoes and garlic , of wet wool and sweat . Danny pulled past the passengers crowded into the aisles and pushed open the door to the front platform . Here , at least , fresher air occasionally came n when the front door slid open . Besides , it was darker on the platform without those yellow naked lights . Danny stood in silent thought . The car lurched westward , the motorman working against a tough schedule . His heavy foot beat a continual , impatient rhythm on the bell . At Franklin a northbound truck crossed before them as the light changed . A shrill , angry staccato from the policeman 's whistle stopped the truck , and the cop walked threateningly toward it . You see ? Danny told himself . Every time you start bucking the rules you get it in the neck . And , damn it , I was told , ordered , to keep out of this . The motorman beat an inquiring note on his foot bell . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the light changed to red , and with a heavy sigh the motorman turned and looked around at the three men waiting on the platform . He saw Danny . " Hi , Doc , " he said Danny looked up and said , " Hello . " Someone to talk to about something else . Maybe that 's what he needed . " Ai n't seen you in a helluva while . " The motorman punctuated with a stamp on the bell ; the conductor pulled the cord , and the car jolted forward . A boy in an Army uniform standing beside the motorman moved from the window , and Danny moved into the spot he 'd vacated . " Still out at the County ? " The motorman whirled the con-  | trols , applied the air in a hurry , and Danny pitched against the front of the car heavily . " Yeah . Still on the job . " " Remember me ? You fixed up my missus last summer . Gallstones . Sure did a swell job of it too . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " A good , safe thing to say . There 'd been more than twenty gallstones while he 'd been in Surgery in August . " How 's she coming along ? " " Just swell ! " The motorman ran his gloved hand over the window before him . The rain was beating down , and little drops of moisture gathered on the inside of the pane . " Running a little late ? " " Yeah . " The motorman made a wry face . " Got a new man back there , and he ai n't worth a damn at beating lights . " The head took a contemplative sideswipe . " And still the supervisor gives you hell if you 're late . " " But suppose it 's a tough night  --  ice and stuff on the street ? and it 's dangerous to jerk a big load along fast ? " " The supervisor still gives you hell , but he tells you that the safety of the passengers comes first . But damn close behind comes the schedule . " Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet night air . He could n't escape it , even here on the front platform of the Van Buren Street car . Sure , rules were okay , until the safety of the passengers came up . Even Dr. Elliot , who made the rules , would agree to that . Clearly Danny 's first duty was to the passengers he 'd pulled along on another kind of ride . He had to get to Mrs. Ferguson . I Ie must make sure that John Doe #847 was not Alfred Sutton . If they were one and the same , then Marian and her mother must be told about the disease . There must be immediate tests , and then , if by some remote chance they had it . . . His mind would n't carry on the thought ; it was too terrible .  | This , then , was it . You ca n't play around with danger on wet , slippery tracks  --  or with leprosy . He swung solidly from the car . His step , as he sloshed across the wet , puddled pavements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the drugstore telephone . In a moment a maid was calling Mrs. Ferguson to the line . " Hello ? " The voice was tense , nervous . " Mrs. Ferguson , this is Dr. Daniel Michaels . " Danny purposely waited . But there was no sound from the other end of the line . He talked rapidly . " Something important has come up ; something very important to you . " " Doctor  --  please  --  I do n't want to seem rude , but really , Mr. Ferguson has asked you not to call . " " Wait a minute , Mrs. Ferguson . Just disregard , if you can , what happened the other night . I want to be helpful . I 'm sure if you 'll listen to me it will save all of you a great deal of  --  unpleasantness . " Danny hurried on to state the facts  --  slightly distorted to save her from any avoidable strain . " The police are working on the matter I discussed with Marian . They know Marian was mistaken , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering from hysteria , but they 're very apt to call her again to clear up that first error . " " Oh no , Doctor ! They must n't  --  involve Marian any further in this thing ! " " Mrs. Ferguson , if you 'd like to come down , I could arrange it so the police need n't know . Then , if Marian was mistaken , you could verify that error officially . If not , well  --  " He ended with a She broke in thoughtfully : " You 're  --  you 're quite sure the authorities need n't know ? " " Not unless you tell them . " The voice assumed tones of desperate decision . " Where and when might I meet you , Doctor ? "  | Danny had the words all ready . " If you 'll be at the bottom of the ambulance ramp  --  that 's around the corner on the side of the building  --  at three o'clock tomorrow , most of the morgue attendants are off duty . The sergeant does n't get there until four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll open up for you at three . " " I  --  at three , then . Three o'clock tomorrow . " He heard the receiver settle slowly . December 19 The next day at three-thirty , when he went to open the big doors for the sixth time , he told himself it would be the last ; she was n't coming . But there she was . She was still pretty , much like Marian , except that her face was thinner . Beneath the green felt hat it had a pale , drawn cast . He noticed the green clip , a big , rich one , on the lapel of her simple gray tailored suit , and she had a Persian-lamb coat thrown over her shoulders . Even the faintly applied rouge and the faint color of her lips failed to conceal the anxiety in the evenfeatured , delicate face . I Icr fingers clutched at the shining black patent-leather bag nervously . " I 'm sorry to be late , Doctor . " For an instant she looked as though she 'd turn and run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ready . You 're sure you want to go through with it ? " She tried to smile . " I 'm here , Doctor , although it 's been one of the most indecisive trips of my life . " Then she stepped inside resolutely as Danny closed the large door behind her . Danny looked at her dubiously . She was trembling , breathing rapidly . He bent his head toward her , but she only smiled again with that same weary assurance . He held her arm firmly . With each step into the big room the trembling increased . He found himself thinking guiltily : Hypersensitive and excitable , needs  | sedatives and rest . No undue excitement or mental strain ... . And yet here he was  --  a doctor  --  subjecting her to the exact opposite . They stopped before the drawer behind which John Doe ? 847 , alias Alex Sorenson , lay on his tray , covered by the rough sheeting . Steel rolled against steel silently as the drawer slid open and a gust of cold , damp air came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin blue face . He should have known she 'd scream . He caught her as she slumped to the floor . SIX December 19 THE SOUND OF HER SCREAMS had rattled back and forth off the hard tile walls , filling the room , and almost immediately Danny heard distant footsteps overhead and the swish of the big door as it opened at the top of the stairs . God above ! What could he do with her ! He tried to lift her , but in falling one of her black patentleather slippers had caught under the roller wheel of the cart behind them . He struggled to free her , but her slender body was as evasive as a handful of water . Finally the cart rolled slightly and her small foot was pulled free . He was lifting her , surprised at how light she was , as footsteps clanked down the iron stairway . Danny looked desperately around the room . Then , carrying her slight weight , he dodged around the roller table and ducked into the dark little autopsy room . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down here someplace . " Charlie 's voice , higher and thinner , whined words that Danny could n't quite understand .  | " Someone 's down here . " You could n't miss the deep , thick voice of the sergeant . They were closer now , and Danny made out the words in Charlie 's falsetto . " Sure . Danny Michaels is , somewheres . I let him in . " Their feet flapped along the narrow hallway as Danny turned and lowered Mrs. Ferguson 's limp body onto a steel table . Beside it was a stack of newly laundered sheets . Ile snatched one up . It crackled like paper , fanning out the icy air as he spread it out over her . In a few steps he was back at the side of John Doe , looking innocently up as Sergeant Myers burst through the door . " Well , for the luvva God ! " The sergeant 's round , ruddy face was splotched with impatient anger . " Danny ! " " Hello , Sarge . " Charlie 's head appeared timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie . " Charlie 's voice had the whine of a vacuum cleaner . " Sarge and me , we heard screaming . " Danny looked as surprised as he could manage . " Screaming ? " The sergeant thrust his head forward on a red bull neck . " Yeah ! What 're you up to down here ? " Danny cleared his throat to gain a few moments . " I just came down for another look at Sorenson , Sarge . Judas ! You do n't see leprosy every day . " The old man 's face screwed up into an appraising scowl . " And the noise ? The screaming ? " Danny looked down at the open drawer before him . " How d' you know it was n't just the drawer ? Maybe I pulled it out at an angle ; ran it off the track . " He tried to run the drawer back into its place at an angle . He had never heard the drawer slide so quietly . The sarge 's eyes narrowed and his mouth twisted with pettish exasperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I pulled out that drawer , maybe something was off the beam . But I promise it 'll never happen again . "  | That was a vow and , Danny hoped , not too much of a lie . He 'd been off the beam all right , even if the drawer was n't , and it was opening the drawer that had produced the scream . For a moment the silence , particularly from the small dark room behind him , roared in his ears . He had to get the sarge and Charlie out of here while it lasted . He was running short on his ration . At any time Mrs. Ferguson might come to and treat them to a scream that would curdle the blood in a turnip . In his wild search for a means his eyes fell on the sergeant 's puffy , wrinkled hand resting on the sheet beside Sorenson 's body . He looked at the hand troubledly , and his voice was filled with self-reproach . " It 's not enough that you 're in danger of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up . " His wide shoulders gave an abject little shrug . The sergeant rose to the bait . " Danger of whose life and health ? " " I mean , messing around down here every day ; a million kinds of infections floating around the place . " Charlie protested in a high-pitched whine , but Danny went on : " I do n't mean the place is n't clean , but just think ! There 's everything down here . Smallpox , pneumonia , scarlet fever , and now  --  leprosy . " " Yeah ? And what 's that got to do with me and my health ? Damn it , Danny ! What 're you trying to get at ? " " I did n't mean to worry you , Sarge , but I noticed you touched the sheet that 's been covering Sorenson there . " The sergeant spread out his hands and surveyed the wide hairy hands with their rough , splayed fingers . His face was a little worried now . " But , Danny  --  " " Do you wash your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've touched a diseased person like Sorenson ? " The sergeant shook his head guiltily , and Danny 's eyes narrowed with professional disapproval . " You know , Sarge , perhaps you 'd better let me give you the once-over . " He took the sergeant 's  | arm . " Come on upstairs . We can lay you out on the coroner 's table . " The sergeant was about to submit , then he suddenly jerked his arm away . " Now just a minute ! I come down here to find out about some screaming . I heard it . So did Charlie . " Charlie nodded submissively . " And all of a sudden we end up talking about me having leprosy . If I did n't know you so well  --  - " Danny shrugged . " Just trying to help an old friend , that 's all . " " Come on now . " The sergeant took command . " Let 's clear out of here . And no more messing around with Sorenson . Understand ? And incidentally , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Danny forced a smile as the sergeant and Charlie turned toward the door . " Be right along , " he said . " I 'll pick up my coat . " The sergeant had swung the door open and was about to lumber out when it happened . From the small dark room behind them came the sound , distinct and unmistakable . A long , deep groan mixed in with a catching , uneven breath . Danny sighed as the sergeant spun around and pounded across the floor to the autopsy room . The lights blazed on with a sharp click . He was right behind the sergeant when the old man shouted : " Charlie ! Come here quick ! " Once they were through the narrow door Danny rushed past them . He reached the slowly moving sheeted figure a moment before the sergeant . Just an eyelash ahead . " This is a job for me . " Then he lifted the cover from the face gently . " She needs reviving , and she 's got to get where it 's warmer . Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sarge , round up a blanket and a glass of water while I carry her upstairs . " The sergeant barked unintelligible questions over Danny 's words , but Danny whirled indignantly on him . " Quit being so helpless . Get that blanket ! " The sergeant hastened off reluctantly as Danny raised the now-conscious woman . Mrs. Ferguson 's pale lips were moving  | with troubled , unspoken words , and beneath her blue eyelids her eyes were rolling distractedly . The white sheeting dropped to the tile floor as he carried her gently across the bright room , then up the hallway and the narrow iron stairs . He whispered to her all the way , trying to reassure himself as well as her . " Everything 's all right , Mrs. Ferguson . Just keep your eyes closed ; act like you 're still unconscious . Let me do the talking . " There was no sign of recognition in the distorted face , so he asked : " Can you understand me ? " Finally her head gave a tired nod only barely perceptible against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner 's office , a gloomy cubicle near Charlie 's wide-topped desk , and set her down on an old black leather settee . He reached for her pulse and counted its regular beat . As he gently lifted one of her eyelids the sergeant churned into the room with an old blanket in his arms . Simultaneously Charlie arrived with the ammonia . Both men stood close behind Danny , watching as he fixed the blanket around her . When there was nothing more to be done he turned to Myers . " Now ! " The sergeant said explosively . " Who is she ? " He had to tell . " A Mrs. Ferguson . " " Ferguson ? Oh ! This is the lady whose daughter come in three nights ago ? The one who said Sorenson was Alfred Sutton ? " He turned back to the limp form . " How 'd she get down there ? " " Not past me , Sarge . " Charlie took up the moment of silence . " I been at my desk all evening . " His long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant whirled on Danny . " Damn it , Danny ! I told you to lay off ! You know the rules ! Dr. Elliot said you 'd promised . Well , as long as you got her here , what did this one say ? " " Nothing . She fainted . " " Sure she did ! " bellowed the sergeant . " I suppose you gave het a big build-up and scared the wits out of her . Told her the guy  | has leprosy and so has everybody else who even looks at him ! Damn it , Danny , I 'm fed up . Damned well fed up ! " Danny had heard Mrs. Ferguson 's sharp intake of breath at the word " leprosy . " He spun around , knelt beside Mrs. Ferguson , and his voice was gentle but pointed . " Just lie back , Mrs. Ferguson . Do n't say anything ! Just lie back . " Her blue eyes fluttered open . Mixed horror and fright were in them , an expression so abjectly desperate that it stopped Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny 's shoulder solicitously . " You going to be all right , lady ? " She nodded weakly and started to rise . Danny tried to restrain her , but she pushed his arm away with an unexpected force . With a deep frown she said just one word , a command : " Please . " Then she ' stepped unevenly toward the sergeant . He supported her arm . She was rocking now . Danny knew she was going to be sick in a moment , good and way-back-to-breakfast sick . The sergeant was using his low , pleading voice , the one that was designed to make you talk before you 'd realize what you were saying . " Was that Mr. Sutton down there , lady ? Dr. Michaels , here , he 's been insisting  --  " Mrs. Ferguson looked away from the sergeant unsteadily , but her voice was vehement . " No ! No ! It 's not Mr. Sutton . There 's a resemblance , but it 's not Mr. Sutton ! " The sergeant tossed an angry look in Danny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in composure , was a miracle of self-control . " I 'm sorry to have caused a disturbance . If I had known my coming would be in violation of the rules  --  " She paused , and the sergeant broke in reassuringly : " It 's all right . Do n't worry a bit about it . " Then again the insistent question : " You 've never seen the gentleman downstairs before ? " " Never before . " She gazed past them , her eyes fading as though  | she were looking miles away . " Never before . Mr. Sutton has been dead for three years . " Danny watched her closely . He 'd missed a guess . She was n't going to be sick . With sheer force of will she had put the sickness down . He was flooded with admiration for her courage and composure . Danny stepped to her side . " Mrs. Ferguson , you must n't talk any more . You must rest . . . . " She drew away from him to the protection of the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant 's eyes narrowed . " Perhaps the doctor 's right . Perhaps you 'd better wait here for a time . We can just sit and talk . I 'll send Mr. Hankenmeier out for some tea at the Night Owl . It 's only across the street . " The sergeant had clumsily overplayed his hand , for now she moved a step away and her hand went to her throat . " You mean I 'm not to be allowed to leave ? " " Oh no , ma'am . " The sergeant was groping for words , a very phony Sir Walter Raleigh in a derby . " I 'll have one of the boys drive us out to your house right this moment . " Yes , thought Danny , and if she still wo n't talk you can twist her wrist en route . But she was n't being fooled . " I 'm quite able to drive myself , " she said . She was a handsome woman in her defiant independence . The fresh air will revive me . " " And perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to your house this evening for a little chat . " She surveyed him steadily . " Yes , " she said . " Perhaps you might . May I go now ? " Danny stepped quickly toward her . " Mrs. Ferguson , may I drive you home ? There 's something I 'd like to explain to you . " She turned her back on him with cold deliberation and appealed to the sergeant . " Is there some way , Sergeant , you can  | prevent this young man from bothering us ? Really , he 's becoming quite unbearable . " The sergeant gave her a friendly pat on the arm . " I 'll fix that , Mrs. Ferguson . " He turned to Danny and put two hundred and ten pounds of muscle behind the words : " I 'm going to see Mrs. Ferguson to her car . You stay here till I get back . See ? " Danny stayed . He was sitting on the leather settee , his head down , one hand fingering the brown worsted over one knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of March . " Okay , Danny , " he bellowed . " Now start talking . This is n't some damned game ! This is our jobs , Charlie and me and the captain , and we 're serious as hell about it . And I 'll be everlastingly damned if I 'll let a smart kid make a monkey out of me ! " Danny took a deep breath and leaned back . The old boy was in no mood to be fooled . His . anger was as sharp as an old maid 's knee . " Okay , Sarge , I was n't trying to make a monkey out of you . I 'm the monkey for being so sure it was Sutton . Seems I was mistaken . All I can say is  --  I 'm sorry . " " Yah ! " The sergeant plopped his weight down on the corner of the desk . The room was silent as he snapped savagely at the end of a fresh cigar , lighted it , and puffed in furious reflection . " You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sticking to the gummy , grimy leather , and he had a job ahead of him . He had to see Mrs. Ferguson , talk to her fast and straight about the leprosy . She 'd heard j i the sergeant , all right . Even the corpses downstairs had no doubt edged away from cabinet 847 . The sergeant tilted his head , and the blue smoke streamed slowly out of his wide mouth and up over his face like a white blanket . " But I do n't quite get it , " he said thoughtfully . " Seems like a hell of a lot of strange dames floating around here over a guy they never seen before . "  | " You can hang that on me . " . Danny 's voice was hurrying again , like a barrel rolling down a hill . " No sense in both of us being chumps . I got them both down ; they both say it is n't Sutton ; so does Danforth . And it 's in your records . Sutton died three years ago . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yah ? but you do n't think so . Else why 're you always trying to disprove it ? Danny tried to lasso his thoughts ; they were getting away from him . " Well , I was knocking myself out over a resemblance , and the dog  --  - " He stopped himself sharply , wishing he could bite off his tongue . The sergeant 's bewilderment increased . " Yeah ? The hound seemed to know the corpse , too , did n't he ? And then the Sutton girl knew the dog  --  seems like a connection there too . " Danny could hear the wheels going around in the sergeant 's mind , slowly but thoroughly . Oh , how I 'd like to slip you a good shot of barbital , Danny thought . You 're getting to the point and I ca n't stop you . The sergeant drew out his words thoughtfully : " It 's an idea , maybe . Letting Mrs. Ferguson see the dog . " Danny interrupted : " They 've already seen him , and he is n't theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny bunch of resemblances , " the sarge grumbled . " We 'll see what the dog thinks of their looks . " " Listen , Sarge , " Danny urged . " It 's all my mistake . Do n't waste any more time on it , and , damn it , you ought n't to bother that woman again . She 's had a lot to stand because of me . " The sergeant snorted . " What the hell side are you on , kid ? You drag people down here like it was a goddamn night club , trying to make them identify Sorenson as Sutton . But the minute I try to pitch in with you , you jump me . Why should n't I run out later this P.M. and take the dog ? " " But Danforth said it was n't Sutton , and as long as he says it  | is n't , I do n't see why you should bother Sutton 's former wife again . The sergeant 's fleshy underlip jutted out thoughtfully . " Maybe you 're right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more questioning to Danforth too . " " Too ? " " Yes . Too . Also . In addition . Because maybe Mrs. Ferguson has something she wants to tell me . And far be it from me to deny a nice lady like her the opportunity to talk to a nice man like me at her earliest convenience . " Danny decided to make one last desperate effort . " But look . The whole deal ties up . We know Sutton 's been dead for three years . You 've got a guy downstairs planted with a name . " The sergeant interrupted , momentarily gloomy : " Yeah . That 's all he 's planted with too . " " What d' you mean ? " " We been trying to check on that guy Sorenson for two days now . So 's Seaver down at Federal Health . But no matter what string you try to follow , you end up the same . No dice . No dope . No nothing . " " How so ? " " Well , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than a coupla rabbits . They were pretty well off . Banked here in Chicago and in New York . " " Ca n't you trace the checks ? " " They did n't use checks . They made all their deposits in cash . Drew it out in cash too . Did n't seem to know anybody or go anywhere out of the Lake Shore apartment . " The sergeant frowned darkly . Danny tried to sound casual . " Well , I should think that with all that investigating on your hands you would n't go into this Ferguson thing any further . " The sergeant came out of his reverie and tried to simulate an impish , playful leer . " Why did you go into it any further ? "  | Danny sighed . When the sergeant made up his mind to a point where he could n't be swerved , he always exercised his heavyhanded humor like an oversized meat ax . But he had to stall the sergeant off , at least until he could get to the Fergusons ' himself . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till tomorrow ? Mrs. Ferguson is in no condition to be disturbed tonight . You saw that yourself . " " Tomorrow would be all right , Dr. Michaels ? " It would n't be all right , ' but it 'd be better . " The sergeant shrugged . " Well , " he said , " I suppose  --  " His voice was broken by the shrill ringing of the telephone out on Charlie 's desk in the lobby . In a moment Charlie appeared owlishly at the door . " Sarge ? " " Yeah ? " " It 's the chief . Wants to speak to you . " The sergeant slid his bulk off the desk top with a grunt and a groan and ambled across the room . Danny could hear his voice , sweetly respectful , and in a moment the sergeant loomed in the door . The tattered felt hat was far back on his head , and the big loose mouth was twisted into an enormous grin . Triumph gleamed in his eyes . " Well ! " he expostulated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The sergeant shook his loose-fitting coat back onto his massive shoulders with a regal shrug . " The chief just called . " " Yeah ? " " I knew they could n't trust that McWalters . " The big head wagged self-righteously . " Seems McWalters is showing signs of a very severe head cold . " " Maybe it 's that epidemic of eight-day flu , " Danny observed helpfully . The sergeant had been smiling , but now he beamed . That would carry McWalters well through the orphans ' Christmas  | party . " The chief , " said the sergeant with the simple majesty of one who , after severe hardships , has been returned to power , " has asked me to hold myself in readiness for Christmas Eve . Well ! " The puffy eyes glazed momentarily as the musty odor of the false whiskers  --  that lost illusion  --  came back to him and smelled as sweet as carnations . For an instant Danny hoped the sergeant would forget his resolve to visit the Fergusons . But such was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claus , he had regained even greater stature as a detective . " Well ! " he repeated wonderingly , with a bravely martyred tone , " I guess maybe I 'm going to have my hands pretty full for the next couple of days . Guess maybe I better take no chances . I better get out there to Evanston this P.M. after all ! " Danny slouched down on the green plush seat . He 'd moved over by the window when the occupant of that seat had gotten off at Wilson Avenue . Now he looked out at the dark kitchens and porches along Winthrop Avenue . The Shoppers ' Special was moving rapidly along here  --  but not rapidly enough . He had to get to the Fergusons ' and be gone by the time the sergeant arrived . On the other hand , it was moving much too rapidly , carrying him back into the center of a tangle he had started himself . Well , once started , he could n't avoid it now . It was a bewildering puzzle , and he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morgue . Danny knew it was Sutton ; Marian said it was Sutton , then although Mrs. Ferguson 's expression of recognition and her scream had admitted it , she had denied it was Sutton . Marian now refuted her own identification and , in the bargain , denied Hans too . But Hans would n't be denied  --  that was one of the false notes in the picture . It was like a patient with all the pneumonia symptoms but no fever . You just ca n't have one without the other . It does n't happen . The  | Fergusons were trying to do it , but it did n't fool Danny , and it was n't going to fool the sergeant very long . Maybe he 'd better start with an apology . They surely could n't get steamed up if he came to apologize . The hell with an apology , he thought . I 'll just tell them straight that the guy had leprosy . I 'll tell them that if it is Sutton , they need n't necessarily have contracted the disease , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , and do it at once . And that 's my exit from the case . Danny turned his eyes into the car and for the rest of the trip studied his fellow passengers . That boy up there could use viosterol . . . . His father 's got sinus  --  salt water and metaphedrine . Cut eggs out of his diet . And that blonde  --  that blonde ? that blonde ! The girl turned suddenly and looked straight into his eyes . She smiled very briefly , showing a beautiful row of white even teeth . Then she returned to her Harper 's Bazaar . Danny grinned . That blonde can keep right on with the treatment she 's getting . . . . SEVEN December 19 MARIAN SUTTON sat in the chintz-covered love seat by the fireplace in the spacious living room , reading . Trying to read . The words and lines flashed past , leaving nothing but thoughts of other things . The page was a white blur , and behind it the orange-red shadow of the hearth fire flickered and twisted against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded her . She closed the book slowly over her fingers and looked reflectively about the room . She remembered the day she 'd moved here with her mother ? and James Ferguson . She must have been an awful child then . She must be a child still  --  sitting here , still feeling , in memory ,  | the congeniality and contentment that had come to this house with them . She could still recall the excitement she had felt the day they 'd driven up the driveway to the large informal house behind the wide lawn , framed by towering elms . They 'd followed along behind the two moving vans , and James Ferguson had looked down at her and across to her mother and had said gently : " We 'll like it here . " They had , too . This was the sort of house she and her mother should always have had instead of the glaring chrome-and-leather modernism that had filled their transient apartments with Alfred Sutton . This was a house with dignity and natural gracefulness , a solid house to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else  --  anywhere else . Yes , they had liked it here . For almost two years . She 'd watched her mother begin to laugh again . They 'd had a normal social life , different from the fast , uncertain life they 'd had with Alfred Sutton , with all its distasteful shadows , the anonymous threatening letters , the luxuries earned through grime and corruption . With James Ferguson her mother had found the kind of life she was meant for , until .. . Until three weeks ago . Everything had changed so suddenly , so frighteningly . Suddenly the laughter had gone out of the house , as though driven by a shrill , ghostly wind . There 'd been secret phone calls , whispering between her mother and Jim , so much she could n't understand . Such formless , mysterious shadows . And then Danny had called and had taken her down into that frightful room , and she 'd looked down at the narrow , sharpfeatured face , and suddenly cold , wild horror had scalded up over her . It had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't . She 'd always been so calm and self-sufficient . But down there in that bright cold room , momentarily she 'd become hysteri-  | cal ; something had snapped . It had been a ghastly figment of imagination and worry and confusion , sinuously altering the still features of the face she was viewing , merging them into the features she remembered as her father 's . That must be it . It had to be ! And yet it still did n't explain the cruel , racking strain she still sensed in her mother and Jim Ferguson , nor her own miserable , unalterable loneliness in the suddenly quiet , sober house . Her mother had come in fifteen minutes ago . What had happened then was typical of hundreds of things that had happened during the past strange three weeks . She had been reading as the large front door opened quietly and closed . " Hello , darling ! Where 've you been ? " Her mother appeared in the hallway , and her head had turned only slightly . Marian had noticed the drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother had taken off the smart tailored hat and the Persian-lamb coat and placed them across the curved newel post . She had tried to smile and then had quickly started up the stairs . " Mother ! What 's the matter ? " " Nothing , dear . Nothing at all . I 'm just a little tired , I guess . " Marian had seen the small wrapped package , about the size of a book , clutched tightly in her mother 's hand . " Christmas shopping ? " Her mother had hesitated for a moment in her upward ascent . Then , her voice a careful monotone , she said : " Dear , I 've got a frightful headache . I thought I 'd go up and try to rest . " " Like a little massage ? " Marian rose eagerly , but her mother stopped her . " No , darling . If you do n't mind , I 'd like to be alone . . . . " And she had hurried up the stairs before the questions in Marian 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had strangled in her throat . She had sunk back into the love seat with this wretched book and , in a moment ,  | she had heard the door to the large master bedroom at the top of the stairs shut firmly . That 's what their life had become . Three people talking across distances , ignoring unspoken questions , without any of their former harmony or understanding . She looked down at the book with its garish , shining jacket in black , red , and white . Then , shoving aside an amber Chinese cigarette box , she put the book resolutely on the white leather-topped coffee table . She 'd go up now . They could n't put her off any longer . She had to find out what this was all about . Her mother would have to tell ; to untie the threads that she felt tightening about her and this house . She rose and resolutely tightened the narrow belt around the burgundy silk dressing gown . She ran her hand up the back of her head , securing a few loose strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of the rosewood break front she caught a moment 's glimpse of herself . She looked short and slight and naively unsophisticated . With her face so colorless with seriousness , the severe hair-do made her look like a little girl parading in her mother 's clothes . Well , that was an impression she 'd correct . She went to the antique mirror over the hall commode . She took out a lipstick from the drawer below the mirror and made deft , automatic touches with it . That helped a little . It would help even more if she could smile assuringly , calmly . That was more difficult , the way she felt . But she 'd do it . Her slippers padded resolutely across the soft blue-gray carpet toward the stairs . As she reached them the doorbell chimed . Instinctively thoughtful of her mother 's rest , she went to the wide door and opened one of the side windows cautiously . Then she saw Danny . He was peering intently , straight before him , at the closed front door . The nice eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off his hat , and the dim light from down the hall struck his face , exposing a self-conscious , contrite twisting of his lips .  | " Hello , Danny . " His words came hesitantly . " I 'm sorry to intrude , but I 've got to see your mother . " " No , Danny . Please . " He looked at her obliquely , appraising her blunt refusal , glanced anxiously past her at the stairs . She tried to soften it . " I 'm sorry , Danny , but Mother just came in . She is n't well and she 's upstairs resting . " " This is important , Marian . " The terse words were so urgent that , without realizing it , she found herself opening the door for him . He stepped into the large entrance hall determinedly , waited in silence while she turned to the stairs . At the fourth step she paused and asked : " That man , have they identified him ? " He blinked both eyes as he nodded . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The dark brown hat revolved nervously between his hands . " Tell your mother it 's absolutely imperative that I see her  --  at once . " ? She went up the wide stairway quickly . At her mother 's door she rapped softly , put her hand to the doorknob , and opened the door . Her mother was sitting on the edge of the chaise longue , reading . As she looked up her eyes were filled with a frightened expression that startled Marian . Seeing her daughter 's reaction , Mrs. Ferguson 's eyes dropped quickly back to the book she had been reading . " Mother , Danny Michaels is here . He says he must see you at once , that it 's very important . " The silent pause was long and uneasy ; then , as if resignedly accepting her fate , Mrs. Ferguson bowed her head submissively . " All right , dear , tell him I 'll be right down . " Her mother rose , lay the book on the chaise longue , and came down toward her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stopped , and her arms fell to her sides , her eyes averted .  | " Mother ! " Marian asked in sharp anxiety . ' When are you going to tell me what 's happened ? " Her mother looked away and said in a low , strained voice : " You 'll know . Very soon now . Go on back down , dear , and say I 'll be there in a moment , please ! " Marian felt like a child dismissed as her mother walked away into her dressing room . Marian went out and the door closed quietly behind her . As she paced across the hall to the top of the stairs she stopped a moment and tried to force back the stinging , burning pain behind her eyes and in her throat . Then she started down the stairs slowly , trying to force a composure that she did n't feel . Danny was standing in the lower hall , trying to find the maker 's name on the grandfather 's clock which stood in the half embrace of the circular stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . with a brief smile . " She 'll be down in a moment , Danny . " She noticed that he still had on his topcoat , his hat in his hand . " Let me take your things . Come into the living room . " She moved a switch on the wall , and soft-shaded lamps flowered into a mellow illumination . Then she sat in the chair before the fireplace and pulled her legs up under her and watched him enter the circle of the flickering firelight and sit on the love seat . He had a good way of moving ; it was neat , economical of motion with the lithe , youthful precision of an athlete . An adult restraint and dignity gave him a poise which belied the boyish face . He leaned forward , elbows resting easily on knees , and extended his hands toward the fire . He rubbed them together meditatively . They were good hands ; small , but strong and sure . She realized she should say something ; the pause had outlived its gracefulness . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation from me . " " Only if you want . "  | She looked down at her hands . " Honestly , Danny , I do n't know why I ran away from you the other night . I suppose that place did something to me . " " Well , of course , Marian , " he said easily . " It gets everyone . I understand that . " But she was conscious that Danny was listening and watching carefully . " When I saw that man I honestly believed it was Father . " She felt his eyes flicker up at her face and went on quickly : " Mother set me straight , of course . " The " of course " had been a little weak at the edges , but he seemed to accept it , repeating it firmly . " Of course , Marian . The police told me later that your father had been dead for some time . I wish I had known that . I never would have called you . " She was relieved at his ready acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Danny . You just did n't know . " Danny said with real sympathy : " I imagine his death must have been enough of a shock at the time without reminding you of it . " Marian spoke matter-of-factly : " Well  --  no  --  Mother and I were away at the time . They had already separated . " " Oh , I see . " " He 'd refused her a divorce . You see , Jim Ferguson was an old friend of hers . Father threatened to name Jim as corespondent , and it seemed best for Mother to get away for a time . When the accident happened we did n't return . There was nothing we could have done . Father 's partner in the law firm , Walter Danforth , attended to everything for Mother . " It did n't seem to hurt her to refer to her father 's death  --  and he certainly could n't blame her for that  --  so Danny felt he could decently ask her a few questions about it . " You mean Danforth identified your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Mr. Danforth and a Dr. Fuller ? I think he was my father 's dentist . "  | Danny 's next question was straight to the point . " Has your mother ever had any reason to doubt that identifica-tion ? " Marian started and asked sharply in return , " Why should she doubt it ? " Danny shrugged and would n't answer , so she went on defensively : " I was just startled out of my wits at the morgue by that amazing resemblance . When I came home and told Mother and Jim about it they were afraid what I said and the resemblance might be used by the newspapers to revive the story of my father 's death . " She could feel Danny 's eyes appraising her and her story . She talked on : " Father had always been in the newspapers a great deal . Mother hated that . She was afraid that the Tribune would break into another rash . " Danny nodded . " He was supposed to be fast and sharp . I remember the Johnson bribery trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet your father got an acquittal . " " Father always did . The papers called him the crooked tool of the Chicago underworld . ' And of course he was defending Tony Scotti when he died . " Danny grinned . " Yes , I 've heard of him , but I guess I was buried pretty deep in medical school about that time . Just what i was he charged with ? " " Scotti was indicted for bank robbery . Two guards were shot . The robbery got four hundred thousand dollars . It was a nice clean case for Father . " Her voice had a cut in it . They sat in uneasy silence . She could n't tell any more ; not now , not yet . Certainly the distant past was safe , but not the last three weeks . " And how about the dog , Marian ? " She shrugged helplessly . " I thought it was Hans , but I had n't seen him in three years . He disappeared right after the accident .  | We thought he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really . " She swallowed noisily , conscious of the improbabilities in her explanation . " Probably at the morgue I was so unafraid , he just naturally took to me as though he 'd known me . " Then she added : " As for my mistake , of course all police dogs look exactly the same  --  " " Yes , of course . " He did n't look as if he believed a word of it , but at least she had stopped the penetrating questions . He broke the silence first : " I suppose it 's my turn to explain why I 'm here , but I 'd rather wait until I 've talked with your mother , if you do n't mind . " " Of course . " She reached for the amber cigarette box and offered it to him . He took a cigarette and held a match for her , then for himself . " We did n't have time to say , Have n't seen you in a long time , and what are you doing ? ' last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe it 'd be a good idea if we just skipped that last time and started fresh right here . " She nodded . " It 's been almost eight years , Danny . Quite a gap to leap . " " Oh , I 'd heard good reports of you from time to time . Pete told i me all about you . He told me you were something quite fancy in a belted back . " " You know Pete ! Yes , I saw him at the Pump Room last summer . " Marian blew out a puff of smoke . " What about you , Danny ? " " Just a quack in the making . I love it , though . " " You 're through in  --  ? " " In June , and then it 's heigh-ho for trumpet and drum . Army Medical Corps . I 'm going to try to be a flight surgeon . I 'm curious about you , Marian . " " Now you 're going to laugh at me . I can see it coming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a business . A coal business . That is , I help . Bess Sampson  --  I guess you never knew Bess  --  married George Gerhardt . He got a commission in the Navy , and Bess was going to run the business . Only she found she was going to have a baby , so I took over . " There is a chuckle in you shoveling around coal . " " You should hear me cuss out the drivers . If I do n't pick up three new swearwords a week I consider myself a miserable failure . And of course with the oil shortage and everyone converting to coal , we 're just swamped . As for bookkeeping , I 'm really a marvel . At any given time we can show either an enormous loss or an enormous profit . Just juggle a few figures around here and there . " Danny made a grimace , but again , somehow , their eyes met . No , she was n't fooling him at all . This was just small talk , covering talk , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch she heard her stepfather 's car drawing up the gravel drive which passed the end of this room . " Marian , I 'm sorry to cut things short , but I 'm due back on duty in just a little while . Wo n't you see if I can speak with your mother now ? " He followed along behind her as she went to the foot of the stairs . At the top of the stairs she turned to him ; they exchanged smiles . His was a reassuring grin , and it flooded up the stairs against her like warm sunshine . She rapped gently on the door . " Mother , Danny 's waiting , dear . " She opened the door . The large room was dark and empty . Its emptiness was punctuated only by the faint ticking of the clock on the low ruffled vanity dresser . She noticed that the door to the bathroom was closed . A rim of light outlined it . For no reason that she could explain her heart was suddenly pounding in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't give . Then something , some  | faint reflection of red light , glittered like a dark pool at her feet . She looked down . All the strength drained out of her in an enormous , crippling surge , and she screamed . EIGHT December 19 DANNY watched Marian up the curving stairs to the upper landing . She walked like a show girl in the big finale . Not the hipundulating kind of show girl , either . Her back was good and straight , her head up , an even , graceful gait that had a certain fluidity and beauty . The severe hair-do piled atop her head was cute , but he liked it down around her shoulders in soft rolls of gold , the way he remembered it . This way she was like a queen . He watched her lift the hem of her dressing gown and step out of sight . The square collar and belt were piped in white . The belt covered the back . Pete would want to know that . He looked around the hall . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , spacious landing across the back . To his right was evidently the dining room , closed off by louver doors . One of them was slightly ajar , and he saw an informal table , a sideboard , and a china cabinet . Above the dado was a soft scenic wallpaper , hydrangeas mixed in with magnolias and graceful , inverted twining buds . The door farther back beyond the stairs was closed . Danny looked around again . This was a good house , rich in the comforts ample money and quiet good taste can supply . He hoped he was wrong in fearing it was a house now menaced by tragedy . He heard a door slam shut and the deep rumble of a man 's voice . Anxious to avoid Ferguson before he saw Mrs. Ferguson , Danny turned back to the stairs and then , from the big room upstairs , he heard Marian screaming !  | He was rushing up the stairs even before Marian had called his name . What had happened he did n't know , but her voice was agony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ferguson 's heavy steps running across the hallway downstairs behind him . He did n't stop to look back . Marian was supporting herself in the doorway . " In the bathroom . " Her voice was breathless , sick with fear . She indicated the door at the back of the big room . He reached it in a few steps and he felt an inert weight holding it from the other side . As he pushed against this weight his eyes dropped to the floor . The pool of red had reached a minute crack in the hardwood floor and plummeted along the indentation . In an instant he 'd pushed the door open enough to squeeze through . Mrs. Ferguson was slumped down on her face , her left arm trailing awkwardly from her body . The blue sleeve of her house coat was blotted with red . Danny turned her over gently . She was unconscious ; the front of her gown was a large blot of deep , darkening red . He hastily grabbed her wrists . Blood bubbled from each of them in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , and sure . His thumbs pressed against the inside of each arm above the wound in a temporary check for the even , spurting stream of blood . " Marian ! " Dazedly she appeared in the doorway behind him . He spoke sharply , authoritatively . " Marian ! Get two towels , cloths  --  anything handy . Pull yourself together . It 's important that you do everything I say ! " " Yes . Yes , Danny . " She hastened to the bathroom cupboard and jerked out two hand towels . Her short , rasping breathing filled the room ; deep , convulsive sobs of beginning hysteria . He hoped she 'd get control of herself because he could n't help her now . Anyway , so far , she was following his commands .  | " Open them up . Now wrap one twice around your mother 's arm , just below the shoulder . We 've got to get on a tourniquet . " She knelt beside him and followed his orders in frantic , nervous haste that made her awkward at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends . That 's right . Now get a hairbrush , anything you can twist to tighten the tourniquet . " As Marian went to the shower stall Danny looked up to see Ferguson standing above him , utter horror consuming his face . " There 's been an accident . " Danny 's voice was authoritative . " I need some scissors right away . " Ferguson looked down at Danny a moment , then disappeared into the bedroom again as Marian knelt beside him , a longhandled bath brush in her hand . " Swell . " He supervised her as she tied the towel a second time in a square knot over the handle and then twisted it slowly so that the proper pressure would be exerted . The desperate importance of each moment seemed to sustain her , now giving her a stiffly automatic competence . Now he could release the newly freed hand to direct the application of the tourniquet to the other arm . A hairbrush , tied in a looped towel , tightened the binding as it was turned gently . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , take a small kitchen pan , boil some water for ten minutes . I 'll want to wash out the wounds . " She looked at him a moment ; then she turned quickly and was gone . " Will these do ? " Ferguson appeared in the doorway with a pair of large sewing scissors in his shaking hands . " Fine . Mr. Ferguson , I 'm going to need some supplies . Number-O plain ligature , a surgical clamp , sterile gloves . I 'll need some tincture of iodine , a hypo of novocain to anesthetize these wrists . A roll of three-inch gauze and adhesive tape . ... " Danny glanced up at Ferguson and went on commandingly :  | " You 've got twenty minutes . I do n't have to loosen the tourniquets until then . She has n't lost enough blood to hurt her , but it depends on you . She 'll be all right if you 'll hurry . " Ferguson finally found words . " I 'll hurry , Doctor . " Then he spun around and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the lower sleeves of the robe . No need to risk contaminating the wound . When this was done he gently lifted his patient , and a tiny blade of blue metal dropped from the folds of her robe and tinkled to the floor . Marian reappeared in the hall doorway and hurried into the room . " Edna had some water boiling in the kitchen , Danny . I poured it into a little shallow pan and started it boiling again . What can I do now ? " " I 've got to look at these wrists , Marian ; find out just how serious things are . " He glanced up at her apprehensively . " I 'm all right now , Danny . How about Mother ? " " She 'll be all right . " As he turned back to the figure on the bed Marian moved the lamp and held it directly behind his shoulder . He grunted with relief . This first wrist was n't bad . He gently lowered the arm and crossed around and surveyed the other wrist . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendons are okay , and so 's the ulnar artery . I 'll clamp and tie the radial , then whip up the gash . There 'll be plenty of circulation to the hand without the supply from the radial . " He looked up at Marian and nodded . He felt for a pulse along Mrs. Ferguson 's neck and counted it off while he watched the minute hand of his watch . " What should we do now ? " Marian was in a fever of impatience to do something more for her mother . " Not much we can do until Ferguson gets back and the water 's boiled . "  | " Ca n't you get her out of the faint , Danny ? She looks so ? so  --  " Her voice trembled , then broke . " It keeps her relaxed . I hope she stays under until I get the stitches in . " " I knew this was coming . " Each syllable was cold self-accusation . " It 's Father . I hated him . I should have known . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked quickly up . Pretense was gone now , and she was really going to explain , but three notes on the door chimes interrupted them . She did n't seem to hear it , and Danny spoke sharply to bring her back . " The door , Marian . Get the door . And bring back that sterile water , also another larger basin . Set the pan of sterile water in ice for a while to cool it off . There 's too much to do to stand around talking right now . You can tell me later . " She left the room silently , closing the door behind her . Danny bent down over his patient . Her breathing was deep and free . He pushed back an eyelid ; the unconsciousness was lifting . Probably get at least one wrist fixed before she regained consciousness . Hell , he should have ordered a hypo of morphine . Better keep her quiet until morning . He examined the inside of the arm , pressing the soft flesh between his fingers , and then he temporarily loosened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated the procedure with the other arm . Then he stepped quickly into the bathroom . With the quick swoop of a large bath towel he got most of the blood from the tiles . He dropped the towel in the tub and rinsed it beneath the spout . Marian and Ferguson were upset as it was , without having this to do later . He went to the cabinet above the washbasin and found some Lysol , which he uncapped and stood on the rim of the bowl . Then he washed his hands rapidly , methodically . He filled the basin again , poured a little of the disinfectant into the warm water , and plunged in his arms and then shook the water from I  | them . As he stepped back into the bedroom he heard a car beside the house on the gravel driveway . It had stopped abruptly with a loud scream of brakes and slipping of rough gravel . Danny smiled soberly . Ferguson was really hurrying . Mrs. Ferguson stirred restlessly . A low moan came from her lips . Damn it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell has happened to Marian ? He waited for the bang of the front door . Impatiently he walked to the window behind the desk and tried to peer out through the slanted blinds , but it was blackly dark outside . In annoyance he turned back , and something in the chintz-covered wastebasket caught his eye . It was a dull olive-green book with gold lettering on the cover . The lettering spelled : " Landors , Diagnosis and Treatment of Rare Diseases . " Danny stopped for a long moment . Well , that was the last link in the chain . There was no doubt now . It was Sutton in the morgue . . . . Ferguson opened the door . He had a black case in his hand . " How is she , Doctor ? " " Doing fine . You were quick . " " I went to Dr. Dermody 's . He 's only two blocks away . His wife gave me his emergency bag . She said all the instruments were sterilized . . . . Dermody 's coming as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . " Danny opened the bag eagerly . A small bottle of tincture of green soap ; gauze , wrapped in folds of white unbleached linen . A glass container with sterile needles . At the bottom of the bag he found two other linen-wrapped bundles . One was doubtless the surgical instruments ; the second , surgical gloves . He was in luck . Danny nodded his approval as he carefully opened one of the white sterile packages and saw the surgical instruments which were kept inside . He spread the towel open on the bed without  | touching the instruments . He took up the hypo syringe and filled it with morphine . " This is fine , Mr. Ferguson . Everything I 'll need . " Danny walked briskly to the bedside . Mr. Ferguson spoke finally in a voice that was wooden , colorless , offhand . " A Sergeant Myers is downstairs . He insists on seeing my wife . " Danny drew in breath between his teeth . " That 's out of the question . After I give her this morphine she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed . His voice reflected the tenderness in his eyes . " You 're sure she 'll be all right ? " " Yes sir . I promise that . " He patted the arm above the tourniquet with alcohol . " Did you tell the sergeant about this ? " " No . " " That 's good . Just say she 's had a nervous collapse . After this afternoon , the sergeant will know what that means . " Ferguson was suddenly alert . " What do you mean  --  this after-noon ? " Danny pushed the needle gently into the soft white flesh . " The sergeant will understand . " " But I do n't ! " Danny turned to him . " Sorry , I 'm going to be busy here for a while . Just tell Sergeant Myers she ca n't be seen . Her doctor forbids it . That is , if I am her doctor temporarily ? " " Why , yes , of course . I 'm deeply grateful for what you 've done . " " Then please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and send Marian to me . I may need her help . " Danny felt for the pulse again as Ferguson turned to go . " Mr. Ferguson , I 'd change my coat . You 've a spot of blood on your sleeve . " Ferguson stopped only long enough to alter his direction . He  | walked rapidly into the bathroom and through its second door into a room beyond . Danny was ready now for the surgical gloves . He returned to the bathroom , gingerly dried his hands on a clean towel , and sprinkled some talcum powder over them . When he returned to the room Marian was beside the bed , gently rearranging the hair away from her mother 's quiet face . A small shallow basin of sterile water lay in the larger basin which was filled with ice . Danny took a sterile bandage , dipped an end in the smaller pan , and tested the water on his wrist . It had cooled sufficiently to go ahead . " It 's okay now . Throw out the ice , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He slipped his hands into the gloves ; the rubber snapped about his wrists . " I 'm going to need your help . Can you take it ? " " I can . " From the bathroom her voice sounded different to him . " While you 're there I 'll need several clean towels . " This was going to be ticklish work ; the arteries were small . Marian spoke in a strained voice as she returned to his side . " A policeman is downstairs , Danny . " He did n't raise his head . He was deep in an examination of the wound . " He said that Mother was at the morgue this afternoon . " Marian 's voice was an accusation now . Danny doused one of the square-folded gauze pads in the sterile water and nodded at a small bottle of green-yellow liquid he had set out beside the surgical instruments . " Pour just a drop of that tincture of green soap onto this pad . " The sweet-scented liquid trickled to the wet bandage , and he manipulated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny proceeded to bathe the lower arm soberly . " He says you asked her down . " It was an indictment . " Look here . There 's something about that man in the morgue that was important to your mother . That 's why she came . " Danny  | took a second square of gauze and rinsed the wound with clear sterile water to remove the traces of soap . Without being told Marian had slid the larger basin under the limp arm to catch the bloodstained water that dripped off the fingers . " Why have you tried so hard to involve us with that man ? " Danny took up the surgical clamp and probed carefully until he had secured the tips of the artery . Then he looped the slender number-O ligature quickly around the artery above the clamp and secured it with a knot . " Because he 's your father ! " Marian was silent as Danny rose and loosened the tourniquet . He wanted to be sure there were no other bleeders before sewing up the skin edges . He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stopped the blood flow had stopped too . " Why could n't you just let his life end ? Mother does n't deserve this ! " He patted the skin area around the wound with a new gauze pad , making sure it was dry . Then he painted around the skin edges with tincture of iodine , being careful that none of the brown liquid got into the tender tissues of the wound . " Take that glass vial , please . " Danny ignored her silent question . " Now break the seal and twist open the lid . Be careful ; do n't spill the needles . Empty them in with the surgical instruments . " She did as she was told , and he selected the smallest needle and took the black silk suture . Three stitches would hold the skin together . No , better take four . " It was all settled , Marian . " He talked slowly as he pulled the first stitch , twisted the needle , and slipped the knot close to the skin . Then after he had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then night before last we found something in the body at the morgue . I had to warn your mother . " She looked away as the needle slipped again into the soft flesh . Her voice was shrill with indignation . " I 'd said it was n't my father . "  | He did n't try to answer that . He drew the second stitch tight , then the third . He worked on quietly , competently , and finally had to speak . " I can feel your resentment , Marian . Please believe I did n't mean to involve any of you . " " You brought the policeman here ; that 's enough for me . " Marian 's anger mounted ; her voice was rough . " Your coming drove Mother to this ! " " No , it started when you came down there and said : That 's my father ! ' If you knew he was dead , why did you come ? " " I could n't help it . I was terribly upset . I did n't realize what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did I have to try to help ? " He glanced up at her ; all the resistance in her had faded . He felt terribly sorry for her . " I know how you feel , Marian . I was just trying to help too . Here  --  take a couple of those tongue blades . " Danny nodded at a small package of smooth wooden slats . " That 's it . Now hold them against the back of the wrist . " Danny placed a dressing over the wounded wrist and started unwinding a roll bandage to hold it secure . When it had progressed far enough to secure the miniature splint she had been holding she took up the adhesive and tore off a strip without being told . She 's made a good nurse , he thought . Then he reached up and loosened the tourniquet . Not off , just considerably looser , enough to let a little blood flow down gradually into the arm . Later the towel would come off . " Okay . Now move the chair around to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and reached for the other arm and started the same process of bathing , first with a small amount of the tincture of green soap , then with pure clear water . He picked up the scissors and cut the suture above the small knot ; then he turned to her and asked steadily : " Marian , when did you first realize that your father was alive ? " She answered quickly , as though she were relieved to drop lies and pretense and talk frankly to someone .  | " I did n't know . I suspected . My first suspicion was one day a letter came for Mother . I was sure it was his handwriting . That was about three weeks ago . Two days later I picked up the extension downstairs and heard Mother talking to a man . It was my father 's voice . " " And what did you do about it ? " " I did n't listen in . I wish I had ! I came up and talked to Mother afterward . She was terribly upset . She denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up half the night , talking . I could hear their voices but not what they said . " " And then what happened ? " " Mother and Jim were forever talking together , whispering , and when I came into the room they 'd stop . " She looked about the big room unhappily . " Everything changed for us , Danny . Jim spent almost all of his time down at the office , and when he was home he was restless . About a week ago he told me they 'd decided it 'd be a good idea if I went out to California to visit an aunt . They wanted to get rid of me . I told them I would n't go . And then  --  " " Yes ? " " You called that night and mentioned my father . I wondered if you 'd seen him  --  if you knew he was alive . You seemed to . I thought perhaps  --  " " You could help ? " She nodded , biting in her lower lip . " And instead I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got home , but they insisted that I convince ' myself I 'd been wrong . Jim returned Hans to you . They hoped to cover up for the break I 'd made . They were so terribly urgent and desperate that I consented without understanding why . " Danny pulled the last knot . He covered the wound with a gauze bandage , and Marian automatically took up two of the tongue blades and held them against the back of the hand until the roll bandage had secured them .  | He shook his head , musing . " I 've never known it to fail . " " What ? " " This is what always happens when you try to conceal facts from the right authorities . " " Is this your help ? Doubting them , holding suspicions against them ? " Marian 's voice was suddenly shrill . " How did that policeman know about me ? How 'd he know Mother went to the morgue this afternoon ? " Danny wrapped the bandage around the wrist and pulled it tight and fastened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because I told him . He knew about your mother because he came in while she was there . " " Yes ! I suppose you had that all planned with him in advance ! I suppose  --  " " Marian ! " His voice was sharp , but it did n't serve to check the sudden deluge of anger . " You 'd better go , Dr. Michaels ! You 'd better leave right now ! " Danny looked down at his patient and gently removed the tourniquets . Then he peeled off the rubber gloves and drew a quilted blanket up over Mrs. Ferguson 's sleeping body . He 'd done everything he could do for her now . At the door he turned . His voice was soft . " Good-by , Marian . And good luck . I 'm awfully sorry . " The sergeant 's eyes were on him like a couple of red-hot coals as he paced mechanically into the living room . Ferguson watched him in a set , wretched glare , but that was n't so important to Danny . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the memory of Marian standing so defiant and protective beside her mother 's bed .... " Well , Danny ? " The sergeant 's big voice filled the room . " I thought I told you  --  told , hell ! ? ordered you to keep the hell away from here ! " Danny turned to Ferguson . The older man 's face was taut and  | stem . " I was invited , " Danny said forcefully . " In fact , Mr. Ferguson asked me out to look at his wife , did n't you , Mr. Ferguson ? " Danny threw a miserable but threatening glance at Ferguson . " Yes . Yes , Sergeant . " Danny could n't stand looking at the utter loathing in Ferguson 's eyes . " And how is the lady ? Can I see her for a minute ? " Danny refused flatly . " It 's out of the question . She 's very upset . " " Yes , " said Ferguson . " I 'm sure you can understand , Sergeant , that after her experiences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again the fine eyes whipped against Danny with loathing . The sergeant approached Danny , twirling his hat wheedlingly in his hand . " It 'd only take a minute . " " In the first place , " said Danny , " I 've given her some stuff to make her sleep . " He forced a grin onto his stiff face . " Peeking in at a sleeping woman is n't exactly your kind of work , is it , Sergeant ? " " Not me ! No sir ! " The sergeant moved quickly to correct this erroneous impression . expression ? " even better , in a week , you could see her for a few " You mean she 's that sick , Danny ' ? " Danny took the sergeant firmly by the arm and propelled him toward the doorway . " Perhaps later , Sarge , in three or four days " ? he glanced at Ferguson , but the elderly man did not change his Danny nodded . At the door he stopped . " I 'd like to leave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a pencil and memo pad from his pocket . He scribbled on it hastily and then handed it to the older man . " You 'll see that he gets this when he comes ? " Danny picked up his overcoat . " Now , Sergeant , maybe you 'll give me a lift to town ? "  | " Oh , I could go a little farther than that , " the sergeant said viciously . Ferguson had followed behind them quietly . The porch light snapped on . " Perhaps , " ventured the sergeant , " I might run out , like the doctor says , in a few days ? " " As soon as Mrs. Ferguson 's health permits , I 'll call you . " Ferguson opened the door and rustled the doorknob impatiently . " Good night , gentlemen . " The door closed behind them solidly . They paced across the wide front porch and down the front steps , and then Myers paused . " Just a minute , " he said . " I got the wolf with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Danny followed the sergeant back on the dark driveway . Their footsteps ground down into the loose gravel in an uneven cacophony . They reached a spot where two young maple trees grew close to the driveway , espaliered flatly against the stately side of the house . Danny wondered aloud : " What 's the idea of hiding the dog ? " " Wanted to spring him as a surprise . " The sergeant sounded smugly self-satisfied , like Dan Dunn explaining his latest case . " Anyhow , he 'd had a long car ride . I figured he ought to have out for a while . " The sergeant bent down with a grunt and reached into the blackness beneath the largest tree . " Damn it , I left him right here . " His bones cracked noisily as he straightened up to take another look . " Yep . This is the place . " He groped about in the darkness intently . Then a match flared in the big hand . The winter wind licked at it eagerly . The sergeant straightened up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put something in Danny 's hand . It was the end of Hans 's leather leash , broken off a few inches from the hand loop . The dog was gone !  | NINE December 20 DANNY had just reached a pause in the next morning , a brief thank-you-ma'am in the uphill fight through the deluge of patients crowding Emergency . He was taking a history on a brokenarm case when the telephone called . A rich , smooth voice was waiting for him when he reached the telephone in the hallway . " Dr. Michaels ? This is Charles Dermody . " " Oh yes , Doctor . How 's the patient ? " " Getting along , thank you . Of course we must expect a few days . I should like , though , to commend you . A very competent piece of work . And thanks so much for your note ! " Danny murmured modestly , but the voice cut in firmly ahead of him . " I 'm at the house now . The patient awakened about an hour ago . " Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nine-twenty . Dermody went on : " She 's suffering a little pain ; we expected that . But in the main , she 's encouragingly quiet and composed . " " That 's fine , Doctor . If there 's any way I can help ? " " Well , as a matter of fact , Doctor , I feel that the best treatment at present is quiet ; no new strains , nothing upsetting or distracting . " Danny could hear a gentle throat clearing at the other end of the wire . " In other words , I think it safe to assume the entire occurrence was an accident of hysteria and panic , which will not be repeated if we make every assurance her mind is not again temporarily unsettled as it was . " " Yes , Doctor . " He did n't know exactly what he was saying yes to , but three years of pre-med had educated him in the strange science of talking with another doctor . Especially an overstuffed ,  | ultraprofessional doctor like Dermody . " Dr. Dermody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the ? the accident ? " " She has , yes . I have her complete confidence , of course . " Danny swallowed hard . And I have n't , of course , he observed . Touche , Doctor . " I intend , of course , to make a complete examination at once . Mrs. Ferguson has been under my care for some years . It 's possible she has " ? the voice stopped while the right word was chosen ? " has a condition which ordinary diagnosis would not reveal . I 've already made a perfunctory check . It will be some time before our pathological laboratory can give us anything conclusive . A day or more . " " Of course , Doctor . " " Meanwhile , I should like to request that , since I am so close to the case , you permit me to take full and complete responsibility . " " Of course , Doctor . I had no interest in the matter at any time other than to call the possibility of infection to Mrs. Ferguson 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to sound like the old goat . " And you certainly succeeded in that . " Dermody 's humor came across the wire with a stilted chuckle . " Of course , if a report is necessary to Federal Health , I shall follow the usual procedure . " Probably appealing to Dr. Dermody would be as effective as appealing to a sea snail for a pearl , but Danny 's anxiety and concern spoke for him . " Doctor , I hope you 'll assure Mrs. Ferguson that I 'm not with the police or the newspapers and that I have n't meant to involve them in any way . " " I 'll certainly do that at the earliest opportunity , Doctor . But ? meanwhile " ? Dermody was trying to blunt the edge of the ax without detracting from its efficiency ? " I think that in the best interests of all concerned  --  "  | " You think I 'd better keep away ; hands off . I have every intention of doing that in any event , Doctor . " Dermody laughed nervously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personality voice again , the my-am-I-not-professional ? voice . " Thanks so much . Really fine job you did . " The voice shut off with a faint click . Danny turned from the telephone . As he stepped briskly down the shining linoleum corridor he jammed his stethoscope deeper into the pocket of his white jacket . Well , that 's that . Authority , law , and order prevail . But not me . And that 's just what I wanted . .. . " Nuts ! " he concluded as he savagely pushed open the swinging door to the Emergency dressing room . Miss Collins , surprised at his vehemence , looked up from the man stretched out on the table . She was cutting a sleeve from a bleeding arm . " What have we here , Collins ? " " Another automobile case , Doctor . " Danny was at work before she had completed her sentence . The patient was stirring with pain . Danny gently pressed the arm . " Say , fellow , you messed up your tattooing a little . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleanup  --  get the history , Miss Collins . Better hold this in a Murray-Jones until we send him upstairs . Now , this is just a little shot to ease the pain ; the needle 's going to tickle a little , like sitting on a mosquito . . . . Sure , you do n't need it , but what the hell , it comes with the treatment , like tomato juice on the sixty-cent lunch . Just lie back now ; you have n't a thing to worry about ; you 'll be pitching for the Cubs next spring . . . . The Ferguson problems slid out of Danny 's mind . Night Emergency , in the person of Intern Maxie Strickland , came down with the flu that afternoon , and Danny was on twenty-four-hour duty . The Ferguson problems stayed slid . The next two days were a steady drone of bandage , splint ,  | suture , dressing . The only punctuation was a couple of telephone calls from Sergeant Myers , neither of which Danny could answer . And there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our tests showed negative response ; the patient is improving . " Finally Dr. Elliot 's office did a big switch . Ben Hudson ? pudgy , plodding Benny  --  transferred from Outpatient to Night Emergency . Danny had twenty-four hours off to catch up on his sleep . He slept six . When he awakened he showered and dressed quickly and hurried out  --  to the hospital . There was the little matter of back work in etiology . After all , he could n't put off his studies forever . At four in the afternoon the big building 's entrance was crowded : Christmas was only three days off now . Everyone was trying to get home . And no wonder . This was no place for Christmas , despite the sad , scraggly little tree surrounded by surgical cotton in the lobby , with two of the three strings of lights already gone out . The Christmas-dinner trays would bear discouraged sprigs of artificial holly  --  left over from last year and made in Japan . And perhaps , the budget permitting , they 'd have green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mild , haunting flavor of ether and rubber gloves . Yes , people were trying to get home all right , with the same hysteria that must have pervaded in ancient Pompeii just before Vesuvius erupted . And as soon as they got out others would take their place , and the same exodus would go on a day or two before New Year 's . Followed by the same influx . It was a vicious circle . He waved at Miss Larkin at the switchboard behind the wide oak counter and winked at the new girl running the elevator , and then when he heard his name he turned quickly . " Hi there , Dan ! " A big man in a blue uniform was walking over to him . " Hi there , Mike ! Walking a new beat ? " " Naw . I just come up to get some dope from a guy I brought  | over here yesttiday . He was shot up by a couple of young hoods trying to stick up his delicatessen . " " Hurt bad ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offhand without being calloused . Mike was a young cop , and young cops , like young doctors , feel compelled to be tough about everything . " Oh , by the way , Doc , I was supposed to give you a message . " " Okay . " " From Sergeant Myers . He 's been trying to get you this morning . First he calls you here at the hospital . They say you 're off duty . So he calls up to your room . Your roommate says you 're over here . " The policeman flexed his arms back and forth , exercising a bull chest . " So the sarge asked me to scare you up . " " What does he want , Mike ? I thought he was off of me for life . " " Yeah ? Well , it seems there 's some folks over in Evanston . " Danny nodded . " He calls ' em last night ; wants to drop by . Talked to the old man of the house , who says his wife is sick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely . So the sergeant calls this noon and gets the maid . " Instinctively Mike 's face lighted up . " She says this guy and his old lady are out . " " Out ? " Danny repeated in absolute bewilderment . " Yeah . So the sarge sort of busted his suspenders and says he wants to see you . " Mike grinned . " When he finds out I 'm coming here he pins the badge on me . I 'm supposed to run you in . I got the car outside . " Mike looked at Danny 's sober face . " What 's the matter , Dan . Caught yourself some trouble ? " Danny paused a moment . " I do n't know , Mike . But an order 's an order . " The ride was at once a tribute to Mike 's split timing and the fact that God looks over the Irish . Despite Commissioner Clarke 's automobile heaters , Danny had a chill several times en route . Six minutes and four miles later they lurched to a stop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the entrance . Danny hurried from the car to the open front door . The wooden floor was streaked with grime and dirty water . The walls were brown  --  or were they ? The sweet , acrid smell of old cigar smoke put a blue haze around the naked lights . A glazed door down the hall glowed yellowly . Danny passed through the reception office , through the swinging gate , and entered the sergeant 's office hesitantly . Over by a dust-splotched window the sergeant sat behind a dark oak desk . He was leaning forward belligerently at the telephone . The heavy little finger of his right hand was crooked as he held the receiver to his ear , intimating that this was a purely social call . He beckoned Danny , with glowering eyebrows , into a dirty barrellike oak chair against the wall . Danny sat and took in the familiar room . It was paneled in oak up to three feet and above there , painted . That is , it once had been . Now it was brown , with a greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass lighting fixture dropped from the center of the ceiling , and two molded glass shades nestled around two I oo-watt bulbs at the bottom of the fixture . The room was small : just the sergeant 's desk , a few chairs , three green steel files , and an electric fan hanging from the wall . On the wall above the sergeant 's head , and slightly at an angle , was a large calendar . The girl on it wore a skin-tight bathing suit and legs that were twice too long for her body . Her eyes , eloquent though they were , said nothing to suggest ED JARVIS , BAIL BONDS , printed beneath . On the opposite wall , the sister of the Ed Jarvis girl , wearing a Western Union uniform with the skirt cut very short , smiled wisely as she delivered " Seasons Greetings " from the United Uniform Company . Danny prepared himself for a bellow from the sergeant when the telephone connection was completed . But he was destined for a surprise . The sergeant was strangely sweet . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | frown , belying the hushed reverence in his voice . " Mrs. McWalters ? " He looked up at Danny sadly . " Sergeant Myers speaking . I have just heard of Sergeant McWalters ' unfortunate indisposition . . . . What ? . . . Oh . " There was a long pause . " Oh . . . . Oh , is that so ? . . . Well ! " The dolorous tone became ever more ponderous . " Oh , I see . . . . Well ! " The heavy lines across his forehead deepened to ravines , and the mouth drooped at the corners as he took a sharp breath . " I see . . . . Well , you tell Mac I called to pay my respects . . . . Yes indeed , ma'am ! " The sergeant put up the receiver and glared down at it pensively . Mike was still standing in the doorway beside Danny . " Jeese , Sarge . McWalters  --  he ai n't dead ! " " No , " said the sergeant heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , he 's fully recovered . " " Well , how d' you like that ! " mused Mike . " And only this noon me and some of the boys was following your suggestion , Sarge . With that two bucks you started us out with we already raised a fin for flowers . My ! " The sergeant 's watery eyes flicked up at Mike witheringly . " Some of the boys , " Mike went on conversationally , " was saying that if McWalters was n't up and around by the orphan party they was going to have you be Santa Claus . " In his enthusiasm Mike was twisting the knife in the wound and breaking it off at the handle . " Okay , " said the sergeant . " Okay . " " Now you wo n't have to do it , " said Mike . " Well ! " At last Mike evidently felt the angry white silence about him , so he looked down at Danny . " Here he is , Sarge . I found him for you . Caught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school kids . " " That 's about all he has n't done , " the sergeant growled . Danny felt smaller in the big hard chair . All the sergeant 's disillusion  | and bitterness seemed to be directed now at him . " Okay , Mike , " Myers said imperiously . Mike took the hint . The door closed gently . " All right , Danny . Start talking . " " I suppose you want to know a little more about my call to the Fergusons ' ? " " You suppose correct ! " " I went there because I was worried about Mrs. Ferguson when she left the morgue . I wanted to satisfy myself she got home safely . " " Nuts ! Nice lyrics . When 're you going to write the music ? " " It happens to be true , Sarge . " And that was no lie . The sergeant 's eyes glowered . " And just what was you doing upstairs when I arrived ? " " It was a medical problem . " " What kind of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarge . I 'm a doctor ; I 'm bound to secrecy . " The sergeant had run into medical ethics before , so he merely sighed . " And maybe you can explain how , when she 's so sick she ca n't see me last night , she can be well enough today to go out for the day ! " " I did n't know she had . " " Well , she did ! " The sergeant looked down at the scribblings on his memo pad . " Her and Ferguson . Left their house at eleventen this A.M. " Danny smiled weakly . " Anyone 'd think you had a watch on the place . " The sergeant 's eyes hit against his like coals , and the big mouth hardened . " I have . I began to feel there was something phony there . I had a couple of the boys keeping a case on the house and everything that goes on . Gelsey called to report when the Fergusons skipped in their car and to tell me O'Hara 's tailing them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . " Danny tried to make his voice coldly matter-of-fact .  | " Sarge , I truthfully do n't know what , if anything , is going on there . But look  --  the Fergusons are nice people ; they 're reliable . They 're not the kind who go haywire . " " They are n't exactly the kind who come clean , either . " " They 're just trying to mind their own business . " " Which is okay until it starts interfering with my business . Then their business is my business . " " I know , Sarge . But , y'see , until I started sticking my snoot into things they were doing all right . I feel responsible and  --  " Danny gulped . " Oh , I get it ! " The sergeant 's small eyes gleamed beneath lowered eyelids . " It 's that girl ! Listen , Danny , this is no love clinic . I got my job to do and , come hell or high water , I 'm going to do it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an envelope with a stubby pencil . " All I know is , there 's something fishy out there , and I 'm going to find out what . " " What 's fishy about it ? Sutton 's dead ; you found that out . " " Yeah . So I did , did n't I ? " Danny observed the sergeant 's quizzical glare and frowningly decided he 'd better listen and hold his tongue . " The first thing that 's fishy is about that dog . He belonged to Sorenson . Right ? Also , Miss Sutton thought she knew him . Right ? " Danny nodded meekly . " Could be Mrs. Ferguson knows him too . Right ? " Danny shrugged . " It could be . Sure . " " And we 'd have found out if you had n't been so damned fast to slip her the sleeping medicine . You knew I was going out there , so you knock her out for a few hours . " Danny gulped dryly . " That was purely coincidental . " " Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't ! That 's fishy-detail number one . Nobody 's seen hide nor hair of the dog since that night . We 've had the boys out in Evanston keeping a sharp lookout . Now if the dog was lost or strayed , would n't he show up somewhere ? "  | Danny nodded glumly . " He might . " " Okay . Miss Sutton told you she knew Sorenson 's dog . Why ? Why 'd she say that if it was n't true ? She do n't look like the kind of girl who goes around identifying strange dogs in front of the morgue for lack of something better to do . " Danny 's mind was working at top speed . There were a few things he wanted to know , but how was he going to work the sergeant around to a point where he could be asked questions and not have two riot squads heading north a moment after ? The sergeant broke the silence : " Well ? I can see you cooking up something . What is it ? " Danny smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplating the hell I raised with my boner in identifying the guy as Sutton . " " Do n't brood over it . " Danny swung his leg off the arm of the chair and walked slowly to the window . " After all , I had n't seen him for eight years . I had n't heard anything about his death . I knew him pretty well . Just what were the details , Sarge ? " The sergeant was interrupted as the outer door opened and Mike reappeared . " Sergeant ? " " ' Yah ! " " Hennessey just come in with that guy you wanted brung in . He 's waiting outside . " " Okay , " grunted the sergeant . " Be just a minute , Mike . " The sergeant wrenched open his desk drawer . " I got some business with this guy , Danny . You got to clear out . " He drew a manila folder from the drawer and thrust it at Danny menacingly . " Here 's the file on the Sutton accident right here . Read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant nodded at a glass-paneled door across the room . " Read them in Kingman 's office . He 's out for the day . Only do n't lose anything out of it .  | And for Chrisakes , do n't start prowling around in Kingman 's desk . " " Sure , Sarge . You bet . " He opened the , door the sergeant had indicated , and as he turned to close it behind him the main entrance to the sergeant 's office opened , and Walter Danforth stepped in past Mike , the patrolman . TEN December 22 DANNY snapped on the light over the wide desk and thoughtfully spread the manila folder before him . The contents consisted of police reports of the wreck , photostats of the coroner 's report on the condition of the body and his verdict of " accidental death , " photostats of affidavits of identity signed by Walter Danforth and Dr. John Fuller , D.D.S. , a carbon copy of the coroner 's reports , and some faintly yellowed newspaper clippings from local papers , all dated in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise that the voices in the adjoining room came to him almost as clearly and distinctly as though he were right in the room of their source . He looked up and around and grinned as he saw the open transom . He hoped the sarge would n't see it too . Now Danny could n't miss hearing everything even if he tried . And he was n't trying . He glanced hurriedly at the first clipping as Danforth and the sergeant exchanged affable greetings . ( Danforth was speaking winningly of his complete willingness to co-operate and assist at any time and in any way . ) Nov. 19 . Alfred Sutton , notorious criminal attorney , was killed last night when , one half mile north of the lighthouse on Sheridan Road , his heavy sedan careened into a ravine and burst into flames . When passing motorists reached the car , Sutton ,  | trapped behind the wheel , had been overcome , and rescue was impossible . Cook County Police investigating at the scene reported that Sutton must have lost control of the heavy sedan on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today . Sergeant Myers was reacting wholesomely to Danforth 's eager offer of co-operation and was telling the attorney modestly that the police make every effort to dispatch their work without interfering with the lives of the city 's splendid citizens . . . . Danny returned to the clipping . News of Sutton 's death came as a blow to Tony Scotti , facing sentence for the alleged robbery , on May 15 last , of the Mayfair State Bank . Sutton was defending Scotti , who had no statement to make when interviewed by your Tribune reporter . The article went on to say that in this case , as in so many others , " this paper has again been first with the latest , ' thereby bringing to Chicago citizens the news of tomorrow  --  today . " Danny looked up . The greetings in the adjoining room were almost over now . " We really appreciate that attitude very much , Mr. Danforth . So many people , you know . . . " That was the sergeant . Danforth 's voice came in : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentioned that there was some feature of my failure to identify the deceased as Alfred Sutton that was puzzling you . " " Not puzzling , " corrected the sergeant hurriedly . " But we 've had some sort of conflicting ideas on the matter . " " Oh ? " " There seems to have been some feeling from the very first that the body might be Mr. Sutton 's . Well , this morning , as pure routine , we called in Dr. John Fuller of Glencoe . " " Oh yes ! " The voice was heavy with interest . " I remember  | Dr. Fuller . As I recall it , he testified at the coroner 's inquest along with me . He stated that the dental plates found after the automobile fire were a set he had made for Alfred Sutton . " " That 's right . His testimony was largely responsible for the verdict of the coroner 's jury that it was Sutton in the car . There was n't much else left to identify . " Danforth treated the sergeant to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the morgue . He took one look at the corpse in the morgue and said : That is Sutton ! ' " Indulgent doubt was in Danforth 's slow words : " I see . " " But when he inspected Sorenson 's teeth he was n't so sure . Sorenson had plates , too , only Dr. Fuller says they were definitely not plates he 'd ever made for Sutton . Said there was some similarity in the dental problems involved , but that was about as far as he could go . " " Hardly legal evidence , " ventured Danforth . " Yeah . Particularly when he said he guessed he 'd been wrong ; it probably was n't Sutton at that . But after all , he had n't seen Sutton for three and a half years . " The sergeant added dryly , " And you know dentists . They would n't recognize their own brother unless he was sitting in a dentist 's chair with his yap open . Danforth laughed patronizingly ; that big boom-boom-boom laugh . " So we were right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands again . That 's why we 've asked you to come in , Mr. Danforth . " " Oh ? " Danny could picture the bushy eyebrows raising questioningly . " There are just two questions . First , we wondered if you might know if Sutton ever went to any doctor . A doctor might know of any scars or marks on Sutton . Of course if we found the same scars or marks on Sorenson it 'd tie the two together . " Danforth deliberated cautiously . " I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you a  | thing about that , Sergeant ; I knew absolutely nothing of Sutton 's ? private life . It 's certainly quite possible he was seeing a doctor ; he was always nervous , irritable , not exactly robust . " Danforth 's tone was quizzical , faintly injured . " It seems rather strange , Sergeant , that you still feel it necessary to check farther when both Dr. Fuller and I have testified that it is n't Sutton . " The sergeant scurried to correct and appease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another little item has come to our attention . " " Yes ? " " Unfortunately , I 'm unable to discuss the case fully as yet . But there are certain ramifications which have attracted the interest of the Federal Health Bureau . " " Oh ? " " Perhaps you 've already been questioned by them ? " " No , " said Danforth more easily . " Although if there 's any way I can help  --  " " Dr. Seaver , in charge of the bureau , has mentioned , let us say , an unusual fact . It is  --  possible that Mr. Sorenson had an ailment which might " ? the sergeant cleared his throat ? " might have altered his facial features . " " Altered them ? " The voice started low and ran the scale in effusive interest . " Coarsen them , you might say . Make the features heavier . " " Is that so ? " " In the light of that fact , I thought it worth while to check with you again . " Again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discounting the fact that the features might be coarsened , ' so to speak , you would be less sure of your statement that it is not Sutton . " There was a pause . Quite a deep , thoughtful pause . Then Danforth 's voice boomed out richly : " Sergeant , I truly do n't believe I can alter my original statement . No , that simply is n't Alfred Sutton . I 'm very certain of that . "  | " Oh . " The sergeant seemed glum and disappointed . The Danforth brotherly smile carried through , even in his voice . " I hope I have n't destroyed some complicated theory you 've been developing ? " Danny stopped breathing as Danforth asked the question . The sentence had carried a smile , all right , and the fine Danforth ease . But it had carried another element , too . An element that perhaps was more noticeable when you could only hear the voice but not see the strong round face with its florid , open-and-aboveboard expression . It was an element of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define the thing himself . But it was there . " No , " said the sergeant guilelessly . " Of course , Mr. Danforth , we work on any and all theories . Does n't pay to discount any possibility of error , y'know . " " Of course , " said Danforth easily . " The thorough job is the only job . " There was a pause . " Cigar ? " " Well , do n't mind if I do ! " crowed the sergeant . Danny heard a match strike against a grating . He could almost smell the smoke . Coronas , no doubt . Something that cost at least two bits a throw . " Tell me , Sergeant , " the attorney went on conversationally , you were on the Whitcomb case , were n't you ? " Danny grinned . Danforth was some politician ! He 'd dug that one up especially for the occasion . The Whitcomb case was years ago , and it had nothing to do with the business at hand . But it had been the sergeant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of it , telling of his masterful deduction , his defiance of all the other experts , and his final smashing solution . Danny could picture the sergeant glowing like neon . " Quite an interesting case , that one , " mused the sergeant . " Y'see , this guy Whitcomb . .. " Danny sighed . He 'd heard the story a million times . It was good for at least five minutes . He looked down again at the clutter  | of papers in the manila folder and came across a yellowed newspaper clipping dated November 20 . Superior Court Judge Clement L. Vandegrift yesterday refused petition of Arthur Mander , new legal counsel for Tony Scotti , for a new trial on charges against Scotti of robbing the Mayfair State Bank last May . Mander pointed out that he had been previously acting in the case only as advisory counsel and that the recent death of Alfred Sutton , prominent criminal attorney , had interfered with the fair and just defense of Scotti against the charges preferred . Judge Vandegrift , in refusing the petition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thoroughly presented and that he had no doubt Mander could sum up the evidence before the jury with all .. . Danny skimmed through the rest of the story . Evidently the trial had gone on despite the petition . He raised his head and listened to the two voices in the adjoining room . " Well , " said the sergeant skillfully , " y'see , when Whitcomb reported his wife 's death to the police , he . . . " It was still going on . Danny returned to the manila folder . There was another newspaper clipping , and he scanned through it . Nov. 21 . Chicago . The coroner 's jury today set the cause of the death of Alfred Sutton , prominent Chicago criminal attorney , as accidental . Meanwhile , the shades of Sutton 's past activities were reflected in the courtroom of Superior Court , Judge Clement L. Vandegrift , where Tony Scotti , whom Sutton was defending brilliantly at the time of his demise , anxiously watched his trial draw to a close . District Attorney Charles Waldoon demanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Boyle , South Side vice lord . Scotti has repeatedly averred that con-  | tinuance of his trial is unjust , claiming that the sudden loss of Sutton as his legal counsel has interfered greatly with his defense . ( See Section II for our gripping special feature , Beatrice LaMour 's thrillingly dramatic interview with Mrs. Tony Scotti , wife of the accused and erstwhile showgirl , titled : " My Husband Is Innocenti " ) Danny ran through the rest of the papers in the folder and then closed it thoughtfully . Sergeant Myers was just winding up his narrative . The big voice came to him clearly , overburdened with selfeffacing modesty . " So that was that . Whitcomb 'd knocked off his old lady after all , just like I said all along . " " My , " marveled Danforth . " You certainly showed great perception and foresight . " " Oh , nothing at all , " grumbled the sergeant . " Just my job , that 's all . " " What we need is more men like you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the chair creak . Danforth was evidently rising , preparing to leave . " Well , " he went on , " I imagine I 'd better be on my way . A man of your caliber must have to assume a much larger than proportionate share of the work of the department . " The sergeant grunted in pleased modesty . " It 's my job , as I always say , " he repeated . " And , " went on Danforth , " if there 's any way I can be of assistance , please let me know . " " Well , I 'll admit we are sort of messed up right at the moment , " grumbled the sergeant . " Sorenson 's a out-and-out mystery man . Ca n't trace what he done or where he 's been . He traveled fast and light . " Danforth grunted amiably . " You 'd think someone out at the Lake Shore apartment 'd have something to offer . After all , a  | man ca n't come and go without being seen or heard occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Yep . But it do n't get us anywhere . " Danny heard the doorknob turn and then the creaky squeaking of the hinges as the door swung open . The two men exchanged good-bys , and then the door closed firmly . Danny grabbed up the manila folder . He banged his knee on the edge of the desk and tipped over the wastebasket in his hurried trip to the door to Myers ' office . But at the door he stopped dead . He 'd have to handle this carefully . He 'd have to handle the sergeant carefully . Danforth had slipped just once during the conversation . He 'd let a cat  --  maybe not a very big one  --  out of the bag , but it was a cat , no matter how scrawny . Danny had caught it . Evidently the sergeant had n't . Only it had fallen in a conversation from which Danny had definitely been excluded . The sergeant looked up at him and majestically tapped the ashes off the Corona into the spittoon at his feet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manila folder . " Okay , damn it . Now I hope all your questions are answered . We men of the force " ? the sergeant paused dreamily , recalling Danforth 's generous tribute ? " we got too much work on our hands to fool around with damn-fool kids . " Danny gave the old man a capricious grin . " It answers all but a few questions , Sarge . " The sergeant sighed . " Okay . Let 's get it over with . Then look , Danny . You 'll promise to leave me alone ? " " Sure . I was sort of interested in the business about Tony Scotti , the interrupted trial . I was in medical school at the time ; had no time to read the papers . Sutton 's death was pretty tough on him . " The sergeant nodded patiently . " The case was a mess . When Sutton checked out there was a hell of a blowout . Then the  | state attorney dug up some evidence that Sutton 'd been dickering to buy out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton 's brief case in the car they came across a stack of scorched fiftydollar bills . The story went around he was on his way somewheres to buy somebody off . " " It 's a wonder Scotti got off ; he must have been pretty discredited . " " Got off ? " " Yeah . I mean here he 's accused of robbing a bank , shooting two guards , buying off the jury , and still he gets acquitted . " " The hell he did . He was convicted . Of course he only got ten years . " " Yeah ? And that was three years ago ; so what is he doing running around loose now ? " The sergeant shrugged . " He got paroled . Served only thirtyfive months . Not a bad rap for four hundred grand  --  if he got the four hundred grand . I guess maybe he knew the right people in the right places . It usually helps . " " And what 's Scotti doing now ? " The sergeant surveyed Danny wearily . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night clubs ; has an interest in them . The Blue Sky Club and the Club Casablanca . " The sergeant looked down at his desk impatiently and drummed his stubby fingers against the scarred top . " Sure , " said Danny , taking the hint . " I 've got to be going . " He turned to the door , asking casually , " By the way , did Danforth give you any help ? " The sergeant glowered . " Mind your own business . " Danny surveyed his nails , then polished them on his lapel . " Oh , I was going to mention . Sitting in the next room as I was , with the transom open , I could n't help hearing some of the things Danforth said . " Then , as the sergeant 's big face flushed with irritation : " Oh , I was n't eavesdropping . But I was just wondering  --  "  | The sergeant 's face turned from red to blue . Anger shot up through his voice like a geyser . " You keep your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm not going to tell you again ! You got this whole business so butched around I ca n't find out what end is up ! " " But , Sarge , this is important ! " The sergeant interrupted by rising wildly . His chair clattered back onto the floor . " Nov look ! So far I 've got you plenty well fixed up with the authorities at the hospital . Right ? But so help me , if you do n't lay off me and this case , I 'll blast you out of there so fast you 'll think you 're Halley 's comet ! " Danny watched the sergeant 's big fist pound out each syllable on the desk top emphatically . He forced a grin . " Okay , Sarge . Only do n't say I did n't try to tell you ! " " Do n't worry ! I wo n't ! " The sergeant righted his chair , crashed back into it , and ran confusedly through the scatter of papers on his desk . It was at this inopportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed at the receiver . " Myers ! Yah ! " The sergeant 's voice sounded as though he 'd been gargling quicklime . " What ! Where 'd you say you found him ? . . . Well , I 'll be damned ! . . . How about O'Hara ? Now look , Gelsey . You stick right there , see ? And call me when O'Hara gets back . . . . You 're damned right ! There 's some funny business out there . . . . Yah ! I 'll wait here ! " When the sergeant turned to Danny a deep frown distorted his wide red face . " So ! " he roared . " The Fergusons are nice , clean people , are they ? I told you something was phony . But , oh no ! They 're old friends of the family , and I 'm supposed to lay off ! " " What d' you mean , Sarge ? " " That dog was a pretty good piece of evidence . He could identify anybody who know Sorenson . Anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could identify Mrs. Ferguson . "  | Danny 's neck cricked as he nodded stiffly . " Well , Gelsey found the dog , all right . " " Good . " Danny 's shoulders hunched . Good , or was it ? " Good , hell ! " The sergeant seemed to explode . " The hound 's deader than a campaign promise . Gelsey found him . Buried out behind the Ferguson garage with his neck broke ! " Danny could n't find an answer to that . He could only stare at the sarge and think unhappy thoughts . The smell of the sergeant 's furiously gleaming cigar , mixed with the other heavy odors of the room , was getting him . The old boy puffed like a chimney in a factory where plenty was going on . " Okay , Danny . Now what d' you think ? " " Hard to tell . But certainly you ca n't jump to conclusions until you give the Fergusons a chance to talk . " " Yah ! If they ever come back ! Maybe they decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And maybe , " said Danny mockingly , " they had to go to the doctor 's . Maybe they decided to run down to the market . Maybe  --  - " The sergeant was so angry he threw a good nickel 's worth of cigar into the white enamel spittoon . The flame hissed and was quiet . " Certainly you ca n't think the Fergusons killed the dog ! What if the dog had acted like he knew them ? Dogs can be wrong , just like us humans . Anyhow , it 's not evidence . " The sergeant forced his fingers furiously through the thinning tangle of colorlessly brown hair over his fat round head . " We 'll know about that when O'Hara calls , and that better be soon ! " Danny rose . " Maybe I better leave . " The sergeant looked up craftily . " And maybe you better not ! If there 's any explaining to be done , I want to find out just where you come in . Damn it all , you stay ! And keep still ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the hard , stiff chairs and lighted  | a cigarette unhappily . For once in his life he did n't want to talk . This was too much of a mess ; there was no rhyme or reason to it . Hans  --  with a broken neck  --  buried out in back of the Ferguson garage . Who  --  who in hell 'd do a thing like that ? And why ? It was a little over fifteen minutes  --  long , torturously confused minutes  --  before the telephone rang . The sergeant slapped down the papers through which he 'd been sorting aimlessly and took up the receiver with a big tense fist . " Yeah ? . . . What ? . . . O'Hara ! Where in hell are you ? " O'Hara 's voiced whined and rasped over the wire . Danny strained forward , trying to hear the words , and suddenly the sergeant spewed forth a cloud of smoke which set Danny to coughing until the story was too far gone to pick up the threads . It was quite a narrative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax museum that has just been stabbed in the back . His big pale mouth was agape so that his rows of crooked teeth were showing clear back to the incisor molars . Abruptly the sergeant shouted into the phone . O'Hara , Danny observed , could hereafter be described as the policeman with one eardrum . " O'Hara , bring them in ! If the old man says the old lady ca n't stand it , damn it , bring them in anyway ! " Then he crashed the receiver down on the instrument , so hard that the bell chimed in the connection box down near the floor . He looked up at Danny with wild , puzzled glints in his eyes and shook his head savagely . " Phony is no word for it ! " " Now what ? " he asked anxiously . " O'Hara just called . He 's been trailing the Fergusons . They just got back home . " " Oh . " ( What a small , blank " oh " that was . ) " And you , perhaps , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only if you want to tell me , Sarge . " " Oh , I 'll tell you , all right , " bellowed the sergeant . " They  | went down to Crown Point . Why ? They went down there to get themselves married ! " ELEVEN December 22 FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER a fat , solid little man whose gray suit fit tightly in wrinkles across a large , round back ambled into the sergeant 's office . The skin fit so tightly over the round florid face that it shone like a blown-up balloon . When it popped into a smile the small mouth stretched away from prominent buckteeth . It was O'Hara . " Well , here we are , Sarge . We brung ' em in , like you said . " The sergeant grunted . O'Hara fished around in his vest . The vest was so snug that two of the buttons had sprung off , leaving two gaps through which a cheap white shirt struggled to escape . In fact , all of O'Hara looked as if he were fighting to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We got ' em waiting outside . Here 's our record . " He scowled as he tried to decipher his rough notes . " They left the house and got into the car at eleven-ten . Backed out the driveway and headed east . " O'Hara looked up a moment . " I told Gelsey , I says : Gelsey , I 'll tag ' em . You stay here , keep an eye on the place . ' So I followed them . They took Highway 46 down to Crown Point , arriving at " ? again the eyes narrowed and returned to the notebook ? " at two-eighteen , perceeding to Johnson 's Wedding House on Indiana Street . Marriage was duly performed in the parlor at two-thirty . At which time the Fergusons returned to Evanston . Arriving at five twenty-three . That 's when I called you , Sarge . First chance I got . " The sergeant nodded . " Okay . How about the dog ? "  | O'Hara smiled . " Oh , Gelsey ran into that purely by accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this freshturned dirt behind the garage ; sort of a drying-yard kind of place . There was an odd-job man out in the back yard cutting some branches offa trees . On a mere hunch Gelsey asks him to dig there . The old man 's sort of dumb ; just goes ahead and digs like Gelsey says . And up comes the dog . With a broken neck . " Another brief consultation in the notebook . " I got the old boy 's name and address if you want to question him . He works by the hour ; sort of stupid old goat . Did n't say much except that he did n't know how the dog got there . He was in the yard burning some rubbish three days ago ; did n't notice any signs of nothing unusual at that time . " " Okay . " The sergeant was moodily contemplative . " I 'll get Myrtle to type up the report for you , Sarg . " " Yah , O'Hara . And show the Fergusons in now . " Mrs. Ferguson came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft gray-green worsted , and her shoes and purse and hat matched a soft brown leather belt . Color in her worried face might have made the suit look smart and right , but now it looked faded . She wore loose-fitting tan gloves , almost the size of men 's driving gloves , and they came up over the end of the coat sleeves , concealing her bandaged wrists . Ferguson came next . His face was tight with repressed anger and concern . He towered above his wife with fierce protectiveness . And then came Marian . . . . She turned to Danny instinctively , and the look . she gave him before walking on with her mother would have frozen the heart of a snow man . And no wonder . Here he was , despite all his protestations of innocence , in the lap of the law , its pampered son . Ferguson helped his wife into a chair with genuine solicitude.  | Then for the first time he noticed Danny . " Good afternoon , Doctor . " His voice was bitter with incrimination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to her . " Marian  --  " Briefly and coldly she turned her narrow , straight back on him . He surveyed the tailored shoulders of the brown tweed suit tapering down to her slender waist , and his voice died out in him . She sat beside her mother and took one of her gloved hands anxiously . Ferguson was asking indignantly : " Sergeant , I should like to know why we have been brought here . " The sergeant rotated a paper clip sagaciously between his fingers . It was one of his pet tactics to let the accused do the talking . Very often a suspect , in an overzealous effort to plead innocence , will give himself away ... . " Am I to assume you are filing some sort of charges against us ? If so , I believe I should be informed of our offense . " It was a brave effort . He was standing directly before Mrs. Ferguson , shielding her . Her head was tilted to one side , and her eyelids were beginning to flutter . Danny stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup . Marian took it from him without looking at his face and held it to her mother 's pale lips . As Danny stood watching , her eyes rose to his face and met his glance searchingly , with reproachful disbelief . " Siddown , Danny ! " barked the sergeant . Danny sat down contritely . Damn it all , this was n't fair ! A stronger man than he could n't have stood the hot , angry hatred that emanated to him from the Fergusons  --  and from Marian . Lord knew what she must think of him ! That he was a spy , a stooge , a double-crosser . Working for the police and with the police , wheedling confidences under the guise of friendship , and then standing by for the kill . Danny 's strong pride was n't made to take this , the degrading onus of an informer . That was one impression he 'd correct . Right now . After all ,  | the accused has the legal right of knowing what charges are being held against him . " Sergeant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better explain what my status is in this case . " " Shuddup , Danny ! " " And you 'd better explain just what the Fergusons ' status is too . " " Danny , if you do n't shut up , I swear I 'll  --  " His forcedly glib conversational tone was bouncing hollowly against a rapidly swelling wall of anger from the sergeant . He had to talk fast . " You have no grounds for holding them , you know . Suppose they did go to Crown Point and went through a remarriage ceremony , and even if you did find the body of the dog buried behind their garage  --  they can explain it , I 'm sure . " He could feel Ferguson listening , intent . The sergeant 's gruff voice was choked off with furious rage . Danny took that chaotic moment to slip in his final message to Ferguson . " And if you 're trying to tie them up with the body in the morgue , even Walter Danforth says it is n't Sutton . So what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it . He retired to his chair weakly . He could hear Ferguson take a long , deep breath . Marian was looking at him now . Her full , soft lips were parted in amazed relief , and the resentment had dissolved , softening the blue-green in her eyes . The sergeant was in the unhappy position of finding not a word fit for mixed company . His eyes spoke a few you would n't find in a truck driver 's vocabulary " Danny , so help me  --  " Ferguson stepped to the corner of the sergeant 's desk and leaned over it . The knuckles on his hands went white as they closed nervously over the thick desk top . " Sergeant , I must appeal to you . My wife is very ill ; this drain on her strength could have extremely serious consequences . "  | " And how , " glowered the sergeant stubbornly , " about the trip to Crown Point ? Am I supposed to believe that trip was taken for her health ? " The sergeant was building up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a dog I brought out to your house ended up buried behind your garage ? " Danny saw Marian 's puzzled look . She had n't known about the dog , then . The sergeant bellowed on : " That dog belonged to Alex Sorenson . He was the only means we had of locating anybody who 'd ever known Sorenson . " " And that 's why you brought him to our house . " Ferguson 's voice was stiff . The sergeant nodded . Obviously realizing that Danny 's interference had ruled out the vindictive type of cross-examination so dear to his heart , he lowered his voice placatingly . " Now , Mr. Ferguson , there 's no sense in losing our tempers . I thought if we 'd get together we could get the answers to some questions that are very important to us right now . On the other hand , if you 're  --  well , upset by anything , we 're here to help you . " Ferguson glanced back at his wife ; she nodded him on . Danny noticed the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaningful glance . Ferguson revolved a wide gold band on his third finger thoughtfully . " And , if I , as you might say , come clean , ' may we leave at once ? " The sergeant was equally thoughtful . " Yes , if your story holds together  --  as I have no doubt it will . " The old man tacked on the last seven words discreetly Ferguson thrust his well-groomed hands into the pockets of the double-breasted coat . He started pacing back and forth nervously . His words came slowly , each one carefully considered . " I met Alfred Sutton and my wife  --  then Mrs. Sutton  --  six , almost seven , years ago . I was administrator of a trust fund . Although my wife was sole beneficiary , Sutton attempted to alter  | the terms so as to secure the money for his personal use . During our conferences I saw that the Sutton marriage was far from tranquil ; that , in fact , Sutton was negligent , overbearing , and cruel . My relationship with Sutton became extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton our friendship grew naturally to sincere affection . " The sergeant nodded knowingly , his eyes half closed . " Four years ago my wife asked Sutton for a divorce . Her life with Sutton had had severe repercussions on her physical and nervous well-being . " The deep voice blazed into the room , harsh with loathing . " Sutton refused . Although he had no capacity for caring for anyone but himself , he was intent on refusing his wife any other happiness . " " Well " ? the sergeant shrugged ? " if he was such a beast , how could he stop her ? " " He could n't stop her , but he made it as unpleasant as he could . He threatened to name me as corespondent and bring a countersuit against his wife . " " Uh-huh . " The sergeant nodded Ferguson on . " Three years ago I met Sutton by appointment at the Ellis Club . Mrs. Sutton and Marian had gone to California . I told Sutton what I thought of him ; I told him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford if he would n't contest the divorce . He would n't promise anything , and I lost my temper . I 'd have had him down if he had n't stayed behind his desk . Then I discovered he had a listening device , which had recorded everything I had said : the threats , the offer of money  --  " " Mmmm , " said the sergeant . " Evidence for his records . " " Yes , to use in his suit against us . I should have thought of it . " His voice was heavy with self-reproach . " Then Sutton said he had an important engagement and he left me there to contemplate my stupidity . " " And when , " said the sergeant , " did this meeting take place ? " " It was on November 18 . Three years ago . " The silence in  | the room was interrupted by the noisy ticking of a clock , nothing else . " Just one hour before Alfred Sutton 's car crashed into the ravine in Hubbard Woods and burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hurriedly : " I must admit that his death came as a relief . I found that I could be helpful in settling Mrs. Sutton 's affairs . As the estate was settled , we found that Sutton had carried an insurance policy , paid up , for several years , to the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars . Otherwise , the estate had been completely dissipated . " Ferguson swallowed noisily . " A year later Mrs. Sutton and I were married . " We had no desire to touch the insurance money . However , it was there . Mrs. Ferguson insisted that it be used for Marian 's education and upbringing . " " Fair enough . " The sergeant tapped a pencil against his forehead . " After all , Miss Sutton was a rightful heir , as you might say . " We felt the unhappy period of our lives had ended . Until three weeks ago . " " Yah ? " The sergeant sat forward eagerly . " Three weeks ago my wife received a mysterious phone call . The message was incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty thousand dollars . " A little whistle escaped from the sergeant 's lips . Danny noticed the tone of Ferguson 's voice was changing a little  --  more guarded and cautious . " We assumed that the call had been made by one of Sutton 's underworld friends  --  or enemies  --  who might be acquainted with our situation and had decided to capitalize on it . " Ferguson looked up at the sergeant appraisingly to see how he was accepting the story . " But forty thousand dollars ! " exclaimed the sergeant . " What if you refused ? " " Well , if I was convinced that Sutton might return from the  | dead ' unless I paid , I would have to return the twenty-five thousand dollars to the insurance company . " " It 's better than forty ! " " But the blackmailer thought we would be willing to pay to avoid the notoriety and so that our marriage would not publicly be known as illegal . " " But Sutton 'd been declared legally dead . Your marriage was perfectly up-and-up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Then he glanced at Mrs. Ferguson , who sat limply in the chair , her eyes cast down nervously at her hands . " Well , of course , " he admitted . " I can see it would n't of been good . " The sergeant resumed the pencil tapping against his forehead . " A letter arrived . " " A letter ? What 'd it say ? Do you have it now ? " " Unfortunately it has been destroyed . " The sergeant grunted . " It showed , however , that our blackmailer had made himself well acquainted with Sutton 's life . He told us of details and incidents  --  God knows where he had learned them  --  in Sutton 's life . He told us of the dog , Hans , and claimed that he had come back for Hans the night after the accident and had him still . " The sergeant grunted a second time . " Even the letter itself  --  the text was typewritten , but the signature had been studiously made to approximate Sutton 's handwriting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant sat forward suddenly . " But look ! If you knew it was n't Sutton , what ground 'd he have to stand on ? " " I asked our blackmailer that question three nights later when he telephoned to establish our meeting place . I knew enough about Sutton 's past practices to feel we could make any return from the grave , ' either threatened or real , very hot for our impostor . " " Sort of counterblackmail , " grunted the sergeant .  | Ferguson nodded . " I was eager to see him face to face and find out who it was , so a meeting place and time were determined . I was to go at midnight , December 15th , to the pro shop at the Diversey golf links . " " Yes ? " The swivel chair creaked as the sergeant leaned forward expectantly . Ferguson smiled grimly . " I went without the money that was expected . " The sergeant grunted . " If you were n't going to pay , why 'd you go at all ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackmailer was Alfred Sutton or  --  " " Then there was a question in your mind ! " The sergeant 's voice leaped across the wide desk , interrupting . Ferguson shrugged off the implied question . " If it was Sutton , then we 'd have to accept what might befall us : the repayment of the insurance , the discredit to our marital relationship , the notoriety we have attempted to avoid . " " And if it was n't Sutton ? " " If it was n't Sutton I was prepared to tell whoever it was to do his damnedest , that he could n't bluff me . " " So you went there . " In his eagerness the sergeant could n't wait for the remainder of the story . " I did . I waited until two-thirty . No one arrived . " Ferguson swallowed dryly . " I arrived back at my home at three-thirty . " " I see . " The sergeant leaned so far back in his chair that for a moment it appeared as though he 'd crash on over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by saying it was one of those grim coincidences  --  the doctor here saw your man , Sorenson , in the morgue and was astonished by the resemblance to Alfred Sutton . Marian , not fully acquainted with the situation , but in an excited and hysterical condition , said that it was her father . Later , when she became more calm , she retracted her statement . "  | The sergeant looked at Ferguson quickly . " And how can we be sure it is n't Sutton ? " " You have Danforth 's word on that , I believe ? " " Yeah . " The sergeant 's voice was weary with confusion . " But how about the dog ? According to Dan  --  the doctor  --  Miss Sutton said it was Sutton 's dog . If it was , how do you explain its being there at the morgue ? " Ferguson floundered . " I can not explain that fully . I simply ca n't understand that feature of the case myself . It resembled Sutton 's dog ; the excitement of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , on realizing her mistake , we returned the dog the next day to the doctor . " " Yes , " grumbled the sergeant . " That 's right . " Ferguson glanced at Danny briefly . " I might explain , Sergeant , that in returning the dog to the doctor I noticed the owner 's tag on the collar . It was vaguely possible that the dog was involved in some way with our blackmailer . On my way home I dropped by the apartment on Lake Shore Drive . I was considering going in when I saw the doctor coming . Not caring to become further involved , I left at once . The doctor may have told you that . " The sergeant glowered at Danny . " No , he did n't ! " " The next day the doctor called my wife . Unfortunately I was n't there . She , of course , was equally upset and concerned . When offered the opportunity of verifying  --  in her own mind ? the fact as to whether it was Sutton , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the morgue . As you know , she said at once that the doctor was mistaken . I arrived home very soon after she had returned . She had become emotionally upset to a point of  --  unbalance . Dr. Michaels had arrived . He sent me out to procure a sedative and  --  a few other items necessary for the treatment of her condition . Meanwhile , you had arrived with the dog . I did n't see him in the darkness as I pulled the car into the driveway . He leaped at the headlights . The car  | struck him , and when I got out of the car I found that he was dead . " " Yes ? " " I did n't know what impression that might make . I could n't stop to think straight . I was desperate to get back to my wife . In my confusion I thought it would be best to make it appear the dog had broken loose . I concealed him in the garage and buried him later that night . " " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ferguson took a deep breath and glanced at Danny with a subtle dart of his eyes . " I merely felt , Sergeant , that under the circumstances I should do everything possible to  --  to ease the tension in my wife 's mind . I felt that all the doubt and confusion and uncertainty into which we 'd been thrown  --  baseless though it was  --  might be partially erased by her realization that nothing in the world might ever separate us . " Hoity-toity , thought the sarge , and even Danny winced at the implausible but high-sounding explanation for the marriage . The sergeant put it into the skeptical question : " But if you were so sure it was n't Sutton in the morgue , I do n't see why you 'd go to all that trouble . " The man turned away from the sergeant with an unhappy shrug . " That 's the whole story , Sergeant . Unconvincing , perhaps , but then the truth rarely is convincing . Now I implore you to let us go . My wife must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate imperiousness . The sergeant took a rasping deep breath . If nothing else , Danny observed , Ferguson 's narrative was so involved that it would take a little time for the sergeant to digest it . Already the old man 's mind was virtually grumbling , like an overfull stomach . " Of course , " said the sergeant . " There may be further questions later . It is n't all clear to me yet , and  --  " " We 'll be at your disposal at any time , Sergeant . " The light  | was flickering back into Ferguson 's eyes as he saw the sergeant 's confusion , and a faint humor crept into his voice . " Are we now allowed to say good-by ? " The sergeant 's face wrinkled , and finally he nodded soberly . The Fergusons rose with alacrity and lost no time in leaving . The last thing in the world Danny wanted to do was talk to the sergeant right now . He escaped under the cover of the moody silence that emanated from the old man after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Fergusons passed through the swinging gate and disappeared through the doorway into the wide hall which led down to the street . Mike , having received instructions from the sergeant , scampered past him too . Danny waited a moment . When he reached the hall Mike was I conferring with the Fergusons just before the entrance door . He could vaguely hear Mike 's voice , through the confusion in his mind , offering to summon O'Hara to drive the Fergusons home again . Ferguson was accepting . He watched them quietly . No doubt the Fergusons had seen enough of him to last them for a long time . Mr. Ferguson helped his wife at the stairs , and Marian was supporting on the other side . They were three nice people , with a single unity and fierce loyalty that made them one . And they were in trouble . Their deep affection bound them close , and yet it was likely to split them apart . . . . Danny felt strangely sad . It was strange , too , that his eyes were faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt ... . He watched the great door swing outward , flashing the reflection of the naked ceiling lights against the black darkness of the street outside . He watched Marian , very straight and lithe , and for an instant he caught her profile framed against the darkness . Her face was set with concern , but the same determined set of her jaw , her straight small nose , the soft curve of her throat overcame him with desire to help , to share her concern .  | A faint grin flickered on his lips . That was a hot one ! Help ! If the sergeant only knew it he could hang the most innocent man on earth by the simple expedient of lending him Danny to " help . " Good-by , Marian , he thought . Good luck . It was almost as though she 'd heard . She hesitated a moment , then turned slowly . He felt awkward and clumsy , standing here alone at this respectful distance . She whispered something to her stepfather , and then she turned up the stairs toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even staccato on the bare wood floor . She extended a warm hand to him . " Danny , I want to thank you  --  for what you said when we first arrived . It helped Jim so much to know just where we stood . " " That 's okay , Marian . " " And I want to apologize for what I said out at the house . " She looked up at him earnestly . " I never really thought you were with the police , Danny . I was blowing off steam . " He nodded again . " I understand , Marian . " " I want to thank you , too , for not saying anything in there to make the sergeant doubt Jim 's story . " He grinned stiffly . " From now on , Marian , I 'm the most untalkative guy in the world . " He realized he was still holding her hand , so he let it go . It dropped to her side , the fingers working nervously . Her effort at levity did n't quite come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualness . " No last words of advice for me , Danny ? " Their eyes met ; hers were serious . " Just one , maybe . Your father 's story was fine , Marian . I think it stopped the sergeant for a while , anyway , but sooner or later he 's going to find out what every one of us but himself knows by now  --  that it is Alfred Sutton in the morgue and that your stepfather knew all the time that it was Sutton who was blackmailing him . "  | " But he ca n't prove it , Danny . " " No , not yet , but he 's no fool , Marian . When he thinks it through he may think farther than we want him to . He can even think that Ferguson was unable to raise that money ; that he went to the appointed meeting place with a different purpose . " " To kill Father . " Her voice was a whisper ; then she looked up at him , the deep blue in her eyes sparkling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Danny ! " " What I think does n't matter , Marian . " Danny looked away evasively . There were too many tangled threads in the weaving of the story . When you looked at Ferguson and his gracious home you could n't believe he 'd kill . And yet the motive was there ; the motive of helpless rage , of resentment , of wanting to protect the one you love . Her hand came out and clutched his arm . " Danny , what can I do ? " He looked down at her , at the terror in her face . Her eyes were glistening with tears . Ferguson 's voice echoed up the hallway to them . " Marian , the car 's here ! " Her head flipped toward the distant doorway , and she brushed her eyes with the sleeve of the tailored suit . " Danny , I 've got to go now to help with Mother . But could n't I see you again  --  tomorrow , maybe ? I 've got to talk this out with you ! He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Tomorrow , Marian ? At lunch ? I 'm on at the hospital until noon . " " At Degner 's ? " He nodded . He could still smell the sweetly faint , subtle scent of her perfume even after the door down the wide hallway had swung shut and the darkness had swallowed her up .  | TWELVE December 23 DANNY drank the last of his coffee and smashed the flaming tip of his cigarette in the red glass ash tray . Across the small round table Marian watched him questioningly as he blew the smoke thoughtfully from his nostrils . She was wearing a tan herringbone suit and a yellow Angora sweater . They made the gray , troubled look about the wide-set eyes less noticeable . So much less noticeable , in fact , that every young man under eighty who hurried past ran into the collapsible serving table which was placed in the aisle directly beyond the small booth . The snappy young men in uniform who passed were tutored in methods more direct . They just gave her a sociable smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk things out had been useless . In the first place , Degner 's , during the height of the Christmas shopping season , was a madhouse of scurrying , rushing people ; clattering trays and jingly silver ; sharp notes above the roar of conversation and laughter . All these outer signs of confusion might not have been so distracting if you had a straight , solid line of thought to follow . But Lord knew that was one thing Danny did n't have right now . If he had any line at all , it was a vicious , pretzellike maze with no exits , no start , and no end . Marian spoke first . " What are you thinking , Danny ? " He looked up at her and tried to give her a smile . " I do n't know , Marian . I 'm afraid we have n't got very far . Maybe it would have been better to admit the truth  --  that Sorenson is Sutton ; then the police would have had a starting point from which to work  --  the auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not your father ? " Danny 's head shook slowly . " I 'm afraid  | that no matter how it goes , Ferguson will have a lot of questions to answer . " " He 's told everything , Danny ; I 'm sure of that . " " So am I. Oh , of course he said it was n't Sutton to stall the sergeant , but that is n't sawdust the old man wears under his hat . He 'll catch on eventually . " Marian sighed . " What can we do , Danny ? " " I think we 'll have to start on a completely new tack . Let Ferguson 's story stand by itself . We assume that he had nothing to do with Sutton ; that Sutton did n't show up that night on the Diversey links . What stopped him ? " " Maybe nothing did except a couple of poisoned drinks at a cheap bar somewhere , or some bootleg stuff he bought to bolster his courage . " " From what I 've heard of your father , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a corner on the market . " Marian smiled faintly with her eyes . " Anyway , we 've got to assume there was more to it than that . After all , if he was as hard up as he seemed to be and expected to fall heir to forty thousand bucks , he 'd hardly spend that very important afternoon ginning himself up . He would n't do anything to risk missing the big pay-off . No , Marian , we 've got to assume more happened behind the scenes than any of us know about . Why did n't he show up ? What or who interfered with his plans , preventing him from keeping that appointment ? " " Oh , Danny . " Her slender hands resting on the checkered tablecloth nervously revolved the heavy water glass . " Where can we begin ? " " As long as we know it was n't your father in the car up in Hubbard Woods  --  who was it ? And meanwhile , what happened to your father between that time and the time he reappeared as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he last left the Lake Shore apartment and ended up on the lower level of Wacker Drive  --  a drunken bum ? "  | " It seems so mixed up . " " But it 's the only way left . We 'll have to start talking and asking questions , and keep our eyes open and keep listening . Talk to people who knew your father . " He looked up at her directly . " You knew Walter Danforth , did n't you ? " " Oh yes . He was Father 's law partner . " " What did you think of him ? " " I always thought he was pretty oily . " Marian grimaced reminiscently , her head tilted . " He was a great backslapper . Only you could never be quite sure whether you were going to get a slap or a stab . " Danny nodded his assent . " It 's just a hunch , but I think he still knows more than he 's told . Y'see , he made one slight slip in the sergeant 's office yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole manner there 's something  --  phony . I think we 'd better start out by paying him a call . " " But , Danny " ? her hand restrained him for an instant ? " how can we approach him ? Certainly we ca n't tell him we know he 's lying about his statement that it is n't Father in the morgue . If we did that  --  " " ? we 'd be placing your stepfather in a not-too-fortunate light . No , we wo n't do that , Marian . " " But  --  " He gave her a sly wink of reassurance . " Just watch me . I 'm smarter than a fox in the middle of May . " " I hope , " she said with an effort at lightness , " that it does n't matter that this is the middle of December . " At one-thirty Danny and Marian turned into the ioo North LaSalle building . They made their way to the back of the elevator as it shot heavenward . No wonder , he thought , we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These elevators would shake up the insides of the plaster woman in the anatomy class . On the thirty-fourth floor he helped Marian through the crowd  | in the car to the wide marble-floored hallway . This was a fine building , a modern temple of finance and law . Even the square , plain gold lettering on the frosted glass door at the end of the hall , DANFORTH , HOAGLAND , AND HEALY , was institutional and to the point . The reception room carried an air of dignity and simple majesty in walnut paneling , hunt prints , dark leather chairs and sofas , and thick floral carpet . Either side of the wide sunny room was interrupted by double swinging doors covered with dark leather and studded in a simple pattern with dull nailheads . As they entered , a small glass window with a decorously small hole in it opened across the room . The girl behind the glass did n't match . She looked like something out of Captain Billy 's W hizBang , but she had the studied , deep voice of the tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and the tapering red nails looked like bloody claws . The shoulderlong hair , which she flung carelessly as she spoke , was dyed so red it had begun to go purple . Danny had to grin as the girl languidly took up the telephone extension . " Mr. Danforth , " she sang in a proper English drawingroom manner , " a Miss Sutton  --  Miss Marian Sutton  --  is here to see you . Danforth 's deep voice rasped through the wire , and the girl put up the receiver gracefully . In a careless swirl of purple hair she turned to Marian disinterestedly , and a long pointed finger , slightly crooked from an upturned palm , indicated the doors in the left wall . " Wo n't you go right in ? " The double doors swung in noiselessly , exposing a long dark hallway . Two doors opened at either side  --  no doubt the clerks and junior partners . At the end of the hall was a larger , more commanding door . It opened as they approached , and Danforth appeared genially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the wide-set eyes turned to Danny and narrowed imperceptibly . Danny found himself shak-  | ing hands with Walter Danforth . He led them into the large private office and seated them on a long modern sofa . As Marian and Danforth exchanged greetings Danny surveyed the office . It was an enormous room , bright with the light that came in through the steel casement windows which ran the entire length of the wall behind Danforth 's large desk . One wall was lined with bookcases filled with red , blue , and green lawbooks , a very imposing display . The wall which Danforth faced as he sat at his desk had two small cupboard doors ; one probably to a small bathroom , the other to a bar . The fourth wall , against which the large sofa on which Danny was sitting was placed , was plain , interrupted only by a wood-panel door which apparently connected with an adjoining suite . It was quite a layout , impressive and majestic . A consultation room , Danny observed . No doubt the real legal work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuffy little cubicles along the hall which approach this throne room . Danny turned to Marian . She was peering thoughtfully over her shoulder at the closed door behind them . Danforth apparently noticed her interest . His voice was carefully modulated , forcedly conversational . " We 've done a little revising since your father 's offices were here , Marian . " Then he nodded at the door . " It 's vacant . Has been ever since your father  --  " He cleared his throat meaningfully . " We have n't needed quite so much space , you see . I 've never taken another partner . " Marian swallowed dryly . " I 'd  --  rather like to look at it , Mr. Danforth . " She started to rise , but he motioned her back with a wellmanicured hand . " It 's locked , Marian . From this side , at least . Your father had it arranged so it 'd open from his office but was locked from this side . " Danny sucked in his lower lip . Evidently in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line . There 'd been a higher , more exclusive throne room on beyond : Alfred Sutton's.  | This office , Danforth 's , had merely been a stopping-off place en route to the inner sanctum . Danny turned to the genial , smiling face of the older man . Danforth was leaning back in the wide , comfortable chair casually . Yet , damn it , there was something strained and alert about the old bird ; an awareness you could feel but not see . One wellgroomed hand rested on the desk top . Perhaps the tight movement of the fingers as they flexed at the edge of the onyx-based desk-pen set showed an inner nervousness . Or perhaps the deep , booming voice was a little too ready , too suave . Danforth turned to Danny casually . " Well , Doctor , I have n't seen you since we met at the morgue . " Danny nodded . " That 's right . " " A remarkable likeness , " Danforth said . " At first , there  --  " He shook his head ruefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . " Mr. Danforth , we 're still puzzled by the whole affair . " Danny forced a sober laugh . " I know you 're very busy , so I 'll be brief . Of course we all know it is n't Sutton in the morgue . " Danny swallowed self-consciously . " However , Marian and I are trying to straighten out a few very important questions . " " I see . . . . " Danforth 's tone showed he obviously did n't see . " The police , for some reason , are n't quite satisfied . They 've been bothering Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson , and naturally Marian is anxious to stop their questions permanently . " Danforth smiled expansively . " But why is it necessary for them to ask questions ? After all , Sutton died three years ago . Now they 've come across the body of a bum that happens to resemble Sutton . " The big shoulders shrugged . " Of course I admit there 's some mystery in the Sorenson matter ; how he fell from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of Wacker Drive in a few brief days . But what connection has that with Alfred Sutton ? " Danforth went on easily , his face almost benign with solici-  | tude : " And I know very little of Alfred 's life  --  or death . It 's true , I was one of those who identified the  --  remains , after the automobile wreck , as being Alfred Sutton . . " The eyes lowered to the onyx desk set . " I did the only thing I could ; I told the authorities that it simply was n't Alfred Sutton . You , Doctor , were there at the time . " Danny took this opportunity to work in a remark . " Mr. Ferguson had a very odd phone call  --  from a person who said he was Sutton . Now this Sorenson looked so much like Sutton that we believe he might have been the blackmailer , capitalizing on the resemblance . And from the way he talked , he must have been in a position to know Sutton well . We hoped you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Danforth shook his head ruminatively . " I 'm afraid I ca n't be of much help . Even though our partnership lasted for twelve years , I knew very little about Alfred Sutton or his friends . He was a secretive man . He minded his own business and made it plain that he expected me to mind mine . " " But  --  " Danforth went on : " He even had his own personal secretary . " He turned to Marian . " I think you remember Miss Mulberry . She was a rather grim old girl , and I doubt that even she had your father 's complete confidence . Certainly I never did . " Danny was surprised at his own sharpness . " Certainly you were close enough to Sutton to have some ideas , some opinions ! " Danforth looked up with surprise , his forehead twisted so that heavy brows shaded the steel-gray eyes . Marian chimed in : " We 're in no position to ask for facts . Opinions , theories , gossip  --  anything might help us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father 's dead . Nothing you could say could hurt him , but anything you fail to tell us may hurt Mother and Jim . " Danforth rubbed a finger behind his ear judiciously . Then one  | corner of the straight heavy mouth twisted upward . " I certainly should n't like to have you feel I had n't tried to help . " He shrugged . " You ask the questions and I 'll supply the answers . Make them as leading as you want . " Danny ran his tongue over his teeth . " First of all , what was your personal opinion of Mr. Sutton ? " Danforth rubbed a thumb across the soft palm of his hand before he answered . " Before his death I liked Alfred Sutton well enough with a sort of healthy respect . I admired him for being shrewd , clever , as sharp as a knife . I knew he found loopholes in the law that no man had ever found before and that he knew how to use them to the best advantage of his client . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Alfred was not only shrewd , but unscrupulous . Had I known at the time of some of his  --  practices , I should have dissolved our partnership at once . " Marian posed the next question . " But his personal life ? " " I knew little of your father 's personal life . I never felt I really knew ' him . He was unfathomable to me , at least . " The words came judiciously . " I always felt  --  without any real proof  --  that he was consorting with distasteful companions . But certainly it had nothing to do with our office arrangement . He took no interest in my personal affairs , and I had no reason to interfere in his . " Danny spoke eagerly . " But what special people did he seem to be close to ? " Danforth turned . " I know very little of them . I always felt , with no verification , that he and Tony Scotti were very close . I know , for instance , that at one time Scotti assigned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during some trial in which Alfred 's life had been threatened . Then again , as you know , Alfred was defending Scotti at the time of the unfortunate accident which resulted in Alfred 's death . They were together quite often . " Danforth shrugged . " It might have been a purely business relationship ; it might not . "  | " Nevertheless , it 's the sort of thing we 'd like to know . Were there any others ? " " Alfred had few office visitors . It was impossible to distinguish which might have been legitimate office calls ; which , social . " The deep voice purred over the last word meaningfully . " But if he was carrying on an active practice  --  " Danforth looked up at Danny insinuatively . " It 's true , is n't it , Doctor , that some men in your profession keep an office only as a cover for their real activities ? " Danny nodded . " Well , that might have been the case with Mr. Sutton too . " " But where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't know . He spent a great deal of time in a couple of cabarets which Scotti owned . " Danny rose and went to the window and looked out at the red tower of the Morrison and the lower squareness of the Boston Store roof . He 'd like to ask a few questions about the mysterious Mrs. Sorenson , but after all , when it was necessary to assume Sorenson and Sutton were two different people .. . He turned resolutely . " Mr. Sutton had a reputation for being quite a hand with the ladies , did n't he ? " Danforth smiled caustically . " Yes , he gave that impression . However , in Alfred 's case it would be impossible to supply any names . " The long well-groomed fingers played at a letter opener , turning it end over end on the dark green blotter . " You might say he was the restless ' type . So far as I know , he never maintained any such friendship for any length of time . " " But if we could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Danforth , obviously eager to finish what he considered a foolish conversation , smiled dryly . " I do n't see where this is leading you  --  nor , for that matter , where you 're trying to go . " " Just one more question , Mr. Danforth ? " The handsome head nodded impatiently . " Just who , of all Mr. Sutton 's acquaintances , would you think  | might know the most about him ? Know of any friends or enemies , the life he led , the people he knew ? " Danforth again thought carefully . " Tony Scotti , I guess . A rather obvious answer , in that I knew no one else with whom Alfred had any connection . . . . " Danforth looked at the neat thin wrist watch on his arm . " If you 'd like to see a small collection of newspaper clippings on Sutton 's death I believe Miss Ellis can show them to you ; they 'd be in among the files of newspaper accounts of my own cases . . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danforth forced a booming note of hope into his good-by . It reminded Danny of the speaker at his baccalaureate . ' " The world is wide ; not wide enough , perhaps . But wide . Go forth and conquer . " Go forth and conquer  --  if you can . Danny stood with Marian for a moment in the reception room . He wished that in some way he could cheer her up , but he was none too cheerful himself . If this was a sample of the findings they 'd glean from their investigation , things did n't look too good for the home team . Marian adjusted the small bunch of flowers and veiling that wished to be regarded as a hat . " Well , " she exclaimed , " any new theories ? " He shook his lowered head slowly , watching a dark brown brogue trace the flower pattern on the heavy rug . " Not yet . We 've only started . " She made an effort at a confident smile , but it did n't quite jell . Her wide-set eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , of course , " she said . Danny meditated a moment . " Why do n't you run through Mr. Danforth 's files ? I 'm going to call Sergeant Myers . And there may be another little call I 'll pay . " His hand closed about her arm softly , reassuringly . " Keep your chin up . I 'll call you here at five . Okay ? "  | " Okay . " Danny took a deep breath to pull his vital organs back into place after the elevator had stopped on the main floor . He walked rapidly across the lobby and through a door marked with a large blue neon drug sign . The cashier was very coy as she handed him a phone slug , as coy as a girl can be while at the same time carrying the full effects of the science of chemistry , the dye industry , and the cosmetic arts on every visible portion of her skin . She 's going to die like that golden Greek boy , Danny thought . Skin suffocation . He closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone booth made him think of the morgue . Some of the smells from the luncheon counter did nothing to dispel the illusion . The slug chimed in the phone 's insides ; Danny dialed and then he was connected . " Hello . I 'd like to speak to Sergeant Myers , please . " " He ai n't in . " The youthful voice had a familiar ring . " Who 's this , Mike ? " " Yah . " " Mike , this is Danny Michaels . " Mike laughed evilly . " Jeez , kid , who you think you 're calling ? " " I take it I 'm not in so good with the sarge . " " Dan , if the old man laid hands on you right now you 'd end up looking like you 'd tangled with a thrashing machine . " Danny forced a hollow laugh . Mike went on joyously : " The sergeant do n't like us boys to break up his acts . " " I sort of had to do it , Mike . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ? " " Oh , he 's been out all P.M. He 's trying to find out what doctor Sutton used to go to , if any . " " Mmmm . But he 's still not sure it 's Sutton in the morgue ? " " He is n't sure of nothing , but he 's covering all the angles . He  | still do n't think the Fergusons , or Danforth , even , are coming through with the cold turkey . " Danny grunted unhappily . This was probably going to be it . If the sergeant once located Sutton 's doctor he would certainly be able to identify the corpse as Sutton . The lid , to coin a phrase , would be off the coffin . " Nuts , Mike . I guess I 've butched up the whole works . " " That seems to be the Barge 's general impression , Dan . He just thinks you 're one hell of a big heel . " Mike laughed boisterously , a series of loud masculine hoots and shrieks across the wire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get in touch with Tony Scotti . " Mike laughed unrestrainedly . " Damn it , Mike , this is important ! I ca n't explain , but I 've got to see Scotti . " When the laughter finally stopped , Mike , still choking , said : " Yah ? What d' you want to do , commit suicide ? " " I ca n't explain , but I 'm on the square , Mike . " The seriousness of his voice finally sobered the patrolman . " I 'm awful sorry , Dan . We got so damn many regulations . We ai n't no information bureau  --  captain 's orders . I 'd really like to tell you , but you know how it is . . . . " " Sure , Mike , I understand . " Danny paused unhappily . " But I 'll say this , Dan . " Mike 's voice was lowered . " I never heard of any regulations against telling you where I 'd start looking if I was you . Purely friendly , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , for instance , I guess maybe if I was you I 'd start at one of them big hotels on Clark Street . " " Oh . Like the one that guy jumped out of last month ? " " Well , not exactly . I 'd figure a guy like Scotti might think it was haunted . I 'd probably sort of figure he 'd stay in a hotel about two blocks north of there . " " I guess you 're right , " mused Danny .  | " Then I 'd sort of figure a guy like Scotti would n't be afraid of extreme height . " " You mean you 'd start at the top floor and work down ? " " Yah . That 's it . " " And you 'd probably figure a guy with Scotti 's dough would have a suite . " " Yah , " said Mike . " Even overlooking the lake , maybe . " " I guess you 're right , Mike . Thanks a lot . It sure helps to talk these things over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pal . " " Oh , do n't mention it , Dan . And keep your nose clean . " The clerk eyed Danny suspiciously . The suit was well tailored and pressed , but after all , no baggage ! " I 'm very sorry , " he said finally in a crisp voice . " Our top-floor suite is occupied at the present time . " " But , " said Danny contritely , " if I could just see it . My aunt is so particular . " The long-haired head shook in a brisk negative . " We have strict instructions that our tenant not be disturbed . However , we have attractive suites on other floors , and  --  " Danny 's head shook equally sadly . " No , I 'm afraid they wo n't do . Let 's see , I 'll have to write her and let her know . That 's suite  --  " Danny snapped his fingers as though attempting to prompt himself . " Suite 2801 , " said the clerk . " Oh yes , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " Danny walked along the wide , quiet corridor on the twentyeighth floor . When he came to 2821 he straightened his tie and hunched his shoulders so that the brown suit would lie casually on his wide shoulders . Then he rapped professionally . The door swung in quietly , about a quarter of an arc . A wide , swarthy face with a flattened nose appeared in the opening . " Yes ? "  | " I 'm Dr. Michaels . " Danny 's voice was firm and self-assured . " I 'd like to see Mr. Scotti . " " Mr. Scotti do n't want to see anybody . " Danny had n't sold vacuum cleaners for nothing . " I think if you 'll just tell Mr. Scotti that Dr. Michaels is waiting outside he 'll decide differently . " The dark eyes narrowed suspiciously . " Yah ? Well , wait just a minute . " The door shut and Danny took a deep breath . In a moment the door opened again . " Mr. Scotti wishes to know upon which business you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only explain to Mr. Scotti . " " Yah ? Well , wait a minute . " Again the door closed . The next time it opened it swung wide . " Okay , come in . " Danny took in the big room quickly as he entered . One of the hotel 's best moderns ; its walls were deep blue , the ceiling an offwhite , and the furniture in bleached woods , upholstered with bright greens and wine reds . The carpet was heavy and cushioned under Danny 's brogues like a blue clover lawn . The feeble afternoon glow was struggling through slanted Venetian blinds . Beside one of them , seated at a large white desk , was Scotti . He turned as Danny entered and closed a desk drawer . Evidently it concealed whatever papers he 'd been working over ; two stray sheets still licked out between the drawer front and the desk top . Danny turned for a look at the corner of the room behind him . Two young thugs in shirt sleeves were sitting at a card table . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentful faces . Danny turned back to Scotti and gave him a grin . Scotti did n't respond . His face was lean and swarthy . His sharkskin blue suit fit him well , almost too well , revealing sharp ,  | angular shoulders and a sunken , powerful chest . If there was ever anything handsome about a snake , Scotti would qualify as handsome . There was something sinister and tawny about him ; even his hands , covered with coarse black hair , were as graceful as a young girl 's . The nails were rounded and well manicured . They were uninhibited , forceful hands ; you could imagine them closing around a throat , choking out a life as easily as other hands might squash the flame out of a cigarette in an ash tray . Not much of a patient , Danny mused . Unless he 's unlucky he wo n't see a doctor once in twenty years . Scotti indicated a near-by chair with an oblique glance . " Okay , Doctor ? " The voice had a harsh , rasping toughness ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every word , revealing white even teeth . Adenoids , Danny thought . Adenoids and tonsils . Danny forced a wry grin . " Mr. Scotti , I might as well come clean . I 'm not here on any business of interest to you . I 'm here because I wanted to talk with you about Alfred Sutton . " Scotti 's eyes , never steady , darted across the room at his two silent friends . Danny could feel their eyes on his back . " What about Sutton ? " The face remained placid ; it was a face that did n't know how to smile . " I understand he was a friend of yours ; that you knew him quite well . " " Yeah ? " Scotti shrugged . " Who told you that ? " " I 've been down at Sutton 's old offices , the law firm . " " Oh . Danforth . " The voice was contemptuous . This time he did n't try to disguise the glance at his two companions . The corners of his thin lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? What else did he tell you ? " Danny shrugged uneasily . " Oh , he said a couple of times when Sutton 's life was threatened you had some of your  --  employees keep a watch over him . "  | Scotti 's dark face twisted into a distorted smile . " You come right to the point , do n't you , kid ? " Danny grinned . " Why not ? I could n't fool you if I wanted to . " Scotti leaned back , his hands closing powerfully over the arms of the small frame chair . He surveyed Danny through lowered , slanting eyes . " So what ? " " Danforth suggested maybe you could tell me of any enemies Sutton might have feared . Or who his closest friends were . " " Maybe I do n't follow you , Doctor . Just what 's this got to do with the price of eggs ? " Danny made an expansive gesture with his hand that explained nothing . Scotti leaned forward again , his left arm crossed before him . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flex . " Sutton was killed three years ago . What 're you trying to prove ? " " Simply that someone has been trying to pose as Sutton returned from the dead . Some friends of mine are messed up with the thing ; I 'm trying to clear it up . " Scotti had been storing some chewing gum beneath his tongue because now he began an even methodical chewing . " And what 've I got to do with that ? " " I 'm merely trying to learn who might have known Sutton well enough to put on a pretty good act of imitating him . " The wad of gum shifted between Scotti 's front teeth ; he chewed contemplatively between tight-clenched lips . " Where 'll that get you ? " Danny made a futile gesture with his hands . " I 'm trying to get all the dope I can about his business , his friends , any  --  women who might have been around . . . . You see , Mr. Scotti , they 've dragged a couple of innocent people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're getting set to hang everything on them but the kitchen stove . " " That 's a little habit the police got , " commented Scotti . Then  | he surveyed his fingernails and snapped his pointed finger ends past the ball of his thumb . " And so the cops sent you here . " " No sir , that 's wrong . I came up here on my own . I 'm not connected with the police ; I 'm acting for myself . " Danny grinned unhappily . " In fact , if they learned I 'd come here they 'd kick the living Christmas out of me . " Scotti surveyed Danny calculatingly . Then finally the sober sincerity of the youthful voice seemed to convince him . " Well , I 'll tell you , Doc . " Scotti rubbed the sharp knuckles of his right hand into the palm of his left . " Sutton was a lawyer . If he was anything else I never knew it . As for the girls  --  " He paused . " Well  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were just girls . " But their names , maybe , or  --  " Scotti interrupted : " Look , Doc . I do n't know . " The intensity of his scowl twisted into a weak smile . " If I come to you for sleeping pills , I do n't ask you who you 're sleeping with , now do I ? " Danny grinned . " I 'm just having trouble getting started . You see , Danforth said  --  " " Danforth ! Why the hell do you listen to that old crackpot ! " " He was just a place to start . " Scotti leaned forward , licked his fingers , and took the gum from his mouth . As he dropped it into the metal wastebasket he peered up at Danny again . " A place to start . Yeah . " " He told me  --  " " He told you ! " Scotti interrupted . " Maybe there are some things he did n't tell you ! " Danny licked his lips . " I would n't be at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . I guess he would n't tell you about some of the red-hot arguments him and Sutton used to get in . Maybe he would n't tell you even if you were to ask him . " " Arguments ? "  | Scotti nodded . " About some of the cases he tried to swipe from Sutton . About some of his cases Sutton found out about . Christ ! All attorneys are crooks in one way or another , only some of them do n't make no pretenses about it . " The thin lips twisted . " I can just hear Danforth , sounding like a goddamn Sunday-school teacher talking about Sutton 's women . ' He did n't tell you about some of the quick babes he has lined up , no doubt . I can just see him raise his eyes in horror , talking about Sutton 's practice . " Scotti snorted . " Where do you think some of them diamonds Danforth 's old woman sports around come from ? And as for his thrilling stories about threats to Sutton ! Maybe he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton . " Danny leaned forward eagerly . " You mean  --  ? " " I mean you said you 'd started out with Danforth . For my money , maybe that 's where you 'll end up , too , if you keep your eyes open . All the crooks in this world do n't call themselves crooks . In fact , if I could of started out looking like Danforth , maybe I would n't of been some of the places I 've been . As long as you 're going to turn into a detective I might as well set you straight on that point right now . " Scotti looked down at the blank desk top . " And if you 're looking for someone who might have known Sutton at close quarters ; knew him well enough to imitate him after three years  --  well , who 'd be better than a partner in the firm ? He knew more about Sutton 's practice than Sutton did . So what else can I tell you ? " Danny rose and forced a grin . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to do my homework . " " And do n't forget to memorize the second verse : All is not gold that glitters ; all is n't garbage that smells . ' " Danny was just turning to go as a door at the side of the room opened , a large white door connecting with other rooms in the suite . Scotti looked up , a flash of annoyance on his face , and Danny turned to follow his gaze .  | Through the door came a girl , a dark brunette , smartly garbed in a dark red dress , with a cape and pillbox turban of silver fox . As she glanced hurriedly about the room her dark eyes stopped on Danny for an instant , widening in surprise , and the full , overpainted lips parted with a deep intake of air . " Oh ! " she said ; then : " I  --  did n't mean to break in , but I 've got to get out shopping . " The eyes left Danny 's face and past him to Scotti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she whirled around and left the room . Her silver-fox cape swirled as she went through the doorway , leaving a heavy trail of pungently sweet perfume behind her and leaving Danny to stare after her in suppressed excitement . Scotti frowned disapprovingly at Danny 's interest . " Well , Doc , you 'll certainly know my wife again when you see her , wo n't you ? " Danny came to with a start and a sheepish grin . Yes , he 'd know her again  --  and he knew her from last time he 'd seen her too . Just one week before he 'd seen her , while he was prowling over the Sorenson apartment . This was the girl who 'd come in and had said : " Ooops ! So sorry ! Wrong floor ! " THIRTEEN December 23 DANNY pressed through the crowded hotel lobby toward the street . His hands were buried deep in his pockets as though he 'd find some ideas jingling there among the small change . The early-afternoon winter was folding like a damp , dark blanket into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing against tomorrow night 's dead line : Christmas Eve . Everywhere you went Christmas carols blasted at you : from store windows and little music shops . Harried mothers herded coveys of  | small excited kids into busses and taxis . People jostled by with deadly intent , carrying their own packages . Store windows were crammed with Christmas displays . Soldiers stood on street corners ; they were the only sane people in the lot , sane because they would n't have much Christmas , so why worry ? Danny shook his head . All the confusion and bluster only accentuated the pandemonium in his mind . That was the girl who 'd entered the Sorenson Lake Shore apartment . Mrs. Scotti ! She 'd recognized him too . He 'd tried to follow her , but in order to allay Scotti 's suspicions his good-by had taken too long . She had merged into the crowds that filled the lobby and the streets outside . What had Mrs. Scotti been doing at Sorenson 's apartment that day ? Scotti must have sent her . But why ? Scotti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead since the accident in Hubbard Woods ; that for him there had never been any Alex Sorenson . No runs , no hits , plenty of errors . As he swung through the wide lobby doors onto the street a grimy-faced little kid stuck a tattered magazine into his face and mumbled something unintelligible . " Not today , kid . " Danny , absorbed , walked on , swinging east toward LaSalle . He heard footsteps patter doggedly behind him and a rough little voice : " Hey , mister . Magazine ? " The signal stopped him at Dearborn . The string of cabs and dark sedans filed past like a funeral procession . Some had on their headlights already to battle the misty fog . They were pale yellow dots in the wintry gloom . A little old lady with a shopping basket got caught in midstream . A cop on the adjacent corner blew a whistle at her , motioned her back , and then proceeded to stop traffic from all directions as he went after her . He must think he 's Moses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea . He felt a persistent tugging at his sleeve .  | Again he looked down at the grimy , freckle-spattered little mug that was staring up at him . The magazine was thrust up at him by a stubby , dirty hand . Danny grinned and dug down into his pocket for some change . The kid glanced over his shoulder delightedly . Then he snuffled noisily . " You 're Dr. Michaels . " It was almost a question , not quite . " Yeah , but  --  " " Lookit the first page , " the kid hissed dramatically . Then he inserted the magazine into the loop Danny 's arm made as he searched for a coin . As the signal changed he darted off . " Hey ! Your money ! " The kid had disappeared into the crowd which was milling on the opposite curb . Danny looked down at the magazine . It was a cheap picture weekly . The cover revealed a bathing girl , a sailor cap perched jauntily over one eye . She was leaning back against a lifeboat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meaningly unstrapped the brassiere of the already scanty bathing suit . The title beneath proclaimed : " This is worth fighting for . " Danny turned back the cover . On the first page three loosely clad girls were pictured revealingly , practicing jujitsu . The title read : " Girls Learn Commando Tactics for National Defense . " Danny shrugged . Judas , he thought , I must look like one hell of a wolf boy . Even little kids pick me out of the mob . Then in the lower corner of the page , cutting across a wellturned thigh , he saw the writing . The hurriedly penciled lines strung unevenly beneath one another in an adolescent scrawl . He crossed the street slowly , studying it . The writing was hard to make out . Hurrying people jostled by him . Finally he had it : " Must speak to you . Be careful you are n't followed . Take first 51 bus that crosses Washington going north after three o'clock . "  | Danny gulped down his excitement , rolled the magazine , and thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it for Pete . Even if uninterested in the cryptic , puzzling message , the girls , giving their all for national defense , would get him . Pete was patriotic that way . He was being followed , all right . He knew it now . He 'd made the test during the last ten minutes of casual rat-mazing through the frantic throngs of Christmas shoppers at Field 's . He 'd doubled up and back the wide holly-garlanded aisles with the tall , sputtering candles winking at each other over the human chaos that chattered hysterically below . He 'd retraced himself , gone up and down the crowded escalators in quick succession . The results , medically speaking , were plus positive . That big , darkly handsome guy in the light gray suit with the bright green covert-cloth topcoat and brown felt hat set at a rakish angle  --  keeping at a discreet distance  --  followed along after him like a bad reputation . So now what ? He looked at the big lighted clock over the State Street entrance garlanded in holly and pine branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to shake Butch and get out on State Street for the 51 bus and Scene Two of " Mata Hari and the Waltzing Rats . " Danny sauntered past the men 's toiletry section , turned left , and entered the scented realm of the ladies ' toiletries . Through the scampering , harried shoppers he glanced at the mirrored wall of a large display and saw Butch turn the same corner idly . As Danny paused to look at some gift compacts on the counter Butch paused and surveyed a man 's hairbrush . Danny turned suddenly and made straight for Butch . As he approached , the big man moved away casually and rounded the aisle to the right .  | That put him right in the middle of the ladies ' girdles . Danny grinned . In the first place , mentally , Butch was n't too light on his feet . In the second place , Butch still thought he was undetected , still in a position to play innocent . That should make things easier . So now . . . Nine minutes , Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those fine ideas , but quick . As he walked along the wide aisle before the elevators his eyes fell on a neatly lettered sign topped by a large Red Cross : LESSON THREE FIRST AID TODAY-3 P.M. SHARP AUDITORIUM-7TH FLOOR He got his idea then . So far he 'd been intent on shaking Butch . Now , for the first time , he wanted more than anything else to keep Butch on the string . He felt strangely paternal as , with deliberate casualness , he stalled the elevator operator with a brief discussion of the men 's haberdashery section . Until Butch had politely pressed his way into the elevator . " Seven , please , " he said very distinctly . The operator bobbed her head sharply . Danny surveyed the back of her blonde frizzy head as the cab bounced softly to a stop at the first floor and the operator called out her memorized list of departments . Danny cleared his throat as the doors slid shut . " Seven , please . " This time the girl turned and looked at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We stop at all floors . " Danny nodded and gave her a little wink . A large expanse of bare cork-tiled floor had been cleared , and folding wooden chairs were set up in even rows . Already a good many were filled with chattering , excited shoppers who were  | thumbing through their first-aid textbooks and rustling with packages . Danny felt Butch turn and veer to the right as he left the elevator . Danny walked solidly down the center aisle and hopped up onto the low speaker 's platform . He raised his hand in a silencing gesture . " Good afternoon , ladies ! " The hum of conversation wilted and died . " I 've been asked to put on a special brief exhibition of essential bandages , " he went on airily . " Your regular instructor will be here shortly . " He gave them his best smile ; it seemed to placate them . Danny turned . There was an odd assortment of splints at the back of the stage , also a small pile of folded triangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar at the back of the clearing , picking at his teeth with his thumbnail . " As we all know , we learn the basics more readily if we have a real patient on which to illustrate . " He wagged a finger authoritatively . " I wonder if there is a gentleman in the audience who 'll be so kind as to step up onto the stage . " Heads turned and wagged back and forth ; there was a loud rustling of paper bags and creaking of wooden chairs . " You ! Back there ! " Danny indicated Butch . " You look like a good red-blooded American . " Butch started . His wide , heavy face flushed . The thick lips formed the word " Me ? " Danny nodded . " It 's all in a good cause , " he said sharply . Brother , you do n't know how good a cause . " Surely you 'll step up and help us ? We 'll just take a moment of your time . " Danny flashed a winning smile . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back row there had better urge him . " There was a general round of laughter . Then applause . Over it Danny heard a small woman turn to her friend and say : " Such a charming man . So much more interesting than Miss Tillamoody . " Butch peered about furtively , like a trapped animal . Two  | elderly ladies in the back row approached him playfully . He extended his hands , fending them off . His face was the color of red plush , and the white gleamed around the pupils of his eyes . Finally , reluctant , he was led to the stage . There was another enthusiastic round of applause and laughter . " Thank you very much , sir . " Danny again raised his hand for silence and forcefully helped Butch out of the green topcoat . " Now , " he said , " I should like to imagine that our patient has three injuries : a broken collarbone , a broken wrist , and a broken pelvis . I should like to have six women volunteers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , so that we may see how quickly and efficiently we can work to relieve our patient 's pain and suffering . Volunteers ? " Twelve hands rose in eager unison , and Danny chose the six closest . Danny turned to Butch . " Now , sir , so that all the ladies may see us at work , will you kindly assume a prone position on this table ? " Danny indicated a wide long table in the middle of the stage . Butch peered down at the sea of intent faces and gulped noisily . With a firm grip on a massive arm Danny led Butch to the table . Unwillingly Butch allowed himself to be laid out . Danny divided the six ladies into three teams of two each and indicated which injury each team would treat . " All right , " he said gaily . " Go ! " The ladies sprang into action . While two expertly padded and secured a splint which extended from Butch 's elbow to the tip of his fingers with triangular bandages , Butch 's right arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left shoulder , making a V across his chest . Then two carefully applied and knotted triangular bandages strapped the arm closely to his body . Meanwhile a third team , holding a long splint against Butch 's side , like a crutch , had tucked seven bandages under the heavy body and legs , and agile hands tied the bandages across and over .  | Butch 's face shone up at Danny helplessly as the women worked over him . Finally all six ladies were finished and stood back proud and breathless from their work . " Excellent , " exclaimed Danny . " Four minutes ! " He waited for the audience 's applause to diminish before going on . " Now . You see our patient can not rise , bend at the hips , or walk . He is entirely immobile until our doctor arrives . " He looked at Butch and patted him on the forehead . " Only I 'm not the right doctor . " He turned to his audience . " Thank you very much . " Then , authoritatively , he stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Butch let out a bellow . At that point Danny broke into a run , plunging through the questioning , rustling audience . Fortunately an elevator was waiting . The door slid shut behind him before anyone could lay a hand on him . His last glance showed a highly agitated Butch with a small cluster of ladies fretting over the knotted bandages . " So , " said Danny . " That 'll take Butch a good ten minutes . " He looked at the operator . It was the same friz-topped girl . She turned around and gave him a smile . " Find what you wanted , sir ? " Danny nodded , grinning . " You 've no idea ! " The hands of the clock over the Washington Street entrance jolted forward . Three o'clock . Danny shoved his way through the slow-moving crowd out into the dark , windy sidewalk . It was only a matter of seconds after he reached the bus loading zone that the big clattering monster ground to a stop . He checked the numbers on the framed revolving sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 51 , all right . A quick , hard pulse was throbbing in his throat as , his dime rang the chime in the fare box . He took a quick look along the crowded rows of seats downstairs , looking for the small silver-fox hat . No sign of Mrs. Scotti  | down here . He braced himself against disappointment , and as the bus jerked away from the curb with a lazy roar and clashing of gears he made his way up the narrow curving stairs to the upper level . The gray , angry glare of the sky seemed to point in at her . She was sitting stiffly toward the front of the bus . At least they 'd be almost alone . Two kids dressed in bright red brother-and-sister outfits were standing up to the windshield , their noses pressed against the cold , misty glass . A few other seats were taken : a couple of soldiers and a girl , who looked as though she 'd keep them interested . A couple of girls in heavy tweed overcoats with dark hats pulled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all else . About the men in their life . And that 'd keep them interested . The damply warm stuffiness of the tightly sealed bus smelled faintly of perfume and burning oil and exhaust smoke , of all the people who had ever ridden here . In contrast to it , Danny 's excitement was exhilarating , piercing the thin suit coat and laying icy fingers on his skin . Mrs. Scotti neither turned nor indicated recognition as he sat down beside her . He ran his fingers through his close-cropped hair , straightened his blue plaid tie , and waited , looking out at the panorama of the city as it jerked by . As they turned onto Michigan Avenue and passed the Wrigley Building , Danny had an opportunity to survey the girl at close quarters . She was n't as young as he 'd thought . Her sensuous face was faintly lined beneath the make-up ; her shoulders were taut and stiff ; the pink wrinkles that showed beneath the powder at the side of her jaws and in her throat showed that her neck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the large deep red suede purse in her lap . As they passed the Tribune Tower she glanced around apprehensively . At last their eyes met and she recognized him with an impulsive jerk of her head .  | ' Well ! " said Danny . " Fancy meeting you here . " Her full lips clenched shut . Otherwise she allowed his witticism to die on the vine . " You were right about being followed , " Danny went on . Again she glanced behind her apprehensively . " Do n't worry . I shook him like a four-bit thermometer . " The lips formed into a sullen smile . Then her hand fell on his arm and her fingers tightened persuasively . Danny found himself thinking of Marian . Strange . Marian could never get such an intimate , sensuous quality into such a small gesture . She spoke finally . " Why did you come to Tony 's apartment ? Did you tell him about having seen me before ? " " At Sorenson 's . " He said it brashly . If this was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her head dipped sharply . " No , I did n't . I was there to get information , not to give it . " " Did you learn everything you wanted ? " She injected a note of carelessness into her words , but even so they were as shining and artificial as a wax apple . " No . I 've just begun . " He turned to her , but she shrugged austerely . " You talk so nicely ; go ahead and talk . " " Okay . What do you know about Mrs. Sorenson ? " She lifted her arm and adjusted the tilt of the small hat . " Mrs. ? who ? " " Mrs. Sorenson . She 's the lady whose apartment you walked into last Saturday . Remember ? " " I got off at the wrong floor . I explained that . " " You had a key . " Her voice was rigidly controlled ; a vocal tightrope walker brandishing two umbrellas and not doing very well . " The door was unlocked . I had instinctively got out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't work I tried the doorknob and the door opened . "  | Danny tested that against his memory . He 'd thought at the time he had heard the key turning the bolt . But he could n't be sure . Her voice went on evenly : " When I discovered my mistake I naturally went downstairs and called on my friend there . " Mrs. Scotti looked out of the window as though the interview were over . " Well , " mused Danny , " why all the concern whether I 'd told Mr. Scotti , then ? That seems a simple enough explanation . He 's no doubt got off elevators at the wrong floor himself . You can explain it to him just as you 've explained it to me . " She shrugged nervously this time . " And if he asks why you went to such elaborate pains to get me up here on the bus for this little fish fry , you can tell him we just wanted to be alone . " Danny gave her hand , closed on his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose carelessly . " Well , I 'll probably be visiting Mr. Scotti one of these days . And by the way , tell Butch ? the guy who followed me  --  I 'm sorry to have inconvenienced him . I 'll be seeing you . . . . " She looked up at him a moment , then reached out and took his hand . " No . Do n't go . Please . " As she drew him down into the seat beside her Danny hunched his shoulders . " I should imagine Mr. Scotti 's a pretty jealous type . He probably would n't like the idea of another man  --  that 's me ? in your life . And he impresses me as the kind of character I 'd rather not tangle with . " Her words lashed out at him : " You 're pretty funny , are n't you ? " He turned on her directly . " Not funny , Mrs. Scotti . Only you might as well know , I want the truth or nothing at all . I 'm not messing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to their ears in trouble , mostly because of me . I 'm going to get them out of it if I can . " She peered down at the back of the seat before  | her . " We might as well reach a perfect understanding now . It seems I 've got something on you . If I told Scotti about your visit to that apartment it could lead to some questions you 'd like to avoid . " " Go on . " " That 's all there is . Now it 's your turn to talk . " " And just what do you want to know ? " " First , I want to know just what your connection with Alfred Sutton was . Call him Sorenson if you want to . " " Alfred Sutton was my husband 's attorney . " Her voice was so deep he could scarcely hear it over the loud rumbling of the bus . " I know that . " " When he was working on my husband 's case I saw him a couple of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep swallow . " He was n't getting on with his wife . I guess he liked feminine companionship . I used to arrange dates for him ; some of my girl friends . " Danny nodded . The large lower lip quivered against even , set teeth . " As my husband 's attorney , of course , I became reasonably well acquainted with him myself . " Danny nodded . " Well , during the trial Sutton was in that accident . At least everyone thought so . People identified the body , what was left of it . " She stared down at her hands carefully . " Well , I happened to believe it was phony , the story of his death . " " Did you tell Mr. Scotti ? " She shook her head sharply . " What made you think something was haywire ? " She turned back to her hands . " Because one of the girls I knew was  --  seeing quite a little of Alfred at the time . He was in hot water over some deals . " The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he seemed to be making preparations to  | check out . In addition , there was the matter of some money of Scotti 's that Sutton was keeping . " " Oh yes , " said Danny . " That 's the money they said was burned in the car with Sutton . " She nodded . " There was n't enough money in that car to  --  " Her voice broke off abruptly . " ? make up four hundred thousand dollars ? " She turned on him . " I did n't say that ! " " No . Go on . " " Anyway , it was n't Sutton 's money . It was Tony 's , and there was never any sign of it from then on . " " Scotti never located it ? " " I do n't know whether he did or not . " " And so  --  ? " " And so one day  --  it was a week ago  --  a friend called me . She said maybe I 'd think she was crazy , but she knew Alfred Sutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her apartment . Of course I was surprised , but she swore it was Alfred Sutton . " Rosalie looked over at him carefully . " She 'd seen Scotti and me with him plenty of times , so she had a right to know Sutton if she saw him , even after three years . " " I see . " Danny nodded . He was listening carefully . There was a thin color of nervousness beneath the heavy varnish of her voice . " Anyway , she called . She said I ought to come over and see for myself . She said she was sure she was making no mistake . " Danny nodded . " Did you tell Mr. Scotti ? " " No . No , I did n't . " " I should think it would have involved him and his interests very deeply . " Her voice was colorless . " He 'd had enough trouble with the cops ; I did n't know what rash things he might do if Viv was right and it was Sutton . Scotti was on probation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than have him get sent back to the pen for good . " " I see . So you went to see your friend and talk it over . " She swallowed dryly and nodded . " And I got off on the wrong floor . Maybe my mind was so upset ; I 'd been thinking of the apartment over Viv 's all day long . " " I should think that 'd have made you more anxious than ever not to get off on the wrong floor . " " Well , it did n't . Right after I ran into you there I went on downstairs . My friend told me Sutton seemed to have moved out ; she had n't seen him lately . I sort of figured maybe she 'd had a brain storm and got her wires crossed . " " So you still did n't tell Mr. Scotti ? " " No . I saw no reason getting him upset over something he could n't verify . Then , having not told him , I was naturally anxious for him not to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said Scotti looks like a jealous type . Well , he is . And if he once gets into his head anyone 's pulled a fast one  --  " Danny nodded . " I can imagine . " He grinned soberly and sighed . " But after all , it 's all established that it is n't Sutton in the morgue . Sutton 's old partner , Walter Danforth , went to the morgue and said it was n't . I should think Scotti would n't be so burned if you told him . Danforth said there was a great resemblance but that it definitely was n't Sutton . Scotti ought to understand your friend making as obvious a mistake as she did . " She rubbed her hands together nervously . " Yes , he should , should n't he ? " Her eyes darted up to his face a moment , troubled and pensive . " Well , if Danforth says it is n't , I should think that 'd be enough proof for you too . " Danny was thinking aloud , trying to hook things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made a couple of slips in front of the police . I do n't think he 's telling everything he knows . And when the police get him started talking , they 'll really have some very potent questions to ask . "  | Her pointed tongue ran thoughtfully across her upper lip for a second . Then the girl sighed . " If you want my honest opinion , I 'll tell you where they 'll end up . " Her voice was sharp and cynical again . " They 'll end up with Alfred Sutton 's lovely wife and that man she 's married to now . " " What makes you say that ? " " Maybe Danforth 's trying to cover up for them . But he ought to know , just like Mr. Scotti and I know , of some of the scenes Alfred Sutton had with that friend ' of Mrs. Sutton 's . If he did n't threaten Sutton twice a day , Sutton thought he was losing his grip . The boy friend wanted Alfred to give her a divorce so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " " Yes , I 've heard about that . " Danny nodded confusedly . He was out on the race track again , and every time he sped past the grandstand there were just two people in it : Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson . They were clutching at one another for dear life and they were definitely not cheering . Neither was he . " Well , " Mrs. Scotti said , " I guess this is the end of the tour , is n't it ? " She arose calmly . Then she looked down at him , her eyes narrowed . " I 'm taking you at your word that you wo n't get me mixed up with all this mess . Tony 's a little hard to explain things to once he starts asking questions . I guess my story 's a little too simple to sound very believable . " Danny nodded . She drew the silver-fox cape about her regally as she slid past him and made her way down the narrow aisle , her high heels drumming against the slanted floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeal of brakes . He looked from the window and saw her alighting . Her eyes flicked up at him but showed no sign of recognition . Danny rode on for two blocks , immersed in gloomy darkness . Then he got off the bus , crossed the street , and caught the ingoing bus . He was going back to Danforth 's office  --  and Marian . And not with the bacon .  | FOURTEEN December 23 IT WAS almost twenty minutes before Danny leaped from the bus and made his way through the crowds that were jostling determinedly along the teeming sidewalk . As he swung into the large recessed entrance to Danforth 's building he was vaguely conscious of a small black coupe parked before the busy entrance . A voice came over the welter of traffic and confusion . " Hey , Dan . " He turned . Mike was lounging behind the wheel of the police car . Danny bucked the tide of pedestrians and stuck his head in the low car door . " Hi there , Mike . What makes ? " " Drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " I guess I told you the sergeant was looking up some doctor who Sutton used to go to . A guy named Vicente . " Danny nodded . " Well , the sarge found out something funny . Seems like this doctor does n't live there any more . " Danny looked at Mike 's red , happy face thoughtfully . " Meaning what , Mike ? " " I do n't know exactly , Dan . I 'm just one of the boys . Seems Sutton 'd been going to see this doctor pretty regular , and the night of the accident in Hubbard Woods an old lady was sitting in the window of her apartment , which was right over the doctor 's apartment and office . She sees some guy in a big car draw up and go in , and then she hears a argument . In a moment the doctor and this guy go out together , still arguing . Well , nobody ever saw the doctor after that . "  | " Judas ! Was n't his disappearance reported ? " Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far as I know , the old lady never thought twice about the doctor checking out without notice , and neither did anybody else . He was sort of on the shady side ; always on the move . Nobody missed him , so nobody bothered to report him being gone . " " So what does that have to do with Danforth ? " " The whole thing 's phony . The sarge ran into this old lady while he was trying to locate the doctor . From what she can remember of the night the doctor checked out , the car and the guy that came in and then went out with the doc  --  it was none other than A. Sutton ! " " Judas ! " " Well , that sets the sergeant thinking . You know how it is with the sarge . He started looking up on this doctor . Jeez , he had the whole office chasing its tail . About all they could find out was that this doctor once got run in for illegal operations . He tried to crack out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and broke a leg . " " Yeah ? " " Well , Dan , it seems that after that accident in Hubbard Woods the autopsy showed that the body they found in the car had signs of a broken leg too . At the time they sort of asked around ; nobody 'd ever known of Sutton having a broken leg . But they decided that did n't mean he could n't of . He 'd been on the loose ever since he was about ten years old and he was n't a guy to talk about his lowly background , so to speak . " Mike raised a flat palm in a gesture of conclusiveness . " So  --  the sergeant puts two and two together and gets six , which he do n't like . He reaches the conclusion it must of been the doctor in that car up in Hubbard Woods and not Sutton . Well , Danforth was the cooky who said it was Sutton , and no doubt about it . " Danny shook his head despondently . This was it .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholar and a gentleman . So here we are again . " Mike grinned expansively . " You 'd better stay clear of there , Dan . The old man 's feeling his oats . This whole business is getting him down . Federal Health is sort of breathing down his neck , hinting in no mean way that he has n't been too sharp to date . The old boy 's out for blood . " Danny gave Mike a wink . " Well , I guess as long as I came through a visit to Tony Scotti without having any head size altered I can handle the sarge . " Marian was sitting far forward on the edge of the deep red leather chair as Danny swung hurriedly in the door . She anxiously held some roughly clipped papers in her hand . " Danny , what 's happening ? " " I do n't know . " He looked apprehensively at the wide swinging door which led to the corridor and Danforth 's office . " You tell me ! " " I was going through Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up her hand and indicated a small clutter of newspaper clippings , news photos , and articles . Danny glanced down at them . There was a blurry picture of Sutton sitting at a council table with Tony and Mrs. Scotti . At the trial , probably . A picture of Sutton , evidently taken years before the accident , with the caption : " Dies in Auto Inferno . " " Anything of interest ? " She shook her head . " Anyway , the sergeant came in . He was pretty rough . He told me to wait here ; he wanted to talk with me . Danny rubbed his hands together nervously as Marian folded the newspaper clippings and put them in her purse . " I 've got to get in there , " he said . Then he took her gently by both arms . " Look , Marian , I 'm afraid we 're in for some trouble . It seems that the sergeant has found out your father was n't killed up in Hub-  | bard Woods . They 've established that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " She nodded ; her eyes had the troubled darkness of a stormy sea . " It 's just as well it came out now , Marian . We 'll get to the truth quicker . " " Yes , Danny . " He went to the small cubicle across the room . The purplehaired girl had been listening to them intently . " Look . " His voice was authoritative . " Give me a piece of scratch paper , will you ? " The girl groped into the small desk drawer nervously . " Thanks . Keep an eye on Miss Sutton for me , will you ? Maybe you could even come out of your cave for a few moments and have a cigarette with her . " Danny took a rumpled package of cigarettes from his pocket and tossed them on the narrow counter . The long red talons stretched out for the package eagerly . " I could use a cigarette right now , " the girl said . " That policeman nearly snatched the hair right off of me . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the corridor he wrote a short note on the slip of scratch paper . It said : " On several occasions Danforth has mentioned the Lake Shore apartment . How does he know about it ? It 's never been mentioned in front of him , has it ? Was he there to see Sorenson before Sorenson died ? If so , what is n't he telling ? " He folded the note crosswise and opened the door cautiously . Danforth sat behind the wide desk . The glow of the wide face had faded to a pale pink , which was sparkling with nervous perspiration . One hand was buried in a coat pocket , the other was revolving in a small arc on the desk top . The sergeant turned . " Danny ! You get out of here ! " Danny closed the door firmly behind him . " Look , Sarge . " He indicated the folded note in his hand . " See this ? It 's got a hot question on it . "  | The sergeant 's eyebrows lifted as he extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless I stay . It 's on the level , Sarge . If you can honestly say this note does n't furnish you a good question I 'll clear out . " The sergeant breathed deeply and nodded . When he had finished reading the cryptic message he looked inquiringly at Danny . Danny shrugged . " Do I stay ? " " Okay ! Only keep your yap out of this . " As Danny sat down the sergeant turned back to Danforth . " It has just been brought to my attention you have n't been coming clean with us , Mr. Danforth . " He handed the note to the attorney , who read it nervously . The sergeant went on firmly : " In the second place , that was n't Alfred Sutton in the burned car up in Hubbard Woods . We got that proved . We know it was someone else , and we know who . " Danforth 's heavy breathing was the only sound in the quiet room . He looked down at the hand on the desk top ; it stopped its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he looked up at the sergeant . The face was n't ruddy pink any more ; it was bleached . The irises in the pale brown eyes seemed to contract ; small round islands against troubled white . " Look , Sergeant . . . . " Danforth 's eyes flicked to Danny 's face accusingly , then back to the older man . " All right , I have n't come clean . ' You 're right : there are certain details I have n't told . Now I 'll make a deal with you . " The sergeant 's big head jutted forward aggressively . " I 'll tell you everything I know if you 'll take it as easy on me as you can . " " You 'll get a square deal ; that 's all I can promise you . " Danforth took a deep breath ; it was wavering , uneven . " I did n't kill Sutton . Maybe I know who did . But I 'm going to get clean of this whole affair . I could bull it through , Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes time to make any charges . "  | The sergeant nodded . " I 'll start right at the beginning of the thing . " " Yah . That 's right . " " I met Alfred Sutton twelve years ago . I had offices  --  not here " ? Danforth looked about the big room unhappily ? " I was out on Madison Street ; the going was rough . I 'd let it be known I 'd like to find someone to share my office expense . Alfred heard , was looking for a similar arrangement , and we made the deal . " " Yah ? " " He made it clear we were to be a partnership in name only ; it looks better on the door . But we were to keep hands off of each other 's affairs  --  completely . " Danforth cleared his throat . " We got along . Sutton 's success was quick . I was doing all right myself . We moved here after two years . At first it was more than we could afford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know Alfred personally . Consequently I never knew the full scope of his practice , but I certainly had every reason to sense that it was dirty enough . " The sergeant nodded him on . " Well , five years ago Sutton started playing the horses . He got on very well at first . Then the tides changed : he got into debt . He came to me for a loan . Twenty-five thousand dollars . I refused at first . Then I found out he 'd been keeping close track of my affairs . " Danforth 's face twisted with the reminiscence of anger . " All attorneys in our work have to handle some affairs that are n't strictly  --  legitimate . Alfred threatened to expose me if I did n't come across . I finally did , after he 'd signed over an insurance policy to me as collateral . I tell you this only because it marked a distinct change in our relationship . " " I should of thought so , " mused the sergeant . " I should of thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I should have , but I did n't . Business was too good . " Danforth smiled uneasily . " As Sutton 's partner , things went well for me , even though it was extremely unpleasant . "  | " Yah ? " " Then three years ago , when the Scotti trial came up , I knew something was out of order . Sutton seemed to be inordinately eager to clear up his affairs . " Danforth looked down at his lap abjectly . " I decided one night to come down here and go through his records . He 'd done just that to me ! " The sergeant , despite himself , clucked his tongue against his teeth . " I did n't know what he had in mind . I was determined not to get caught holding the sack a second time . So I came down . " The voice was scarcely audible now . " That was the night of November 18 . Three years ago . " The sergeant 's voice was a bark . " The night Sutton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was supposed to be killed . " The sergeant sighed . " I came down . Of course I did n't know about the accident . I was in Sutton 's office , going through his files , when I heard a key in the lock . It was Alfred . " " Yah ? " The sergeant shifted nervously forward . Two more inches and he 'd be flat on the floor . " He told me then about the accident . He did n't tell me who was in the car in his place , but he 'd framed the accident all right . " " But  --  right during the middle of the Scotti trial ? " " That was part of it . I knew Scotti had turned over a large sum of money to Sutton for safekeeping . " " The money stolen from the Mayfair Bank ? " " I do n't know where it came from . But it was a large sum . I think he 'd have liked to kill me there and then to keep me quiet , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to make a getaway , a neat getaway , with no signs of any mystery which might raise any questions . " " So then what happened ? " The attorney 's voice became a monotone , a series of toneless ,  | short phrases . " He told me he 'd make it worth my while if I 'd do everything possible to make it appear he 'd actually been killed in the accident . " " Such as testifying at the inquest that it was him ? " Danforth nodded . " How much did that set him back ? " Danforth looked up at last , his eyes narrowed . " Fifty thousand dollars . " The sergeant whistled . " And for that all you had to do was keep quiet ? " Danforth nodded again The sergeant made puzzled gestures with his hands . " But why was he trying to pull such a fade-out ? " " He did n't explain . I did n't ask . " " He paid you the fifty grand right then ? " " Out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I could n't tell . " " I 'll be damned ! " The sergeant 's amazed face took in Danforth unbelievingly , like a little kid who 's just pulled the whiskers off his father and finds it is n't really Santa Claus . " So then ? " " The accident was reported  --  and accepted at face value . It looked like the incident was closed . " " Yah . I should guess so . " " Until " ? Danforth swallowed ? " until three weeks ago . Alfred telephoned . He was back in Chicago . He simply summoned me to the apartment on Lake Shore and told me if I knew what was good for me I 'd be there as specified . I went . " " Yes ? " " He 'd gone through whatever money he had ; he wanted more . He told me he 'd paid out to me  --  that fifty thousand dollars  --  not to mention the insurance I 'd collected on his death . Now it was my turn to pay . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd have had him by the nose . If you 'd come to us he 'd have been in hotter water than you . "  | Danforth nodded . " Only he had nothing to lose . I had all this . " Again he surveyed the office hopelessly . " There was no doubt in your mind that it was Sutton ? " " None whatever . He was blackmailing the Fergusons too  --  his former wife and her new husband , you know . " The sergeant nodded . " I told him it 'd take a little time to raise the money he demanded . Ferguson was stalling for time , too , and Alfred did n't want to wait . " Somewhere behind him Danny heard a door opening , the click of a lock . . . . In the adjoining suite . His mind was so occupied with Danforth 's narrative that the noise only registered unconsciously . " I told him I had to have at least ten days . Finally he consented . " The sergeant grunted as he rose awkwardly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to the room . The room was suddenly silent ; the Venetian blinds over the wide windows banged softly against the window frame , as though caught in a sudden draft . The electric clock on the bookshelf , a modern-looking thing that did everything but tell time , made whirring sounds like the distant sound of many airplanes . The noise of the traffic from the street far below , the honking of horns and clatter of bells and squealing of brakes , made a weird melody . The back of Danny 's neck felt as though cold fingers were barely brushing against the ends of the close-cropped hair . The air was suddenly heavy with hidden menace . .. . " And this is the thing , Sergeant , upon which I think you should base further investigation . While I was in Sutton 's apartment I happened to see  --  " The words froze on Danforth 's pale lips ; his eyes were glazed in abject , terrible horror . He stared at Danny ; no , past him  --  at the heavy paneled door which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn by a sudden blast of noise , deafening , stunning , and the door behind Danny closed as his head spun  | around , fanning at him a wisp of gray , acrid-smelling smoke . Danforth was slumping down slowly in the chair , a stupid smile on the large , relaxing lips , the eyes glazed with unconsciousness . As Danny sprang around the wide desk the big hand dragged slowly across the desk top and fell limp and motionless at Danforth 's side . A spot of red appeared against the neat striped shirt . The sergeant 's voice was shrill . " Where ? Where 'd it come from , Danny ? " Danny nodded with his head at the paneled door . As Danny worked frantically to loosen Danforth 's collar he heard the sergeant rattling wildly at the closed door , but it was locked . The spot of red on Danforth 's shirt was rapidly blotting , larger and larger . Danforth 's jaw was trembling ; the lips were moving as though he were trying to speak , but he was making only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form words . If there had been words Danny could n't have heard them . He could n't have heard anything over the heavy pounding of the sergeant 's massive shoulder as he threw all his force against the unyielding door . Then wood splintered and shrieked . He could hear the sergeant 's footsteps pounding across the adjoining office . This was all in split-second timing , with each moment an hour long . Danny was working deftly , with all the agility he could muster . His ear  --  particularly the right , which had been nearest the shot  --  was ringing like a carillon gone berserk . He took up the limp arm and pressed his middle three fingers against the soft under wrist . " Danny . " His head jerked up . It was Marian . His fingers explored the thick wrist for the pulse . He 'd thought he had it at first , but it had seemed to drain away . Danforth 's face was still now , set in an awful grimace . He straightened up and glanced into the adjoining suite through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | one in plan but was vacant . The hall door was open . Evidently the sergeant was in hot pursuit out in the main corridor of the building . " Danny ! What 's happened ? " She looked at the limp , heavy figure slouched over the big desk , and her deep blue eyes widened in a horrified question . " Yes , Marian . He 's dead . " He led Marian gently back into the waiting room of the large office . He looked around for Purple-hair , but she was nowhere to be seen . He helped Marian into one of the deep chairs . " Danny . . . " Her voice came to him as though from under water . He saw the package of cigarettes on the low table , lighted two at once , and handed one to her . His hand was none too steady . " Danny , I saw something-in those clippings . " " Not now , Marian . Later . " He looked about the room wildly . He could n't leave Marian here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . . . " Where 's that secretary ? " " Downstairs , Danny . " Marian 's voice was breathless . " She said she was so nervous she 'd developed a headache . A Bromo  --  the drugstore downstairs . I told her I 'd take any calls . " She closed her eyes , and her right hand came up as she pressed at her temples with her gloved fingers . " But Danny , while I was here alone  --  " Marian broke off abruptly as the hall door burst open and Purple-hair entered and stood loosely in the doorway . One look at Marian 's pale face and she said : " What 's the matter ? " " It 's Mr. Danforth . " " What ? ? He tried to grab her as she flew by , but she swung through the corridor doors , and he could hear her spiked heels beating against the linoleum . In a moment , as he 'd expected , there was a sharp , piercing scream .  | He looked down at Marian apprehensively . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and get Purple-hair before she did anything rash . She was leaning , against the doorjamb like a limp , willowy sack of flour . Her face was the color of a bruise ; the heavy pink of her cheeks and the red of her mouth were deep tans and brown , verging on blue . He took her firmly by the arm . " Come on , " he said . " Out of here . " The girl turned to him crazily ; he gave her a firm shake . She let him lead her away , back into the reception office . As he lowered her onto the sofa beside Marian she slumped as though she 'd been unboned . He thrust his cigarette into her mouth , and she puffed on it mechanically , her nervous , jerky breathing acting like a bellows . He turned to Marian just as she flung herself about and buried her face in the crook of her arm against the arm of the sofa and started to sob . As he started to move to comfort her he heard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuffling . Voices . .. Marian heard it too . Her head rose slowly as Danny went to the door , opened it , and peered out . Everyone else was peering out of their office doors too . Up the center of the wide marble floor stormed the sergeant . He had someone in tow and was half tugging , half pushing . Danny could n't make out the sergeant 's words over the babble of voices from the curious observers and the dull roar which still echoed in his ears . He adjusted his eyes to the darker confines of the hallway . Then , when he saw the sergeant 's captive , it was as though someone had landed a fist squarely in the center of his stomach , knocking the air clean out of him . He seemed to lose his balance . His weight shifted against the door , which snapped shut neatly . He turned to Marian . She was looking up at him questioningly.  | What to say ? What in hell to say ? The tall reluctant man beside the sergeant was James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhilaration at the " chase " left him sharply as he propelled Ferguson into the large office and closed the door . First he saw the Sutton girl . She was sitting limply on a big sofa against the wall . As the door closed the pretty face lifted slowly . She looked first at the sergeant , and as her eyes shifted they widened . " Jim ! " The second time her voice was a wail : Jim ! " Ferguson looked at her , and the sudden anguish that flooded across the finely chiseled features took the sergeant 's breath away . As Ferguson 's free arm encircled Marian the sergeant loosened his automatic , viselike grasp of the other arm and turned away . Behind the Sutton girl , a girl with long bright red hair was slumped on the sofa , hysterically sobbing into a small lace handkerchief . The sergeant turned away . He attempted to preoccupy himself by working with his tongue at an imagined particle of food between his teeth . He caught his reflection in a small wood-framed mirror . His wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his deep sense of reluctance and distaste . And no wonder ! This was one hell of a way for a man to be preparing for Christmas . Sure , he 'd got his man , all right , but he 'd never felt further from the spirit of Santa Claus than he did right now . His self-disgust was a large , rapidly expanding hard ball in the pit of his stomach . Strangely enough , a picture  | of McWalters flashed through his mind , and he found himself surveying it with homicidal loathing . McWalters was beaming toothily down into a sea of eager , smiling little faces lighted by soft candlelight . His pillow had slipped and his eyes slanted like a shark 's . He had to say something . The words did n't want to come , but he turned to Danny gruffly . " How 's Danforth ? " Danny 's head shook . " He 's dead , Sarge . Shot through the heart . " " Judas ! " The sergeant sighed . Then that awful silence again ; a silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a hostile , reproachful silence that surrounded him . From the ragged fringes he could hear a confused uproar in the hall , the low rumble of traffic from the wide , tall windows across the room , the chatter of trip hammers working on a hard pavement , the incessant , doleful ringing of a telephone bell in some distant room . But that was the fringes . Here , where he stood , the silence was complete and stifling ; so ponderous , it was hard to breathe . The sergeant cleared his throat and was startled at the sudden noise he 'd made . " Well , " he said in a voice completely unlike his own , " I guess I got to make a couple of phone calls . " After he had spoken tersely to the coroner and the chief of the department he re-entered the tight circle of silence again . He stood before Ferguson , his feet planted far apart . " Okay , " he said . " You probably do n't want to talk till you 've seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's probably useless for me to say , Sergeant , that I had nothing to do with Danforth 's death . " The sergeant shoved his hat back from his forehead . " You were running down that hall awful fast , " he commented cryptically . Ferguson gently shoved Marian aside . " Look , Sergeant , attorney or no attorney , I can only tell the truth . I came up here to see Danforth . That 's true . I came because I was curious .  | He had repeatedly said it was n't Alfred Sutton in the morgue . " The sergeant nodded . " Sure . Sure . But we happen to know now it is Sutton . " " We 've known that all along , Sergeant . " Ferguson 's voice was a deep , contrite rumble . " I sort of thought you had . " " It was our out from " ? Ferguson shrugged ? " I do n't know what charges . I did n't feel that at the present time I should definitely re-establish the identity ; everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as long as you thought so , too , my wife  --  " The sergeant nodded exaggeratedly . " But that excuse is out now , " he said . " And frankly it does n't look too good from any angle . " Ferguson 's eyes dropped helplessly . " But you was saying  --  ? " " I came to speak to Danforth . Knowing as I did that his identification was incorrect , I wanted to know why it was . " " You thought maybe you could buy him into keeping on with his statement it was n't Sutton ? " The sergeant 's voice surprised him again ; it had a strong ring of disbelief . He could n't look at Ferguson and say " buy him off " without having something strain almost to snapping point in his credulity . " No , I had no such idea , " Ferguson said quietly . " I came to discuss the matter with him  --  to . see if he was deliberately mistaken or what his reason was . As I entered the building I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought nothing of it at the time . Then , when I entered the office , I found my daughter ? Marian  --  here . She was alone . " Myers ' head snapped around to Purple-hair . " You , " he barked . " Where 'd you gone ? " The girl sobbed and tugged to get out her words . " I 'd gone downstairs . Miss Sutton said she 'd watch the switchboard . II had a splitting headache , and  --  "  | The sergeant turned away , his eyes narrowed , and the secretary took it as a signal to stop talking . Ferguson went on with the firmness of desperation : " Marian told me you  --  and the doctor  --  were here . She said something important was in the wind . Naturally I was anxious not to be discovered . Marian said she had to wait for the doctor ; for me to go  --  " Yah ? " " I was out in the hall " ? Ferguson swallowed painfully ? " when I heard the report of gunfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I 'd be involved if I were found here . So I left immediately . Of course you know the rest . " " Yah . The elevators did n't work quite fast enough . " Ferguson looked downward , but his voice was firm . " That 's the God 's truth , Sergeant . It 's all I can tell you  --  or anyone  --  all I can possibly tell because it 's the absolute truth . " The sergeant 's head did n't move , but his eyes darted over to Marian suspiciously . Then he turned sharply to the sobbing secretary . " She suggested you go downstairs and leave her here ? " The girl bit in her upper lip tragically and nodded . The pure drama of the situation was at last too much to be ignored . The voice was becoming rich and dulcet again , despite the steady punctuation of sobs . " I told her I felt simply awful ; a headache . She said : Why do n't you go down and get a Bromo ? I 'll watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to her forehead and massaged it gently . Danny stepped forward . " Now just a minute , Sarge . If you 're trying to say that Marian  --  " " Shuddup , Danny . " The sergeant 's order was offhand , instinctive , like a father speaking to a troublesome child by rote . Danny started to object heatedly , but Ferguson stopped him with a small shake of his head . The sergeant took in a deep breath . " Well , " he said , " I 'm afraid  | we 'll have to talk all this over more fully . Down at the police station . As soon as the coroner gets here we 'll be on our way . " Ferguson turned to Marian gently . " Dear , you 'll have to tell your mother ; tell her everything will be all right , that she 's not to worry . " " I ca n't tell her , Jim . You 'll be home later this evening ; he 'll believe you . He 's got to ! I 'll just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her chin and lifted her head . " I 'm afraid I may not be home this evening , Marian . " Danny stepped forward resolutely . " Just one minute here ! Listen , Sarge . That shot did n't come from the door that leads to this corridor . It came from that door to the vacant suite on the other side of Danforth 's office . " The sergeant 's eyes narrowed . " You 're real sure of that , Danny ? " " You 're darned right I am ! I was sitting so I could n't help seeing the door from the corridor . There was no one there . Not only that , but the gun nearly went off in my ear , and my ear was backed up to that door from the vacant suite , the door you cracked open . " The sergeant turned to Danny succinctly . " You were n't just leading me off on a wild-goose chase , were you ? It just happened I had my back turned , so you thought maybe ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little screw-loose , maybe , but he was n't lying . " Okay , Danny . So that shot came from that other door . Okay . " " But , Sergeant " ? this time Marian stepped forward ? " Jim bad just gone out the door when I heard the shot . He could n't have got there in time . " The sergeant asked pointedly , " But you did n't see him when you heard the shot , did you ? You ca n't say where he was . " There was a long pause . The sergeant took in Marian appraisingly . A pretty girl . A damned pretty girl . Kind of small , but well rounded in the right places . Innocent-looking .. . No ! Damn  | it all ! Everyone was always looking innocent just for him . Danny , he knew and could trust , but this whole Ferguson bunch  --  they were phony . Naturally , she 'd try to protect her stepfather  --  even if she 'd seen him do the shooting . Ferguson seemed to read these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply , " No , she ca n't say where I was at the time . " " But , Jim , you could n't have ! " she wailed . " It 's all right , Marian . We know that , and we 'll prove it somehow . " He turned to the sergeant . " You will let my daughter go home , Sergeant ? I promise you that she 'll be available for your questioning at your convenience . Her mother is ill ; she 'll need Marian . " " Give them a break , Sarge . Be a pal . " Danny 's voice came up to the sergeant through the dark stickiness of his thoughts . " Well  --  okay . " He wagged his head self-righteously . After all , it was Christmas . The words ran through his mind raggedly : " God rest ye merry gentlemen , let nothing you dismay .. : ' Pete Aldrich gave Danny a wide grin . " Judas , Dan . Light somewhere . My head is n't on a swivel . " Danny stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his short hair . " I ca n't light , Pete . This is such a nasty mess . " Pete nodded sagely . " You can say that again , brother . " The old wicker chair creaked as Danny slumped down into it . It creaked as he nervously rose and again started pacing off the narrow confines of the room . " Okay , " said Pete . " We got as far as you leaving Danforth 's office with Marian . So then what happened ? " " I drove her car out to Evanston and we broke the news . " Danny shook his head savagely . " What a job that was , telling Mrs. Ferguson ! " " I can imagine ! "  | " There was n't any way to soften it . The sergeant 's holding Ferguson on suspicion , and he indirectly accuses Marian of trying to trump up an alibi . " Danny sighed . " Of course he thinks Marian 's just saying Ferguson had just left the room when the shot went off . But he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't left for that Bromo ! " " Yah , sure . " The solid tone of Pete 's solemn voice stopped Danny a second time and he turned . " You think it was just a frumped-up alibi yourself . " " I do n't know , Dan . After all , from the point of view of the man on the street  --  that 's me  --  Ferguson does n't exactly look like a sugar-coated cooky . He was in the thing pretty deep . Naturally , Marian 's fond of him and would want to help him find an out if she could . " Danny 's voice thundered . " Damn it , Pete , Marian was n't lying ! If she said Ferguson did n't have time to do it , then he did n't do it , see ! " Pete 's face broke into a sly smile . " Have you set the date yet , pal ? " " Oh  --  shut up ! " Danny answered rudely . " This is no time to be setting dates . Certainly you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Ferguson 'd been there with her before the sergeant nabbed him in the hall . Pete 's light eyebrows raised . " But she did n't quite get around to it . " " I did n't give her a chance . I kept telling her to keep still . Walking in on Danforth as he died had n't been too soothing an experience ; she was pretty shaken up . " Pete nodded . " Sure she was . " He rubbed his big hands together meditatively . " Just face the facts though , Danny . You 're getting yourself all bolloxed up because of your personal feelings for Marian and her mother and Ferguson . Sure they 're swell people . Maybe so was Jack the Ripper to a small , intimate circle of friends . "  | " Cut it out ! " " But , damn it , Danny , Ferguson said himself that he 'd fought with Sutton . So Sutton is supposedly in an accident and is killed . One of the last people he 'd seen was Ferguson , and at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't mean he had anything to do with the accident ! Sutton was n't even in it ! " " Maybe Ferguson planned the accident and Sutton got wary and put that doctor  --  Vicente  --  in the car in his place . " Danny started to object , and Pete held out both hands restrainingly . " I 'm not saying that 's how it was ; I 'm just saying it could have been . " " And it could have been me who framed the thing . I never liked Sutton after he kicked me out of Marian 's life , either . " Pete continued with his conjecture : " So Ferguson marries Mrs. Sutton , collects the insurance , and settles down to a quiet family life , thinking his troubles are over . But it just so happens that Sutton returns . He blackmails Ferguson . Ferguson decides this time he 'll take care of Sutton once and for all . So he goes to Sutton 's apartment . Danforth sees him there . He gets rid of Sutton by feeding him poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys Danforth off to claim it is n't Sutton when the body shows up at the morgue . Danforth does just that , until the heavy hand of the law closes in , and then he talks , or starts to talk . Ferguson knocks him off , too , and gets caught at it . " Pete shrugged . " There 's one other item : whoever it was who shot Danforth had some way to get into the adjoining vacant suite . Some way , such as a key . " " Go on . " " You said it used to be Sutton 's office . " Danny nodded darkly , and Pete went on , very matter-of-fact : " Who 'd be more likely to have a key than Sutton 's ex-wife , Marian 's mother ? She could have slipped it to Ferguson . " Pete shook his head skeptically . " I 'll admit it 's pretty rich for my blood , Dan . "  | " Yeah , but when the sergeant hits on the idea , will it be too rich for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pete nodded thoughtfully . " Even so  --  in the first place , it 's just too damned obvious , too pat . And the Fergusons  --  " The head shook again incredulously . " That 's just it , Pete . And the Fergusons . ' There are some things you can believe and some you ca n't . This is one of the things I ca n't . In the first place , if Ferguson had wanted to kill Sutton three years ago , he 'd have enough intelligence to see it was Sutton in the car , not just a proxy . In the second place , when Sutton returned with his blackmail threats , an intelligent guy like Ferguson would n't resort to murder . He 'd realize that although it could be damned unpleasant he and Mrs. Ferguson could override any scandal . Their relationship would have been understandable in the eyes of so-called society . " " Sure . But on the other hand , if Ferguson did plan the accident and did intend to kill Sutton up in Hubbard Woods , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover up . And after all , Danny , he did n't go to the police when he got the first intimation Sutton was alive and ready to blackmail him ! " " No . Because I genuinely think he believed Sutton had been killed and that this was a trick by an impostor . I think he went to meet Sutton  --  or the impostor  --  as prearranged , and when no one showed up Ferguson thought : Well , what the hell ! Why go to the police now ? ' And why should he have gone to the police ? " Pete nodded . " We are now taking the great circle route . " " Then I had to come along and call Marian . She came to the morgue and said it was Sutton . Ferguson had no connection with Sutton 's death , so why become involved ? He quieted Marian and returned Hans to me . Hans led me right back to Sutton 's apartment on Lake Shore . And the lid was off . " " Okay , Danny . That 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to peddle to the sergeant right now . "  | " That 's just the trouble . He thinks he 's got everything bagged except , of course , locating Mrs. Sorenson  --  or , to put it more tenderly , the baby doll Sutton was keeping in the Lake Shore apartment as a pet . " " Please , Doctor , you 're making me ill with your crude implications . " " And probably the sarge 'll feel his work is done and leave that part of the investigation to Federal Health . " " Why should n't he ? After all , it 's their business . " " Yah . " Danny ran his hand distractedly through his hair . " Oh yes ! There 's still one little angle of the case . " " What 's that ? " " The sergeant caught Ferguson outside Danforth 's office , all right . But one thing he did n't find . " " Yah ? " " He did n't find the gun that killed Danforth , and he nearly tore the building down looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what he 'd done with it ? " Danny 's Irish face flushed with exasperation . " You seem to forget , just like the sergeant , that Ferguson says he did n't have a gun ; he did n't do any shooting . He was just there to pay a call . " " Oh yes . How thoughtless of me . " Pete flexed his hand thoughtfully . " There 's another thing you do n't seem to take into account , Danny . Just suppose Ferguson did n't shoot Danforth . Does that necessarily clear him of guilt in the automobile accident , when Vicente was knocked off  --  and the matter of one Alfred . Sutton , who was blackmailing the daylights out of him ? " " I think it does ! There are just two ways of looking at Ferguson 's call on Danforth this afternoon . First , he went there to kill Danforth in order to keep him quiet . The only reason he 'd do that would be because he had some reason to keep Danforth quiet . And the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt in the other two death 's : Vicente 's and Sutton's. "  | Pete nodded mutely . " On the other hand , assume he went there merely to talk to Danforth to find out what Danforth knew  --  as Ferguson says was the case . That does n't imply any guilt ; it 's perfectly reasonable that he 's innocent of those other deaths . As a matter of fact , if he had been guilty , I ca n't imagine he 'd take a chance of going to see Danforth . He 'd be placing himself right in Danforth 's hands and giving him the key to the bank vault . " " That 's right , Dan . " " And I 'm certain Ferguson did n't kill Danforth , because Marian says he did n't have time . " Pete nodded again . " You 're right back where you started , Dan : hanging the entire issue of Ferguson 's innocence or guilt on Marian 's word . " " I talked to her very frankly on the way back to Evanston , Pete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any tangents and that her word  --  one way or the other  --  is all I 've got to go on . She knows , too , that she can confide in me , that I would n't give her away if she came clean . Linder those circumstances she has nothing to gain by stringing me along . If she 's lying , then she 'd know Ferguson was guilty , and she 'd know that no matter how hard I worked I 'd still end up with Ferguson . I just do n't think she 'd do that with me . " Pete took a deep breath . ' Vamour , toujours l'amour , " he mused , " and have you got it bad ! " Then he smiled wisely . " And do n't try to tell me you 're interested only because it should n't happen to a dog ! " He glanced at Danny 's sober face . Danny , he was surprised to see , was peering off into the distance dreamily . Always a grim realist in the matter of anyone else 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the program ? " " That 's just it . I do n't know . For one thing I 'm going to talk to Hughes again at the Lake Shore apartment . " " What more can he tell you ? "  | " Probably nothing . But someone came there to see Sorenson ; Danforth started to say so . Even though Hughes says he never saw anyone , maybe one of the other people on the floor did . I 'm going to talk to them . I 'm going to talk to that woman Mrs. Scotti told me about , the one who said she thought she 'd seen Sutton . She lived right downstairs . Maybe she saw or heard someone . " Danny nodded . " I get off at the hospital at two . I 'll take in the Lake Shore apartment right after that . " " Looks like a nice full day , Dan . And if you happen to knock into one of those places at teatime , bring me home a crumpet . " SIXTEEN December z4 WHEN Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . Mrs. Hughes , more blonde and blowzy than ever , was standing at the manager 's counter , discussing a telephone bill with two of the building 's tenants . She glanced up . Her fine-penciled eyebrows raised as Danny flashed her a jaunty smile . He snatched off the brown snap-brim felt hat and ran a hand over the thick layer of short sandy hair . " Hi , Doc . " The voice behind him was low , easy , and friendly . He turned . It was George Casey . Myers ' watchdog . George was lounging in the most comfortable chair in the lobby , thumbing through an old copy of Reader 's Digest . Danny glanced longingly at Mrs. Hughes . She and her tenants were discussing the whole life history of the telephone , from Alexander Graham Bell to Don Ameche . He turned back to George . " How 's tricks ? Why 're you here now ? I thought the sergeant considers the Sorenson matter closed . "  | The big head tilted over to one side . " Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come back for her clothes or something . " " Will you know her when you see her ? " Casey 's big head wagged . " Mrs. Hughes described her to me . Something pretty gorgeous in the way of a blonde . " Danny laughed . " I do n't like to discourage you , George , but there 's lots of blondes in Chicago . " George was unshaken . " Mrs. Hughes 'll point her out to me . " " Sure she will , George , " Danny said soothingly . " Sure she will  --  if she sees her first . " George smiled contentedly . " Oh , we 'll see her . And you ? What 're you up to ? " Danny returned the smile . After all , George got a slug over the head way back when . Way back when , during Prohibition . A slow , friendly mind was his contribution to the noble experiment . Now they sent George out on jobs where they knew nothing would happen . Just to keep him busy and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't come traipsing back here , of all places , now that the story had broken in the papers . " George , there is no objection to my prowling around the halls , is there ? " George mulled over the question carefully , his lips puckered thoughtfully . " Do n't see 's there should be , " he commented finally . " S'long as you do n't disturb nobody . " Danny gave him a wink . The conversation at the manager 's desk was drawing to a close . Mrs. Hughes had , of course , won out . The tenant was thumbing through some bills in a gold bill clip . He gave George a couple of pats on the thick , solid shoulder . " See you soon , George . " " You betcha , Dan . Always glad to see you at any time . Give my regards to the folks . "  | George nodded with inner satisfaction . The folks . He 'd figured that out all by himself . Anybody young as Danny ought to have folks . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the manager 's counter Mrs. Hughes surveyed him placidly . Her face looked pinker and whiter today , as though she 'd dipped it in a flour barrel and then smeared her cheeks with raspberries . " Good afternoon , Doctor . " He nodded his greeting . " I 'm the proverbial bad penny . " Her smile was sullen . " I suppose you 've been reading the news . He nodded . " Really ! So far tbey 've only used the name Sutton and said a prominent Lake Shore apartment . ' If they ever give out the name Sorenson , or the address , we 'll have an exodus out of here that 'll make your head spin . " " Let 's hope they do n't ! " " We 've worked a long time getting a good , steady clientele here , and that 's no cinch . If they ever get the idea we 're running a hide-out for gangsters  --  " Mrs. Hughes shuddered . " I tell you , Doctor , Mr. Hughes and I are about at wit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do but run around town for them . Like this afternoon , Mr. Hughes has to go down and look at some pictures of some women ; looking for Mrs. Sorenson , no doubt . It 'll take him all afternoon , and we 've got so much to take care of right now , with the help situation so bad . " Danny leaned forward insinuatingly and let his hand drop meaningfully over Mrs. Hughes 's plump arm . The long upper lip was straight . " Mrs. Hughes , you know I 've been awfully interested in the Sorensons . You see , some very good friends are involved , just as you are . I 'd like to help you both . " She shrugged pettishly but did n't remove her arm . " Well , I sure wish someone 'd put an end to all this ! "  | " Perhaps I can help , if you 'd just tell me everything you can about the Sorensons . " " I do n't know anything about them ! I 've told everybody that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny a pettish little smile . Evidently the gentle reassuring pressure of Danny 's hand on her arm , the memory of the unpaid bill , and the realization of the endless confusion made her more willing to talk . " They kept to themselves all the time . Not friendly to anyone , as far as I know . " " You 've read the papers , so you know about that man who was shot yesterday ? Danforth ? His picture was in the paper . " She nodded him on . " He was telling the police , just as he was shot , that he 'd been here . " " I read that . But I never saw him . If I did , I did n't give it a second thought ; people come and go all day . And even if I 'd known then he 'd come to see the Sorensons I probably would n't have thought anything about it . Know what I mean ? " Danny sighed and nodded . Mrs. Hughes went on unexpectedly : " Of course I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sort of people who 'd get along together . Of course you ca n't tell about people any more . Only he looked like such a  --  well , a refined sort of man  --  and Mrs. Sorenson  --  " " Yes ? " " Well , she just did n't look his type . Of course when a man looks dissipated he looks dignified . With a woman , she just looks hard . " Mrs. Hughes touched at her straw-blonde hair . " Did they seem to get along okay ? " " Whenever I saw them together they seemed to . Of course there was that night  --  it was the first or second . Bertie and I were making out bills , I remember . " " Yes ? " " Mrs. Morgan  --  she 's next door  --  called and said they was dis-  | turbing her with some sort of fight . But then she always complains . We thought it was probably just the radio . Anyway , she 's good pay , so Mr. Hughes went up . Mr. Sorenson met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorenson . He said as far as he could tell , everything looked peaceful enough . Bertie just used the old apartment manager 's dodge , told them somebody had complained there was a radio too loud somewheres and would they mind turning it down if it was theirs . Mr. Sorenson said it was their radio , but they 'd already turned it off . " " Were there any other complaints ? " " Oh , Mrs. Morgan is always complaining . But she never said anything more about them fighting . Of course she was always complaining about the dog . " Mrs. Hughes grimaced mildly . " We just told her the Sorensons had the dog visiting them from time to time . The dog was well behaved ; he never made any noise , so she never found out they kept him up there all the time . " Then she added hastily : " You wo n't tell anybody ? " Danny smiled . " Of course not . " 1 " There were other times she called us . Once she said their shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it day and night . Another time she complained about them hammering on the walls . That was Mr. Hughes ' fault . he was having Tony , the maintenance man , put in more hooks for Mrs. Sorenson 's clothes . " " I see . " Danny thought carefully . " And they checked out ? when was it ? " " They did n't check out ! Mrs. Sorenson left about a week after Mrs. Morgan complained about their fight . Just up and left , I guess ; I do n't know . I make it a practice not to interfere , but I P mentioned not seeing Mrs. Sorenson to Mr. Sorenson as he came in a couple of days later . He said she 'd gone to visit her mother for a while . " " And Mr. Sorenson ? "  | " He stayed . Let 's see  --  it was five days after Mrs. Sorenson had left . I happened to mention it to Bertie . " " Mention what ? " " Oh , just the way Mr. Sorenson acted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new maid , when he come in . He looked awfully queer ; I do n't know , sort of green , like he 'd seen a ghost . Know what I mean ? In a hurry to get up to his room . At first I thought he 'd had one too many , and then I decided he was afraid he was going to faint . " " Could it have been fear of something else , something or someone he 'd seen ? " Mrs. Hughes ran her tongue over her oily red lips . " Yes , I suppose it could . " " Did you speak to him at all ? " " Yes , I did . I smiled and said good afternoon to him . He just glanced over at me " ? a stubby red-nailed finger traced a path past the desk and to the elevator ? " and went on upstairs without a word . " Danny 's lower lip jutted out thoughtfully . " Mrs. Hughes , do you suppose Mrs. Morgan would mind if I went up and spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest face and smiled I vindictively . " I imagine she 'd love it ! But let me warn you , whatever she says about the apartment and the way it 's run , please remember she 'd think people were making too much noise if she had the place to herself ! " Everything about Mrs. Morgan was pretty much as Mrs. Hughes had described her : even the neat , brisk little arc the door took as it opened ; the distinct white dots on the black , 4 sacky dress which hung from the sparse , flat body ; the sharp , definite features of the narrow , heavy-lined face . Even the silverrimmed glasses seemed to flash defiance . Too much acid , Danny observed , with a distinct neurotic complex and vitamin deficiency .  | It was impossible to visualize there ever having been a Mr. Morgan . Probably a big good-natured guy . Either he got fed up with a timetable life , or his birdlike wife forced him onto her own diet and got rid of him that way . " Yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't seem to soften her , but at least she did n't slam the door in his face . " And what do you wish to know ? " He gave her a thick , charming smile . " I thought perhaps you could help me in my investigation of Mr. and Mrs. Alex Sorenson . " His voice was already acquiring Mrs. Morgan 's thin , pedantic directness . Her small head , with the fringe of old-fashioned pompadour hair , twitched . " I knew nothing of them . Nothing , except that they were most unsatisfactory neighbors . Apartment-house living requires consideration and thoughtfulness , particularly in a building as shoddily constructed as this one . " The head tossed backward defiantly . " I , for instance , never play my radio after ninethirty . Others may want to sleep . Too , I never speak in a loud tone of voice , slam doors . Even in washing dishes I place a dish towel over the drainboard , so that the clatter of dishes wo n't  --  " Danny shoot : his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little " Well , is that so 's ! " on his lips as the account of precautions lined on , one after another . When his cue finally came the words poured out : " I understand the Sorensons were quite thoughtless , that they often had quarrels and arguments . " " Indeed they did ! " The thin eyebrows twitched heavenward . " I often had to move a chair into my tiny little kitchen to escape the noise ; my nerves just ca n't stand constant jangle , jangle , jangle ! Day in and day out ; no consideration for others ! " Danny 's voice was doleful . " And even so , I suppose their voices were so harsh and discordant you could n't escape it . "  | " It was useless . " Mrs. Morgan took a martyred sigh . " What seemed to be the cause of the argument ? " The thin lips bit together caustically . " Money . " Danny shook his head despondently . " Is n't it always , Mrs. Morgan ? " He clucked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clucking almost as though she were a horse . " Mrs. Sorenson accused her husband of retaining money which was rightfully hers . He denied it . She started to cry " ? the thin lips twisted in an apology for all women who must resort to tears ? " and called him a  --  well , a spendthrift . He told her , in the most blasphemous of terms , to mind her own business ; that she 'd been perfectly satisfied with his management of funds when he had plenty to manage . Something to that effect . I 'm quite sure then that he struck her . Unfortunately I ca n't say she did n't deserve it . I had to take to my bed the next day with a sick headache . Of course I called Mr. Hughes at once . " The long , heavily pored nose twitched . " In his usual lazy manner he seemed to imply I was too persnickety . I finally had to tell him if the hubbub was n't quieted immediately I should call the police . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you ever see any of the Sorensons ' callers ? " The eyes blazed threateningly . " I did not ! I had n't the slightest interest in that type of person ! I live my own life , quietly and inconspicuously , and I expect others to live theirs . " " But , you see , there was one gentleman  --  tall , dark , ruddycomplexioned  --  who said he 'd called on them , and  --  " " I know nothing about the Sorensons other than what I have told you ! " The scrawny hand rattled the doorknob nervously . Danny knew the interview was over . As he bid Mrs. Morgan a doleful adieu he discovered that he sounded exactly like a mortician . As the door closed crisply Danny shrugged . He 'd learned quite a little . The pieces , some of them , were beginning to fit together .  | Sutton , going under the name of Sorenson , and his lush blonde companion , whoever she might be , had run out of money . They 'd come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Fergusons . But that would take a little time ; neither could be expected to raise such big sums in a day . And meanwhile Mrs. S. flew off the handle and left in a huff . Only where did she go  --  and why ? Danny sighed . Just how all this helped clear the Fergusons he did n't know . And just what had happened to Sutton-Sorenson from the time he left his place so unexpectedly to the time he showed up on the lower level of Wacker Drive as a very dead , drunken bum ? Why did he leave so suddenly ? Who or what had he seen ? Maybe Viv , Mrs. Scotti 's friend , would have an idea . A lighted glass panel down the hallway said : " Stairs . " He 'd go down and see Viv now , in the suite which was directly below the Sorenson apartment . He was in luck again .
