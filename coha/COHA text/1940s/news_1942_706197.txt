txt CLEVELAND , Jan. 18 ? Although war production as yet is only a fraction of the goals set by President Roosevelt , the industrial regions of the Midwest have taken long steps toward conversion of peacetime industries into weapon factories . In this work the thirteen ordnance districts established with skeleton forces in 1922 are rapidly becoming the organizers and reorganizers of American industries . Using the new pattern of war 's demands , these offices are the operating branches of the general staff at Washington which plot , direct , instruct contractors , set production schedules and finally  --  under the newest regulations  --  actually finance war contracts by prepayment . One of the largest ordnance district offices is located here , and by special arrangement with the War // WAR OUTPUT SHIM ' SPURRED BY ARMY // Department it is possible for the first time to give some description of the field work required by the country 's newest and all-encompassing industry  --  war . The Cleveland Ordnance District , which controls operations in Northern Ohio and part of Western Pennsylvania , has one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces on primary contract or subcontract about 5,000 of the 13,000 items listed in the Ordnance Department 's requirements . The Ordnance Department procures-everything with which men fight except airplanes . In this district are tank factories , gun factories , producers of gun carriages , binocular manufacturers , . the whole list of automotive equipment , to name only a few of its saroducM . Its business is approaching the rate of $1,000,000 a day and probably will exceed $5 , - 000,000 a day before it reaches the anticipated peak . Lieut . Col. H. M. Reedall , deputy district ordnance chief , is ' the youthful director of this government business enterprise . He smiled when he was asked to give examples of conversion of industries that had turned figuratively from manufacturing plowshares to forging swords . " Every job we have in manufacturing military requirements is a conversion one , " he said . " The man who has made electric irons must be taught to make a new product . Machines to bore gun barrels have no use in civilian manufactures . A gun carriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to convert factories ? " he was asked . Management Is Key Need " We have to find skilled management primarily , " he replied . " If management can do one thing well , it can learn to do another , if it has the right tools and the workmen and accurate plans . There is not much difference between one product and another if a manufacturer can work from plans . It is easy to change over the big companies . The problem lies with the small subcontractors . " As one example of a large conversion which has been virtually completed , he cited the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company , at Akron , which adapted the machines with which it had been making tire molds and beer barrels to the manufacture of gun carriages on a quantity basis . The type and quantity are a secret , but these carriages  --  far more complicated than the guns themselves  --  cost $8,000 each , which gives an index of the multiplicity of their parts . At Mansfield the Westinghouse Company 's unit which used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company now makes no commercial cars . Not very long ago the War Department sent out the specifications for the recoil mechanism of a British anti-tank gun , a difficult job . A number of manufacturers studied the venture . Then the Bridgewater Machine Tool Company , at Akron , which had been making molds for the rubber industry , took the primary contract . This job is going forward , assisted by seventeen subcontractors who do 70 per cent of the total operations . Second-Hand Machines Used Another problem arose with orders to manufacture a type of British field gun entirely different from the American types . In this case , original estimates called for $1,750,000 worth of machine tools . The job was adapted to secondhand machines which were procured for $450,000 . Fifteen companies are Involved in mass production , through subcontracting , of a 37-millimeter armor-piercing shell , designed for use against tanks . It is proverbial that large-scale government operationsand extreme expansion of programs in wartime involve waste and duplication , but studies of the methods set up in this specimen ordnance district reveal multiple checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informality also noticeable in contrast to the red tape that so often marks bureaucratic operations . Colonel Reedall meets contractors for conversations , and not for formal conferences . When they have submitted padded bids he has ordered these bids scaled down and showed how to do it . There have been many occasions when small manufacturers , who have not realized the scope of new ventures , have made bids on which an expert could see they would literally lose their shirts . In such cases they have been advised to raise their bids . There is no altruism in this advice , for a contractor who goes broke in the middle of a job is more of a liability than no contractor at all . The office records here show virtually no cases in which contractors have defaulted , although the greater number by far are small and heretofore inexperienced operators on the things they are producing . This is one of the regions where cluster the little manufacturers , as well as a few large ones . For the making of war materiel in this district there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These contracts , of course , interlock and are held by considerably fewer companies . Operations today cover 640 plants . The ordnance district office oyer which Colonel Reedall presides has mushroomed from a skeleton staff only eighteen months ago , when he was transferred to Cleveland from St. Louis , into an organization embracing 1,800 persons . This staff is spread over much of four floors of the Terminal Tower Building and is growing constantly . In the staff are about fifty Army officers trained in ordnance operations . Among the civilians are engineers , accountants , lawyers and industrial specialists whose salaries for work-weeks ranging to sixty hours or more are fractions of their former incomes . These are men who for the most part have been asked to volunteer their services and have " signed up " for the duration . In secret files that fill whole series of offices are 50,000 drawings covering about 5,000 of the 13,000 items of ordnance equipment , with specifications , stand ' ards and the most minute requirements . Supplementing these drawings , which were made by engineers for engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here are displayed the actual parts of , the wanted equipment , and Colonel Reedall gathers in the room small manufacturers to determine fromd the parts what their machines can do or be adapted to do . Frequently ' ordnance engineers suggest means by which the manufacturers can adapt their facilities . Statistics , filed in binders , reveal as nearly as possible all the machine tools in the district and the numbers of men qualified to work them . Likewise recorded arel the extent of training facilities to provide new workmen and the potential supply of additional tools . " We have pretty well filled up the critical machine tools with production , " Colonel Reedall declared . " Soon we shall have to use the marginal producers . The cost will be higher , but in this thing the only result that counts is production . " The ordnance office here owns about 30,000 gauges used to check materiel . Some of the gauges test tolerances as small as one tenthousandth of an inch . The gauges are used primarily by inspectors in the plants . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , can not obtain them and the ordnance office lends its gauges . There have been occasions where the office itself has had to borrow from manufacturers . This is part of the inter-locking cooperative side of the government-industry production picture in the field . These gauges are the instruments which make possible mass production by use of subcontractors . Any particular item which passes the gauge test will be interchangeable with a similar part , even though manufactured 1,000 miles away . The office holds classes to teach inspectors how to use the gauges and check on quality of production . One section of the offices is used by plant inspectors , who travel five days a week and write reports on the sixth . They look for everything from minor fire hazards to human hazards and study every element of plant security . The contract division has been enlarged greatly in the past two weeks as a result of an order from Washington authorizing district offices to award Contracts involving less than $1,000,000 , without reference to Washington . A finance division was established within the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent of contracts . This was done to finance small manufacturers who have no bank credit to undertake initial orders . A staff of auditors keeps daily track of expenditures , checking cost estimates against manufacturers ' statements . A priority staff runs down critical materials as need arises , operating with the major agencies in Washington . " Gold Mine " of Scrap Found When a critical situation arose in this district recently because of a shortage of scrap essential to the making of steel municipal authorities cooperated in a " scrap hunt " which yielded 28,000 tons . One figurative gold mine of scrap was uncovered in a long-forgotten dump covered by a field of weeds . Each day sees new tools , new workers and new facilities brought into the picture , while officials and management increase operations toward the goal of three shifts seven days a week in every materiel supply factory . That goal is far from achieved . This story , however , is written on a week-end , when customarily fires would be banked in factory boilers and workers would be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland through which one catches only glimpses of blue sky . A visit to the factories here reveals no sight of spectacular bombers or the imagination-stimulating smaller combat planes , but what can be seen are the cumulative thousands of increasing activities necessary to supply an army which by the end of 1942 will contain 3,600,000 men .
