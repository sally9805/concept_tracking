The guard at the Miami Beach Army stockade saw the woman , aging ( 40 ) Ursula Parrott , author of Ex-Wife and herself four times married , hide the handsome boyfaced soldier prisoner in the back of her car . He shouted for her to halt . She stepped on the gas and charged for the exit gate . Escaping in this reverse Lochinvar was Private Michael Neely Bryan , 26 , once a very hot guitar player with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw . He had been locked up for flying to New York without permission ; also the FBI was investigating charges that he was involved in the transport of narcotics . <P> To many a Hausfrau , wrinkling into middle age , this saga of the popular author of slick , sleek magazine pap was a thrill beyond her daily hopes . They quickly bought up almost every Ursula Parrott book on the drugstore shelves . But what produced a bitter-sweet romantic sighing in Ursula 's readers fetched another emotion in the breast of the FBI . Ursula was charged not just with love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion of an army prisoner . <P> Readers could turn to any of Author Parrott 's 14 books to find many a lush passage written in that hot chocolate sauce that has pleased so many followers of her ( up till now ) fictional romances . <P> " She stared at him and he did not hurry her . So she understood very completely that he was asking her to stay , not for an hour or two , or another evening , but permanently . . . . " <P> In Ursula 's book Next Time We Live it was that simple . But the author 's real-life current hero was also charged with helping run a reefer flat in Manhattan where marijuana cigarets were smoked by soldiers &; sailors . This sort of thing might enchant the shade of Baudelaire , but it is vexing to narcotics squads . <P> After the Miami Beach escape Ursula drove Bryan to her surfside home , outfitted him with civilian clothes . " I remember I wanted to give you things . . . smart sport roadsters and pearls-the moon in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely do such things ; when arrested , Ursula said it was all just " an impulse . . . . " <P> The FBI felt it was a large , bad impulse . Ursula , still game after hectic questioning , haggard , her impulsive uncombed head under a badly tied turban , was freed on $1,000 bail . The near future held for her , first , the star witness part in an approaching Federal narcotics case . Those of the ex-bandsman 's jive-plucking friends that could be reached mostly made the same comment : " Mike always was a damn good guitar player . . . . "
