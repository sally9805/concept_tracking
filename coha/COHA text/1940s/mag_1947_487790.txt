A Westerner Goes East - /on , and Southeast Asia , from 1943 to 1946 , found his intellectual and spiritual life greatly enriched . If the world at large , he feels , could learn what he learned in that experience , it too would grow much richer by Asia . His enrichment consisted in coming to understand for specific reasons what he might have been willing to admit only in disembodied principle before he went there : namely , that Asia and Asians have a right to their own lives free of Western imperialism , which is injurious to them and the imperialists alike ; that their cultures have values , chiefly of the mind and the spirit , which the rest of the world should understand and at least in part employ ; that through the recognition of these facts mankind can achieve the state of one world which will forestall other wars . institutions and nations , he tells us , like individuals , quarrel and fight because they suffer from paranoid delusion , which seems to be just another way of saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to panic and irrational conduct expressed by violence . Mr. Taylor 's ideas are evidently sound enough , though they are hardly novel and do not in themselves constitute the interesting part of his book . The real value of the work lies in the author 's full and careful statement of the steps by which he reached his convictions . He analyzes his intellectual experiences in the greatest detail , and the subject of the book is actually the education of Edmond Taylor . Since he has unusual powers of self-analysis and a fluid , vivid , and rich prose style , this personal history is absorbing and stimulating , except in a number of spots where excess of detail and repetition tend to relax the attention of the reader . Mr. Taylor has remarkable skill in investigating individual and public sentiment through conversation and interview , and he has obviously supplemented this by considerable reading and reflection . His book may therefore help other thoughtful men who can not duplicate his experiences to obtain some measure The NATION of the rich education which he has so , q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has persistently battled the popular notion that a novel is as good as its politics must do a bit of backtracking in the case of Humphrey Slater 's " The Heretics " ( Harcourt , Brace , $2.75 ) . Perhaps , after all , a novel is as good as its political Heart in at least this one sense  --  that if it has a truly sound political core , this healthiness is likely to be reflected in the feeling tone of the whole work . There would certainly seem to be a relation between Mr. Slater 's decent political point of view and the fact that his book suffers from none of the weaknesses endemic in our contemporary fiction of good-will ; it is not priggish , condescending , " or inflated . On the contrary , its manner is beautifully quiet , self-respectin , direct , consistently matching its disciplined political intelligence with a disciplined literary taste . But unfortunately Mr. Slater 's good sense and taste , while they save him from the common pitfalls of current political ' fiction , seem also to put a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lamentably underwritten in point of character development and drama . It is only the suggesticin of the fine novel it might have been , a seed rather than-at a full growth . Mr , Slater divides his story into two sections , the first dealing with the Albigensian heresies of the early thirteenth century , the second with the Spanish civil war . The connection is only ideo- - **1 logical : Mr. Slater is giving us a tom-parative study in fanaticism . But he also contrives a narrative link by carrying over the names of the chief characters in the first half of the book to the second . Four children are the main actors in ' I the early section of " The Heretics " ? a brother and sister , Paul and Elizabeth , their friend Simon , and Moro , the Moorish boy with whom they join forces after their parents are killed as heretics . Seven centuries later a Paul and an Elizabeth , brother and sister , and a friend Simon are again Mr. Slater 's principal characters ; in the confusion of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved ? Elizabeth as a correspondent for the English papers , Paul as a Trotskyite soldier , Simon as a Stalinist soldier and spy  --  the old quartet is completed by Cordova , Elizabeth 's Spanish lover . It is a stunty contrivance , without either intellectual or emotional validity . For the fact is that no more than Mr. Slater 's modern characters are present-day counterparts of the Albigensian orphans is the of civil war a modern equivalent of the heresy-hunting of the Middle Ages . " The Heretics " is not saying anything so mechanical as that history repeats itself . What it is saying , if I read it correctly , is that the instinct to fanaticism has been fairly constant throughout history . Just as a dedication to the ideals of the church issued in the reign of terror against the Albigensians , so a dedication to the Soviet ideal produced the ruthlessness of the Spanish Communists ; in whatever period , that is , there is a reverse of violence to the coin of principle . Mr. Slater 's parallels between the child victims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heretics and the Moscow trials , between the Nomile nalist-Realist issue and the theoretical - issues of radical dissidence have a more than literal significance . They indicate the paths of thought and feeling that 4 connect man to man over the centuries . The earlier portion of Mr. Slater 's book is historically interesting . It was ? nevertheless a mistake for Mr. Slater to have included it in the same novel with his Spanish material , which , quite by itself , has such fine fictional potentialities . Probably no one who has written about the Spanish struggle is better qualified for the task than Mr. Slater , both in military knowledge  --  he fought in the Spanish war and he has published several books on military strategy  --  and in political insight . " The Heretics " has none of the sentimentality or political ambiguity that marred Hemingway 's " For Whom the Bell Tolls . " Its author is not caught by the myth of heroism , nor is he afraid to move completely into the open with his indictment of the Stalinist command in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a short satiric chapter describing a meeting of the Operational Policy Commission , three Spaniards and three Russians . Yet despite these advantages , " The Heretics , " as ' a work of the imagination , is not to be compared with Hemingway 's Spanish novel . Every human situation in it , every occasion of drama , is , if not entirely thrown away , taken at its lowest pitch  --  quite as if the whole business of novel-writing were properly conducted only on the scale of a well-bred drawing-room conversation . And one 's disappointment at Mr. Slater 's undue reticence turns to ? bitterness if one happens , as I did , to read " The Heretics " hard upon Frederic Wakeman 's " The Saxon Charm " ( Rinehart , $2.75 ) , which is one of the most inept books ever to come my way , and yet one of the most self-proclaiming : The new novel by the author of " The Hucksters " has a novelist as its protagonist and a good deal to say about the profession of literature . Clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very superior pastime , for heprovides opportunity for everyone in his book to acclaim it . Whenever Novelist Eric Busch , hero of " The Saxon Charm , " utters an inanity , which is whenever he opens his mouth , there is a bystander to murmur , " What wisdom ! " And obviously Novelist Busch - would feel no less strongly about Novelist Wakeman than Novelist Wakeman feels about Novelist Busch . Let other reviewers risk libel by naming the likely original of the villain of Mr. Wakeman 's piece , the prodigious play-producer whose genius for the theater is so heavily larded with egotism that it leaves no room for the genius of his playwrights . I am content merely to report that Mr. Wakeman calls him Matt Saxon , and that he comes nowhere near making a credible fictional character out of him . We are intended to understand that Saxon 's malign charm was the temporary undoing of a fine writer named Busch who had written a fine play about the life of Moliere . ( Happily Mr. Wakeman spells Moliere correctly ; the same can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) People who can believe in the quality of Busch and of Busch 's dramatic effort , or who can even remember with respect that there was such a person as Moliere after Mr. Wakeman 's manhandling of him , will no doubt also believe in the inordinate power for good and evil of Mr. Saxon . I am not one of them , But I should add that my untempered response to " The Saxon Charm , " however much it may result from the contrast between Mr. Wakeman 's entirely unwarranted confidence and Mr. Slater 's unwarranted modesty , is also directed to a culture which encourages such cheapness as Mr. Wakeman 's and even pays dearly for it . the terms in which the hero of " The Hucksters " left the advertising business and committed himself to the life of art should perfectly have prepared us for the kind of art we get in the novel that follows ' =The Hucksters . " There was every evidence in Mr. Wakeman 's book about radio advertising that the point of view of its author was identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that if , after he broke with his old world , Mr. Wakeman 's hero went on to be a writer he would simply lay aside his " sincere " neckties for " sincere " ideas . But self-revelation was read as healthy self-criticism , Mr. Wakeman was credited with a conscious act of social usefulness , and anyone who failed to appreciate his service to American life was accused of refusing help when it was offered . Perhaps the same accusation will be leveled against the critic who fails to welcome Mr. Wakeman 's newest seriousness . Perhaps here the ungenerosity will be found to lie in tracing so close a connection between the quality of " The Hucksters " and the quality of " The Saxon Charm , " in failing to encourage Mr. Wakeman 's journey from Mammon to literature , But I risk the imputation in view of the substantial aid our society makes available for such travelers . The report is that the movies 454 encouraged Mr. Wakeman with $250,000 for " The Saxon Charm , " in advance of publication . DIANA TRILLING ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
