Reporters on a daily drudge through the Surrogate 's Court in Poughkeepsie leaped hungrily last week upon a rare scrap of news . A millionaire 's name over a drab set of tax-appraisal figures made their story . The name : Franklin Delano Roosevelt . <P> The common man 's President had died uncommonly wealthy . His executors assessed his gross estate , before expenses and taxes , at $1,940,999 . Nearly half that amount he had inherited in stocks and bonds from his mother ; another half-million was soundly liquid in bank accounts , additional securities and U.S. Treasury bonds . Hyde Park property ( including $110,520 worth donated to the nation ) and the famous stamp collection ( auctioned for $212,847 ) were other principal assets . <P> With meticulous care the list recorded F.D.R. 's modest possession of $133 in cash on the day of his death . Last year 's royalties on The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt , published by Random House in 1938 , amounted to a mere $13.50 . Alumnus Roosevelt 's $500 investment in the Harvard Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typical debts : $22 for Hyde Park seed , $72 to a British stamp dealer , and $8.88 for newspapers . <P> In the final accounting , attorneys ' fees , executors ' commissions , administrative charges and funeral expenses would subtract a $200,000 chunk from the estate . Estate taxes would take out considerably more . But the remaining fortune made F.D.R. the second richest U.S. President. * <P> <P> * George Washington left a fortune estimated at over $5 million , Lincoln only $110,000 . Ulysses S. Grant struggled out of bankruptcy only by selling his memoirs , finished but a few days before his death . Roosevelt I 's $810,706 estate formerly ranked second to Washington's.
