At the end of last week the American Federation of Labor was the biggest labor empire in U.S. history . Comfortably atop 6,500,000 able leaders , fantastic phonies , criminal racketeers and hard-working dues payers sat apple-colored President William Green , bumbling master of all he surveyed and now indisputably the peer of C.I.O. 's Phil Murray . The newly prodigious membership gave the Federation vast political power and an annual income exceeding $3,735,000 . The record-breaking total was reached at the 63rd annual convention , in Boston , when the International Association of Machinists came back into the fold . <P> Soon another 600,000 members of John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers may be back too . Chief obstacle to the readmission of the Miners has been Lewis ' grab-bag District 50 , which has raided all kinds of A.F. of L. unions . But the Executive Council received a letter from John Lewis last week cooing his willingness to dissolve District 50 into the appropriate A.F of L. unions . The Executive Councilmen , thinking of 600,000 dues-paying members , prepared to gulp down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.M.W. will be readmitted soon . <P> In Washington , John L. Lewis , who despises William Green almost as much as he hates Franklin Roosevelt , grinned sardonically as he followed the convention 's dull familiar pomp . Said he : " Did you ever see me in a movement that stayed dead long ? "
