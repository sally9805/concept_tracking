In Waukegan , Ill. last week , a stage show started on its rounds billed as Uncle Tom 's Cabin in Swing . The swing was all there , in a noisy , nickel-in-the-slot sort of way ; but Uncle Tom 's Cabin was not . In his 87 years in the theatre , Uncle Tom has taken some awful beatings-from stagefolk as well as from Simon Legree-but never a worse one than at Waukegan , where there was no auction block , no whipping post , no bloodhounds , no Eliza crossing the ice . Topsy and Little Eva remained-but precious little Eva . <P> Yet nobody seemed to care . The present generation , still curious about Uncle Tom 's Cabin as the greatest propaganda novel in the history of the U. S. , has little feeling for it as the greatest hokum play in the history of the world . Harriet Beecher Stowe fought against having her book dramatized , on the ground that if people began going to Christian plays they would end up going to un-Christian ones . But in an age before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Tom was pirated ( by Actor G. L. Aiken and others ) , with never a cent of royalties for Mrs. Stowe . <P> The play did well before the Civil War , but its unparalleled popularity really began afterwards , when its propaganda value was gone and the monkeyshines started . In the ' 70s and ' 80s barnstorming troupes ( known ever after as Tom Shows ) went to every tank town in the U. S. , to places where even the circus never went , playing in tents , in showboats , in rooms over warehouses . <P> Many actors played Uncle Tom their whole lives through . A real " Uncle Tommer " always knew his part ( ad libs included ) when hired ; if he had to rehearse , he was considered a fraud . Though dozens of notables like Joe Jefferson , Mrs. Fiske , Maude Adams , Otis Skinner at one time or another appeared in Tom Shows , good actors almost always flopped in them . It took a ham to bring home the hokum . <P> Famous is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here last night . The dogs were good . " Anything went in a Tom Show . Eliza might cross the ice against a backdrop of the tropics . There were comedy teams , minstrel troupes , animal acts . There were " double shows " - two Uncle Toms , two Topsies , two Legrees ; there were even triple shows . Harriet Beecher Stowe once went to see Uncle Tom 's Cabin in Hartford and had to have the plot explained to her . <P> The sure-fire moments were the bloodhounds chasing Eliza , and Little Eva 's ascent to Heaven on a block &; tackle : <P> To die and go to Heaven was her only hope ; But one of the stagehands forgot to fix the rope : So she did n't get to Heaven Till a quarter past eleven , Little Eva , Little Eva . <P> When The Players revived it in Manhattan in 1933 , Critic Percy Hammond claimed he detected tears in the eyes of such sophisticates as Edna Ferber , Rollin Kirby , Katharine Hepburn .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
