St. Louis , whose big three daily newspapers are closed by a strike , got itself a new paper last week . Its publishers ( the Newspaper Guildsmen and three backshop unions of the strike-bound Post-Dispatch , the Star-Times and Globe-Democrat ) hoped it would not live long . So did St. Louis readers , who found the skimpy four pages of its first issue an inadequate substitute . To start their St. Louis Daily News , Guildsmen wangled a first allotment of 16 tons of newsprint from WPB ( which will allow any new daily paper that much ) , persuaded a south St. Louis neighborhood publisher to print it , * and hired an apartment above his plant for their editorial offices . Copyreaders toiled in the living room . Managing Editor Thomas Sherman ( who edits the Post-Dispatch Sunday editorial page ) , his society department and a Transradio news ticker were bunched in the dining room . In an alcove off the hall was the telephone switchboard , and classified-ad takers labored in the kitchen . The sports and financial departments got the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily , News publishers rolled out 100,000 copies a day , and had no trouble getting advertisers , or selling out their whole first issue in an hour . They solemnly promised their readers to cease publication as soon as the strike ended . <P> <P> * First day union pressmen picketed their fellow unionists ' paper , on the grounds that it was not employing the right kind of pressmen.
