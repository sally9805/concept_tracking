U.S. Open Champion Ben Hogan was Sticking to his grand design ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) . The other pros could make the full winter circuit ; " Little Ice Water " would take what he could get in four tournaments , then rest until spring . <P> Warming up on the Los Angeles Open early last month , Ben had come in behind Lloyd Mangrum and nine others . But as he sank his final putt for a birdie , he promised : " Things are going to get better . " A week later , Ben won the Bing Crosby invitation tournament . At Long Beach the week after , he won again . On the 18th green he sank an 11-ft. putt ( " It seemed like the longest I ever made " ) to tie Jimmy Demaret ; next day , in the playoff , Hogan won by two strokes . Said he : " I guess I 'm making myself unpopular . " <P> This week , after 72 holes of the Phoenix Open , Demaret and Ben Hogan were tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Demaret . He took an early lead , lost it , took it back again with a birdie on the 345-yd. 14th . Then he got his big break ( a double one ) on the 17th . <P> Jimmy hooked his drive toward the rough , but the ball hit a spectator and caromed back onto the fairway . His next , a strong approach shot headed for the back-of-beyond , hit a second spectator and dropped on the edge of the green . Demaret took a par for the hole and gained another stroke on Hogan . Jimmy sealed the victory on the 18th with a 30-ft. putt for a birdie , a 67 and first-prize money of $2,000 . Hogan missed an easy putt for a 70 . Grinned Jimmy , who would be riding the rest of the winter circuit : " I feel like a race horse beating Citation . "
