A perfect pearl , formed not in an oyster but in a coconut , was exhibited last week in Florida by Botanist David Fairchild . One of a dozen found in 9,000,000 East Indian coconuts , the pearl began ( scientists believe ) when a sprout was unable to force its way through one of the three pores in a germinating nut . Like a sand grain in an oyster , the sprout was then encrusted with layers of calcium carbonate-even though chemists have never found this compound in either the nut 's milk or kernel.
