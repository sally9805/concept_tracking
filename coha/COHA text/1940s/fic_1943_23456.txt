NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS A Sim ) ) CHRISTOPHER LA FARGE This is the fifth story in Mr. La Forge 's series , " East by Southwest . " These stories , their characters and their happenings , are all entirely fictional . They grew from the observations and experiences of the author as a war correspondent in the southwest Pacific . If , happily , they seem true , it must be in the sense of a truth that illuminates rather than reports , for here there is no transcription of actual events. ? The Editors / KNEW what time Charlie Calthrop , the correspondent for INS , had got to bed the night before because he had ( as he usually did ) fallen through the hole in the board floor of the tent we shared , and his curses had awakened me . After I had put iodine on the abrasions on his shin ( for one does not neglect scratches in the tropics ) , I looked at my watch , noted it was past two o'clock , and went hack to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , when he slept through reveille in the morning . You had to be really sound asleep to do that at the Navy Casuals Camp . Reveille was broadcast over a violent system of loudspeakers placed with great skill all about the camp . I lay in bed , half awake , in no hurry to get up , and planned my day . I was due to leave Touebon , the capital of the island of Balade , that afternoon on the cruiser Las Vegas . I should have to pack and get my laundry and do other chores . Presently a loud and nasal voice came over the loudspeakers , preceded as always by an amplified bosun 's pipe . " Chow , " it said , " is being served now . There will be no chow after seven o'clock . I repeat . Chow is being served now . There will be no chow after seven o'clock . " Charlie Calthrop groaned and rolled over on his other side . I got up and I went to the Chief Petty Officers ' lavatory and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent and began leisurely to dress . Through the open flap of the tent I could see long Lines of sailors in dungarees advancing slowly on the main Mess Shack . I was half dressed when the loudspeakers opened up again : " The following men lay down to the Captain 's office , at the double . Seaman , 3d Class , A. J. Bloodock ; Fireman , 1st Class , S. R. Moody . I repeat . " And it did . Charlie groaned again and stirred . I put on my shoes , found my cap , loaded my packets . I was about to leave when the nasal voice again began : " Will the following named officers please report at eight o'clock to the Reception Center for the censoring of mail . Ensigns J. S. Mahaffey , A. M. Gurlick , 0 . 0 . Valenti . Lieutenants M. Grossford , G. J. Blanker , Junior . . . " It was a long list . At the end , the voice said , " I repeat , " and of course proceeded to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Charlie and rolled over again . " He 's purveying news , like you , " I said . " You 'd better get up . You 'll miss breakfast . And you 'll get no work done . " " Thank God , " said Charlie , " I did my piece yesterday . " " You 'll be hungry later . " " Not me , " he said . " Not after last night . And I ca n't face all those rosy , those apple-checked ensigns tucking in orange juice and enormous plates of oatmeal and ham and eggs and coffee and then moving on to those huge sugared buns that they cover an inch deep in jam . Golly ! I wish I had n't thought of it . " " You wo n't sleep here , " I said . " Go away , " he said . I left him and went to the Officers ' Mess where chow was being served now and , mercifully , until seven-thirty , and I had breakfast . It was much as Charlie had described it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . Breakfast over , I went up to the C.P.O. 's latrine which , being famous , was called the Mountain View House . It was an eight-holer with a fine view over the camp . It was a very interesting spot . There were six customers as I entered and took my place , and another man followed me in . Two men were reading comics , one was studying some typewritten sheets of paper . The others were talking . " He said he expected to get the 40-millimeters on by the end of this week , " said a thin man . " But he wo n't . " " Is that so ? " said a large , hard-bitten C.P.O. several places down . " I did n't know they was installing them here . " . " That 's what Glendale told me , " said the thin man . " Captain McHenry , he was crying for ' em , " said the hard-bitten man . " He says with them 40 's their torpedo planes is cooked . " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right . " " What 's new about the Westerly ? " asked the thin man . " I ai n't heard nothing , " said Harry . " On'y thing I 've heard is that the Las Vegas got in with her carrier . " ' The Superior ? " " Yeah . " " When ? " " Yes'day afternoon . " " They get into anything ? " " Not ' at I heard . You hear anything ? " " On'y she 's going right out again . They got a lotta new fliers and a new Executive . It 's a shakedown cruise . " " Yeah , I suppose so . So long . I 'll be seeing you , Arthur . " Harry departed then . Another C.P.O. , very square and solid , who had been smoking outside , took Harry 's place . " Hello , Elliott , " said Arthur . " Ware ya ? " said the new arrival . " What 's new , Arthurl " " " Nothin ' . You heard anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that so ? Bad ? " " Du n no . I heard tell she got a fish into her , but someone said it was a bomb . Any a you heard anything ? " " No , " said the others . " Where was she ? " " That 's all I heard , " said Elliott . " Any chance of whisky around here ? " " No , " said Arthur . " On'y beer , and a sorta brandy , local stuff . " " Rotgut , " said another man . " Do n't fool with it . " " You know Chief Droskin ? " asked a bald man , rising and preparing to leave . " Sure , " said Elliott . " We was on the Big E together for a while . If you mean Jim Droskin . " " That 's him . He 's here , " said the bald man . " Is that so ? " said Elliott . " Yeah . Been here two weeks , and whaddya know ? " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French girl . Regelar . " " Him ? " cried Elliott . " Droskin has ? " " Yeah . He has her regelar . I knew you 'd laugh . " " White ? " asked Elliott . " Well , yeah  --  mostly , " said the man . " So long . " " So long , " said Elliott . " Ai n't that the God-damnedest thing ? " The two men who had been reading the comics and the one who had studied the typed sheets now left and their places were at once taken by three new men . One of these wore dungarees . The others wore khaki . " Hello , Arthur , " said the man in dungarees . " Hi , Joc , " said Arthur . There was silence for a while . Then Arthur rose and left and shortly after he had gone Elliott got up to go . " So long , " he said , and left " So long , " said the others . " Is that Chief Elliott , was on the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said another man . " Anything new ? " said , Joe . " He usually knows something . " " The Westerly got hit , " said the man . " She got a fish and a bomb into her , I hear . " " Where away ? " " Du n no . It ai n't been released . " " Captain McHenry 's ship , ai n't it ? " said another . " That 's right . Or so I believe . You ever know Chief Droskin , Jim Droskin ? " " Sure , I knowed him . What 's of him ? " " Nothin ' , on'y he 's got him a steady girl here . French . " " Fer Gawd 's sake ! " said Joe . " Droskin has got him a girl ? Here ? Where they is scarcer'n hen 's teeth ? " " That 's what . " " Gees , you never know . White ? " " So they say . " " Well , well , " said Joe . " That 's bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence then , and there were already several men waiting , I left and went back to the tent . Calthrop was still in bed under his mosquito net , but he had given up trying to sleep through the frequent announcements and he was smoking . " Where have you been ? " he asked . " The Mountain View House , " I said . " Any news ? " " just scuttlebutt , " I said . " The Las Vegas is in , which I knew last night . Chief Jim Droskin has a French girl , mostly white , and the Westerly has been hit . " Calthrop sat up . " Where ? When ? " he said . " That 's all I know , " I said . " Some say a torpedo , others a bomb . Place and time unknown . Her captain is McHenry . " " What a hell of a reporter you are ! " said Charlie , and he lay back on his pillow . " Now I 'll have to find out for myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a desultory manner , while I packed my gear . Then I said good-by to him and lugged my duffel to the gate , checked out of the camp , and was lucky enough to get a lift in to Touebon with a kindly colonel of Engineers . He dropped me at the Navy Press Relations Office in Touebon . That office occupied the rear third of a Quonset hut . The other two thirds were occupied by two elderly and high-ranking Navy officers engaged in deciding what form communiques should take . One could occasionally hear them , through the wallboard partition , arguing the choice of an apposite and unrevealing word ; but more often they discussed how to spell it , and from time to time they sent in one of their yeomen to consult the Webster that Press Relations thoughtfully maintained for the correspondents , who frankly admitted they could not spell . There were three correspondents already there . They were Fareckson of AP , Maydriss of U.P. , and the Englishman , Honscoll , of the London Daily Express . They were reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed entirely in capitals . The Press Relations yeoman was typing busily . " Good morning , " I said . " Morning , " they said . I sat down and picked up a copy of the News . As I did so , the Press Relations Officer , Lieutenant Basswall , entered . " Good morning , gents , " he said cheerfully . " What 's the news ? " said Maydriss . " Not a new , men , not a new , " said Basswall . " Lord ! " said Honscoll . " Except , " said Basswall to me , " that you leave at three-fifteen from the East Dock and I 've got a truck to take you and your gear down from here at three . " " Thanks , " I said . " Honest to God , Bass , " said Maydriss , " is there no news at all ? " " None , " he said . " Bass is right , " I said , " except that the Las Vegas and the Superior are in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Superior has a new Executive and a lot of green pilots . Beyond this , Chief Petty Officer James Droskin has , to the wonderment of his friends and acquaintances , got him a French girl , regelar , and she is almost entirely white , and the Westerly , Captain McHenry , has been hit by either a torpedo , or a bomb or both . " " Great God ! " said Basswall . " Where in hell do you pick up such stuff ? " " In the C.P.O. 's powder room at camp , " I said . " Where else ? " " Where indeed ? " said Honscoll , without looking up . " Where , where indeed ? " " Not here , " said Maydriss . " Is it true , Bass ? " " First I 've heard , " said Basswall . " But I 'll inquire . " " And if it 's true about the Westerly , " said Honscoll , " what then ? Do you suppose that dear old bird Lieutenant Cladding , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would let us use it ? " " No ! " shouted Fareckson. ; " Listen to this , " said Maydriss , a large and amiable man . " This will give you boys an idea of what you can say , and how you can say it . " He read from the COMSOPAC News . " ' Commenting at his press conference concerning his intentions on this anniversary , MacArthur piously remarked . . .1 That is a splendid word , that piously . Do you suppose our Admiral suggested it , or do you think the boys next door got it out of Webster to promote inter-service love ? " " Sh ! " said Basswall . " For God 's sake , boys ! They rank hell out of me . " " Poor old Basswall , " said Fareckson . " Always a bridgehead and never a bridge , " said Maydriss . " It 's a hell of a thin partition , " Bass-wall said . It was at this moment that Charlie Calthrop came in . Charlie is not a beautiful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rage . " Look ! " he cried , letting the screen door slam behind him . " By God , lookat my story now ! " He held out six sheets of typewritten paper . There was not one of them that did not have at least ten neatly cut holes in it . I had seen a good few censored articles , but none like this . " That , " he said , " is the work of Colonel Denvers . What in hell do I do with a thing like that ? " " Put it on the pianola , " said Honscoll . " It will either play ' Home , Sweet Home ' or ' Do n't Get Around Much Anymore ' . " " You think it 's funny , " said Calthrop . " I do n't . What do you propose to do about this , God damn it , Basswall ? " " Hey , take it easy , " said Basswall . " Take it easy ? " said Calthrop . " Listen , pal . I laid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it was O.K. I spend two days and three nights checking up on my material , and ruin my health . I brush the beetles off my typewriter and write the piece . I take it to Cladding . He says O.K. again . I leave it with him because in it I have to mention the God-damned Army . He sends it to Colonel Denvers . Denvers makes a lace doily out of it . What in hell do I do ? What can I do ? What can you write ? And every C.P.O. at the Casuals Camp knows the Westerly has been hit and I bet we ca n't say that either . " " We know where you 've been , " said Honscoll . " Did n't Denvers ever read that directive ? " asked Calthrop , ignoring Honscoll . " He read it , " said Basswall , " because I read it to him over the phone and sent him a copy . " " And does n't it specifically outlaw this sort of duplication of censorship ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calthrop . " Look at it . A good piece , full of news , and now it 's not worth putting on the wires . What the devil are you allowed to file from this stinking command ? " " Listen , " said Basswall . " I knew about this , Charlie . Cladding phoned me and told me . I called the Colonel . I reminded him about the directive , pointing out politely that it was from the Admiral . He threw his rank at me , just as he did with Cladding . What could I do ? We 're only lieutenants in the Navy and he 's a full colonel . He said you mentioned the tanks the boat carried and that the tanks were Army and he was n't going to let you write about that raid and mention tanks . " " Because the Japs do n't know we used tanks against them ? " asked Calthrop. flWhat a farce ! " " I 'll do what I can , " said Basswall . " But now it all has to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Army is technically in charge of this island . By the time this clears , if it ever does , your yarn will be cold goose , I 'm afraid . I 'm damn sorry . " " Sorry ! " cried Calthrop . " What good does your sorrow do me ? " " Take it easy , " said Maydriss . " It 's not Bass 's fault . " " Nuts ! " said Calthrop , and he went out of the little office , slamming the screen door behind him . " Damn , " said Basswall . " And I put him on to that story . " " Sure , sure , " said Maydriss . " Charlie 's just mad . He 's not mad at you , Bass . It 's just more TAFU . " The letters of that New Zealand expression stand ( approximately ) for Typical Army Fuss Up . " I 'll tell you , " Honscoll said . " And , gentlemen , you may have the privilege of quoting me directly . There 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big chaps in Washington sit down and decide what news is really worth in time of war . When they 've done that all this 'll stop , you mark my words . There 's no bloody use saying news is important unless you believe it . Unquote . " He reached down and lifted his typewriter off the floor and set it in front of him . " Now , " he said , " I shall do a spot of work . London waits breathless for me to speak . " " To-day ? " said Maydriss gently . " A story to-day ? " " This sort of thing flows out of me like from reporters in the movies , " Honscoll said . " I shall file it this afternoon , while all of you cheer . " " So ? " said Maydriss . " To-day , my unconscious Limey friend , is Good Friday . Radio Touebon , under the aegis of that unfighting Frenchman , Monsieur Haricot , is shut . To-morrow is Good Saturday , Sunday is Sunday and is Easter . Mondayis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sensitive instrument which can give out with the amazing volume of three thousand words a day for all the correspondents of this area , will accept your think-piece cheerfully on Tuesday at nine-thirty A.M if Monsieur Haricot is not delayed . Piously delayed , I should add . " " Good God ! " said Honscoll . " Is that true or are you pulling my leg ? " " It 's true , " said Basswall . " Who the devil runs this war ? " demanded Honscoll . " Monsieur Haricot , or the United States ? " " You sound like Calthrop , " said Fareckson . " I feel like him , " said Honscoll . " We are bothers under the skin . But it 's like I said . There 'll be TAFU till the boys at the top make up their minds that news really is a weapon of war . " He closed his typewriter slowly and sadly . As I had errands to do , I left then . But I did n't forget what Honscoll had said . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat that was to have taken me aboard broke down , and eventually I got out to the Las Vegas in one of the liberty boats from the naval landing . While I was waiting there , I fell into conversation with an older C.P.O. , the Quartermaster , and we introduced ourselves . His name was Alfred Lincoln , and he told me a good deal about the Las Vegas . He was proud of his ship , of its officers and crew . There were no officers going out on that boat . Chief Lincoln saw to it that my duffel bag was put aboard for me and he told me to stick with him . Being sober himself , I think he was sharply aware that most of the sailors on the landing had ( as the Irish put it ) drink taken . " Come up forward with me , sir , " he said . " You wo n't mind the boys , will you ? They 've had liberty , that 's all . " " Hell , no ! " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got aboard and sat forward on a pile of mail sacks , and the good lads piled on noisily . Among them was another Chief Petty Officer . I think he was the ugliest man I have ever seen , his face pock-marked , a huge scar twisting one corner of his lip into a permanent grin , his sandy eyebrows so long and thick and bushy that they looked artificial . He carried a bottle , and he was full of charm . " Hiya , Alfred , old cock-a-whoosis , " he called out , and he made his way heavily forward . " Outa my way , scum , " he said to the sailors . " I got ta get next to old man Lincoln , the uncle of his country , on account he needs a drink . " " Let ' er go , Chief , " they cried . " Gangway for the Chief . He 's carrying the stuff . " " Do n't none of you bastards trip me , " said the ugly man . " It would n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let ' im by ! " the sailors shouted , and they laughed , and so did the Chief . Finally he got forward and he sat down , very suddenly , next to me . " Whoopee ! " he said . " This , " said Lincoln , introducing me , " is our Chief Water Tender , Jim Droskin . " " Oh , yes , " I said , before I could help it . " Sure . " Chief Droskin looked at me . " You sound , " he said to me , " like you 'd a heard a me . " " Who has n't ? " called out one of the sailors . " Yes , " I said . " I did hear of you . " " Where away ? " said Droskin . " You came up for discussion this morning at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Mountain View House , " I said . There was a roar of laughter from all hands . The boat cast loose then and began its choppy progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Droskin . " Do n't believe it . What 'd you hear , paI ? Have a drink . " " No , thanks , " I said . " Your need is greater than mine . " " A pal ! " said Droskin , and he took a drink . " Have a pull , Alfred , old stepan-fetchit . You look sad , damn if you do n't . " " Had all I need , " said Lincoln , " Boy ! " said Droskin . " Two strikes . " He took another pull . " What 'd ja hear ? About me . At the morning retreat . " " Yeah , what did you hear ? " cried a sailor . " What 's new about the Chief ? " called out another . " Do n't mind them , sir , " said Lincoln . " They 're good boys . " " Do n't fret , " I said . " I was in the last war . " " Give , give ! " cried the boys . " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Droskin . " Lay off , " said Lincoln . " To hell with you , " said Droskin . " He 's my pal , and he 's going to tell me . " " All right , " I said . " I heard you were able to corral a beautiful French momma for your very own , and that on the island of Balade . And mostly white . " There was a howl of delight from the sailors . " Good old Droskin ! " the men cried . " What a man ! What a pan ! " You could see that Droskin was delighted . He beamed at me . " By God , " he said , " white ? After three weeks , coffee looks like cream here . Now you got ta have a drink . " I drank a little from the bottle he handed me and passed it back . " We 're pals , " Droskin said . " But they is going to have to close up that Mountain View House , it 's dangerous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you get aboard , you come aft , " he said to me . " You come aft to the C.P.O. 's room , you do it . We 'll make you damn well at home . Shake the teeth outa your head but we always got coffee . We always got something to eat . Never mind the officers . They 're the best damn officers on the best damn ship in the best damn navy in the world . But you stick with us . Come aft . And by God , pal , I 'll show you my new momma 's photograph . Burn you up . " " O.K. , " I said . " Thanks . I will come . " " You do that , sir , " said Lincoln . " You 'll be welcome . " " And they ai n't a man on this here boat who wo n't help you out and about , " said Droskin . " True or untrue ? " he demanded of the sailors . " True ! " they cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ship ! There she lays . Ai n't she lovely ? True or untrue ? " " True ! " they shouted again . We were circling in to the Las Vegas then , and they were right . She was a beautiful ship , with long , clean , fine lines . When we had made fast , they all went aboard , and the wonder of it was that they went steadily and quietly , and saluted the quarterdeck briskly and with gusto , and all their faces had changed , as though someone had switched off a happy light but had turned on pride in its stead . You can see , then , that I was off to a running start . To get a general idea of the functions and techniques of a cruiser which , together with a group of destroyers , accompanies an aircraft carrier to form a small task force is not difficult when all the officers aboard are as kind and patient in answering questions as were these on the Las Vegas . Even Lieutenant Commander Sisson , the Communications Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . But it was because I went aft to the C.P.O. 's room and drank coffee with them ( until I knew them all ) , and because the boys who had been on the liberty boat remembered me in a friendly fashion and introduced me to their friends , that I became aware of the rumors and their effect . The men conceived that ( being a correspondent ) I must know more than they did , and ( not being an officer ) would be likelier to tell of it , and certainly be easier to approach . It was the story of the Westerly that was troubling them . " What do you know ? " they 'd ask me . " Is it true she got hit ? " Or , " Where was she when she got it ? " I could see they did n't believe me when I said I knew less than they did . " She was with the Waco and the Paugatuck , and she had about ten or a dozen cans , " one man told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nettle is the code name for one of the islands near to the Japanese . " I do n't know , " I said . " I wish to hell you did , " he said . " Or someone . " You heard it everywhere . It was astonishing how it grew . They were wondering all the time what else had happened , what was being concealed from them . Even the C.P.O. 's were worried , though they discouraged talk of it . Youcan get an idea of how far it had gone from the conversation I overheard by the after 20-millimeter guns near the fantail . There were two men cleaning and oiling one of them . " I tell you , Henry , she went down , " said one , a fair-haired boy with a conceited face . " Nuts , " said Henry . " Jesus , George , you always got a lot of stuff to tell . " " I know it 's true , " said George . " How the hell d' ya know ? Did the communications boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . " They never give out with nothing . All they get is in code anyways . If you got ta know , I heard it from Semple , and he heard it up topside . " " Aah ! " said Henry . " Semple ! That 's good , that is . You hear it from a Goddamn mythologist , and you believe it ! " Mythologist is what they call a meteorologist . " Next you know , you 'll believe him about the weather . " " He heard it topside , " said George . " I tell ya , it 's true . If it was n't true , why in hell wouldn ' they leave us know ? " " I 'm tired of listening to the stuff you give , " said Henry , but I could feel that he was shaken , that he half believed it , and that it worried him as it had begun to worry many others of the crew . It worried me too . a little , and so I took it up with Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C.P.O. 's room aft . The vibration , as he had said , was terrific , for the room was near the stern and the Las Vegas was making tracks . There was no one in the room but us , and we had to shout to be heard over the rattle of coffee cups and the other incessant noises of a metal room shaken visibly . " You musta been sober , " he was saying . " Otherwise you would n't remember so damn good what went on on that liberty boat . " He grinned at me . " How about you ? " I said . " You seem to remember it . " " Who , me ? " he said , and laughed . " Listen , pal , old man Lincoln never gives me a chancet of forgetting it . He pours it into me , night and day . I awinost believe it myself now , I heard it so often . " " I guess you 'll survive it , " I said . " Sure , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny you can laugh at it twenty times a day , is they ? " " No , " I said . " That 's what bothers me about this rumor of the Westerly . " " Yeah , " said Droskin . " That 's bad scuttlebutt . It 's doing no good , in a hurry . I 've tried , and so have all the Chiefs , to stamp her down , but she grows up where you stamp . It had ought to be denied or confirmed , official , so we could be shet of it . " " It ought , " I said . " Listen , " he said . " You ai n't official . You got no rank to trouble you exceptin ' you eat in the wardroom . How well do you know Mr. Sisson ? Like him ? " " Yes , " I said . " I know him only fairly well . He seems to me damn intelligent . " " He 's a fine officer , " said Droskin . " Why n't you speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I meant to , but events moved too fast for me . What happened , as I gathered the story by little bits afterward , was this . The Waco , sister ship of the Westerly , and in the same task force off the island called Nettle , was hit by two shots from a Japanese cruiser . The Jap cruiser was part of a task force accompanying a convoy . The Waco , knowing that time was everything , sent a message in the clear  --  that is to say , not in code  --  giving the position of the Jap ships and stating that she was temporarily out of control , her rudder having been hit . Part of this message , relating that the Waco was seriously hit and by an enemy cruiser , was picked up by the sailors on duty in the communications section of the Las Vegas , then almost eight hundred miles away . As the message was not in code ( and they had had no specific instructions as to how to deal with such a contingency as regards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell of it . And they did so . The message came over at dawn . By eight o'clock everyone on board had heard it , though it had grown and was oddly garbled . I heard this garbled version first near the 1.1 guns . " Jesus , did ya hear about the Waco ? " one of the gunners asked me . " I heard something , " I said . " She 's sunk , " said he . " I did n't hear that , " . I said . " I- heard she was hit . " " She 's sunk , " he said . " Bloscowicz told me , and he 's communications . " " Gosh , " I said . I climbed down from the 1.1 's and went in search of Mr. Sisson . At the foot of the ladder was a young sailor named Costello . He was putting aluminum paint on some rust spots on a davit . " Did you hear it , sir ? " he said . " About the Waco and the Westerly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ? " I said . " The Waco 's sunk . The Westerly 's hit bad , again , and they say the Paugatuck 's gone and some of the cans . " " I do n't believe it , " I said . " It 's what I heard , " he said . I went forward to the wardroom , but it was deserted except for the stewards . I left , deciding to go up on the bridge and find out about this . On my way up I ran into Frester , one of the radio boys . " Gawd , " he said , " I guess we 're on our way up now . " " Up where ? " I said . " Nettle , " he said . " My gosh , they 've sunk all three of them cruisers and I hear the most of the destroyers is hit bad . Anyway , what can they do against cruisers ? And what in hell is happening to the transports was with that force ? " " It 's scuttlebutt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our force . " " Hell , no , " he said .

" " Not now , " he said . " It was , first off about the Westerly , but it ai n't now . " I started up for the bridge again . As I did so , they began target practice , shooting the 5-inch guns at smoke pots dropped into the water by planes . I put cotton in my ears and went up to watch . When that was over a torpedo plane from the carrier towed a sleeve back and forth over our task force , and all the ships practiced shooting it down with 20-millimeters and 1.1 's . There was no time to ask questions . Everyone was too busy , and there was far too much noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , pulling the cotton out of my ears , when I heard the loudspeaker click on , and the bosun 's pipe sound over it . " Listen to this , " said Commander Carter , the Gunnery Officer , who stood beside me . " This is Sisson 's new idea . And the skipper let him try it . " " Attention ! " said the loudspeaker . " Attention ! " Forward of me , in their circular station . the sailors on that constant watch they keep , swung in their swivel chairs , binoculars to their eyes . But you could detect a difference in their pose . They were listening . Below me ( for I could see a great deal of the vessel from my vantage point ) those who had been busying about stood still or moved very slowly , one ear cocked toward the nearest loudspeaker . " We arc beginning to-day , " said the pleasant and recognizable voice of Mr. Sisson , " a regular feature . It will be a noon broadcast of news to supplement your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these broadcasts a little more than is permitted to be printed , for you will realize that the Trans-Radio sheet goes to many people on land as well as at sea . Remember , each day at noon , or as near noon as conditions permit , we are going to bring you the latest hot news ? or as hot as we can get it and serve it . Like lots of things you see and hear on board this ship , this news is for you and not for the shore . You are getting inside dope . This first time , there is not much news . " To begin with , then , let me tell you that we have received a fine report from that altogether reliable source , Mr. Tomakizu Hori , spokesman for the Japanese Board of Information . Mr. Hori says ( I quote ) : ' We must counter the American methods of fighting even if our men have to resort to vile and dishonorable methods to do so . The American people have no spirit of sportsmanship and fight like wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought you 'd be glad to know this . You might tell the Marines . " In a very recent engagement north of our present position one of our cruisers received two hits . She and the other members of her task force had run into a Jap force attempting to supply one of their bases . One Japanese cruiser has been sunk , one badly damaged , one transport sunk , two damaged , one destroyer set afire , and the Jap force has fled to the north . Our cruiser has temporarily repaired her damage and rejoined her force . Another of our cruisers of that same force had also suffered a near miss , ten days previously , by a bomb , but the damage was slight and to her superstructure , and was adequately repaired at sca . Casualties were light . As so many times before , we have sunk two Jap vessels , damaged four , at a total cost to us of two hits , neither fatal , to one American warship . Let 's keep it up . " In closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the Japanese in their latest report of last week 's action , they have sunk or damaged thirty-two of our transports while downing one hundred and seventy-five planes . I have made a careful tabulation of all Japanese claims to date and regret to report to you that the entire United States Navy now consists in minus one hundred and ten ships . We are , therefore , at the bottom of the sea . How do you Iike it down here ? " That is all . Next broadcast to-morrow at noon . " " Well ? " said the Gunnery Officer . " What do you think ? " " Good 1 " I said . " Damn good . And high time , I 'd judge . " " You 'd judge right , " he said . It was the next day , about eleven forty-five , that I walked aft in the bright , hot sunshine , and stood near the fantail again . The boys were busy cleaning the 20-millimeters and loading the drums , for we had had firing practice again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was watching the planes being taken aboard the Superior . There were very few waved off now for a faulty approach , though when we had begun our cruise a lot of them had had to take two or three shots at it . Presently I became aware that George , the blond boy with the conceited face , was having words with his partner , Henry . " So what ? So what ? " said Henry . " Get the rags and use your feet , feller , and save your mouth for all the eating you do with it . " " Is that so ? " said George . He threw a piece of waste down hard on the deck and stalked off forward . After a minute , I moved over and stood near Henry . " Good morning , sir , " said Henry , very cheerfully . " Hello , " I said . " How goes it ? " " Good , " he said . " Good . " " Your boy friend seems peeved , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's mad because I piped him down . He gives out with too much of the bilge he hears around , and he do n't know what the hell he 's talking about . " " Nobody likes to be piped down , I guess , " I said . " No , " he said . " But , God , it had to come some time with that lug . He 's O.K. He just uses his mouth when he ought to rest it and give his ears a chance . We shot good , didn ' we ? " " Yes , " I said . " It was good . " " Did you notice that second sleeve , " said Henry , " the one that . . " The loudspeaker clicked on , and the bosun 's pipe sounded , stopping Henry instantly in the midst of his sentence . " Attention ! " came Mr. Sisson 's voice . " Attention ! This is the noon broadcast of inside news . " " I hope to Jesus George is listening , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlie Calthrop and of what Honscoll had said , and I was happy , too  --  for the Las Vegas  --  though I was wondering about the larger field . PERCEPTION RUTH LOIS SIMONDS ERE at the winter window if you stand Quiet , the house behind you , people near As touch through darkness should you reach your hand , Back to the fire  --  the silences of snow Will fall before you , clean against your eyes . You will feel frost . Reason you could not know Spreads flat before you , infinite and clear . Thus at the pane , lonely though not alone , In the forsaken field perception lies , Freezing to fear the marrow of your bone .
