MISS MARY ELIZABETH COGDAL had been in the Presbyterian mission near the Old South Gate of Shanghai for some years when I was born , so I have no clear recollection of our first meeting . But she may have remembered it . For legend has it that she bent over my crib , pursed her lips , and said , " Well , they always come that way . " Miss Cogdal was born on a farm in Illinois and later moved to Kansas . She knew the earth and was familiar with horses ; no better preparation has yet been devised for a missionary . Somewhere in her past lay a romance . We never heard much about it , but it hovered there in the background ? the young lover dead , the girl turning all her passion to teaching . I always gathered that it was the unreliable conduct of this young fellow which made Miss Cogdal into a militant feminist who began to teach in a country school at the age of sixteen . From that day to her death she declared herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be got around by any fairly subtle male . All her life Miss Cogdal was a little slow in paying attention to anyone , and the Lord was unable to get through His Call to her until she was in her middle twenties . After making herself acceptable to the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions , Miss Cogdal , still paying no attenlion to anyone , started putting her affairs in order . Knowing in her own mind that life in China would hold no luxuries and that she was on the point of renouncing the world , she gave away all her possessions . When she buckled the strap on her one suitcase , it contained two changes of nunlike garments , her Bible , one knife , one fork , and one spoon . The last three items were to see her through her apprenticeship with chopsticks , and then they too were to be cast aside . Hcr clear voice always broke into notes of bassoonlike laughter when she told of the other ladies of the South Gate mission eagerly waiting to see the latest nineties fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rustling black creation of her own design . Miss Cogdal 's establishment never quite lost its original nakedness . " Why should people worry about their houses , " she would ask , " when half the children in China have n't clothes to their backs ? " And then she would sweep out and clap a garment on the next child she met . Miss COGDAL came to grips with South Gate immediately . Starting with a private teacher , she soon acquired a hold on Chinesc which remained a curious delight to all who heard her speak . Then she turned her attention to the mission 's school for girls . The principal of the Girls ' School at that time was an Englishwoman who did not like cucumbers . Miss Cogdal doted on cucumbers . She and the Englishwoman ate their meals together . Whenever cucumbers appeared on the table the Englishwoman snatched up the dish , rushed it out to the kitchen , and hurled the cucumbers into the garbage pail . At the end of six months Miss Cog-dal became principal of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her tastes . The Englishwoman disposed of Miss Cogdal turned to the girls . She was offended by them . They were apathetic , thin , flabby , delicate , finicky ? in short , they had not grown up on a Kansas farm . Miss Cogdal went about getting what she could to take its place . She drew up a stiff regimen of physical training for all the girls . The girls shuddered ; the girls ' parents shuddered . One did not go in for flinging the body about wildly in China . Miss Cogdal stood firm for flinging the body about . Then the Orientals outsmarted themselves . Smiling up their sleeves , they said that everything would be fine if ? and they thought it was an insuperable if ? the foreign teacher did the same exercises . Miss Cogdal was shocked . " Of course I 'm going to do them , " she replied . " How do you think they 'll learn if I do n't teach them ? " The Chinese had been had , though Miss Cogdal went on blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Not only did Miss Cogdal do her calisthenics ; she started her own vegetable garden to get more exercise by spading , hoeing , and weeding . . When the girls saw this they knew that the world had come to an end . And , indeed , that world had come to an end . In her own way Miss Cogdal set a good pace for the emancipation of Chinese women . Her pupils soon adored her to the point of imitation . She had large feet , so the Chinese girls began to frown on bound feet . She was vigorous and athletic . Her most daring advance was made late in the twenties . The short-hair question was agitating the councils of the church in those years . If it had been anyone but St. Paul who had laiddown those absurd injunctions , Miss Cogdai might have conformed . But she got to thinking about Paul , who was after all a mere man , and she decided that he had n't known his own mind . While everyone else was debating whether or not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cogdal took a streetcar into Shanghai . She went to no beauty parlor , for this was not a move of vanity . She went to an ordinary barber shop and demanded that her hair be cut exactly like a man 's . She thought of this , I am sure , as the most humiliating method she could follow . On her return the station gulped collectively . Miss Cogdal was very calm . " It feels better , " she said ; " it 's more convenient and it saves time . " The station hastily decided that Miss Cogdal would not go to hell , and the next day the braids in the Girls ' School began to fall . Ironically , this haircut was the most beautifying thing Miss Cogdal could have done to herself . Big-boned , with great hands and feet , she had sensibly never gone in for frilly clothes or flower patterns , but the hair drawn back into a knob at the back of her head had always looked a little silly . Now , in her sixties , the close-cropped graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her austerely cut suits and dresses she could have stalked into any of Shanghai 's more sophisticated spots and been accepted as a distinguished woman of the world . This , in fact , was just what she was . y RT underneath it all there seethed a great unrest . At the risk of appearing old-fashioned in my psychology , I think she wanted children . She may have wanted a man , but I doubt it , unless it could have been for the pleasure of hitting him over the head and plucking out his hair . She used to come and look at my sister and me when we were still small . Gingerly she held us in her arms . But at the first squawk , the first dampness of the diaper , she jumped up , thrust the infant back , and declaimed , " Let them as wants babies have ' em . I do n't ! " She came back to the nursery time and again . Eventually she experimented with vicarious motherhood and took under her guardianship an ugly duckling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for her education , and even stooped to finding her a husband . This experiment was not a great success , since the husband turned out to be an opium addict and the girl not altogether grateful . Her second daughter was more satisfactory . Miss Cogdal spotted her among the alley brats of Mulberry Lane , opposite the mission compound ? a dirty little girl of three living with her newly widowed father and five or six other ricksha coolies . Miss Cogdal offered to take the girl and rear her . The father was glad to be rid of his daughter , so Miss Cogdal bundled her over to our house , where she and Mother filled a bathtub and stripped the child of her rags . They scrubbed the skin off her , using tub after tub of water and ignoring the girl 's screams . Satisfied at last , Miss Cogdal thrust her into some clean clothes and took her to the school dormitory . Next morning she was gone . Miss Cog-dal strode to the hovel in Mulberry Lane , turned down the filthy bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face tear-stained . Without hesitation Miss Cogdal snatched her up and , her own eyes brimful of tears as the girl fought and wept , bore her back to cleanliness . After that she stayed . As she grew up , a completely undemonstrative tie was formed between the two self-willed and determined women , a tie which was closer than Miss Cogdal normally came to sentiment . Her unrest had some sportive manifestations . It was a fine scene of a moonlit night to see Miss Cogdal , long-sleeved nightgown whipping about her , stride back and forth on the upstairs veranda of her house as she walked in a nightmare , waving her arms about as she shouted " Help ! Murder ! 0 Lord , 0 Lord ! " until someone led her back to bed . For no known reason this convinced her she was a light sleeper , and she refused to lock her house until a thief got in one night and rifled her bedroom successfully . There were other nights when Miss Cogdal did no sleeping at all . If she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader ? she sat up with it until half an hour before breakfast . Then she would fill her bath with cold water , leap into it , come out refreshed , dress , go down to breakfast , and appear at school to lecture the girls on the necessity of regular habits . I wish I knew more about her reading . I know that it followed no plan , that she had spells when she read magazines , novels , biographies , and murder stories ? apything she could lay hands on . It would , I am certain , make an interesting list . When I came back from boarding school one vacation , Miss Cogdal asked me what we were studying . After I had said something about European history of the seventeenth century she remarked , " I know a book you would like , and it would do you a lot more good than any history text . It 's called The Letters of Madame de Sim:gni . " Kansas ? South Gate ? Mary Elizabeth Cogdal ; Paris ? Louis QuatorzeMarie de Rabutin-Chantal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , but I can not complete the charm , though I remember her recommending to me Tom Jones and Barry Lyndon . When somnambulism and reading failed to release her , she required physical expression . After one station meeting which handed down a number of Pauline rulings , she went home and dragged out a heavy log from her woodpile . Taking the outside coolie 's axe , she savagely smashed the log into tiny chips before going in to eat her supper . Another time she reacted with an even finer sense of violence . What we referred to as the Q Trial provoked her . The Q 's were two sisters who made so much trouble in the mission that their dismissal was considered . The investigating commission was presided over by a man , a non-South Gater : two bad mistakes from Miss Cogdal 's point of view . Not only was the creature a man , he was a small man , about half Miss Cogdal 's height . The insolence of this male midget 's sitting in judgment on not just one woman but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do battle against him . She won , as South Gate knew she would . But when the trial was over ? and it dragged on for days ? Miss Cogdal was still not satisfied . That night , as she combed her hair before going to bed , her pent fury swept over her . Stubbornly setting her jaw , she grasped the heavy comb and , slowly and relentlessly , one by one she broke out all its teeth . The upshot of the Q Trial was that Miss Cogdal had to go safe-conduct for one of the sisters and live with her . Her defense of this woman had not been made because she liked her . In fact , she did n't especially , but she took up the cross good-humoredly and laughed when the Chinese pastor said the two of them were just like man and wife : they fought for and with each other . LIE in 1918 Miss Cogdal was practically incapacitated by sprue , and I was not doing too well either . A dictionary will observe airily that sprue is a tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enteritis . In the same lexical tone , the dictionary will note that asthma is a disease of respiration , characterized by difficult breathing , cough , etc . Neither definition is even suggestive of these two tortures . Everyone at South Gate got the idea about the same time . Miss Cogdal , going on fifty-five , was ill and should go to the mountains for a rest . I , going on six , was ill and should go to the mountains for a rest . Argal , Miss Cogdal and I went to the mountains for a rest early in 1919 . This is a Presbyterian syllogism . My sister was trundled off with us , and a green amah and Miss Cogdal 's cook completed our party . The trip up the Yangtze to Kiukiang by boat and then into Kuling Valley by sedan chair did not improve anybody 's health . My sister was acutely homesick , but she had been told not to make me unhappy , so she mooned around , lips clamped , looking like Niobe suddenly gone dry . Miss Cogdal suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowels of the boat , the amah was river-sick . I viewed it all impartially . At the age of four and a half , during an attack of amoebic dysentery , I had overheard the doctor saying to Mother that he did n't think I was going to live . This is a mistake doctors often make with our family , but I did n't know this at the time , and I was so invigorated at the thought of beating the rest to heaven that I got well in a few weeks . But whenever things got very hectic I assumed the doctor had been right , and I leaned back , waiting for death to remove me . I leaned back most of the journey to Killing , wondering if the rites of burial at sea were effective on a river . ONCE we had arrived safely in Kuling , Miss Cogdal got down to curing her sprue and knocking us into shape . We spent our mornings at a small American school . In the afternoons Miss Cogdal took over . One of our daily tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted the letter in pencil . Miss Cogdal edited . We made a second copy in ink just to limber our fingers . Miss Cogdal. read proof . At last we got a fair sheet of paper and transcribed our final copies . It took me a month or so to adapt myself to Miss Cogdal 's epistolary style . Frequently during that period my first draft contained some such statement as " Auntie Cogdal beat me this afternoon until I cried . " On coming to this in her editorial capacity , Miss Cogdal would look up and fix me with a not unhumorous eye . Rapping my fingers with her pencil , she would say , " Boy , tell the whole truth . " My revision would come out on a piece of scratch paper : " The cook called me a bad name so I threw a mud pye at him and Auntie Cogdal gave me five wacks when I cried to make her stop . " Miss Cogdal 's eye would brighten at this as she corrected " pye " and " wacks . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would twist a bit , take back the scratch paper , and emend to " After I called the cook a bad name this afternoon he called me one so I threw a mud pie at him and Auntie Cogdal gave me five whacks when I cried to make her stop . It did nt hurt . " Miss Cogdal would insert the apostrophe , smile at me , and say , " All right , and while you 're copying that , I 'll just step out to the kitchen for a few minutes . " By the end of four weeks I developed a satisfactory method and was even guilty of things like " I was a bad boy this afternoon but Auntie Cogdal was very nice and just gave me five whacks . " Miss Cogdal also left her marks on my speech . Not a very advanced conversationalist at that age , I nevertheless enjoyed talking . When I got hold of something to tell I tried to say it all at once and interrupted my own sentences , backtracked , leaped ahead , and generally made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of listening to me , Miss Cogdal pulled me up short one day in the midst of a long backwards harangue and said , " Form your sentences in your mind , boy . Speak them clearly . Then close your mouth . " Not bad precepts , though for some time my conversation was rather halting as I formed a sentence in my mind , spoke it clearly , then closed my mouth and began forming another sentence in my mind , only to discover when I was ready to speak it clearly that I had lost the floor to Auntie Cogdal . What with her belief in exercise , Miss Cogdal took us for long walks . It is not too strenuous to take a long walk with a victim of chronic enteritis ; even so , we thought some of the hikes a bit too much , and one day we took Miss Cogdal for a walk . Pretending that a mountain gully was a path , we started up . Miss Cogdal was not a graceful rock-climber , and by keeping about fifty yards ahead of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She played the game well , congratulating us on the trip , and never after insisted that we go any farther than we wished . The sprue inspired a thoroughly perverse game we invented . It can be appreciated only by a child raised by the canal that bordered the mission compound , and all delicate readers are advised to skip this paragraph , for it reveals only the bad effects of living in a country which does not consider comment on bodily functions very bad taste . Miss Cogdal 's bedroom and the dining room had originally been one large room . The wooden partition , thrown up in casual Chinese fashion , ended in the middle of a window and was a foot short to let one get at the latch . When Miss Cogdal was audibly in the throes of her suffering we liked to thrust our heads around the end of the partition and shout " Boo ! " Miss Cogdal , enthroned , would look at us calmly and say , " All right , children , pull your heads back in . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we drew back , her great laugh came crashing against the partition . admit there is a very canalish touch to this , but the real point is that Miss Cogdal thought it was just as funny as we did . rTHE series of events which convinced A me that Miss Cogdal was one of the superior women of her day reached its climax slowly . My first-grade teacher was reasonably competent , but she was a trifle frail in a Victorian way . One hot spring morning she was standing by the blackboard demonstrating that two plus two equal four . As we concentrated on this problem she suddenly wheeled towards the door , said " Oh , my God ! " and collapsed on the sill . A few of us ran to her , and then I , putting two and two together in my own Presbyterian arithmetic , went into the other classroom , where my sister 's class worked . The teacher looked up as I entered , and I said to her firmly , " Our teacher has just said a bad word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very satisfactory , and the first and second grades spent the rest of the morning in the playground . The next day we had a substitute , a missionary mother whose ideas on education were decidedly embryonic . Her first question was " Can anyone here count up to a hundred without making a mistake ? " I put up my hand and volunteered . " Go ahead , " she ordered . Wondering at this elementary task , I set out toward a hundred , galloping through the twenties , thirties , and forties , droning on into the fifties , sixties , seventies , and then rattling off the rest at breakneck speed . " Very good , " the substitute said . " You are a well-educated boy . " I thanked her , and she started around the class , asking each member to count to a hundred . As it happened , no one else was able to ; so for the next week the first grade was taught to count to a hundred . This was done by the chorus method . Obviously there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chorus automatically . Therefore I sat twirling my glasses in my hand and pondered the meaning of life . On Friday of that week I twirled my glasses once too often : a temple snapped , and the chorus was hushed . The substitute came over to my desk . " What have you done ? " she asked . " I 've just broken my glasses , " I said . " Can you read without them ? " she demanded . " No , " I said , although this was not strictly true . " Then there 's no use your staying the rest of the morning , " she told me . This I could n't understand , since reciting to a hundred did not demand very keen eyesight . But I kept my mouth shut and got up to go . " You are , " the substitute said , " a wicked , bad boy to break your glasses . When you get home you must get on your knees and ask God to forgive you . " Until this moment I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I walked reluctantly back to the house , for if the substitute thought I had sinned , probably Miss Cogdal would think so too . Unwillingly I went through the door . Miss Cogdal looked up from the book she was reading at her desk . " Why are you back so early ? " she asked . " Is anything the matter ? " " Yes , " I said bravely . " I was twirling my glasses in school while we counted to a hundred and I broke a temple . The teacher sent me home and said I must pray to God on my knees to be forgiven for this sin . " Miss Cogdal 's head jerked back . Her deep brown eyes flashed . " Are you telling the truth ? " " Yes , " I said . She took a deep breath , looked in my eyes , and saw that for once the truth was in me . Then she jumped up , book in hand , raised her arm , and with a wild shout of " Sin ! " hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly , and down she flung it again to another magnificently bellowed " Sin ! " Thoroughly frightened , I asked , " Should I get down and pray right away ? " Miss Cogdal relaxed . Her eyes filled with tears , and for the only time I can remember she put her arm around me . " My dear boy , " she said , " if we pray for anything we will pray for that idiot woman 's soul . " She grinned , and I felt much better . " She 's not a Presbyterian , " Miss Cogdal chuckled , and then grew sternagain as she added , " but that 's no excuse . " Turning her eyes full on me she continued , " It is the silliest thing in the world to pray to God over nothing . You have n't sinned . No one your age really can sin . And remember this : when you break a thing , when you make a mistake , never , never get down on your knees and whine about it . Just get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she let go of me to smack her fist down on the desk . Her eyes lit up . " The Bible says , John , that you 're in danger of hell-fire if you call your brother a fool . " She hesitated . " Well , I wo n't call that woman a fool . No , I wo n't ? she is n't worth it . " I had gathered by this time that Miss Cogdal was on my side . She smiled at me and said , " Now you may play for the rest of the morning , and when your sister gets back and we 've had tiffin , we 'll all go down to the Gap and have your glasses mended . " The Gap was the name given the village in the pass at the head of Kuling Valley . The three of us set out on this unusual expedition in high spirits . Miss Cogdal was quite as excited over this irregularity as we were , and that may have been the cause of her accident . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Instead of wearing the regulation two petticoats and an underskirt , she was in the habit of breezing about with just a pair of voluminous black bloomers under her walking skirt . We got the glasses fixed and set out to see the sights on the Gap 's one street . Somewhere on this journey the elastic of Miss Cogdal 's bloomers gave way . My sister and I , afraid to say anything , saw what was coming . Down , down , down came the bloomers below the hem of Miss Cogdal 's walking skirt . We looked at them , hypnotized . Miss Cogdal finally noticed that we were staring at her . " What 's the matter , children ? " she demanded . My sister pointed feebly and quavered , " Auntie Cogdal , your bloomers . " Miss Cogdal looked down . With a snort that brought everyone 's eyes on her , she bent over , grasped one leg of the garment and stepped out of it , then balanced and pulled off the other leg . Rocking with laughter , site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them carefully and stuffing them into her reticule . She smiled at the Chinese audience which had gathered . " There , " she said , " we can go on now . " After a few paces she hitched up her skirt and commented , " I wonder why that never happened before . You know , it 's a lot more comfortable this way . " My sister and I looked at each other , eyes wide in admiration of such aplomb . Was this not a wonderful woman ? we asked ourselves ; and we agreed that she was . III IN THE years following our stay at Kuling Miss Cogdal returned to her teaching at South Gate . I know little of this part of her life save that she won the unfailing tribute of a great teacher : the personal affection and respect of her best students . If her methods were similar to those she had used on me , I have no difficulty in understanding her pupils ' devotion . One thing which surely characterized everything she did in and out of the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one occasion a pupil told her that angleworms made noises ? " talked , " as she said . " Tommyrot , " Miss Cogdal replied , or at least its Chinese equivalent , " I 'll eat the first one I hear talking . " After the next rain the girl called Miss Cogdal out to listen to the worms . Miss Cogdal put her ear to the ground . She heard something . Getting a trowel , she dug in and brought up some angleworms . According to my story she ate them . Others say this was the only time in her life that she broke her word . My own contacts with Miss Cogdal during this period came from ours being the one really normal household in South Gate and from her delight in the game of rook . She was fond of normality and incurably addicted to rook , though I imagine that she learned to play the game only after coming to South Gate . Certainly her original suitcase had not held a deck of cards . Rook leads you temptingly on to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . The winner of the bid has the privilege of picking up a four-card kitty and then discarding four cards from his hand before naming the trump . It was this kitty which was Miss Cogdal 's undoing in a rook game . To have four accessible cards face down on the table so aroused her curiosity that she often had to be reminded that the bid could not go above the maximum number of points which could be won in a single hand . Her desire to hold the unknown led her time and again into overreaching herself , whereupon she would go set in a dazzling collapse , revealing as the cards were played that from the very beginning she had not held a single quick trick . Possibly this accounted for the reluctance of some of the more conventional South Gaters to have her for a partner . For my sister and me , when we played a hand in co-operation , she was ideal . She usually took the bidding away from us , but when it came to playing out the hand ? there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into long huddles of whisperings . If we failed to reach an agreement , I would peek into the hand on our right and my sister would do the same for the one on our left . Auntie Cogdal gazed over our heads and launched into an interesting tale for the benefit of our opponents . The three of us made an almost unbeatable combination when Miss Cogdal curbed her curiosity over the kitty . At times she trumped our tricks , but no one cared , least of all the two of us . And I think she enjoyed playing with us as much as we enjoyed her , for when she was paired off with one of South Gate 's Mrs. Battles she realized too late always that she had put her partner into a bad hole and felt compelled to say loudly , " Pm a goose , a perfect goose , I know . But those four cards face down there are just too tantalizing . " Her partner would look acidly in Miss Cogdal 's direction , but Miss Cog-dal often failed to recognize acid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted her . On the whole , I think that I prefer Miss Cogdal 's type of game to Mrs. Battle 's , for I share with Auntie Cogdal the unusual view that games are meant for entertainment . Though Mrs. Battle may have been the soul of whist , Miss Cogdal was the very heart of rook. went off to boarding school I saw Miss Cogdal only during vacations . One Christmas I came down with asthma , and Miss Cogdal , knowing that I would be upset by missing our annual Christmas Eve dinner at the home of some friends , brought all her gifts up to my bedroom and spent the evening with me . Her gifts were characteristic . A woman who spent almost nothing on herself , Miss Cogdal gave the best of everything to her friends , and what she would have considered mildly sinful to own herself she happily thrust into the hands of another . That evening as I gasped and coughed between my jerky sentences ? with plenty of time to form them in my mind ? she sat wrapping her presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud pies , my glasses , her bloomers . She shook her cropped head and laughed until she was in almost as bad shape as I was . But then she asked me with a tremor in her voice , " Do you think I did a good job ? Was I all right for a mother ? " I was fourteen at the time , an age which does not lend itself to easy expression of sentiment ; but I was able to catch my breath firmly for an instant and , with no need to form my sentences , I assured her that she had been all right , that she was marvelous , and that my sister and I adored her . I wonder if she had ever been praised to her face before . Her brown eyes grew luminous and her features softened . The next breath I went into a coughing fit . " Good Heavens , boy ! " she exclaimed . " There 's no need to choke yourself to death flattering an old woman . " " Who ? said ? old ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life I heard Miss Cogdal giggle . It was not a silly giggle ; it was a flight of full-throated meadow larks rising at sundown . When she left that evening , Miss Cogdal turned at the door . " I 've always thought it was a pity you had to be a boy , " she said , " but now I 'm not so sure . " T SCARCELY know what more I can say of her . She herself would think that I had already said too much , that if I really had to write a book about South Gate I ought to concentrate on the interestingpeople , the Chinese , though Miss Cogdal never found the Chinese very puzzling2 for she met them all on a basis of complete equality . She had no unctuous condescension in her , none of the superior laughter which shrills through many an Old China Hand 's remarks on the quaintness , the oddity , the weirdness ( all meaning the inferiority ) of the Chinese . I believe the only thing that ever angered her from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a man or a woman . To Miss Cogdal nothing was weird , odd , or quaint simply because it was not Kansas . She never confused difference in manner with difference in quality . She was that rarest of foreigners in China , one who accepted unconsciously the right of the Chinese to think , to act , to be human beings . She accepted everything until Kansas common sense told her something was wrong , and once she was convinced a thing was wrong she flew to remedy it , not with superior cluckings and shakes of the head , but with a clean heart and an impassioned spirit . There was no studied policy in this acceptance . Miss Cogdal was incapable of either forming or following a policy . She had no systematic knowledge of Chinese art , but she did not sniff with supercilious amusement at paintings which lacked Western perspective . She knew little of Chinese literature , but she never sneered at things she did not understand . Perhaps the best way to describe her attitude ? which was not really an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese to Miss Cogdal ; the Chinese were honestto-God people . When the Girls ' School was turned over to a new principal Miss Cogdal had the good sense to leave the compound . She was not going to get in anyone 's way . With a friend she made a home in the International Settlement , where she created a job for herself by keeping in touch with her former pupils , who were to her her own children , devoting her waning strength to helping them in every way she could . Not entirely satisfied with this , she , who had shaped a great school , did some teaching in a small struggling school in the city . In 1932 the Japanese swept over that part of the city . Some of her girls were killed in the streets , some were subjected to indignities , others were able to flee . This barbarism threw Miss Cogdal into a frenzy . Back at South Gate , where she herself had had to seek refuge , she could not sleep for thinking of the outrages being committed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept down on the Japanese . Exposing herself to scorn and insult , she did all she could to get the Chinese and their possessions out of the rioting district . The Japanese soldiers were , after all , men ? and small ones . When the temporary peace was arranged she went back to her home in the city . Only then did she learn that she had developed Hodgkin 's disease . After reading all the literature she could find on it and learning that her condition was incurable , she refused to leave China . Instead , she went to a hospital for a few weeks , but finally returned to her own bed . Hodgkin 's disease is a degeneration of the lymphatics . In its latter stages the victim may suffer a complete agony of the body . Miss Cogdal was no pale and resigned martyr . Exhausted and gaunt , weeping over a wounded China , she was uninterested in dying a nobly restrained death . If she was to die , she was to die , and the quicker the better . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and again , " How long , 0 Lord , how long ? " After five hours of unconsciousness this great-hearted pioneer woman died . During the last decade or so a hot controversy on the value of foreign missions has burned . At times I have found myself in sympathy with the more severe critics , but always at some point I stop . The case for foreign missions is entirely Mary Elizabeth Cogdal 's case .
