Biggest challenge to OPA 's new get-tough enforcement program is neither the tire bootlegger nor the gas-coupon clipper but the widespread evasion of controls on rent . OPA last week swung one of its hardest punches , ordered rents reduced and stabilized on Oct. 1 in 54 more defense-rental areas scattered across the whole country , bringing under federal rent control areas where a total of 50,000,000 people live . In 53 of these areas rents are cut back to March i levels ; in the 54th ( Chateau , Okla. ) the ceiling is based on the preceding October . <P> Black rent might some day be the " sick chicken " * threatening the whole existence of OPA . Unlike most other ceiling-price violators , landlords fight back , make the direct accusation in court that the price-control act is unconstitutional . OPA remembers what happened to NRA when the Supreme Court decided the same issue . <P> Five rent-control cases , which went into special three-judge Federal courts because they involved constitutionality , have been fought through successfully by tough little Talbot Smith , OPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bend , two in Mobile , one in Wichita-but though widely separated on the map , all the cases were curiously alike in their defense-arguing that the act delegated legislative powers to a Governmental agency which should be exercised specifically by Congress . OPA 's Lawyer Brunson MacChesney , chief of the compliance section , thinks the similarity no coincidence , believes there exists an organized resistance to rent ceilings . <P> <P> * NRA charged the Schechter Bros , of Brooklyn with selling unfit poultry and otherwise breaking the Live Poultry Code ; in 1935 the Supreme Court 's decision on this famed test case made the Blue Eagle a very dead bird .
