txt Having for years admired the spirit of fairness which seemed to me to inspire your treatment of the news , I have been troubled by several instances recently in which I felt that , dut to an omission , the impression made was not fair . I refer to your accounts of a number of sea rescues and , in particular , to the half column in the issue of Nov. 24 headed " Army Men Hailed for Sea Rescues . " In each case you have referred to the rescuers as " crews of Army transports . " Not once have you mentioned the fact that these men were actually all merchant seamen , temporarily and voluntarily in government service , something it is safe to assume very few readers would know . Whenever anything occurs which might invite public censure , such as the refusal to unload the ship at Marseille , the papers make it plain that those involved belong to our merchant marine . Would it be no more than simple justice , then , that the truth cort cerning their heroic accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be clearly ; presented too ?
