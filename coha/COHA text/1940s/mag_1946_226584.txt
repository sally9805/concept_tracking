COMPANIONS OF THE LEFT HAND ( 338 pp. ) - George Tabori-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> Hungarian-born George Tabori , 32 , is almost unknown as a novelist . Educated in Germany , trained as a journalist in the Balkans and the Middle East , he now lives in England , has worked for the BBC since 1943 . Companions of the Left Hand , * his second novel ( the first : Beneath the Stone , 1945 ) , is a sardonic political parable , overwritten in spots , preachy in others , but crafty , speculative and Koestler-like in its ambiguities and undertones . <P> In outline , the story resembles Thomas Mann 's Death in Venice : an aging writer goes down to the Italian seaside to rest in the sun . Tabori takes this theme , twists it around to fit a modern situation and his own ends . The aging writer is Stefan Farkas , noted Hungarian dramatist . His train reaches San Fernando one day in the summer of 1943 . He has been told that San Fernando will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacation and a rest . The war has made him nervous . <P> Nazis &; Fascists . The Fascist station master greets him : " Ah , Signor Farkas , welcome . " At the Hotel Paradiso , the manager bows and scrapes . Three Nazi officers staying at the Paradiso are impressed , try to make conversation . " Herr Farkas , " says one , " my wife has just written me . She went to see a play of yours . In Dresden . She enjoyed it tremendously . " Farkas stares , smiles coldly , answers in French . He has no love for Nazis or for Fascists . <P> Or for Communists , either . He meets an Italian in San Fernando who talks like a Communist . " I knew Trotsky in Vienna , " Farkas tells him ; " I did n't like his accent and the way he played chess . I regard Communists with the same suspicion as Jesuits . " Farkas laughs , takes off his monocle and wipes it with his silk handkerchief . The Italian seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendly , good-humored world he has always known . The Italian reminds him that such a world no longer exists , that for some people it never existed . Farkas shrugs his shoulders , smokes his cigar , drinks the rich local red wine . <P> When the news of Italy 's surrender finally comes , San Fernando celebrates . Farkas ' Italian friend is in fact a Communist , and sets up shop as the local commissar . Rumors fly fast : Mussolini has killed himself ; Hitler has taken poison ; the British will arrive any minute , accompanied by the Chief Rabbi of London and the entire Navy . San Fernando strings up a few Fascists , hangs out homemade Allied flags , dances in the streets . <P> Order &; Death . But the Allies are still hundreds of miles away , south of Rome . The German Army arrives instead ; Farkas hears its motorcycles and tanks roar into the village . " These wretched peasants , " sighs the German colonel ; " I am here to restore order . " In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian Communist , and is swept to death in the " restoring " of order .
