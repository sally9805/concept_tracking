Three men were honored for valor in Canada last week : one in death , one on his homecoming , one with the British Empire 's rarest medal . <P> Champion 's Champion . Roy Brown 's greatest moment came in the early morning of April 21 , 1918 . He had been in almost daily aerial combat on the western front for 14 months . His nerves were dangerously taut . Said he : " Milk and brandy were my only food for two weeks . ... " That morning he swooped unseen behind an Albatross , bagged the famed , ferocious Red Knight of Germany , Baron Manfred von Richthofen . <P> When Australian machine gunners later disputed the kill , Brown never made any extravagant claims . In civilian life he was a small , unassertive man , greying and dapper in later years . Last week , at his peaceful farm near Toronto , Captain Roy Brown , D.S.O. , D.F.C . with bar , quietly died in bed . <P> Homing Angel . " Here comes the Angel ! " the Marauder pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his R.C.A.F. Spitfires into action . In escorting U.S. bombers on 60 sorties over enemy territory , Chadburn 's wing lost only one bomber , accounted for 44 of the enemy ( twelve by the Wing Commander himself ) . For this work , Chadburn became the first R.C.A.F. member to win a bar to his D.S.O. At Dieppe he had previously won the D.F.C . Home to Canada this week came blond , soft-spoken Wing Commander Chadburn , 24 , for a well-earned rest . <P> They Did Not Pass . Paul Andr Triquet 's great-grandfather fought in the Crimean War for Napoleon III ; his grandfather fought the Germans who invaded his native France in 1870 ; his father , who emigrated to Canada , returned in 1914 to fight the Germans again . It seemed only natural for Paul at 19 to enlist as a private in the Royal 22nd Regiment , the " Van Doos . " <P> A sergeant major at the start of World War II , he was a captain when the 1st Canadian Division moved to Italy . In December Captain Triquet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny Casa Berardi , where German troops barred the road to Ortona . In the first advance towards the gun-studded stone houses , half of Triquet 's men and all his officers were either killed or wounded . Said Triquet : " The only safe place is our objective . " He , two sergeants and 15 men made it . There they dug in and Triquet repeated Nivelle 's famed order at Verdun , " Ils ne passeront pas " ( they shall not pass ) . Through successive German attacks the handful held their ground . Next morning the Canadians poured through and stormed on to Ortona . <P> Last week Paul Andr Triquet lay on a hospital bed in Italy . He had not been wounded in battle but while instructing at a battle school . He had also become a national hero . " For determined leadership and example , " Major Triquet had been awarded the Victoria Cross . He was the fourth Canadian to be awarded the coveted ribbon in World War II , the first living French Canadian .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
