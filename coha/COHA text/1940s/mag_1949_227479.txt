A one-legged Communist named Idris Williams sat last week in a tall office building with his back to the winter view of beautiful Sydney Harbor . Two hundred seagoing ships were tied up there for lack of freight or bunker coal . Australians were shivering in heatless houses . Electricity for cooking , lighting and hot baths was rationed , and 650,000 had been thrown out of work because their factories had no coal . Comrade Williams , president of the Miners Federation , had called a coal strike . <P> The issue was one of the most peculiar in Australia 's turbulent labor history . Miners ' demands for shorter hours and a three-month long-service vacation after seven years ' employment had been pending before the Coal Tribunal . The tribunal 's sole member is Francis Heath Gallagher , a lawyer who now spends much of his time in the coal mines and is sympathetic with the miners ' grievances . <P> Union leaders heard that Gallagher was about to render a rather favorable decision . That would never do . The union 's Communist leadership had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A peaceful settlement might undermine the militancy of the miners-and their leaders ' position . They threatened to strike unless Gallagher granted all their demands . Considering this threat to be blackmail , Gallagher refused to hand down any decision until the strike threat was withdrawn . <P> On orders from Comrade Williams , the miners struck June 27 . Australia 's Laborite Prime Minister Joseph B. Chifley , veteran of many a railway walkout , was jolted out of Australia 's usual tolerance of communism . For the first time , Chifley denounced the Communists , and his government hurriedly drafted an emergency bill that would prevent unions from using their funds to support strikes called during arbitration proceedings . Most of Australian labor supported the bill . It passed without dissent . Cried Labor M.P . Leslie Haylen : " Reds act here as in Berlin . They choose the depth of a hard winter to try and suborn a great community by privation and attrition . " <P> Sullenly the strikers realized the hatred that they had stirred up . A newsman who visited the colliery towns wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into town . As you go to the bar the talk quiets and eyes follow you-intelligent , suspicious eyes-summing you up . Nowhere in the world have I felt more like a foreigner . " In Newcastle a striking miner working in his garden saw three air force Vampires zooming over , cried to his wife : " Look , they 're going to bomb Federation House . " <P> The strikers showed no signs of going back to work and Comrade Williams , smug in his office beside Sydney 's harbor , seemed satisfied that everything was going along just fine . Australians set themselves for a long , cold winter .
