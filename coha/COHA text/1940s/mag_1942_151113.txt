The next prize that the Jap wants is the rich Netherlands East Indies . Last week while he was still fighting in Luzon and Malaya he struck at the Indies , for their supplies of oil , rubber , metals and all the other storied riches by whose possession he could tilt the economy of the war . <P> To the Indies ' stubborn Dutch and their broad-faced , able commander , Lieut . General Hein ter Poorten , the thrust was deadly in its possibilities , as it was to the rest of the Allies . To the U.S. it was also bitterly humiliating . The Jap struck from U.S. territory . <P> His chief base was the broad , well-docked harbor of Davao , 600 miles south of Manila . The U.S. defense force in Davao , a thin little group set there by a penny-wise and pound-foolish nation , never had a chance when the Japanese landed in the second week of the war . Since then the Jap has made Davao his own . Last week a flight of U.S. heavy bombers , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Davao , saw the Allies ' worst fears spelled out in ships off the coast . <P> There lay an invasion fleet-a battleship , five cruisers , six destroyers , twelve submarines , twelve transports . The big planes squared off on their bombing run and let drive . They scored direct hits on the battleship , sank a destroyer , landed fairly on some of the other vessels . It was a good job by newly arrived U.S. reinforcements . But it was not enough . <P> Later in the week U.S. bombers found what was apparently the same battleship at Malalag Bay on the west side of Davao Gulf , gave her the works again . This time she took fire . But the Jap had already moved to the south with most of his force . <P> By week 's end he had made four landings in the Dutch archipelago . His troops got ashore at Tarakan ( see map ) , an island off the oil-rich northeast coast of Borneo , the Indies ' richest oil center . He pushed in under cruiser protection during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Indies Army bombers . <P> Japanese troops also got ashore at three points on Minahassa , the thin , eastward-reaching upper handle of Celebes . Here the Jap came by sea and by parachute . He was already in British Sarawak , on the north coast of Borneo . Hein ter Poorten and his Army Air Force commander , thin-faced Major General L. H. van Oyen , promised that oil wells would be fired , refineries dynamited before the Jap got to them for the supplies he now needs more than anything in the world . <P> The Dutch needed help . They were getting some-but not enough-from U.S. bombers flown across the Pacific , from Tommy Hart 's Asiatic Fleet which they announced was operating , in part at least , from the Indies . In two days Dutch and Allied airmen , reported to be operating from 50 secret jungle airdromes , claimed to have scored direct hits on four Japanese transports and two cruisers , to have shot down seven enemy planes . <P> The Allies had finally recognized the tremendous strategic importance of N.E.I. ( above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their southern Pacific headquarters under Archie Wavell down on Java . <P> As of this week they were outnumbered on the land , outgunned on the sea . The Jap was pressing hard and the Allies were strictly on the defensive . They were going to have plenty of trouble , for the Jap 's bases were moving south like a fast creeping paralysis across the South Seas .
