Winter was coming in the Baltic ; the Red armies moved swiftly . Driving down the eastern shore of the Gulf of Riga , they crossed the Latvian border , freed the whole mainland of Estonia . In Tallinn , an ice-free port most of the year , work crews began repairs on the harbor installations , the power plant generators spun again , the government of a Soviet Socialist Republic reassembled . <P> In ten days , Marshal Govorov 's army group had killed 30,000 Germans , captured 15,000 more . When Govorov seized Ainazi , on the Latvian coast , the Germans lost their only rail-served port north of Riga . For two months they had stubbornly clung to an escape corridor at the bottom of the gulf-yet , when the Russians captured the inland rail town of Cesis , they found it had been reinforced by Elite Guard and aviation cadet units from Germany . <P> Clearly , the Nazis were more interested in delay than in evacuation . They knew that when Joseph Stalin 's forces had finished their Baltic campaign , four whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . Though they admitted extensive " disengaging " movements , they showed some signs of preparing to fight for Riga like another Sevastopol or Brest . The forests and marshes around the city were strewn with mines , bristled with machine-gun nests . <P> The Germans still held four Estonian islands blocking the mouth of the Gulf of Riga-the large islands of Dag and Oesel , the smaller inshore islands of Vormsi and Muhu . Last week the Russians seized Vormsi and Muhu by amphibious assault , landed marines and tanks . Berlin claimed that German warships had tangled with the Red Fleet , now freely ranging the eastern Baltic , and had sunk many landing barges-but there was no claim of dislodging the Reds from their island footholds . Heavier naval action in the Baltic seemed likely soon . <P> Meanwhile , at week 's end , the drive on Riga languished . Winter was coming on , but not even winter could hurry Stalin 's hand .
