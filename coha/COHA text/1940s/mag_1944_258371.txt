We 'll turn Manhattan into an Isle of joy-Rodgers &; Hart . <P> Manhattan has enough city plans on hand to paper Broadway from end to end . This week it got one more . The plan 's author is Engineer-Architect Hermann Herrey . He was a widely famed city planner in Britain and on the Continent before the war , organized a national road-plan exhibit for the Royal Institute of British Architects , is now studying U.S. city problems on a grant from the American Philosophical Society . His collaborators are his wife-a physicist teaching at Queens College-and a Harvard architect , Constantin Pertzoff . <P> Great Circles . No starry-eyed planners , they started with a practical engineering study of traffic and congestion in the city . Their studies convinced them that Manhattan 's basic trouble is hardening of the arteries-a creeping paralysis of transportation . Kerrey 's plan begins , therefore , with reorganization of Manhattan 's streets to restore circulation . Around the central part of the island would run a belt highway . It would carry all through north- &-south; traffic , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals . About 90% of the present crosstown streets , and Madison and Lexington Avenues , might be eliminated ; all remaining streets and avenues would be one-way . North- &-south; avenues ( except Broadway ) would carry no through traffic , would be broken at intervals to permit division of Manhattan into a series of huge , self-contained blocks , each circled by a " ring street . " The sides of each oblong block ( about 15 present city blocks long ) would be two avenues ; its ends , two cross streets . This system of ring streets and one-way traffic , like a highway cloverleaf , would eliminate all traffic intersections . <P> The general character of the present midtown and downtown business sections , the theater district , Central Park , and Broadway would be undisturbed . But the rest of Manhattan , now " all mixed up , " would be reshuffled in a more orderly scheme : placing industry along the belt highway , housing in separate areas and parks around the riverfront fringes . In the now-blighted downtown area between Canal Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent Fair , which might include a proposed fashion center. * <P> Great Hopes . Planner Herrey 's belt highway , some 80 ft. high , would have six separate levels-for truck , bus , passenger and express traffic , two levels for parking . It would run between 9th and 10th Avenues and between 2nd and 3rd . Crosstown streets , much wider than present ones , would be laid out in pairs ( e.g. , an eastbound highway on the site of 40th Street , westbound on 42nd Street ) . <P> Freed of traffic lights ( except at pedestrian crossings ) , the ring streets would supposedly allow a smooth flow of traffic . The block plan would place all residents within easy walking distance of schools , shops , etc . Herrey proposes a new type of apartment house , with a terrace and garden for each apartment .
