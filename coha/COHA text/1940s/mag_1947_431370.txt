 | Colitis is an inflammation of the colon ; the termination " itis " means inflammation . True colitis can be quite serious , whereas spastic or mucous colitis ? or , as it is sometimes called , an " irritable colon " ? is a functional affliction , and though it is definitely trying , it is nothing to worry about . In fact , simple worry may be its chief cause . There are at least four types of true colitis . The first and second are actually amoebic and bacillary dysenteries , with which we became familiar during the war , for troops not infrequently contracted one or the other in the tropics or in countries such as China or India , where native habits of growing and handling food are far from hygienic . The third type , chronic ulcerative colitis , is another story ; but most people need not be disturbed about it , because it is fortunately quite rare . The fourth , caused by some of the less-important dysentery organisms , is just food poisoning , manifested by a one- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delhi belly , " " Gyppy tummy , " or some other regional label ; here at home we say solemnly that we have " intestinal flu . " It responds to paregoric , a little rest , and careful eating . Spastic or mucous colitis is far more common than true colitis. and , in its way , it is more difficult to deal with . In real colitis , the patient is sick because the colon is affected . In spastic colitis , the situation is reversed : the colon is n't making the patient ill ; the patient is making his colon sick . It reflects a nervous condition . Like a nervous " sick headache , " an irritable colon is more often the result than the cause of disordered nerves . Many people suffer this sort of colitis . It is almost an occupational disease of artists , writers , and theatre people ? indeed , of most tense . high-strung individuals , especially those who use their brains more than their muscles . More women than men suffer from it , and doctors encounter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women . The doctor suspects an irritable colon when mucus accompanies excretions . Blood from the rectum is serious , but mucus is no more important than discharge from the nose or phlegm from the throat . There are other symptoms : pain and a sore feeling in the lower bowel , sometimes a burning sensation in the rectum , occasionally the need of going to the toilet too frequently , sometimes every half hour or so . The condition varies . There are days when the entire abdomen feels bloated and sore and the colon burns and aches . Usually the pain is below the navel . This is a good sign , because ulcers and gallbladder trouble cause pain above the navel . This pain ; such symptoms as gas , constipation , occasional diarrhea ; and his patient 's personality give the doctor the clues . He does not , however , depend on these symptoms alone . He makes a thorough examination , beginning with a microscopic examination of specimens of excreta , to make sure there are no parasites of a true colitis . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that he probably orders a barium test . In this test , an enema. with barium added to the water , is given at the hospital , so that X-rays can be taken as the fluid flows from one end of the colon to the other . Some technicians inject air into the colon after the enema and then take stereoscopic films . With the information the doctor obtains thus . he can @#  | distinguish between a true colitis and a : : irritable colon . An irritable colon is perfectly normal . The only unusual characteristic is excessive activity in the little cells in the lining that secrete mucus . As a rule , these cells produce just enough to lubricate the lining of the colon and so protect it from rough or irritating substances . In a nervous person , the cells overwork . The cause of spastic colitis , therefore . resides in one 's emotional structure . This is easily understandable . When you are worried , or have to do a job under pressure , or get excited , your insides act up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you felt this way just before exams . Nowadays , although you may take profound problems in your stride , yo. : get excited when you have an important dinner party or when Johnny tracks mud on the clean rugs . You are a tense person , and when you are agitated , you : body reacts . Your stomach may he swollen and sore ; you may be constipated ; eventually , you may have spastic colitis . DIAGNOSIS is not always so simple Occasionally an irritable colon is symptom of some profound frustratio : which , in really severe cases , only a psychiatrist can treat successfully . When people are unhappily married , or are childless and want children , or feel themselves insecure or futile , this spiritua maladjustment may manifest itself i : colitis . In most cases , however , the condition is the result of nervous temperament and the stresses and strains of living Consequently , if you have colitis an : : really want to recover from it , you mus cooperate wholeheartedly with the doctor . When your difficulty is emotiona. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy ; but you can if you wi : . You must learn to live a more plac : : : life . This requires self-control and selfdiscipline . You must develop a technique for bridling your temper . When you op : the icebox and find that the youngster have made sandwiches of the cold roar beef you 'd planned to use for hash , dot . get irritated ; tell yourself calmly thy .. - now they 've had their meat and for dinner they 'll have to get along on bake : beans . When the month 's bills add up : more than you 'd expected , do n't go in : a tailspin ; tell yourself that what 's dot. : is done , and figure out how to meet t : -. : emergency . If you have a new job , dor. lie awake worrying for fear you won make good ; the worst that can happeis that you 'll be fired ? and very fe ; 6 people in this country starve . You must learn to adjust to inescapac situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are restir . You must get plenty of sleep , and a ne after lunch is good if you can manage Make sure that mealtimes are agree able . Do n't raise controversial issues the dinner table , and do n't permit yo family to indulge in any but the m amiable chatter or discussion . This vc help your colitis and will be good f your children , too . Doctors have notic that spastic colitis tends to run in far .. lies . - You may have to give up smoking a drinking . That cigarette you smoke wh you are upset makes you worse : does n't soothe you . And the cocktail t.  | picks you up before dinner makes you feel worse later . You must avoid any overstimulation of your body or your senses , including sexual excesses . Physical exercise appropriate to your age and habits is helpful , but be sensible about it . Do n't play three or four violent sets of tennis every day if you are almost forty and for years have n't done anything more vigorous than lift a coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . This will distract your mind from your work and from the routine of life . But do n't take up something that 's just busy-work ; do something creative , such as gardening , photography , sketching . Diet is , of course , extremely important . But be sensible , for people who suffer from colitis are often the victims of diet fads . A friend tells you about a wonderful new diet that relieves everything ? yet all it does is make your condition worse . Your doctor will tell you that you must have a good , wholesome , wellbalanced diet . If your case is average , you may eat fruit and vegetables ; but while you 're getting over the worst of your troubles , you should not eat them raw . You may have meat , whole-wheat bread and cereals , and eggs . If your case is extreme , the doctor may suggest that for a while you eat stewed fruit and pureed vegetables . If you need it , he will give you a bland diet . HE CERTAINLY will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These measures , useful when used occasionally , aggravate the disorder when used routinely . Frequently they are the actual cause of it ? after a time , the bowel may become infected by : oo many laxatives . Few people realize that bowel habits vary . One individual may eliminate each day ; once in two or three days may be normal for another . Some people are neurotic about this subject and worry irrationally . They worry about regularity and quantity . Actually , quantity varies with the type of food ingested . Stalky vegetables like cabbage , broccoli , asparagus , and celery , foods with bran in them , fruit , and coarse-fibered meat have a : arge residue . Fine meat , potatoes , milk , fruit juices , white bread , cream soups , etc. , are largely absorbed by digestive processes . The intelligent thing to do is ignore the whole thing . However , if you fluctuate between constipation and diarrhea , and suffer from the gastric symptoms mentioned here , or if only slight symptoms are accompanied by palpitation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaur doctor for help . If you do n't consult him , do n't do anything . Nothing will happen except that you will go on being cmmcomfortable . Never go to a quack who promises to help by irrigations , manipulations , or any such device . Do n't smile a : this . People with colitis are often the victims of unscrupulous pseudoscientists . Two symptoms should be taken seric . : sly : passing blood from the rectum , and a change in the normal pattern of E. wel habits , if that change lasts longer than a couple of weeks or a month . If you . ve constipation or diarrhea for a long time , tell your doctor . Either of these should be investigated promptly . But an ordinary irritable colon is another story . It can temporarily take the joy out of life ; but it is n't dangerous , d it can be cured .
