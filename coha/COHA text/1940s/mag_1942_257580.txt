The pesky milkweed , cursed by farmers , has found a use-as a substitute for kapok . With a newly invented milkweed gin , a Michigan factory will next month start removing 1,000,000 lb. of floss from milkweed pods , for the U.S. Navy . The floss will replace kapok , formerly imported from Java , in l ) life jackets where , like kapok , it is six times as buoyant as cork ; 2 ) linings of flying suits , where it is as warm as wool but six times lighter . Next year farmers will be paid to plant free milkweed seed in 50,000 barren acres of upper Michigan .
