The U.S. took over its section of occupied Berlin , death-ridden capital of a dead empire , last week . Along a road marked off by the Red Army , a column of 4,000 U.S. vehicles rolled toward the shattered city . As the Americans crossed into suburban Zehlendorf , a dismal rain fell . Cried some gaunt Berliners : " Gott sei dank - Thank God ! " Others stood silent and sullen . <P> Next day - the Fourth of July - the Americans lined up in the courtyard of Lichterfelde 's former SS barracks . Opposite them was ranged a Red Army detachment . Major General Nikolai Baranov , commander of the Russian garrison in Berlin , welcomed the newcomers . General Omar N. Bradley , commander of the U.S. <P> Twelfth Army Group , replied . Bands played the national anthems of Russia and the U.S. The Stars &; Stripes fluttered up a staff until it flew level with the Hammer &; Sickle . A 48-gun salute was fired . Then the Russians marched smartly off . <P> Mark of Death . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since its capture ten weeks ago , two things at once impressed the Americans : the mark of death , and the mark of the Russians . <P> Death stared from the cadavers of mighty buildings ; the smashed , charred bones of the Reichstag ( see cut ) ; the battle-broken Chancellery , where Adolf Hitler and his paramour , Eva Braun , may have died ; the ruins of the Propaganda Ministry , Foreign Office , Kroll Opera House and almost every other notable Berlin edifice . The stench of death rose too from corpses still rotting under debris , from the corpse-clogged Liitzow Canal , from hasty , shallow graves dug in every park and Platz . <P> Mark of the Russians . The Russian imprint was also everywhere . In their period of unilateral rule , the Russians had appointed the Brgermeisters for all Berlin 's boroughs and an Oberbrgermeister . They had opened , under their own rules , a few schools , movies , cafes . Their buxom women troops acted as sentries and traffic police . Their stolid Red Armymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had placarded the ruins with huge portraits of Stalin and with posters that proclaimed : " The destruction of the German nation is not among the aims of the United Nations . " They had conscripted German women for work gangs . An ordinary Hausfrau had to put in one six-hour day each fortnight clearing rubble ( see cut ) . Wives of Nazi Party members labored six days a week at 72 pfennigs ( approximately 7 ) an hour . <P> The Russians had exacted " reparations in kind " on a large scale . When the British occupied their area of Berlin , they found the immense plant of Rheinmetall-Borsig ( 25 blocks , 70,000 workers ) stripped of heavy machinery that had produced gasoline and Tiger tanks . Of 2,500 machines , only 300 were left . Key equipment from textile mills , sugar refineries and other factories had also made the long trip to Russia . Said a German manager appointed by the Russians : " There is no question of our producing anything . Our productive capacity is absolutely nil . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
