txt " The term ' inflation ' has so many meanings that I ordinarily prefer not use it , " says Dr Benjamin M. Anderson . Jr " If by ' inflation ' one merely means rising commodity prices , wd had it on a grand scale in the last war , and so far have it on a moderate scale " On the other hand " If by ' Inflation ' one means monetary factors which tend to generate a rise in prices , the present situation is far more inflationary than was the situation in the last war . " Why ? Dr. Anderson has three chief reasons : 1 . The Government today insists on borrowing huge sums of money at interest rates so low that investors ' funds are not attracted . The securities are in large part sold to commercial banks : this creates deposits which ultimately get Into the public 's hands , and become a part of the inflationary spending stream . In the last war rates became sufficiently high to attract investors ' funds . 2 Today there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people  --  ready to contribute to the inflation spending whenever the public decides to use them . These funds are largely in the form of bank deposits . 3 . There is not the same confidence in the dollar now that existed in the last war . Scarcity of Goods In regard to rising prices in the last war , explains Dr. Anderson , " it seems to me to have been the scarcity of goods . as 50 million men quit work and went to war engaging in the most extravagent kind of destruction and consumption of goods , and as Europe was buying without limit of quantity and price all that she could get in this country , and our people , activity employed , were bidding up prices to hold the scarce goods here . " Dr. Anderson further notes that during the last war " The prices of common stocks broke in the autumn of 1916 . " The general price level as distinguished from the commodity price level was not rising after we got into the war and for some time before that . " Scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were falling . " The explanation of these economic developments , according to Dr. Anderson , is to be found in the fact that " men and governments were sacrificing the future to the present , selling future goods and claims to future goods , long time assets and long time debts , at lower and lower prices in order to get resources to concentrate into the present , to get the scarce goods needed for life and the prosecution of war . Opposite Directions " From the end of 1916 on . " continues Dr. Anderson . " the trend of commodity prices was in one direction and the price trend of long time income bearers was in the other direction . ' For the purposes of this interview Dr. Anderson prefers to talk chiefly about the monetary factors in the inflation picture . " Using the term ' inflation ' to mean monetary factors making for higher prices in equities. we have an ' inflation ' factor in the present situation that was largely absent during the last war . " " We had very easy money by pre-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Dr. Anderson , " but tightening money was a repressive factor through all of 1917 and 1918 and began to be felt in the latter part of 1916 . " " For cheap money of 1915 and the first half of 1916 two factors were responsible : ill The corning of the Federal Reserve System which reduced the reserve requirements of the banks of the System , and ( 2 ) a great Inflow of gold from Europe which amounted to $1,100 million between December 1 , 1941 , and April . 1917 . The combination of these two factors gave us call money averaging between 175 ' 1- and 2'i ' for about a year and a half in 1915 and 1916 But the call rate rose sharply in the autumn of 1916 and in 1918 call money was pegged at 6 , ; - and rationed out . In the absence of this it would have gone far above 6r1- . " Other Interat Rates Dr Anderson emphasized that other interest rates also moved ahead in the World War I period , in contrast to the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and continue even after two years of war in Europe . " The commercial paper rate , " explains Dr. Anderson . " averaged about 3 , y ' ; - , in 1915 and 1916 , went to 3 91 , , in December of 1916. 4 13 ' , - in March of 1917. 5 ' . in June of 1917 , and 6,1- in September of 1918 , which rept esented very tight money . In contrast , the commercial paper rate so far in 1941 has aaveraged 0 63,1 Bond yields were only moderately affected by the cheap money of 1915 and 1916. the decline being from 419 ' , in March of 1915 to 3 99 ' - rin December of 1916. with a steady rise thereafter to a high of 4 82,1- in September of 1918 Also in contrast . Moody 's Triple A bond averare t-teld in 1941 has been 2 77,1 , " There was a big expansion of bank credit in the years 1915 , 1916 and the first half of 1917 but the great increase was in commercial loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large accumulations of idle funds in the period of the first war The pace of industry and rising commodity prices and rising wages outran the expansion in loan funds : and real pressure in the money and capital markets began to show itself before our own government got into the war . " Importance of Monetary Situation Continuing his emphasis on the importance of the monetary situation , Dr Anderson says : " Now , I should make the sharpest kind of distinction between the monetary situation in the last war and the monetary situation today . In the last war , as I said before , tightening money w as a repressive factor through all of 1917 and 1915 . When oar great l% ar effort began in 1917 , the Government started suddenly an immense borrowing at rates of interest that real:y attracted investors mono . The chart book issued bN the Board of Governors of the Feder al Reserve System dated February 11. 1941 , has on page 20 a curve covering the years 1916-40 , showing the ownership of Government securities . I have had this curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically that it was investors ' money which the Government got in 1917 and 1918 and that it is bank money which the Government has been getting in 1939 , 1940 and ** the $26 ' 2 billion of public debt at the peak in 1919 , investors had taken nearly billion and banku held only S4I , billion of which they already had nearly a billion bi fore the Goternment 's borrowing program began chiefly as security for national bank notes . The total of ' war paper ' in the banks at this peak . including both Government securities owned and loans against Government securities , was b6 billion . The commercial banks are by all odds the biggest owners of Government bonds today . Second Sharp DihtinetIon " The second sharp distinction between the monetary factor in 1914-IS and the monetary factor today is to be found in the fact that we now have an immense volume of idle tunds in the hands of frightened investors . chiefly demand deposits in banks . At no stage of the years 1915-18 1B there evidence of any real accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monetary factor of today and the monetary factor in the last war is to be found in the fact that nobody at any stage of the game in the last war lost confidence in the goodness of the gold dollar or lost confidence that the dollar was as good as gold . Some of us who are monetary specialists were irritated at the time by the wholly unnecessary and entirely unjustifiable failure of the Federal Reserve Banks to pay out gold on demand , and at scattered manifestations of a slight premium on gold in certain retail markets , but this eon , ern never passed into the minds of the general public , and . for that matter , never made any difference in the behavior of the financial community There was no flight from the dollar into securities . real estate , and other equities during the last war period . We trusted the dollar .
