In a world fascinated by guessing games , which pour from every radio and occupy prominent space in periodicals , from newspapers to the most erudite literary magazines , the riddle is the hoariest veteran . Riddles , which people think of as belonging purely to the province of children , have had their effect on history . Some of the riddles now current among children have been handed down from the days of the Pharaohs . Perhaps the most famous riddle is the Riddle of the Sphinx . According to legend , the Muses transmitted it to the Sphinx , who dwelt on a high rock outside Thebes , and the Thebans were required to guess it .

( A man with a pot on his head , riding a mule . ) THESE are typical examples . All are as old as the hills , and they are still nearly as popular with small-town small fry as they were with children a hundred years ago . Riddles that delight contemporary children most are ? strictly speaking ? not riddles at all , but conundrums and verbal sells . The riddle proper is guessable in a reasonable sense , while the answer to a conundrum is a pun ? sometimes a very bad pun . Here are some popular conundrums : " Why is an orange like a bell " Because it peels ( peals ) . " " What flowers do you always wear ? . . . Tulips . " " When is a door not a door ? ... When its ajar . " " Why is it bad to gossip in the stable ? . . . Horses carry tails . " " Why 's a watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why does n't the locomotive ever sit down ? . Because it has a tender behind . " " When are sailors like corpses ? . When they are in the shrouds . " The last one seems a little gruesome , but macabre themes hold few terrors in the folklore of childhood . In some conundrums the pun is in the question , rather than the answer : " How do you make a Maltese cross ? . Pul : its tail . " One small girl , when told the answer , protested , " I still do n't see how you can make a Maltese cross out of a pullet 's tail . " The joy with which this absurd mistake was reported goes far to explain the popularity of conundrums . There is another modern development of the conundrum , which children consider very funny : " What did the big toe say to the little toe ? . . . Look out ! There 's a heel following us . " " What did the big rose say to the little rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayonnaise say to the icebox ? . . . Close the door . I 'm dressing .

" ' Why did the moron take a ladder to church ? . Because he heard it was a high mass . " " Why did the moron drive his car off the cliff ? . Because he wanted to try his new airbrakes . " " Why : lid the moron take hay to bed with him ? .. Because he wanted to feed his nightmare . " These , oddly enough , are popular  | not only with children but with adults . Sells that travel under the name of riddles are riddles gone completely haywire , and children everywhere love them dearly . The question always sounds sensible enough , but the expected answer is so obvious or absurd that no intelligent child would dare to offer it seriously . Thus the " correct " answer traps the victim into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therein lies the main fun for the questioner ? and for the hearer , who of course has no trouble finding a new victim . Here are the oldest favorites : " Why does a chicken cross the road ? . To get to the other side . " " Why do policemen wear red suspenders ? To hold up their pants . " " Why did they bury Washington on a hill ? . . . Because he was dead . " " When is a yellow clog most likely to enter the house ? . When the door is open .

" B : " But an ostrich ca n't bark ! " A : " Oh , I just put that in to make it difficult . " Now it is B 's turn . B : " I know a better riddle than that ! What is long and red and hangs on the wall and whistles ? " A : " There 's no possible answer to that one . " B : " Yes there is , too . It 's a herring . " A : " How could it be red ? " B : " I painted it red . " A : " How did it get on the wall ? " B : " I hung it there . " A : " But herrings ca n't whistle . " B : " So it does n't whistle ! " If Homer were alive today , perhaps he 'd die with vexation at hearing the answer to that one .  |                  @ @ @
