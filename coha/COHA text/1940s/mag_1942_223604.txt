Ever since the fall of France , bald , elegant William Christian Bullitt has moved across the U.S. stage , now out to the spotlight , now back to the wings . After his return from serving as Ambassador to France he was gradually lost to view : rumor said that he had gone into seclusion to write a book . Last winter he suddenly crossed the stage : he was President Roosevelt 's special emissary on an eight weeks ' tour of the Near East . Back he went into the shadow : rumor said he was thinking about running for Governor of Pennsylvania . <P> Last week the U.S. got another glimpse of suave Mr. Bullitt . A photograph from an Army operations headquarters " somewhere in England " ( see cut ) showed him walking with Lieut . General Dwight Eisenhower , Commander of the A.E.F. , and Brigadier General Ira Eaker , head of the U.S. bomber command , who this week personally led a force of Flying Fortresses in a raid on occupied France ( see p. 26 ) . Then he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eamon de Valera . <P> This time Bullitt had a new title : special assistant to Navy Secretary Knox . But his job was probably the same : working as eyes &; ears of Franklin Roosevelt .
