Last year Americans ate nearly a billion pounds of commercially frozen foods . About a half-billion more pounds were stored in 5,000 cold-locker plants by some 1,500,000 U.S. families . The quick-freezing boom , barely 15 years old , is growing fast . Last week a propagandist who has contributed to the boom , maga zine Writer Boyden Sparkes , published a book predicting that the next big move will be toward freezing and storage in the home ( Zero Storage in Your Home ; Doubleday , Doran ; $2.50 ) . <P> Many food technologists believe that after the war quick freezing will supplant canning and dehydration as the chief method of food preservation . To Zealot Sparkes , such speculation is overcautious . He asserts that food freezing may revolutionize the U.S. standard of living . City people will buy their food wholesale . People " in modest circumstances , " Sparkes glows , " may eat cheaply such meals as heretofore were available only to rich gourmets . " Farm families will have an easily preserved , tasty winter supply of their own produce-including much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Sparkes has a 26-cubic-foot freezer on his North Carolina farm , keeps it stuffed with whole lamb carcasses , chickens , cream , sweet corn , grapes , strawberries , quail , pigeons-all of which his family can eat fresh the year round . He also keeps in touch with other members of the small but fanatical cult of U.S. citizens who own home freezers . Their exploits are reverently recorded in his book . The Fyler family , of West Simsbury , Conn. , reports that its freezer saves it $1,000 a year . A Mrs. Spencer of Pueblo , Colo. , whom Sparkes salutes as a " distinguished pioneer , " gives an awesome account of freezing 2,000 quarts of food annually , from soups to shortcake . <P> The Works . The first quick-freezing process was patented by Inventor Clarence Birdseye of Gloucester , Mass , in 1925 Food is frozen at 10 to 20 degrees ( Fahrenheit ) below zero , stored at zero or below It keeps its flavor , vitamins , color and tastes as fresh when taken out of storage ( after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put in . Freezing is less trouble than canning or dehydrating . The food is blanched in boiling water or steam , then wrapped in a moisture-proof , vapor-proof container and sealed with a warm iron . ( Fruits are packed in sugar syrup to prevent oxidation . ) <P> Home freezing machines range from four to 35 cubic feet . So great is the demand for them ( manufacture has been suspended during the war ) that soda-fountain ice-cream cabinets worth $25 as scrap have been refurbished and sold for as much as $800 . A family locker in a storage plant usually holds about 200 Ibs. of food , rents for an average of $12 a year . Capacity of a 26-cu. - ft. home freezer : about 1,000 Ibs . <P> The Quirks . The chief disadvantage of home freezing has been the high cost of the freezer . Though relatively inexpensive to run ( $2 to $3 a month ) , freezers range in price from $300 to $1,000 . They are also inconvenient , because food packages piled up in the box are hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole batch of food .
