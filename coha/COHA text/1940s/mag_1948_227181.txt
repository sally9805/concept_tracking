The brightest comet of 1948 was visible this week , but only early birds and milkmen got a good look at it : the comet could be seen only for a short time before dawn . In the north temperate zone its rising tail appeared above the southeastern horizon just ahead of the sun . The best view was from a hilltop away from bright city lights . <P> Official discoverer of the new comet was Professor John Paraskevopoulos of Harvard 's observatory near Bloemfontein , South Africa , who reported his find on Nov. 7 . Other southern hemisphere astronomers spotted it about the same time , as did at least one nonscientific night owl . Captain Frank McGann of Panagra saw the comet from his Clipper as he flew over the Caribbean on Nov. 4 , and reported it to his base in Miami . <P> According to Dr. Leland Cunningham , comet expert of the University of California , " McGann-Paraskevopoulos " ( official name : 1948-L ) is now moving away from the sun , having passed closest to it on Oct. 27 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not come any nearer . Its tail is more than 15 long , 30 times the breadth of the full moon , and its head is estimated to be of the second magnitude in brightness ( this is brighter than all except 41 stars in the sky ) . The comet will fade slowly , but it will appear a little earlier every day . Early risers or late-to-bedders will have a better chance to look at it before it vanishes into outer space .
