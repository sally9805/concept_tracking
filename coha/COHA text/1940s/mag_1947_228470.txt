In Paris last week , members of the Senate Appropriations Committee , having doggedly toured the neat Norman farm country and held long conferences with Premier Paul Ramadier and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault , relaxed at a party given by U.S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery . Over cocktails , one Senator 's wife asked an English-speaking Frenchman : <P> " Is it true that the French have n't got any more dollars ? " <P> " That is true . " <P> " No dollars at all ? " <P> " Not a single one . " <P> " Gee , " said the Senator 's lady , " that makes you think , does n't it ? " <P> Back in Washington , Administration officials were doing a little more than just thinking . They were trying frantically to scrape up some dollars . They had some success . <P> The Export-Import Bank authorized France to use $93 million ( and Italy $32 million ) in untapped reconstruction credits for emergency purchases of fuel . The Army bought $50 million worth of French francs to pay off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . The biggest lump sum was a preliminary divvy of $360 million in gold looted by the Germans : $104 million to France , $29.4 million to Austria , $4 million to Italy , $40 million to The Netherlands . <P> There were a few other possibilities . The Army still owed France some $30 million . France had a claim on $37 million worth of Indo-Chinese gold captured by the Japanese . There was a chance that $115 million worth of German assets might be kept out of the Treasury for use abroad . All told , it was probably enough to keep Europe going on a hand-to-mouth basis until the first of the year . <P> <P> But it was only hand-to-mouth , and unless something like the Marshall Plan is soon put into operation , another crisis would arise early in 1948 . Sighed one Washington administrator : " Boy , am I tired of these goal-line stands . "
