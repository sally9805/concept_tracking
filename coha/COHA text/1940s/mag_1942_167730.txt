The precious time won from the Jap in the victory of the Coral Sea was running out . Soon he would strike again , and this time he might plow through to New Caledonia or to Australia 's sparsely held coasts . <P> In the U.S. , wishful thinking after the battle had set spirits soaring , sent many a U.S. citizen flying to the double-wrong conclusion that the war was being won in the south Pacific as well as in Europe . Australians knew better . The Jap had been thwarted before but he always came back for more , because he always had more reserves close by than the United Nations in the south Pacific could lay their hands on . So it was after the Battle of Macassar Strait ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) . And so it was after the Battle of Bali , when he took another shellacking . He always got where he was headed . <P> Now the Jap wanted Australia , either under his foot or under the shadow of his forces operating from the islands to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Douglas MacArthur would have liked . But of air strength MacArthur had enough to keep the Jap worried and off balance . He used it , while among the islands to the northeast the U.S. craft prowled , and watched their chance . <P> While Navy subs bagged a 7,100-ton cruiser and two Jap cargo vessels , MacArthur 's airmen reached far &; wide for the Jap 's shipping and air installations . The dingdong raiding across the wilds of New Guinea went on daily , with the Jap pounding at the U.S. airdromes at Port Moresby while American and Australian crews smashed the Jap 's docks , sheds and ships at Salamaua and Lae . <P> Bombers from Australian bases raided Timor , to the northwest , bunged up a flying field , fought their way home untouched . U.S. four-motored bombers , piloted by Australians , flew 600 miles to the ex-Dutch naval base at Amboina , blasted shipping , knocked down three Zeros and came home one ship short . <P> For bomber crews it was a wild &; woolly life . In one raid a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flaming plane looped out of control around the bomber and spun into the ground . After the fight there was more trouble-no doing of the Jap . The bomb doors would not close . Two U.S. enlisted men were lowered on ropes under the speeding plane . Without parachutes for comfort , they shook the doors loose , were hauled back with the certainty of heroes ' medals . <P> In these and many another desperate raid the Jap was taking a good pounding . But it was not enough to stop him . His ships still went into his ports , his supplies piled up on the docks that called for hundreds more Allied bombers for their destruction . He was on the way again . There was no mistaking that .
