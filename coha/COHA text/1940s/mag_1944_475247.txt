ONE day in 1942 Colonel Robert Rutherford McCormick strode into the city room of his Chicago Tribune . He had a statement for the press . Word had just arrived that the Federal Grand Jury had determined that the Tribune had not violated security regulations by publishing a detailed story on the Battle of Midway . The handful of staff men stopped working to watch him . " There was electricity in the air , " recalls one who was present . As the Colonel reached the center desk the staffers burst into applause . It was not a staged demonstration ; it was a spontaneous and curiously ingenuous one . They crowded about him , and he was touched and for a moment could not speak . Then he dwelt haltingly on the vindication and his confidence in the men who had handled the story ; and he said that he had no family but regarded the Tribune as his family , and that when he died the Tribune would pass to the employees . Thcn , once more alone and unapproachable , he retired to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time criticism of the Tribune was at its peak . Mass meetings had denounced it and burned it in the streets ; men of liberal persuasion everywhere were out to get the Colonel . Marshall Field 's new Chicago Sun was pointing up the consonal journalism . And in other ways he is a throwback to the past . Above all he is a lonely , patriotic , sincere man who believes that he is one of the few remaining bulwarks between this country and catastrophe . As an aristocrat and scion of " one of the first families of Chicago " ( as one of his wealthy friends put it three times in a ten-minute interview ) , he has a strong sense of noblesse oblige . Paternalistic , he regards his heavy responsibilities with deadly seriousness . He labors prodigiously at news-papering , and although he is not considered one of the great American editors , he is an inventive man with vast knowledge of the mechanical side of newspaper manufacturing , and has a talent for surrounding himself with extremely able helpers . Arrogant , distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inspires either bitter hatred or blind devotion and so he has become at once a cult and a legend . It is easy to hear anything about him , from vicious scandal to irreverent anecdote , but it is difficult to go behind the legend , for he ordinarily refuses to be interviewed , and his friends adopt his close-mouthed attitude . Once he sent word to a Sun reporter that he would see no one from the Sun but Marshall Field . Recently he has been so frequently under attack that today his friends leap belligerently to his defense as soon as his name is mentioned , assuming that assault is imminent . Few men in public life have gone ? to greater lengths to keep their private affairs private and their public affairs pugnacious . He has an abiding contempt for the idle rich and the proletarian leaders alike and he expresses it frequently , for he is blunt of speech ; once he startled a luncheon club by opening his address thus : " Today I am going to talk about the pimp . Willie Bioff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shy and likable . In a strange way fate seems to hand him the opposite of what he seeks . He is beloved chiefly by the " society " people he detests ; he has carpentered the career of but one hugely successful politician , and that one is a Roosevelt supporter ; he saw the Republican Vice-Presidential nomination he coveted go in 1936 to his enemy whose newspaper publishes the deadly " Colonel McCosmic " cartoons ; he has been charged with aiding the Germans whom he despises as filthy-minded mongers of scatological humor . The Colonel must feel that it is events which are contradictory ; they plague and confound him . He plays the patriot 's part and what happens ? He is accused of disloyalty . Contemptuous of failure and intensely patriotic , he champions persons who happen to stand with him on this issue and that , and they turn out to be traitors . It must all be very confusing to him . rr onAv at sixty-four Colonel McCor- mick is a tall , erect man of vigorous habits and military mien . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accent which sounds almost British . He is always self-possessed , with the poise of breeding . He is handsome , with arched aristocratic eyebrows , tired pouchy eyes , a bristly mustache , and gray hair . He dresses immaculately , frequently in tweeds , and possesses an extensive wardrobe , most of it acquired in England . He is a vain man who finds it extremely difficult to unbend , and the rare occasions when one of his reporters sees him at ease become deathless city room legends . One evening factual errors appeared in the first-edition editorial on Ludendorff 's death , and so a top-notch reporter instead of the usual menial was dispatched with the first edition to the Colonel 's town house on Astor Street , not far from the Tower ; for the Colonel was certain to make important corrections in the editorial ( his troops had opposed Ludendorff 's in the war ) and nobody but the Colonel 's secretary can read his handwriting and she had gone home . With trepidation the reporter entered the living room , a big , comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tweeds , which explained why he had n't seen the editorial before publication : he had been out on his eight-hundred-acre estate near suburban Wheaton . He was in jovial mood . While he read through the editorial he offered the reporter a drink . The Colonel had had a couple of drinks himself ? a rarity , for though he loves good living he is an extremely temperate man . ( Incidentally , he does not smoke and dislikes having those about him smoke . ) When they had finished their work the reporter rose to leave ? interviews with the Colonel are brief ? but the Colonel asked if he had a ride back to the office . The reporter said a photographer had brought him . " Take the photographer some cigars , " said the Colonel , and thrust on him a fistful of cigars . Once more the reporter sought to leave . But the Colonel , measuring him with his eye , said , " I believe we are the same height . How tail are you ? " The reporter said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch . The Colonel boomed , " Let 's meashah , " and called the butler . The butler , a very short man , brought a chair and climbed onto it . The two men stood stiffly back to back and the butler placed a silver salver across their heads . The reporter realized he was a little taller than the Colonel . At the same moment he felt an increasing pressure on his head . He allowed himself to shrink . Finally the butler announced , " Exactly the same , sir . " The Colonel said with satisfaction , " I thought so . " The reporter departed . II C OLONEL MCCORNIICK was born in Chicago , July 30 , 1880 . His grandfather was a brother of Cyrus Hall McCormick , who patented the reaper and may have invented it ( the Colonel does n't think he did ; this is a family squabble ) . His mother was the daughter of Joseph Medill , Abe Lincoln 's friend and owner of the Tribune . Thus the Colonel , or Bertie , as members of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest aristocracy , influence in public affairs , and violent journalism . Oddly enough , it was the original Marshall Field ? the grandfather of his antagonist of today who loaned Joseph Medill the money to buy control of the Tribune in 1874 after Medill had been fired as editor by anti-Grant liberals . Medill always said he intended to run his paper so that people would swear by it while they swore at it . He succeeded , and so has his grandson , the Colonel . Though the McCormicks came to Chicago a hundred years ago , they originally were a Virginia family , and the Colonel , despite frequent attacks upon Southern politicians , today retains a deep affection and kinship for many traditional Southern institutions ? militarism , gallantry , paternalism , feudalism , and the landed aristocracy which champions states ' rights . Several of the Colonel 's ancestors engaged in politics and public affairs , and his father , Robert Sanderson McCormick , was appointed secretary to the American legation at London . So Bertie and his brother , Medill McCormick , attended preparatory school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently that the Colonel 's distrust of England stems from those early days . A boyhood playmate recalls that even earlier , in Chicago , he and Bertie avidly read boys ' books like The Boys of ' 76 in which all Yankees were embattled heroes and all British were scheming redcoats . The elder Medill had been intensely patriotic ; so was the Colonel 's father . Bertie 's former playmate recalls , " They were always twisting the Iion 's tail , and Bertie simply carries on . " In Chicago Bertie lived with his parents on the Gold Coast . Most of his playmates were named McCormick : nearly a dozen McCormick families , all powerful , lived within a radius of four blocks near Ontario and Pine ( today renamed Wabash but still referred to , significantly , by family members as Pine ) . While his father served as ambassador to Austria , Russia , and France , Bertie lived in Chicago with various relatives , including his grandfather Joseph Medill ( who died in 1899 ) , and his aunt and uncle , the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to Groton School and then to Yale . Years later , Franklin D. Roosevelt banteringly disclaimed to a Tribune reporter responsibility for the Colonel 's education , since the Colonel had been one form ahead of Roosevelt at Groton . The common story goes , of course , that the enmity between the two men began at Groton . One classmate confirms this but is unable to document it ; and the legend seems contradicted by the Tribune 's early neutrality toward Roosevelt . It is said the Colonel felt that even a Democrat would be better than Hoover . ( The Tribune 's chief objection to Roosevelt in 1932 was its doubt that he would make a President sufficiently strong to deal with the obstructionist Congress. ) 111 ER= was graduated from Yale in 1903 . He took up residence at the Union League Club in Chicago and entered Northwestern University Law School . But everybody in his ward was in politics ? his family and neighbors had come to feel civic duty almost obligatory ? and in 1904 Bertie left school and ran successfully for alderman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of trustees , an office he held until 1910 , despite critics who called him " Czar McCormick " when he instituted administrative reforms modeled on military lines and designed , he claimed , to increase efficiency . He apparently did a good and conscientious job , familiarizing himself with every detail of the operation of the district . It was at this time that he met a young Irish construction boss , Edward J. Kelly , who knocked down an obstreperous workman who was a son-in-law of a powerful Republican politician . McCormick , though himself a proteg6 of the politician , praised Kelly 's courage and promoted him instead of firing him . Today Kelly is mayor of Chicago and , though a Democrat , he has the support of the Colonel . It has been said that the Colonel made Ed Kelly . If , as some believe , the Colonel 's lifelong ambition has been to be Illinois ' Mark Hanna , it is perhaps a tragedy of his career that Kelly turned out to be boss of the machine that carries Cook County for That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune 's support of the Mayor as simply a cynical bipartisan deal overlook the Colonel 's intense loyalty to old friends he admires . A member of the City Council from 1904 to 1906 , McCormick later served with the Chicago Charter Convention and the Chicago Plan Commission . He was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1907 and helped organize a law firm which today is the largest in Chicago and is still counsel for the Tribune ( as well as for the antagonistic Times and Sun , when their interests do not conflict with the Tribune 's ) . But his career as a lawyer and public servant was cut short in 1910 when Robert W. Patterson , son-in-law of Joseph Medill and editor of the Tribune , died . Bertie 's elder brother , Medill McCormick , had been aiding Patterson at the paper , but he wanted to run for senator ( which he did , successfully , becoming one of the " irreconcilables " who torpedoed the League of Nations ) ; and so Bertie , who was then twenty-nine , and his cousin , Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World 's Greatest Newspaper " appeared on page one , where it remains . James Keeley , the veteran managing editor , stayed on to run the paper until 1914 ; thereafter the cousins were in full charge . The combination of the cousins was an effective but not an especially happy one . Patterson was a socialist and enjoyed donning disreputable clothing and rubbing shoulders with the common people ? activities of which the Colonel has never been accused . Unable to agree , they took over the editorial page in alternate months , with somewhat startling results . It was Patterson who developed the comic strips which have been one of the reasons for the Tribune 's huge circulation . The Colonel was more interested in the mechanical departments . He hired experts to head them , invented improvements in printing , and bought vast timberlands in Canada and a fleet of lake freighters ( some of which fly the Union Jack he distrusts ) . To this day the Colonel is a publisher 's publisher , familiar with the mechanical operations of newspaper publication as he was familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cousins assumed full 0 control of the Tribune when the European war broke out . Since youth the Colonel had been a student of military affairs , an admirer of things military , and a horseman . Commissioned a major in the First Cavalry , Illinois National Guards , he went to England early in 1915 . In London he married a Chicago woman named Arnie Adams whose divorce a little earlier from her husband , a relative of McCormick 's , had been bitter . He lunched with British leaders , including Asquith , whom he told that only " society " in America was very strongly pro-Ally and that the nation as a whole was for America first and was unsympathetic toward all warring nations . Even then he was critical of England 's military prowess . He visited the Russian front and wrote a book , With the Russian Army , which he dedicated to the Grand Duke Nicholas ; in it he expressed admiration for the Russian army , said that the spectacle of Cossacks mounting and swinging into line could be equaled only by international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted the wine of death , and its flavor will be forever in my throat . " How heartily he quaffed the wine of death has been the subject of controversy . Sent to the Mexican border , he won a reputation as a good drillmaster and disciplinarian who held himself aloof from his brother officers . Later , as a major in the First Division , he was attached to Pershing 's headquarters staff in France . Subsequently he was elevated to lieutenant colonel and colonel . His detractors tell a yarn to the effect that the soldiers at the front became so weary of caring for his dog that they poisoned it , that the Colonel believed it had been taken to Paris , and that he went there in search of it , lamentably , at the very time that the Battle of Cantigny was about to begin ; but the fact is that the Colonel did fight in the battle . Not without reason did he name his suburban estate Cantigny . He was sent back to the States to train troops and draw up a handbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war he was commandant of Fort Sheridan , near Chicago . In 1923 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for leadership , executive ability , and supervision of training and discipline . To this day he signs his articles in the Tribune " Colonel Robert R. McCormick " and his employees invariably address him as Colonel . Every year he entertains the members of his First Division at a picnic at his estate . His affection for his old comrades in arms is indisputably genuine . Though called a " tin soldier " by his enemies , the Colonel is a serious student of military affairs . He published a life of Grant which , though perhaps insufficiently critical , was documented with extreme care . In doing the research for it the Colonel visited battlefields and paced off distances . His library on the Civil War is extensive and he contributes scholarly pieces to the Tribune on Civil War military operations . Reading occupies more of his few spare hours than social functions , and he sometimes abandons his guests abruptly to retire to his library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively with soberly factual accounts of the present war ( " Tonight I am back again in the Pacific " ) ; this summer some of his baffled associates were wondering if he did not intend to turn to more inflammable material as the 1944 campaign waxed hot . III Y THE end of the First World War the Colonel and his cousin , Captain Patterson , had conceived the idea of establishing the tabloid New York News . ( It is said they made the decision to publish it while sitting on a manure pile in France . ) Whether they established it to get out of each other 's hair , or to incur a deficit that would reduce their tax liability on the huge Tribune profits , or simply to expand their endeavors , in 1925 Patterson went to New York to edit the News ( which , far from being a money-loser , achieved the largest circulation in America ) . The cousins , as trustees of the Medal Trust , retained theoretical influence over each other 's papers ; their so-called Tribune group established the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macfadden for an unsuccessful Detroit daily , and bought the Washington Times and Herald for Patterson 's sister Cissy , who shared with them and Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms the income from the Medill Trust . But since 1925 the Colonel has been supreme in Chicago and in Chicago alone . The two thousand shares of Tribune stock are closely held by the Trust and a few individuals . Each share is probably worth about $37,000 . Under Colonel McCormick the Tribune has become enormously successful and the Colonel confers daily , a few special writers see him occasionally . Among them are the political editor , special assignment men like Philip Kinsley ( who is now engaged in writing the Tribune 's official history ) , and the farm and automobile and aviation editors ( their specialties are the Colonel 's hobbies ) . The Colonel piloted his own plane until he cracked up near his farm ( where he had a private airport ) and his Iate wife induced him to desist ; he continued to fly with a private pilot until the war emergency , when he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the Colonel 's office is adorned with old prints of Chicago and the flag that flew over the Tribune in Civil War days , and it is guarded by an armed sentry and a secretary . He really has two offices . The larger is equipped with several rows of theater seats dominated by the Colonel 's desk ( on a dais ) , a unique table covered with a red-and-yellow marble slab . The adjoining inner office contains a fireplace and is furnished more comfortably , like a study . The Colonel always wears his coat at work . His desk is usually clean . While talking he toys with an ornamental letter opener . It has been said that nobody ever has talked to him longer than thirty minutes . His daily conferences with his executives are brief , and reporters called to his office do little but listen , sometimes only for a few seconds . All have been embarrassed on their first visit to his office ; on turning to leave they can not find the door . The paneling seems unbroken , and they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret door . Some consider this door a precaution against physical attack , but it is probably just a foible : the tales of the Colonel 's fear of assassination are exaggerated and born of ignorance . Though not a good speaker the Colonel assiduously belabors luncheon and other clubs with his gospel that the New Deal is ruining the nation . His speeches are not always as effective as his paper 's hard-hitting or insidious editorials ; and his letters are sometimes ill-advised , as once when he wrote to a friend claiming personal credit for introducing machine guns , mechanization , automatic rifles , and airplane artillery spotting into the army , and introducing the R.O.T.C. into the schools ; for being the first to advocate an alliance with Canada ; for " getting the Marines out of Shanghai " and acquiring Atlantic bases ; but admitting he had failed " to get the Army out of the Philippines " or to persuade the Navy that airplanes could destroy battleships . Readers who share the Colonel 's views like to believe that he writes all the Tribune 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read them all before they are published , and he writes some . His prose is like his private speech : blunt and forceful . Late one night when he had been out driving through the city he stalked into the local room wearing a big overcoat and driving gauntlets and followed by his dog . He sat down at a typewriter , pounded away a few minutes , flung aside his gauntlets , and typed a little more . He is a big man at a typewriter . Presently he ripped the paper from the machine , handed it to the center desk , said , " Put that in ? the editorial page , " and strode out . He had written about five lines deploring the manner in which " one of the smaller newspapers " was disfiguring elevated pillars in the Loop with advertisements for a serial story . The editorial page was replated . He ordinarily enters the city room once every two weeks or so , usually with his dog Lottie , an ancient German shepherd , at his heel . In 1937 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at its height , the Colonel came into the city room and told the staffers working on the story that the union men were not strikers but rioters and were to be so labeled in the paper . He was so genuinely enraged by the " riot " that his voice trembled . People who have seen him in such situations have no doubt of his sincerity . .2k FEW years ago when the Tribune , like most newspapers , was campaigning against syphilis , a reader 's letter wondered how many Tribune employees had syphilis . The Colonel promptly ordered a staff-wide blood test . Yet he is not humorless . One afternoon he strolled into the city room and , remarking he had heard that Colonel Knox had ordered his News to differ with the Tribune on every question , boomed with brief laughter , " Ho ho ; he 'll be at a disadvantage next week when we come out against syphilis ! " Nevertheless , when matters of high principle are at stake the Colonel is grim , as when he read Rhode Island out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Tower after the Democratic majority in the legislature of that state had ousted the Republican members of the supreme court . ( The Colonel 's lawyers advised him that defacing the American flag was a criminal offense ; and , in order to sew the stars on again , employees had to haul down the flag atop the Tower , causing a deluge of apprehensive telephone calls . ) In 1936 the Colonel organized the Volunteers , lay speakers in Landon 's behalf , among them many of the elderly ladies who lionize the Colonel . As the campaign closed the Colonel predicted that history would record that it had been the Volunteers who saved the nation in ' 36 ; and a Tribune employee composed a limerick which , depending for its rhyme scheme on the Colonel 's accent , gained such wide currency that the author became alarmed . It went : There was a young man from Topeka Whose campaign grew weakah and weakah , Till the Volunteers came And made every old dame A bellringah , singah , or speakah . IV M RS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , the Colonel 's almost never . One veteran society reporter says she never has seen him at a social function . His friends say that , especially in these times , he is too busy for " society . " He once employed a man whose duties included squiring Mrs. McCormick to the opera , horse shows , benefits , and other affairs which the Colonel refused to attend . His chauffeur also took her to the opera . The Colonel and Mrs. McCormick frequently rode to hounds on the Wheaton estate , and when she died about five years ago he gave her a military funeral and buried her body on the estate . But , unlike him , she preferred to maintain residence in the three-storey , brick-and-limestone , ivy-grown town house . Once she entertained Queen Marie in their home but the Colonel refused to come downstairs . Yet he tried to please his wife in many ways , not always with success . Once he arranged a tableau depicting the venality of Prohibition agents and presented it in his town house after a dinner party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hugely funny but Mrs. McCormick was not amused , nor were the guests . The Colonel likes pretty women and has been on friendly terms with at least one woman in radio , stage , or motion pictures ; and he is capable of little gestures of gallantry . It is said that once , driving into the city on Roosevelt Road , which runs through a slum area , he espied an elderly Polish woman laden down with parcels , commanded his chauffeur to stop , himself alighted and , bowing low , offered to assist the woman . ( She refused . ) He has an old-fashioned courtliness about him . Once at a WGN conference he asked the ladies to leave the room and then discoursed before the men on the state of the theater , alluding fleetingly and stiffly to chorus girls ' endeavors to attract gentlemen . Once , knowing that a woman friend would soon arrive at her summer house , he staffed it for her and filled it with flowers . These are facets of his forbidding personality usually hidden from public view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has as many as fifteen people for dinner and perhaps another dozen afterward , for he invites friends to bring their guests , who these days are often servicemen , strangers to him . Yet in the neighboring town of Wheaton few people know him . The Colonel lunches occasionally at the Chicago Club but more often at the Overset Club , an informal gathering of Tribune executives and their guests in a private dining room in the Tribune Tower . He is on intimate terms with none of his numerous relatives except , perhaps , Chauncey McCormick , who lives near him at Wheaton ; nevertheless , the family is , as one of its members has said , extremely loyal in time of crisis . His friends say that since his wife 's death , although he has withdrawn almost completely from " society , " he has become more tolerant in his personal human relations . " He is mellowing , " one said . Strangers who have met him prepared to dislike him have been surprised at his charm ; Marquis Childs ? who is surely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shy , almost impish " smile , his grave courtesy . Now and then he dines in town with a few friends at a club or private home but almost invariably he leaves by nine or nine-thirty , often to go down to the paper . Once he was seen dining alone at a Russian restaurant ; he was clipping the Tribune . T F THE Colonel makes large contributions to charities or other public causes from his private fortune , he does so anonymously , with one exception : after his wife 's death he gave several valuable paintings to the Art Institute . He refused to contribute to the Red Cross drive at Wheaton a few months ago , calling attention to the Tribune 's large donation . The chairman wrote again , asking the contribution not from McCormick the publisher but from McCormick the Wheaton farmer . Presently he received a check for $1,000 and a stiff letter from the Colonel 's secretary : the chairman 's importunities had in no way influenced the Colonel 's decision to contribute . The Colonel 's admirers call attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such big charitable ventures as the Golden Gloves Tournament and the Chicagoland Music Festival ; they say that in this way the Colonel performs more good works than any other man in Chicago . MOST of his closer friends are wealthy old-line Republicans . While some rank-and-file party members may dislike him , he is in almost complete control of the party machinery in Illinois , and men like Governor Green and Senator Brooks are considered his mouthpieces . His reporter at Springfield is called by other newspapermen his errand boy . Because of his anti-war line before Pearl Harbor the Colonel inevitably attracted the lunatic fringe of isolationists ; and so it has been natural that , just as the Colonel sees dark New Deal conspiracies everywhere , his enemies should view him as the spider at the center of a web of Dillings and Vierecks . Actually , the Colonel has little patience with such persons . He uses them effectively when they suit his needs , but without personal enthusiasm . Publicity seekers like Representative Clare Hoffman are first astonished to find themselves on page one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will keep them there . The Dillings have made it appear that they are close to the Colonel but they are not , and on at least one occasion the Colonel 's secretary told Mrs. billing that the Colonel had no time to see a hysterical woman . The Colonel championed her cause vigorously , just as he had sought to avenge Walter Liggett 's , because he felt that , whatever her views , the government 's attempt to throttle her constituted an attack on the fundamental freedom of speech and the press . One can not smile at this , for the Colonel has for many years been an outstanding and effective defender of the press 's freedom . V T HAS been said of the Tribune ( as of other successful newspapers ) that it is read so widely because it antagonizes so many people . But if nearly a million Midwesterners believed it a sinister force , would they buy it ? Hardly . The truth would seem to be different : the Colonel 's huge power in the Midwest is largely based on the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may not go all the way with him , but his prejudices ? his narrow nationalism , his distrust of foreigners and especially Europeans and more especially the English , and his detestation of many labor activities , of federal intervention in economic affairs , and of liberal ideas generally ? coincide with and inflame their prejudices . This fact , added to the power which he wields by virtue of his inherited wealth , his great family prestige , and his sound business ability , makes him at the moment one of the strongest forces in American public life . It might be argued that Colonel McCormick is one of the few men in America ? perhaps the only man ? to combine two divergent strains in American newspaper-dom . One of these strains is that of personal journalism : it was strongly represented in the great editors of bygone times who used their newspapers as weapons with which to fight for their personal convictions . The other strain is that of hardheaded manufacturing and publishing with a sharp eye to profits . During the past generation or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men who were not journalists at heart so much as industrial operators who happened to manufacture newspapers instead of , let us say , girdles . They may have had strong personal opinions on public matters , but on the job they concentrated on finding the answers to one question , " Will it pay ? " Not so Colonel McCormick . He not only knows what will sell and how to manage his big business shrewdly ; he also knows what he believes and is willing to go to hell for it . This is obviously an exceedingly strong combination , under one condition : his ideas must be basically acceptable to his readers . True , many people say they read the Tribune news pages for the complete news reports but never read the editorial page ; but one does not need to read the editorial page to find out what Colonel McCormick believes ; one can find editorials daily on page one , disguised as news stories . The Colonel is a man of inventive bent and a dccp knowledge of the mechanics of publishing who happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great part of Midwest public opinion has gone back into the past almost as far as he has .
