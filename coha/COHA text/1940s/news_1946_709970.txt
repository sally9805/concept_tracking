txt BIG FOUR END JAM ON TRIESTE POLICE ; MOLOTOV ACCEDES Governor Gets Right to Rule Force , Suspend Laws and Appeal to Security Council RUSSIAN QUALIFIES ASSENT Pegs Accord to Recall of U. S. and British Troops  --  Balks on Power to Halt Subversion By LANSING % ARREN The Foreign Ministers of the Big Four yesterday broke the deadlock on the powers of the proposed Governor of Trieste and the policing of the Free Territory . These issues had blocked all progress on the peace treaties for a week . They did not reach complete agreement on the statute of Trieste , but resolved the stalemate on so many points that they were again hopeful of reaching an accord in their Council meeting at the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria . Foreign Minister Molotov made several major concessions , but maneuvered so skillfully as to safeguard his position in the event of a future blockade . The Western powers obtained acceptance of their point of view in several cases , but yielded in matters of phrasing to respect the Soviet view . A clean-cut victory was obtained by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the police , suspend legislation and appeal to the Security Council on measures he considered necessary to protect the statute . Objection on Major Point Mr. Molotov declined , however , to accept one provision of capital importance . This would not only allow the Governor to act in matters affecting the statute but also to halt subversive activities that might undermine the regime . The Soviet Union 's agreement was made contingent on fixing a date for the withdrawal of British and United States occupation troops . Besides this important issue , there are a number of others on the statute that the Ministers have yet to discuss . These include the Soviet claim for the right of Yugoslays and Italians to separate zones in the free port and for a customs union between the Free Territory and Yugoslavia . A series of the provisions discussed yesterday was referred to the Council deputies . They will meet this morning to draft them , in accordance with the substance of agreements made . The Ministers will not resume their discussion on Trieste until tomorrow afternoon . The early part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council suite was spent in close-range sparring between Mr. Molotov and Secretary of State Byrnes . After this contest , which the United States delegate won on points , Mr. Molotov appeared unusually affable , and work went at a rapid pace . Area of Agreement The following is a list of the principal decisions taken yesterday : ( 1 ) The Governor of the Free Territory will have the power to appoint and dismiss the chief of police . ( 2 ) Members of the police force will be appointed and dismissed by the chief of police . ( 3 ) The police chief will take his orders from the local council of government in normal times , but the wording makes it plain that this is a delegation of the Governor 's authority over the police that he may assume immediately in any emergency . ( 4 ) The Governor will receive reports and keep in contact with the chief of police and will be kept informed of the instructions given him by the council of government . ( 5 ) The Governor may suspend administrative measures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to an immediate report to the Security Council of the United Nations . The Governor may , in matters affecting his responsibilities , propose administrative measures ; in case of a conflict with the council of government , the decision may be referred by either side to the Security Council . These , on the whole , represent acceptance of the claims of the Paris conference plan as modified in the latest French draft . They contain some concession to the Soviet point of view . The Western powers originally // wished it stated that the police chief would be " subordinate " to the Governor . Stubborn resistance of the Soviet delegate resulted in the elimination of this phrase , although the Western powers appeared satisfied that the text insured subordination in fact . Mr. Molotov also scored an important point when he obtained deletion of the phrase that would have allowed the Governor to proclaim a state of siege . This is implied , according to the Western delegates , in his power to take measures that he deems fit in an emergency . Compromise on Executive Veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The British , French and United States delegates were in favor of allowing the Governor to suspend and initiate legislation affecting the statute and rights of the inhabitants . In the agreement he may suspend any orders of the local government that he considers dangerous , though the Soviet Government wished them to become operative subject to suspension by the Security Council . Under the decision taken , the suspension is immediate , sub ' to the Security Council 's final decision . On measures the Governor may propose , both the council and the Governor may appeal at once to the Security Council to act . The principal failure in the agreements reached yesterday is on the implementation of the Governor 's powers in execution of any measures he may take . The loophole maintained in this section is of capital importance and is capable of blocking all progress toward an accord . Though the long and persisting deadlock was broken , Mr. Molotov refused to yield on what Mr. Byrnes had always considered an essential feature of the accord : It is in Article 9 of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This article defines the emergency circumstances in which the Governor would be empowered to act . Mr. Molotov accepted the provision covering matters affecting the integrity and independence of the Free Territory of Trieste , but declined to grant that there might be an emergency in a threat to " human and civic rights . " The provision would allow the Governor to check ' internal propaganda and subversive activities endangering such rights . Four-Month Limit Asked Mr. Molotov , after much argument , declared that there would not be much difficulty in settling this clause , provided the Council could agree on a limit of four months after treaty went into force for the withdrawal of the Allied troops . He indirectly raised the principal remaining obstacle to settlement on Trieste . In the Western view , the disturbed condition in the Free Territory precludes the fixing of such a date . The Western powers have accepted the provision that the territory shall be demilitarized , but they contend that the occupation should continue until the Security Council is satisfied that conditions are such that the troops of occupation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to this point would permit a last-minute revision of the numerous concessions made . Agreement in substance but not on wording was reached on other points . On the question of foreign relations of the Free Territory , the Soviet delegation wished to limit the Territory 's action to granting patents and on consular exequators . Holds Restrictions Not Needed Mr. Byrnes declared that it was necessary to make sure that the Free Territory Government could not enter into agreements or treaties that would violate the statute or guarantees of human rights . He proposed inserting here the Governor 's right of veto . This was among the subjects referred to the deputies . Another debate centered on appointment of the judiciary . The Americans , Britons and French contended that they did not wish to bar an ultimate decision for election of judges , but they thought it unwise in the initial period . Mr. Byrnes suggested a term of five years before such elections would be permitted . The deputies were instructed to draft a compromise .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
