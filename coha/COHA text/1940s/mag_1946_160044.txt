The two huge green waves , lashed by some abysmal fury , reared up and blotted the sky from view . They seemed about to crash into the quiet , pleasant room , threatening to shatter the fragile decor , engulf the politely conversing statesmen . <P> These waves of destiny ( in oil on canvas by Painter Frederick Waugh ) ornamented the delegates ' bar in the U.N . General Assembly building and served as an inescapable reminder to statesmen who might forget over Scotch- &-soda; that U.N . stands in the midst of apocalyptic forces . The picture of the waves was called The Roaring Forties . <P> New Tune . Some of the world 's Assemblymen had come to Manhattan last week half expecting the dizzy glories of ticker tape and drum majorettes . But the New York of the Fitful Forties received them soberly , gave them a welcome of cautious hope . The mood of the delegates exactly fitted this welcome . <P> Cautious skepticism , rather than hope , dictated the organist 's choice of an overture . It was To Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise , which opened the first U.N . meeting at San Francisco . As the delegates gathered in the old New York City World 's Fair Building at Flushing Meadows , they beheld another omen . Dominating the vast , greenish Assembly Hall was an oddly contorted map of the world ( in cartographer 's lingo : " a north polar azimuthal equidistant projection " ) which made the U.S. and Canada look relatively normal while the rest of the troubled planet was either upside down or misshapen . <P> New Tone . The greatest surprise were the Russians , who acted more jovially than at any previous international gathering . There were some flurries , such as their request for added police protection of their Glen Cove , L.I . estate , and the occasion , at Flushing , when indomitable Foreign Minister Molotov almost walked straight into a wall where he thought a door should have been . But it was perhaps typical of the new Russian mood that he smilingly permitted himself to be guided along the right path by Interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Molotov 's fellow delegates could hardly get used to his frequent smiles and handshakes , suspected that at times he even hovered on the brink of a backslap . Cracked he : " This is my first vacation since the Revolution . " Oscar Englund , a waiter at the Waldorf , found Molotov gracious enough to give an autograph-though Englund later lost his job for his audacity . " So what ? " said he . " That 's history , what I saw . " <P> Perhaps the most spectacular gesture of conciliation was made by Russia 's cynical , ductile Andrei Vishinsky , who led a five-man Soviet delegation into St. Patrick 's Cathedral to attend a Solemn Pontifical Mass for the United Nations on the Feast of Christ the King. * <P> Materialist Vishinsky heard Msgr . Joseph F. Flanelly denounce " impious and rank materialists . " After Mass Vishinsky bowed , smiled and warmly clasped the hand of the Most Rev. J. Francis A. Mclntyre . The new Russian line might turn out to be long or short , straight or crooked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy hand .
