Grown men started last week when the Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey Circus opened in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . The Circus had changed to look as fabulously beautiful as they had imagined it had looked when they were children . The Brothers John and Henry Ringling North , their imaginations inspired by Designer Norman Bel Geddes , had enchanted the traditional " Spec , " the great opening parade . <P> No longer was there the usual procession of chipped wagons and shabby cavalry . <P> Instead the arena was transformed into a nursery lotus land . Even the tanbark had changed color , to a bright blue . Over it , one after another , rolled glorious floats and glittering equipages of white and gold , bearing hundreds of characters from Mother Goose . Wheeling and cavorting came Old King Cole , in canopied splendor suspended between four elephants ; ranks of pretty maids with cockleshells ; a cow that literally leaped over the moon . <P> It was like the lovely dream circus in Billy Rose 's Jumbo , only five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the less mature it was staggering . Said one young spectator for publication : " It was all good . I ca n't remember . " Lest the Big Show be beautified out of its hallowed form , in other acts Trainer Alfred Court presides over snarling panthers and lions who pose , with noble indifference , among dogs and bears , including the bruin who apparently gets ecstatically drunk on a bottle of beer . Elly Ardelty , netless , stands on her pretty blonde head on a trapeze at the very top of the circus heavens . Massimilliano Truzzi juggles knives , flaming torches and the spectators ' nerves . Half a hundred elephants galumph around the ring and take a bow in unison . Hubert Castle staggers like a drunken clubman on his tightwire . And in his air-conditioned , chrome steel cage in the menagerie , Gargantua , the 550-lb. gorilla who at eleven years is probably not yet old enough to mate with M'Toto , his presumed gorillass ( TIME , March 3 ) , makes the angriest faces in the world and then wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his huge back and buttocks . <P> In the adjoining cage M'Toto manages to look a lot like him and still be labeled " cute . " Last week M'Toto 's former owner , swank , socialite Mrs. E. Kenneth Hoyt , traveled from her Havana estate to see M'Toto and supervise a light lunch of eggs , salad , cup custard and a pound of filet mignon . Backing out of M'Toto 's presence , Mrs. Hoyt brushed against the one side of Gargantua 's cage that is not glass-enclosed . Gargantua thrust a huge hand between the bars and , with a single twitch of a clawed finger , tore Mrs. Hoyt 's smart costume off her back .
