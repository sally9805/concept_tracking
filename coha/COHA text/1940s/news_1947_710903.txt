txt AGENDA ORDER SET Council Reaches Accord After Russian Hints Others Plan for War MARSHALL SPURNS CHARGE Suggests Russian Does Not ' Believe Own Accusations ? Urges Logical Talk statements by Molotov and garshall in London , Page 2 . By HERBERT L. MAT HEWS Spedal to TECS Haw loss Tom . LONDON , Nov. ** Council of Foreign Ministers witnessed a great explosion today , with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov making all the expected accusations against the three other powers aS anti-democratic and imperialistic and even as fomenting war . The answer came with considerable force and unanimity from the other side and especially from United States Secretary of State Marshall , who even flatly stated that he was convinced Mr. Molotov did not believe the allegations he had made . Thereupon all four delegations ca/Mly got down to work . They have accomplished more in these first two days than in a relative period at any previous meeting of the Foreign Ministers Council . Yesterday they agreed on the items of =their agenda and today they settled-the order in which the items were to be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Foreign Minister ? deputies , who are to report back Dec. 2 . Tass Spreads Molotov 's Speech At first glance it looked like a victorious day for Mr. Molotov : He launched a typically , Russian diatribe , which the Tass agency quickly made available to the world : He nominally yielded on Austria to the extent of letting it be put first on the'agenda , lout got it immediately shelved for a week , during which things may happen . Finally he insisted that the procedure for the German peace treaty be the first thing to be discussed and the others agreed , although Secretary Marshall made it clear he considered the question of far less importance than the economic and political structure of Germany . However , Mr. Molotov 's successes are hardly likely to gain him any ground , His diatribe brought replies that were , each in their separate ways , devastating . Moreover , the United States , British and French delegates refused to take Mr. Molotov seriously . The quiet but firm way in which French Foreign Minister Bidault lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? there was no weakness there . Westerners Avoid Wasting Time If the Austrian treaty is shelved , at least this conference will not adjourn until it has been thoroughly discussed . And for the rest , the - United States , British and French delegations gave way simply to get on with the work and cease wasting time . They really do not care much which question is discussed first or last so long as all of them are discussed speedily and thoroughly . So there was that extraordinary contrast today of a ding dong battle of words to begin with and a solid constructive piece of negotiation to end . When Mr. Molotov , who was in the chair , said he wanted to make a statement concerning the Soviet attitude on Germany , everybody knew just about exactly what was coming , and Secretary ' Marshall even began immediately making notes for his reply . The other delegations clearly felt that Mr. Molo tov had received his orders froii Moscow and that he just had to be allowed to let off steam . Even so , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some countries , said Mr. Molotov , that are striving for a democratic peace and there are others striving for an imperialist peace , which " inev= // itably leads to a division of countries into two categories : the dominating powers on the one hand and the subject and enslaved countries on the other , and that in turn leads to new international conflicts and wars which harbor the danger of a third world war . " He spoke vaguely of " another plan in relation to Germany which aims at preventing economic restoration for fear that Germany might become a rival in European and world , market , * * * a plan that would mean an attempt to exploit one or another part of Germany as a military or war industrial base for one or another future military adventure in Europe . " Molotov Bars Treaty Delay He concluded on the disturbing note that " the formation of an all-German democratic government can not be postponed any longer " and that the organization of a future peace conference must also be immediately examined . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secretary Marshall very calmly and suavely began what was to be a powerful counter-attack . He said that the people of the United States wanted a German peace treaty as quickly as possible and while the Austrian treaty was not comparable in importance it could be quickly reached . Secretary Marshall had condemned Soviet propaganda in Chicago before coming here and is known to have made up his mind not to get himself involved in a mud-slinging contest with Mr. Molotov . Today he quietly said he could see no point in Mr. Molotov 's repetitions of allegations about imperialism and " whatever he may say Z would remain convinced that the Soviet delegate does not really believe his allegations . " He then contemptuously added that he was not interested in such discussions , " Let us get down to work and drop this business of alleging evil motives which are figments of propaganda , not of the mind , and logically endeavor to reach an agreement for the benefit of the entire world , " he added . Mr. Bidault was brief and equally effective in his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations had contributed very much to the harmony of their meeting or had been at all helpful . Then , with characteristic French logic , he pointed to the contradiction in Mr. Molotov 's charges . He said that on one hand Mr. Molotov had made references to obstacles being put in the way of the German economic rehabilitation , and on the other , of efforts to prepare Germany for war . Neither charge , said M. Bidault , is correct . As was to be expected , Mr. Bevin was broad and heavy-handed . But it was he who successfully made a joke of the whole business . First , however , he seriously discussed what to do about Austria and It was his suggestion that led to today 's solution of the Austrian treaty question . Then he turned to what he called " this constant talk about imperialism . " ? " I can only support what my two colleagues of the United States and French delegations have said , " he declared . " We are so used to being called warmongers . and everything : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union . As for the rest of us , we all came from down below , I suppose . " Even Molotov Laughs : at Jibe Everyone was laughing by this time , including Mr. Molotov . Mr. Bevin went on to say that " if you treat these charges With the humor they deserve we may get on with our business . " He sarcastically suggested that some deputies be appointed to define democracy , imperialism and sovereignty : . Then. , he read a passage froM a-British document circulated du-Ing the Moscow conference that demanded that Germany should be forced to guarantee " freedom of . speech , freedom of the press and radio , freedom of assembly , freedom of movement and communication , freedom in religious affairs , freedom of association for lawful . purposes , and freedom of the judiciary , freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment . " " That , " said Mr. Bevin , as his parting shot , . " does not look very much like being . anti-democratic . " They all had let off steam and everybody was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their serious business and very quickly agreed on their agenda and the-order : in which the items were to be discussed . They are as follows : ? ( 1 ) Austrian treaty . ( 2 ) Preparatien of a German peace treaty : ( 3 ) Economic principles . ( 4 ) Form and scope of provisional German Government . ( 5 ) Implementation of . Moscow decisions on demilitarization of Germany . ( 6 ) United States draft disarmament and demilitarization treaty . They also agreed that the Council was not required to complete the discussion of any one question ) before going on to the next : ? was 5:30 o'clock . Yesterday , the Foreign Ministers had agreed to hold their sessions from 3:30 to 6:30 but Mr. Molotov suggested they recess and begin afresh tomorrow with the second item . The others shrewdly suspected that Mr. Molotov was preparing another long harangue and had not finished writing it .
