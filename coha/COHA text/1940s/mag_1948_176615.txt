When it was all over , the Hon. Sir David Smith , chancellor of the University of New Zealand , confessed to a vague feeling of disappointment : " Not a single joke ! I rather prefer the way we do it in our British universities-more zest . " Last week 's inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower as president of 194-year-old Columbia University was as solemn as a funeral , as impressive as a coronation , and as carefully mapped as an invasion . <P> As the bells of St. Paul 's Chapel tolled the zero hour ( 2 p.m. ) , a 700-man academic task force debouched from Nicholas Murray Butler Library and cut across the campus north to Low Memorial Library . In the procession marched the presidents and representatives of 310 U.S. and 38 foreign universities and colleges , ranged in order of seniority-from the University of Bologna ( founded 1088 ) down to New York State University , which so far exists only on paper . Oxford was represented by British Ambassador Sir Oliver Franks , the University of Pennsylvania by President Harold Stassen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nearsighted spectators in the crowd of 19,000 greeted with applause and whispers of " There 's Ike ! " ) . <P> A Good Omen . At the end , just in front of the university macebearer , came General Ike himself , wearing the hood of an honorary LL.D . ( trimmed in purple , for Law , and lined in blue &; white , for Columbia ) . A ripple of applause followed Eisenhower down the aisle ; he grinned at old friends like General Omar Bradley and Admiral Thomas C. Kincaid , and saluted Elder Statesman Bernard Baruch . <P> Under an overcast sky , Ike took his place on the Low Library steps-at the right hand of Frederic K. Coykendall , chairman of Columbia 's trustees , who was enthroned on a great horsehair armchair that had once belonged to Ben Franklin . Four times Ike heard his praises ( and Columbia 's ) loudly sung ; each time he tipped his gold-tasseled mortarboard to the speaker . Then Chairman Coykendall surrendered to President Eisenhower the university charter , the keys and the horsehair throne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun smiled through the clouds . <P> A Bad Cold . Ike donned horn-rimmed spectacles to read his 20-minute inaugural address , stopping once to snuffle into a handkerchief because of a bad cold . The new president 's address was proper , unexciting , and meant to reassure everyone that he had laid down his sword &; shield . Said Eisenhower : " If this were a land where the military profession is a weapon of tyranny or aggression-its members an elite caste dedicated to its own perpetuation-a lifelong soldier could hardly assume my present role . But in our nation the Army is the servant of the people ... Hence , among us , the soldier who becomes an educator . . . enters no foreign field . . . " Eisenhower was going to see to it , he said , that Columbia remained a bastion of freedom : " Only by education in the apparently obvious fundamentals of freedom can doubt and fear be resolved . . . There will be no administrative suppression or distortion . . . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
