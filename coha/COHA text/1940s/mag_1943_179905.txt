BATTLE OF THE PACIFIC <P> U.S. readers who had thought of the New Guinea campaign as an exclusively American show were pulled up sharply last week by announcement of the campaign 's casualty totals . The U.S. suffered 4,319 casualties ( 2,175 killed , 2,144 wounded ) ; Australia 6,212 ( 2,379 killed , 3,833 wounded ) . The principal U.S. contribution was in the air , and the American casualties included perhaps 1,000 airmen . On the ground , the Australian loss was almost twice as great as that of the two U.S. divisions in the campaign .
