The Navy this week proudly released an artist 's drawing of its new supercarrier . Unnamed as yet , the CVA-58 will cost an estimated $124 million . Though the money is still to be appropriated , the Navy has scraped together enough to start laying its keel by early 1949 . From its decks , the Navy claimed , planes carrying the atomic bomb will be able to reach and bomb 92% of all possible targets anywhere in the world . <P> The new carrier will be the longest ( 1,090 ft. ) , and the biggest ( 65,000 tons ) naval vessel afloat , and flat as a flounder . To reduce the ship 's visibility and provide extra deck space , the lofty island of wartime U.S. carriers will be shrunk to two turret-like structures which telescope below deck level when not in use . The carrier 's gill-like funnels are flush with the armored flight deck ; it will have four catapults to fling its planes into the air . Like the 45,000-ton Midway-class carriers , it will be too wide ( 190 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all carriers , the CVA-58 would not go it alone , but would have to operate as part of a carrier task force , to be accompanied by 16 destroyers ( to provide a radar and antisubmarine screen ) , four to six cruisers for antiaircraft and surface support and at least two smaller carriers to carry fighter planes . The CVA-58 will probably carry about the equivalent of an Air Force bomber group , of which the Air Force has 16 . One spread of torpedoes or a near-miss from an atomic bomb would put it out of action .
