Canada 's third political party , the socialistic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation , polled but 8% of the votes at the last general election , against 55% for Mackenzie King 's Liberal party and 31% for the Conservatives . But the sands of Canadian political popularity have been shifting since the 1940 election . A recent poll , showed CCF strength up to 21% , against a dwindling 35% for the Liberals and a stationary 31% for the revamped **25;2062;TOOLONG . CCF demands have become important . <P> Last week in a convention at Montreal the CCF of militant Quebec Province adopted a resolution demanding public ownership of all power resources in Canada . The resolution singled out the controversial $106,000,000 Shipshaw development in the hinterlands of Quebec ( world 's largest power dam , with the possible exception of Boulder ) , as a " scandalous exploitation of Canadian resources , " made it a leading argument for public ownership , a vital campaign issue in the next election . To steer clear of interference with the war program , CCF tempered its resolution to read " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader M. J. Coldwell has been more voluble and outspoken on this Shipshaw finance than on the question of public ownership . Already producing power and scheduled for completion in November , Shipshaw was under construction 15 months before its existence was revealed last January . The Aluminum Co. of Canada had financed it to the hilt from contracts on future aluminum deliveries signed with the U.S. , Britain and Australia . Primarily , the dam was built to supply power for the war production of aluminum . U.S. Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones advanced $68,500,000 in fund 's of the Metals Reserve Co . Great Britain advanced $55,600,000 , Australia $10,000,000 . Canada contributed an excess-profits tax write-off of $154,500,000 to the project . <P> Coldwell charges that the Aluminum Co. of Canada will pay for the dam from its contracts by the close of the war , will come out with " a monopoly which will dominate electric-power resources and the production of aluminum on the American continent and to a large extent throughout the world . " The method of finance , he contends , makes the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " the greatest financial grab ever pulled off in . . . Canada . " Shipshaw , insists he , must be seized by the Province of Quebec .
