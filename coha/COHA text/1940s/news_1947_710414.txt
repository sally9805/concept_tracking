txt LAUSANNE , Switzerland , May 14 ? The British Government has refused to let the International Refugee Organization operate in the British zone of Germany , to take care of those displaced persons who will ultimately fall within the scope of the IRO operations , it was learned today . The total number of persons involved is about 245,000 , of whom nearly all are expected to require total or partial maintenance for an indefinite period . The British position , which is not yet in the open , is regarded as an extremely serious threat to a successful handling of the vast refugee problem . The preparatory commission of the IRO decided yesterday to take on the job being dropped by UNRRA June 30 , without awaiting final establishment of a permanent United Nations body . If the IRO were not to begin operations on July 1 , almost the entire burden of the displaced persons problem , would fall on the British , French and United States Governments , as the overwhelming bulk of the refugees are in their zones of occupation in Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiativel in converting itself into an executive body . They do not want it , however , to send its own personnel into their zone of Germany . Having failed to budge the British through ordinary channels , the United States , which has pledged full cooperation with the IRO in its zones Of occupation , is now taking the matter up at the highest level . Secretary of State Marshall is urging , or will shortly urge , Foreign Secretary Bevin directly to override the objections of British military authorities to admitting the international staff . The reasons for the British stand // are obscure and the British are more than reticent about explaining their position . They refer to unfortunate friction between UNRRA and military authorities and bad publicity that resulted from it . Representatives of other nationalities , including Americans , have various explanations of the British resistance . First , the British would like to be paid in dollars by the IRO for acting as its agents in their zone . If the IRO does its own work the British will get less foreign exchange from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that political control of displaced persons would be more difficult if an international staff were in charge of their care . The British are particularly worried about the growth of agitation for migration to Palestine . Under its constitution the IRO is bound to press for an opening of the doors in Palestine as well as elsewhere for the victims of Nazis . The third reason advanced by sources connected with the existing refugee programs is a British desire to keep maintaining some groups that would be screened out as not deserving aid by the IRO . Several tens of thousands of Poles and Yugoslays are believed to fall into this category . Throughout the current meeting of the IRO preparatory commission British spokesmen have tried to play down the size and urgency of the refugee problem . Both Sir George Rendel , chief British delegate , and Sir Herbert Emerson , head of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees , who reflects British Foreign Office views , have repeatedly emphasized the progress being made in liquidating the problem through absorption of the DP 's by neighboring countries . Other delegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as primarily designed to strengthen the British position in excluding the IRO from their military zone .
