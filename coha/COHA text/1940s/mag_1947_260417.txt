Senator Homer Ferguson 's War Investigating subcommittee , digging into the wartime contracts of Millionaire Plane-builder Howard Hughes , had turned up some gaudy ore . It glittered with headline names , beautiful girls , fantastic expense accounts ( TIME , Aug. 4 ) . Last week , the committee went deep into one of the abandoned mine shafts of history , guided by big-time World War II administrators and brasshats and-somewhat unwillingly-by a Hollywood pressagent and a President 's son . It found more ore . <P> Man of the Hour . In July 1942 , the Germans were sweeping unchecked across Russia and Africa . Help from the U.S. was crippled by German submarines , which were knocking off up to 700,000 tons of shipping a month . It was a dark hour for the Allies , and the man of the hour was Henry Kaiser , the miracle shipbuilder and idea man from the west . <P> Pudgy Henry Kaiser , by his own testimony before the committee , had bustled into Washington with a hatful of ideas . One of them paid off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air power across the Atlantic . As much as anything , his carriers broke the back of the U-boat campaign . Another Kaiser scheme was a fleet of 500 enormous cargo planes to broad-jump over the subs . <P> Miracle Man Kaiser had had a little more trouble selling that scheme . The Army &; Navy were against it . They needed scarce materials and technicians for their standard combat and transport craft . Planemaker Grover Loening told committeemen how , as a representative of WPB , he looked over Kaiser 's plan and reached the same conclusion as the military men . WPB 's aviation experts figured Henry Kaiser did n't know an airplane from a Sherman tank and that his promise to get the first model into the air within 20 months only proved it . <P> But Kaiser had blustered his way to the top , where he convinced WPB Boss Donald Nelson of the worthiness of his idea . Nelson said go ahead , and RFC Chairman Jesse Jones produced the Government cash . Kaiser picked Howard Hughes as his partner in the venture . Witness Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aviation division , recalled with awe : " Kaiser is one of the world 's greatest salesmen , in a class with Diamond Jim Brady and Bill Sunday . " <P> Bluster &; Ballyhoo . What these facts proved was that bluster and ballyhoo had been a big force in wartime Washington . The final super-cargo-plane contract turned out to be for only three 200-ton craft . Kaiser lost interest in the scheme and later bowed out , muttering darkly about a " mysterious kiss-off . " With Hughes on his own , the contract shrank to one plane which has never yet flown . <P> There was no evidence of skulduggery . Builder Hughes had reportedly sunk $7,000,000 of his own cash into the project . The Government money involved was peanuts by wartime standards : $18 million . At worst it was just another wartime idea gone sour , at some cost in time , materials and manpower .
