txt Anthony Eden , British Foreign Secretary , told a joint session of the Maryland General Assembly tonight that the United States , Great Britain , Russia and China must act together in war and in peace if they were to win victory over the Axis and prevent future conflicts . Addressing the legislative body over which his paternal ancestor , Sir Robert Eden , once presided as the last Royal Governor of Maryland before the outbreak of the American Revolution , Mr. Eden emphasized the ties that now bind the United States to Great Britain and the other United Nations and expressed his high satisfaction with the conferences he has conducted with President Roosevelt , , Secretary of State Cordell Hull , War and Navy officials and other leaders . He gave no clue to the decisions that had been made . He cautioned his listeners , including a nationwide radio audience , however , to expect no " sudden and sensational developments " from the Washington discussions . He reiterated his warning that " we have yet far to travel before the final triumph over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that we must expect in the interval " strains and stresses , setbacks and disappointments . " To the Chinese , who have resisted Japanese aggression alone for more than five years , Mr. Eden held out the promise that " the day will come when the Burma road will once again be open * * to carry to China an ever-increasing volume of supply , which the efforts of your country and mine are turning out daily from the assembly lines . " Evidently reflecting Chinese complaints that the United States and Britain were concentrating too much on the European theatre of warfare to the exclusion of Pacific interests , Mr. Eden said that China should not " misdoubt us " because " we shall not forget how for years she resisted aggression singlehanded , " and he added : " Let there be no mistake . We shall not rest upon our arms until every one of our enemies has unconditionally surrendered . We , no less than you , and our partner China , have a score to settle with the Japanese ; nor shall we cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back . We shall be with you in this to the end . " He pleaded for international cooperation in the war and especially in the peace to prevent future conflicts and his remarks seemed addressed particularly to isolationists in America who fought American participation in the League of Nations after World War I and opposed President Roosevelt 's foreign policy before Pearl Harbor . There could not be prosperity in one country and misery in the next , he continued . If nations tried to have these things , their path would lead but to another war . Nations that were heavily defended national fortresses could never find security or progress within their walls , he said . Security and progress would only come , he said , where there was the greatest possible measure of cooperation , adding that the United Nations , and in particular the United States , the British Commonwealth , China and the Soviet Union , must act together in war and in peace . The British people , he concluded , were proud of the company with which they marched , a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one flag and no one language uniting it , had one passport , freedom ; one objective , victory ; and one purpose , a joint and lasting peace . Ancestor Is Recalled Introducing Mr. Eden , Governor O'Conor recalled his gubernatorial ancestor and declared that the latest Eden " comes to us , in a time of great crisis , a symbol of the kinship that today links his great commonwealth of nations to our beloved country . " The State House legislative chamber was jammed , although admission was by card only . The British Foreign Secretary , making his first formal address in America , had dined earlier at Governor 's House with Governor Herbert R. O'Conor , who introduced him to the Assembly and to the audience on the Columbia Broadcasting System . Also at the Governor 's dinner for Mr. Eden were . John G. Winant , United States Ambassador to Britain ; Viscount and Lady Halifax ; Admiral John Beardall , who formerly was the naval aide to President Roosevelt and Mrs. Beardall ; Oliver Harvey , private seoretary to Mr. Eden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Kingdom .
