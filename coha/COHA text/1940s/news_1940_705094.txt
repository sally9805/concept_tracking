" The administration , Col. Lindbergh said , tells us that we are preparing to defend America , while orders are being placed for the type and quantity of armament that would be used for war in Europe , This country does not need untold thousands of airplanes , he said , unless it intends to wage a war abroad . What we need , he added , is a thoroly modern and efficient corps , trained and equipped for the specific mission of American defense . Calls for IL S. Independence . Pleading for " American independence , " Col. Lindbergh accused the Roosevelt administration of pursuing the same course that led France to disaster and England to her present plight . Instead of building their own national strength , the peacetime leaders of England and France told their people that their security lay abroad , that the best way to defend their own countries was to fight for Poland , he said . Leaders of the same caliber how tell us , he declared , that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country is to defend England . This country is weak , the people are divided and dissatisfaction is rising among them , Lindbergh asserted , be : cause they have no confidence in the efficiency or judgment of their leaders . He said the leadership which has alienated the most powerful military nations of both Europe and Asia while leaving ourselves unprepared for action is not competent to lead the nation successfully thru a great crisis . Here 's Address In Part . Col. Lindbergh 's address in part follows : " I come before you tonight to enter a plea for American independence . It is amazing that one should have to plead for American independence its a nation with a heritage such as ours ; In a nation which In its infancy revolted against foreign control , and whose people have fought time and time again - against the armies and interference of the old world . Yet the independence and the destiny of America were never more in jeopardy than they are today . " During the first century and a quarter of our existence as a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully , all the major powers of Europe . At the same time that our forefathers pushed thru the wilderness to the Pacific , they forced , one atter another , England , France , and Spain , to discontinue their interference with American affairs . We won mir independence from England when we were a nation of less than four million people . Why Give Up Independence ? " Why , then , with one hundred and thirty million people , are we being told that we must give up our independent position , that our frontiers lie in Europe , and that . nur destiny Will be decided by European armies fighting upon European soil ? What has happened to this nation that it fears In maturity the forces that it conquered in its youth ? What foreign Influence has sprung up among us ? Where Is the blood of such leaders as Washington , Jefferson , and Lincoln ; blood that stood firm on American soil against the threats , the armies , and the navies of the greatest empires on earth ? " What We lack today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; the type that turned adversity and hardship into , virility and success . No one doubts that we are in the midst of a world crisis . No one denies that our defenses are weak ; that our debt is great ; that dissatisfaction is rising among us . We do not question the need for rearmament , for reform , for a better economic system . Leadership Is Questioned . " What we do question is the leadership that has brought these conditions upon us . We question that the men who were unable to foresee these conditions in time to avoid them , who could not foresee the war in time to prepare for it , are now competent to carry this nation successfully thru a period of great crisis . " Under their leadership we have alienated the most powerful military nations of both Europe and Asia , at a time when we ourselves are unprepared for action , and while the people of our nation are overwhelmingly opposed to war . " There is no question about the fundamental courage and solidarity of Americans when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division among us about the defense of our own country . We have always been ready to fight against the interference of foreign powers in our affairs . If need be we are ready to die for the independence of America , as our forefathers have died before us . On a clearly American issue we stand a united nation . It is only when we are asked to take part in the quarrels of foreign countries that we divide ; only , when we are asked'to Merge , . - ur des- , tiny with that of other lands . " The fact is today that we are divided ; we have not confidence in our leaders .. We have not Confidence in their efficiency or in their judgment . Instead of a Washington warning us against the wiles of foreign influence and excessive partiality for any nation , we are told that our frontiers lie in Europe . We are informed that we may be invaded from the icebound mountains of Greenland , and by fleets of nonexistent trans-Atlantic bombers . " We find the same men who have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling us that as a nation we are weak and unprepared ; that we must appropriate more billions of dollars to building up our military forces . These same leaders who have failed to solve even our peacetime problems , who have a consistent : record of promise followed by failure , now ask us to put our:elves in their hands again as they lead us steadily toward that climax of all political failure  --  war . " They do not tell us openly what their intentions are . They say we should leave our decisions and our destiny to specialists  --  to the same specialists who have made us a wenk-I ened nation in an antagonistic world . They harangue us about ' democ. racy , ' yet they leave us with less knowledge of the . direction in which we are headed than if we were citizens of . a totalitarian , state . We are told we are being prepared to defend America at the same time that orders are placed for armament that would be used for a war in Europe . " We do not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war abroad . What we do need is a thoroly modern and efficient air corps , trained , equipped , and maintained for the specific mission of American defense . " Adequate defense does not necessitate this alarm and confusion . With intelligent leadership , we could have built an impregnable defense for America . But today , while we listen to talk of aircraft , guns , and battleships , we find ourselves in confusion at home and under ridicule abroad . It Is happening Ie. America . " The same thing is happening to us that happened to England and France . We have been led to debt and weakness , and now we are being led toward war . Instead of building their own national strength , the peacetime leaders of England and France told their people that the best way to defend their own countries Was to fight for Poland . They followed tills ' advice and failed . Now we are being told , and by lenders of similar caliber , that the best way to defend our own country is to defend England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence , the first step must be to assure ourselves of leadership which is entirely American . The doctrine that we must enter the wars of Europe defend America will be fatal if we follow it . " If we desire the unity among our people that . is essential to national life and strength , we must select leaders who believe sincerely in national defense , but who are wholeheartedly opposed to our involvement in foreign wars : Above an , we must select leaders whose promises we can trust , who know- where they are taking us , and who tell us where we are going . The entire future of America and of our system of life : hangs upon the action we take and the judgment we show . It does not depend upon the outcome of the war in Europe , but upon men , regardless of their party , who will lead es to strength and peace , rather than to weakness and to war .
