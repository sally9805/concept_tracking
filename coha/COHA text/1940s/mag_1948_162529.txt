New Jersey 's Representative J. Parnell Thomas knows that a good headline , come appropriation time , can do more than months of hard work . Last week , as his Un-American Activities Committee applied for a whopping , $200,000 allotment from the House , Thomas dug deep . What he fetched up was an old file on Dr. Edward U. Condon , director of the National Bureau of Standards . The bureau is the Government 's chief research agency in physics , mathematics , chemistry and engineering . <P> Dr. Condon , declared the report , was " one of the weakest links in our atomic security , " an associate of " alleged Soviet espionage agents . " The report said that Condon was an executive director of the American-Soviet Science Society , an affiliate of the Communist:front National Council of American-Soviet Friendship . The report cited a letter from the FBI dated May 1947 , which declared that Condon had been " in contact as late as 1947 with an individual alleged , by a self-confessed Soviet espionage agent , to have engaged in espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 to 1944 . " <P> Weakest Link . Dr. Condon answered sharply : " If I am the weak link in atomic security , then the nation need have no fear . " He said that he had asked Thomas for a hearing last summer on the charges but had had no reply . Promptly the Commerce Department announced that only six days before the Thomas report was issued the departmental loyalty board had held , unanimously , that " no reasonable grounds exist for believing Dr. Condon is disloyal . " <P> Thomas backed away a trifle . The committee had no evidence that Dr. Condon was " disloyal , " he admitted , just that he had been " indiscreet . " But , he added , he could not understand " how the loyalty board could have cleared Dr. Condon in view of the evidence . " From his bed in Walter Reed Hospital , where he is recuperating from an attack of gastrointestinal hemorrhages , he issued a subpoena for the board 's files . Secretary of Commerce Harriman refused to honor the subpoena , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had testified in confidence , and would prejudice future loyalty probes . Blustered Thomas : " If they think they are going to get away with it , they are mistaken . " <P> For scientists in the Government , already weary of being investigated , checked and rechecked , the Condon case seemed close to the last straw . The staid American Physical Society , of which Condon is a former president , warned that actions like these " will make difficult the collaboration between scientists and the Government on which so much of our future depends . " Condon himself asked Senator Bourke Hickenlooper 's Joint Atomic Energy Committee to hold its own investigation in the hope of " restoring conditions in which men of intelligence . . . will not be constantly harassed and harried by irresponsible attacks .
