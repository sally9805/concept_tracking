From strike-racked Paris last week , Republican Foreign Policy Expert John Foster Dulles directed an urgent hint toward Washington . Communist efforts to wreck Europe 's economy , he said , would convince Congress more than ever of Europe 's desperate need for help . His hint was sharpened almost daily by new reports of Communist violence , sabotage , street battles and wrecked trains . But Dulles ' congressional colleagues did not seem to hear . Congress was bogged down in dawdling and delay . <P> The slowdown began as soon as the House Foreign Affairs Committee reported out its $590 million relief bill ( including a $67 million cut in the Administration 's program , a $60 million dividend for China ) . Before it could reach the House floor , it had to be routed through the Rules Committee , headed by Illinois ' Isolationist Leo Allen . The Rules Committeemen had their crowbars poised and ready . <P> Gathered around their big , green-topped table , they ganged up on the committee report . Chairman Allen was frankly against any aid at all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loafers . " <P> Cold with rage , Foreign Affairs Chairman Charles Eaton argued back . " We might just as well face the fact that Russia proposes to conquer the world by infiltration , by revolution or by force of arms . . . . If we do n't send this aid the price will be much more than this . " The committeemen engaged in six hours of futile wrangling before they sent the bill to the House . <P> When the House convened next day , the wrangling began all over again . For six hours that afternoon and six the next , the debate ranged over familiar , barren ground . Michigan 's Clare Hoffman , who is bitterly isolationist and antiCommunist , rose up to quote from Washington 's Farewell Address : " Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground ? " Then , quite unpredictably , he branded the danger of world Communism " a false doctrine . " <P> Attendance dwindled as Congressmen gossiped in the cloakrooms , began checking out for the weekend . Democrats slyly turned over their speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties for reinforcements . But Majority Leader Charlie Halleck was adamant : " If the Democrats want to rubber-stamp this program , they can do it . We want this program to be debated and threshed out before the votes are taken . " <P> As the House went to work on amendments this week , there was no doubt that the interim aid bill would pass , eventually-in just about the shape the Senate had already approved . Meanwhile , the bitterest congressional foes of Communism seemed curiously determined to play the obstructionist role which would best suit the Communist game .
