To the 260,000 U.S. citizens who wear artificial eyes , the war has brought a special headache . The best glass for eyes was made by a German formula , and the U.S. supply of glass eyes is almost exhausted . Since glass eyes deteriorate after a few years , even if they are not broken , wearers feared they might be eyeless for the duration . Last week they heard good news : <P> &gt; A Louisiana State University ophthalmologist announced that he had developed a plastic eye which he claimed was lighter , more durable than glass . <P> &gt; Manhattan 's Mager &; Gougelman , oldest and largest U.S. glass-eye maker , scenting a shortage , had put U.S. glass companies to work analyzing the German glass . A chemist at Northwestern University finally cried Eureka , and last week Mager &; Gougelman were making eyes from a domestic glass which they said was better than that old German stuff .
