New Yorkers were beginning to wonder just how pure the boasted ethics of the medical profession really are . When 175 Manhattan doctors were temporarily suspended from practicing in workmen 's compensation cases last week , the total number of New York City 's 16,000 physicians thus convicted of crooked dealing this year passed the 1,000 mark . ( The figure might be even higher if 890 accused doctors now in uniform had not been excused from answering charges . ) The suspensions were the result of a State drive against one of the nation 's richest rackets : the " kickback " racket that has netted unscrupulous New York insurance men , lawyers , physicians and X-ray laboratories as much as $5,000,000 a year . <P> How the racket works : an injured workman is told by a " steerer " ( usually a lawyer or insurance man ) which doctor to go to ; the doctor then pads his fees to double the normal amount ( or , more often , by prolonging treatment unnecessarily ) and sends a kickback to the steerer . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory , he gets a second piece of dirty money when the specialist or laboratory pads fees in turn and kicks some back to him . <P> The racket is well known to New York 's State and local medical societies , which pass on doctors ' eligibility to treat workmen 's compensation cases . But they did nothing about it until prodded by the Moreland Commission , sponsored and appointed by ex-racket-busting Governor Thomas E. Dewey . <P> The Moreland report has resulted in : 1 ) eighteen amendments to New York 's compensation law ; 2 ) attempts at suicide by two compensation officials .
