Ben , too , and both sat up and listened as it became louder and louder and more rapid . Old Ben began crying and praying , saying all the time that it was the angels of heaven coming for to carry them home to Jesus , but Vigo argued against this and persuaded old Ben to get up and take his pick and begin digging toward the spot in the face where the tapping was growing louder . By digging and shoveling the slate aside , Vigo and old Ben were able to tunnel in several feet . Vigo propped up the slate with timbers . It was hard work and slow because the air was getting thinnerand it weakened them to do much picking . A long time later they heard the sharp ringing of the shovels on the other side and felt the dull vibration of the picks chopping against the fall , and in a little while they could hear the muted murmuring of voices on the other side . Then came the moment when Vigo saw a tiny pin point of light shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakawayand old Ben grasped it and kissed it and fell to his knees and . prayed , and Vigo tried to laugh and boast that he was not afraid . Then he fainted dead away . They carried him , he said , and old Ben to the shaft and put them on the hoist and lifted them swiftly to the surface , then put them in the bed of a spring wagon and drove them to their homes . It was after midnight , almost eighteen hours after the cave-in , and he was lying stretched out on his back and covered with gunny sacks , and old Ben was lying beside him , when Vigo finally came to . Old Ben reached over and took Vigo 's hand and held it to his cold lips and told Vigo how he had saved both their lives down there in that hole when old Ben was ready to lie down and die . Old Ben died a few hours later , but Vigo never went back to the mines again . A few days later he ran away from home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Judd , he went back to the things he could see in his own mind , and his voice rumbled on while the mules nodded as they walked and the wagon rolled on down the winding road through the holler . " Judd , " he said , dreamily , " just think ! Today we ' uns is gon na meet a man who 's a-gonna give us money t ' go t ' Californy on , out where we 'll make money an ' live like white folks an ' " " You 're a-talkin ' , Vigo ! " said Judd gleefully . " Ya shore are , Vigo , honey , " said Mamie , laughing with Judd . " And , Judd and Mamie , I o'n see us now , a-comin ' into Californy , a-goin ' downhill , a-coastin ' all th ' way , lookin ' over th ' green valleys an ' th ' Pacific Ocean far away , with th ' white foam breakin ' along th ' edges of hit , an ' steamboats loaded with people on ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide highways , paved with concrete and bleached white with th ' sun . An ' I c'n see orchards an ' farms an ' wheat fields an ' fields with nothin ' but flowers a-growin ' in ' em , an ' I c'n see wide streets an ' streetcars an ' picture shows  --  picture shows ! " Judd sat with the reins dangling between his knees and his eyes staring blankly at the road ahead , over the backs and bobbing heads and waving ears of his mules . Mamie sat there , too , listening to Vigo 's soft , deep voice as he talked on , enchanted by the things which came to him . " Ya shore got th ' gift , Vigo , " Judd said . " Ya got th ' gift of talk , an ' a silvery tongue , an ' ya got a good imagination , an ' ya can see things what no one else can see . " Mamie looked up at him and smiled . " Go on , Vigo , " she said , touching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more , Vigo . I love t ' hear th ' way ya talk , Vigo . Go on , Vigo . Tell me an ' Judd some more . "  | Vigo laughed softly . He thought of his voice , and what the woman said to him when he was a young man . This was the first time he had talked like this  --  really talked imaginary things he saw in his own mind  --  since the night he and Lou had sat with their backs to the cabin and looked up at the big moon coming across the ridge and lighting up everything in the holler . " Yes , " Vigo said , closing his eyes and swaying a little with the motion of the wagon , " I reckon I c'n see things far off , like in a dream . But this time hit 's real t ' me . Hit 's as real as if it was right there afore m ' eyes , an ' I could reach out an ' touch hit . I had visions afore . Uster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t ' ketch me a ride sommers , I uster see things in m ' own mind , but they war n't as real as they air today . Somehow , I got a funny feelin ' , too . A feelin ' like as we 're all a-goin ' t ' leave this here place an ' we ai n't never a-comin ' back . An ' th ' lan ' t ' where we is a-goin ' is th ' Promised Land . " Now , " he said , " I ai n't a-joshin ' when I say this , Mamie an ' Judd . But I got what you might call a heavenly vision this time . An ' this feelin ' tells me that we ' uns is all a-gonna strike hit good , an ' all do right well , an ' live like decent folks . " Mamie looked up at him , and there were tears in her eyes , and she reached out and took his hand and held it for a moment , even with her husband looking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo , hit 's a-goin ' t ' be wonderful , an ' I thank ya , Vigo , fer a-comin ' along with me an ' Judd today , do n't we , Judd ? " Judd nodded and looked down at the mules ' rumps . " I kinda got th ' all-over fidgets too , Vigo . Like somethin ' was a-gonna happen  --  orth ' feelin ' you have when you think someone is a-com-in ' " That 's it , Judd , " Vigo said , pulling his hand away from Mamie gently . " That 's what I 'm a-tryin ' t ' say . An ' hit 's a good feelin ' , Judd . A right good feelin ' , Judd . " They had reached the slope of the road where it ran down to the yellow-and-white stop sign at the junction of U.S. Highway 62 , and Judd pulled up his team to a stop as he leaned out and lookedp103both ways along the asphalt-paved road . Suddenly he stood up in the wagon and slapped the reins hard on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot and turned left toward Berryville . And for the first time Vigo and Mamie and Judd saw that the road was thick with the traffic of dozens of wagons and oxcarts and automobileswhich rolled along the highway . The wagons and oxcarts were away over to one side of the road , almost off the pavement on the dirt shoulder , and they kicked up the gray dust which rose in great clouds and hovered over the road like a canopy . " My Gawd ! " Judd exclaimed , standing up again and looking behind him along the road , then up ahead . " What in th ' name of tarnation does all this mean ? " Vigo laughed . " Ever'body 's a-goin ' t ' th ' talk meetin ' , Judd , " he said . He looked up ahead . " There 's Jess Yell from Eureka Springs , an ' right behind him is Ab Turrell an ' his wagonload o ' young ' uns . An ' I think I see th ' Youngbloods an ' th ' Snoddys an ' th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like all th ' folks in fifteen mile is a-cornin ' to th ' talk meetin ' . Their mules an ' hosses is covered with lather , an ' th ' dust is all kicked up . " Judd shook his head . " They shore got them circ'lars passed aroun ' ever ' which way . I ai n't never seed so many folks on this road , not even when they 's a carnival in Berryville , which ai n't once't in a blue moon . Well , I 'll be a hoot owl ! " There was a clatter of hoofs in the road behind them , and Vigo and Judd turned around and saw the horse coming toward them at a gallop . " Hit 's Shadder Bob , an ' he 's a-runnin ' thet hoss t ' death ! Even Shadder Bob 's a-goin ' t ' Californy , an ' when they Bits t ' a-hirin ' lazy Negroes , they shore must be hard up fer h'ard hands ! " Judd exclaimed . Mamie turned around and smiled up at Vigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision , Vigo , " she said . Vigo nodded. pI04MEN , AND BOYS who took their places in the fields beside the men , began filing into the big auditorium and taking the scats along the aisles . There was a great shuffle of feet as they moved over the hardwoodfloor and slid into the seats . There they sat in silence , fanning their faces with their hats , and looked up to the stage , where CaliforniaBartlett and his man secretary sat between the sheriff and his two deputies in the row of chairs before the drop curtain . In the front center of the stage was a speaker 's stand , like the pulpit in a church , and over it was draped an American flag . A larger flag hung down over the drop curtain , and to the left of the flag was a big cloth sign , pinned to the curtain . In letters big enough to read all the way to the back of the auditorium , the sign said : WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA ! UNCLE SAM NEEDS MEN TO BUILD SHIPS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEARN . CASH PAID IF YOU SIGN A YEAR 'S CONTRACT . R. T. ( " California " ) Bartlett Agent . Motto : " My Word 's As Good As My Bond ! " COME TO CALIFORNIA ! UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU ! This was the first thing that greeted them as they entered the hall , and from where Uncle Yancey sat at the right of the speaker 's stand he could watch their faces as they read the sign while walking to the front to take their seats . Vigo Hoxie and Judd Cossey came in together , and Uncle Yancey , holding his guitar on his knee and his harmonica on the wire contraption around his neck , watched Vigo as his mouth droppedp105open when he saw the big flag and the sign , and his lips began to move as he read the sign aloud to Judd . Then , after looking at the faces of California Bartlett and his secretary , a man named Bolger , and Sheriff Lawson and his two deputies , Vigo glanced over at the end of the stage and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . Uncle Yancey was adjusting the wire contraption around his neck and fitting the harmonica into the grip that held it before his mouth when Sheriff Lawson gave him the nod , and Uncle Yancey sounded his " A " and tuned the strings to the key of the mouth organ , and began playing " Skip to My Lou . " He would play and pick a stanza , then sing the words to the stanza , then go back to playing his mouth organ and picking the cords and making the runs on the guitar . Two by two the men took up the rhythm and began tapping their feet and slapping their knees , keeping time with the cadence of it . Presently , attracted more by the music , which could be heard echoing through that big hall all the way out to the lawn in front , the men began to fill the hall and stand along the sides by the windows . Within a few minutes the place was packed with old men and young men from all over that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in years , men from Harrison , Boone County , and from all that rich country in the valley of Crooked Creek ; North Fork , on the White River , and Cotter and Yellville , Salem , Mountain Home , Calico Rock , and Rogers and Huntsville , and all the mountain regions and valleys , hills and hollers of the Ozarks in the northwestern part of Arkansas . Finished with " Skip to My Lou , " Uncle Yancey arose , holding the guitar by the neck , and bowed . The hall echoed with the stompingof feet and men slapping their hands on knees covered by the thin , tightly drawn blue denim of their overalls . Someone called out , " Play Barbara Allen ' ! " And someone else yelled , " Play Turkey Shivaree ' ! " and " Play th ' Jawbone Song ! " Still half bowing and not knowing whether to announce that this was the end of the entertainment or whether to continue with his playing , Uncle Yancey looked back over his shoulder at CaliforniaBartlett , who was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bolger , sitting with the money sack between his feet on the floor , was clapping wildly and laughing and talking to CaliforniaBartlett . " Play Little Birdie , Little Birdie , ' " someone down front yelled , and Uncle Yancey looked down and saw that it was Vigo , who was clapping his big hands and laughing . His voice was heard above everyone else 's , and because it was Lou 's husband , and because there was a moral in it for everyone , including Vigo , Uncle Yancey began with " Little Birdie " : " Purty woman , purty woman , Just see whut you 've done , You caused me t ' love you , Now yore husban ' has come . " Little Birdie , Little Birdie , Come sing me a song , I want to live in a dark holler , Whar th ' sun can never shine ! " I 'd ruther be a sailor , ' Way out on th ' sea , Than t ' be a married man With a baby on my knee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quare ? You 've no cause for to worry , No sorrow for to bear . " After that they cried for more , and again the sheriff , who by this time was monopolizing California Bartlett with his talk , gave Uncle Yancey the nod , and he proceeded with the song they asked for , and everyone kept time with the tapping of their feet and the slappingon their knee . " My ole Miss is mad at me , ' Cause I would n't live in Tennessee , Wah jawbone to my jangle tang , An ' a wah jawbone to my jangle lang . . . . "  |p107When  the laughter and applause quieted after that , Uncle Yanceygot up and walked over to the speaker 's stand , where the flag was draped , and raised both hands and , according to instructions from Sheriff Lawson , he asked : " Now , who 's a-goin ' t ' Californy , th ' Land of Promise ? " A few raised their hands , and the others clapped and stomped their feet and yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road agent , who had sold bug juice and patent medicine for ten years with Colonel West , Uncle Yancey could tell that this crowd was in the right humor to buy anything , do anything , or say anything . Right now , he thought , if he had some of old Colonel West 's tonic , he could clean up a fortune this evenin ' , right here . Any man who could n't sell this crowd of mountaineers on the idea of going to California was n't much of a salesman , he thought . Why , in the humor they were in , he could talk ' em into high-tailin ' it straight out for California , afoot and ahorseback , right now . The sheriff arose in the midst of the applause and walked up to stand at the speaker 's stand . " This here feller , California Bartlett , " the sheriff was saying , " travels around in one of them trailer automobiles , a-packin ' his own printin ' press fer printin ' up them yaller circulars that everyone in this room got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary to protect th ' great amount o ' cash he totes aroun ' with him t ' give away t ' fellers like me an ' you t ' pay their expenses t ' California so 's t ' hep build them ships . An ' he 's come here today to Berryville , th ' gateway to the Ozark country , to get good , big , strong men like you to pitch in an ' build ships . Now , without further encroachin ' on his time , I give you California Bartlett , the man whose word is as good as his bond  --  Mister Bartlett , step up hyar ! " Bartlett cleared his throat as he arose and walked toward the stand , his long arms dangling at his sides and his acre of back and shoulders swaying a little from side to side , his head held high and his red hair glistening in the light . A breeze was blowing across the auditorium from the open windows . There was an immediate uproar as the men and boys caught sight of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff and who dwarfed the speaker 's stand which stood beforep108him . Bartlett stood a good six feet six inches in his white Palm Beach suit , which made him look even bigger . When he opened his big square jaws , his voice boomed out over the heads of the men and boys sitting with their mouths agape , their hats poised in midairfrom their fanning . " Gentlemen , " he began , waving his right arm in a wide sweeping motion , " I 'm indebted to "  --  and he turned around and made an uplifting motion with his hand  --  " to Uncle Yancey Jolly for putting across this meeting today . When I was in eastern Oklahoma they told me that if I was looking for a man to make my appearance in the Ozark country a success , Uncle Yancey Jolly of Berryville , Arkansas , was the man ! " Uncle Yancey half rose to acknowledge the clapping and stompingwhich went up from the men out front . Just as he rose , Mr. Bolger came up and took him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gentlemen , " Bartlett went on , as he raised his right arm upward to indicate silence , " it 's worth a fortune to me to get a meeting like this together . And "  --  he reached down and put his big hand into the moneybag Bolger had brought up , and drew out a wad of greenbacks  --  " and , gentlemen , just to show you how much I think of Uncle Yancey an ' his guitar playing and harmonica blowing , I want to present him with a little token of my gratitude and esteem . " Turning , he said , " Uncle Jolly , I want to present to you , out of my own funds , the sum of fifty dollars for your work here today ! " One by one he counted out five ten-dollar bills . There was a big intake of breath all over the hall as everyone watched him count out the money and lay it in Uncle Jolly 's shaking hands . " Take it , Colonel , " he said , bestowing a title upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Now , gentlemen , that is only a sample of how much we out in California value the talents of you good people of the Middle West . " As Bartlett talked on , Uncle Yancey backed to his seat in the centerof the stage , under the great flag , and sat down weakly . That was the finest piece of showmanship he had ever seen , he thought.  |p109It  had the desired effect , for if there was a man in the auditorium who was not in the proper frame of mind before , he was now . " I hold before you , " California Bartlett was saying , " copies of work contracts which I will ask each and every one of you to sign at the conclusion of my remarks . And upon the signing of one of these contracts , each man will receive the sum of fifty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents for the payment of first-class railroad fare from here to California . " And on top of that , gentlemen , " he added , " I will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I represent , the sum of twelve dollars and forty-five cents , making a grand total of seventy dollars to each and every man who signs a contract here today . " It seemed as if not a man breathed , and California Bartlett lowered his voice as he talked fast . " Mind you , men , this is not a gift . It is an advance  --  a loan  --  which will be deducted from your first month 's salary in Califor-nia . " And as though he had read their minds , he answered their questionby saying , " Seventy dollars is nothing compared to the wages you will earn . We have just begun to lay the groundwork for the biggest shipbuilding program in the world . The first ship was launched last August . You will be trained and well paid . Many of you will make enough in one week to repay the advance in full ! " There was loud applause , and when it had quieted , he went on : " California welcomes you now . California offers a job for every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store for that Golden State in the West . . . " His big voice rumbled on as he told of the good rich land fully irrigated , the great green pastures , the forests full of great flocks of game , the streams where fish were abundant and where wild rice grew to feed the flocks of wild ducks and geese which blacked the skies over the hunting grounds in season . There were no skeptics among the men who sat there now with their hands clasped over the knees , their heads to one side , their eyes big as walnuts , and their mouths open as they listened . He told them of the new homes which would be waiting for them there ,  |p110modern  homes with every luxury , good hospitals and schools , oldageinsurance and security for the future . And when he had finishedhe took his place at the table on the end of the stage and spread out the contracts and laid beside them pencils and pens and ink bottles . Bolger , his secretary , and Sheriff Lawson and his two deputies came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartlettthe sheriff and his deputies stood guard behind them . First in line and on the stage was Ab Turrell . California Bartlett looked at him , extended his arm across the table and shook hands with Ab , a tall , skinny mountaineer who had a houseful of young ones , mostly boys . " Your name , sir ? " California Bartlett asked . " Ab Turrell . Abner 's th ' first name . " Bolger wrote Ab 's name at the top of one of the contracts in a blank space among the fine print . " Religion ? " Turrell said nothing . " Any skills ? That is , are you a mechanic , carpenter , welder ? " asked Bolger . Ab shook his head . " I can fix farm machinery . An ' I can fix fences , nail boards , build houses . " California Bartlett looked at him a moment , glanced back at Sheriff Lawson , who nodded . " Put him down as a carpenter , Bolger , " he told the secretary . Bolger wrote quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growed-up boys , " Ab said . " Both over sixteen . How about them ? " California Bartlett looked at the sheriff , who nodded . " Fine , upstandin ' boys , " said the sheriff . " All right . You can sign up for them , too , " said California Bartlett . " Names Abel and Cole . Cole is seventeen , Abel sixteen . " Bartlett 's secretary filled out two more contracts , and Ab Turrellsigned them . " Two hundred and ten dollars to Mister Abner Turrell , " the sheriff called out . Ab swallowed hard , took the money and shoved it into his pocketp111quickly . He was so excited that he nearly fell from the stage as he tried to find the way out of the auditorium . The next man in line was Shadder Bob . " Name ? " asked Bartlett 's secretary . " Shadder Bob . " " How 's that ? " " Shadder Bob . " " Is that your full name ? " the man asked him . Shadder Bob nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary repeated : " Religion ? Are you Protestant or Catholic ? " Shadder Bob laughed . " I hai n't no Catholic , mister , " he said . " I got enough trouble jus ' bein ' colored ! " Shadder Bob signed up for himself and his seven sons , and then , one by one , the others came up in the line , signed the contracts , took their money , and yelled and laughed as they ran out of the auditorium , past the long line of waiting men and boys , who shifted nervously from one foot to another , shoved their hands deep into their pockets , bit off the ends of tobacco twists and plugs , rolled their own cigarettes , licked the paper and twisted the ends and lit them , drawing hard on them and blowing the smoke above their heads . Some stood still , gazing out over the hills where the sun cast moving shadows of the clouds . SHADDER BOB sprang off the stage and landed squarely on his feet in the middle of the center aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mister Hoxie ! Shadder Bob 's a-goin ' . By Gawd , Ah 's a-goin ' , sho ' ' nuf . Ah 's a-takin ' mah seven sons an ' hop dat train , or git me one of them trailer-mobiles . I got seven boys . Seven times I 2 seven is forty-nine . Count ' em ! Fo ' hunnert an ' ninety dollahs ! by Gawd ! " Vigo laughed and Shadder Bob waved the money in the air . " Gon na git out'n this swamp lan ' , Mister Hoxic . Gon na buy me a car an ' light a shuck out'n this lan ' . Gon na git me a pair o ' them high yaller shoes an ' a straw hat an ' a pair o ' red baggy pants an ' a white silk shirt , Mister Hoxie . Shadder Bob 's a-goin ' , with seven sons  --  lucky seven . Seven . Lucky seven ! Hit 's th ' Judg'mint Day , yes suh ! Sho " nuf , Mister Hoxie ! " And he went mumbling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to anyone who would listen : " First thing I do , I 'm gon na go to Little Rock an ' git me a gal . Then I 'm a-gonna ketch me a ride on a truck t ' Oklahomy , then git me a day coach an ' lay back in them soft green cushions an ' sleep all th ' way . " And another laughed and said as he passed : " Me ? What am I a-gonna do with this money ? Why , I 'm a-gonna go straight t ' Californy . Just like he said t ' do . Gon na tell m ' old lady I 'm a-goin ' . An ' when I git thar , I 'm a-goin ' t ' send fer ' er . Bring ' er out , first-class .

" Vigo and Judd Cossey moved forward in the line . They were next to be interviewed.  |p114THE  TOWN DID N'T HAVE MUCH in the way of industries except the sawmill , the hardwood plant where they made ax handles , wagon tongues , pick handles , and hardwood flooring , and the frog farm four miles out of town on the gravel highway going north toward the Missouri line . The town depended mostly for its income on the Missouri &; Arkansas Railroad , and the fruit and dairy farms in the nearby valleys . In summer , when the " touristers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profited by catering to their " needments . " Out of season , however , the shops and stores around the circle in the center of town were almost empty , except on Saturday night , when the farmers and the hill folk came to walk the street , look in store windows , or just stand around the circle and meet old friends and talk and watch the folks milling by . The crowds thinned out by nine o'clock as the farmers herded their young ones together and loaded them into spring wagons and dusty cars and headed out of town for home . Tonight , however , there were more people in the town , walking around the circle and crowding into the stores than there were in the height of the best tourister season , and Uncle Yancey , carrying his guitar slung by a leather thong over his back , had difficulty in pushing his way through the crowd . " I got t ' find him afore he spends all that money , " Uncle Yancey kept telling himself . " I got to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who passed him on the street was smoking a cigar , holding it in the corner of his mouth and talking out of the other side , squinting his eyes and walking with his hands sunk down deep in his jeans . " A nation o ' Gawd-damned fools ! " Uncle Yancey muttered , cocking his eye and squirting ambeer between the cars parked around the circle . " Fools an ' the'r money ! "  |p115As  he passed each store , Uncle Yancey glanced in and hoped he would see Vigo . It was past eight o'clock and he had been wandering around the circle for an hour , hoping he would see Vigo or Judd or Mamie , or someone who could tell him where they could be found . Now he came to the " Model Store , Notions , Clothing for Man and Boy . " Uncle Yancey pushed through the throng standing in front of the store and stepped inside . The store was full of men trying on new hats , work shirts , overalls , and shoes . The place smelled like new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Yancey was met by a sweating clerk who ran forward , rubbing his hands together and smiling . Uncle Yancey 's business was brief , and he stated it briefly , yelling above the hum of voices in the store . " He was in here ' bout two hour ago , " the clerk replied . " But he left . " " Spend any o ' thet money ? " asked Uncle Yancey . The clerk rubbed his hands and laughed . " They 're all spendin ' money , Mister Jolly . Spendin ' it right an ' left ! " " Thank ye ! " Uncle Yancey said , squirting juice toward a pile of empty cardboard boxes . " I 'll be moseyin ' along . " Bill Bradley at Bradley 's Corner shook his head . " Him an ' that Cossey feller an ' some woman was in hyar ' bout an hour ago , but they went , " he told Uncle Yancey . " Was he drinkin ' ? " Bradley laughed , wiping the bar with a rag . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen or more were grouped together . " See them fellers ? They 're a-goin ' from place t ' place , samplin ' everthin ' in town . " " How about Vigo ? Was he a-drinkin ' ? " asked Uncle Yancey . Bill nodded . " Nothin ' but th ' best bonded stuff . That 's what ever'one 's drinkin ' tonight . " Broshears saw Uncle Yancey coming and ran around the end of the bar when the old man entered his place down the street . " How about some jig-time tunes , Uncle Yancey , " Broshears said , grinning . " Give you ten dollar t ' play for an hour in my place . "  | " Ai n't lookin ' fer no engagements t'night , " Uncle Yancey said . " I 'm a-lookin ' fer Vigo Hoxie . Seed ' im ? " " Sure , sure , " said Broshears , laughing . " Seen him ' bout sundown .

They was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At Linn Benton 's place , which was fuller than the rest only because it was bigger than the other bars , Bib Young never even looked up from the cocktail he was mixing for a couple of hillmen who hammered on the bar . " Las ' time I seen Vigo , he come in a-hell-raisin ' an ' demandin ' a bottle o ' rye whisky . Would n't take nothin ' else . Judd an ' Mamie was drunker'n hoot owls , an ' a-singin ' an ' shoutin ' . Reckon they gone home by now , if they hai n't passed out som'ers . " At the House of Silvery Shadows , Uncle Yancey asked the old woman in the ticket booth . " Nope , " she snapped . " Did n't come t ' no pitchur show . Do n't allow no drunks in hyar . Bad enough trouble with drunks afore now . They 're allus foolin ' with little girls . Got so bad we do n't allow no man in hyar if he 's even got a whiff o ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mister Jolly . Would n't sell ' em no ticket , nohow . No siree ! " The girl who was taking tickets at the door shook her head . " They did n't come in here , suh . I hai n't seed ' em . " " Did n't buy no straw hat , " said the clerk in the Emporium . " An ' did n't buy no shoes or no work shirt . I 'm all sold out , anyhow . Just got a few things left . That Californy Bartlett feller shore brought prosperity to this town , by Gawd ! What this country needs is more fellers like him ! " There was only one more place , besides the Grand View Hotel , a big red-brick building which was put up back in 1902 , when the town anticipated a sudden growth at the time the railroad was put through . Vigo and Judd and Mamie would n't go to the Grand View if they were in a bad condition , because the manager would n't stand for it . The only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a back street , off the circle in the center of town . Uncle Yancey turned off the main drag and walked down the dark street , past the wagon lot , which was still full of spring wagonsp117and teams tied to the tailgates . The animals stomped and pawed the earth and pricked up their ears as Uncle Yancey walked past the lot toward Charlie 's place . Charlie was racking pool balls when Uncle Yancey hitched his guitar thong higher on his shoulder and walked in . The place was dim with tobacco smoke and smelled of strong liquor and stale cigars . There was noise of conversation and the clicking of pool balls . " Hello , Uncle , " Charlie grinned , glancing at Uncle Yancey as he dropped the last of the balls in the wooden triangle , shoved them forward on the green cloth , steadied them and lifted the rack . " Ai n't seen ya in a coon 's age , Uncle . Whar ya been hidin ' ? " Uncle Yancey raised his left eyebrow , spat at a sandbox over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chin with the palm of his hand . " I 'm a-lookin ' fer Vigo Hoxie . " Charlie shook his head . " Didja try them row of houses down by th ' millpond , Uncle ? " " Nope , " said Uncle Yancey . Jasper Bagnell , straw boss at the hardwood plant , called to Charlie from the far end of the hall . " Back in a jiffy , Uncle , " said Charlie . " Do n't go ' way . Maybe I can give you a clue . " Uncle Yancey nodded , leaned his elbows back on the top of the glass cigar counter by the door , and waited . Charlie came back in a moment , waving a paper bill at him . " A fifty-dollar bill , Uncle . Fourth one I had t'night . This burg 's shore lousy with money t'night , ai n't it ? " Uncle Yancey nodded and spat out the front door . " As I was sayin ' , " Charlie went on , fingering in the cash drawer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you try one of them row houses down by th ' millpond , Uncle ? " " What 'd Vigo an ' Judd Cossey 's wife be a-doin ' down in them places ? Would n't put hit past Judd , but not Vigo or Judd 's wife . What 'd they go there for ? " Uncle Yancey wanted to know . Charlie laughed . " Them houses is gittin ' all th ' business t'night . Been a reg'lar parade past my place all evenin ' . Never seed so many hell-raisin ' hillmen in m ' life . They go down , a-whoopin ' an ' a-hollerin ' , but they shore do n't come back that-a way . Now thar 's one , " he said , pointing out the door . Uncle Yancey saw a young fellow who was staggering and almost falling as he stumbled along the dark street , headed for the row houses down by the millpond . " See ? " Charlie laughed . " Now you jus ' watch in ' bout an hour when that feller comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ha , ha ! " He leaned over and spoke in a low voice : " Cora 's got a new bunch o ' gals . Just got ' em in las ' week . Come all th ' way from Mobile , I hear . Rale S'uth'n gals , they say . Got some high-yallers an ' mulattosan ' a coupla Mexicans . Cora 's a-gittin ' ready for a big touristertrade this summer . An ' she got her on-sale liquor license back . Paid a hundred dollars t ' th ' right party , I hear . An ' with a liquor license an ' them gals  --  ever'one 's a three-way ride  --  she 's a-cleanin ' up , I 'll say . She shore hit it th ' right time , this time . Never saw so much jack in town . " " But they got Mamie , Judd 's wife , with ' em , " Uncle Yancey said . " Mamie would n't go in one of them places . " " If she was good an ' drunk she would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right t ' work ! " Charlie laughed . " Tell me , now , " Uncle Yancey asked . " Did ya or did n't ya see ' em ? " Charlie nodded . " About an hour ago . Now I ai n't a-sayin ' they went t ' Cora 's place , but they was a-headin ' that way . An ' all three of ' em was in th ' gales . " Uncle Yancey pulled gently on his beard . " Maybe , " he said reflectively , " they was a-goin ' t ' th ' wagon lot . Judd was a-drivin ' his team , ya know . " " Not when I seed ' em , they was n't . Arm in arm , they was . Vigo on one side , Judd on th ' other an ' with th ' gal ' tween ' em , all a-singin ' an ' a-hollerin ' an ' carryin ' on " Charlie interrupted himself to point out the door again . " See them two . That 's Hap Malvernan ' Dan Ketchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Got a kid named Rose . Now whar 'd you reckon Hap an ' Dan 's a-goin '  --  t ' th ' wagon lot t ' git their wagon out ? " Uncle Yancey shook his head slowly.  | " Course they ai n't . Now if you really want t ' find Vigo , why don'cha go on down t ' Cora 's place --  " Uncle Yancey hitched onto his guitar again and shook his head . " ' Thet 's whar I draw th ' line , " he said . " Never been in one o ' diem houses , an ' never will . I foller 'd their trail as fur as I 'm a-goin ' , an ' no further . " Charlie shook his head . " If I see ' em a-comin ' back this way , I 'll tell ' em you was lookin ' fer ' em . " " Leave ' em be , " Uncle Yancey growled as he walked from the place . " Jus ' never you mind . " " Okey , Uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and walked up the dark street , leaving behind him the sound of clicking pool balls and the laughter of the men on the biggest spree Uncle Yancey recollected in the history of the Ozarks . UNCLE YANCEY PUSHED HIS WAY back through the crowd which still milled around the center circle of the town , then followed the dark street past the dimly lit houses to the road that led from the town . Up through the dark valley he walked , his guitar slung over his back , his head bent low in cogitation , his feet slowly pacing off the long strides in the soft shoulders beside the gravel road that led from the town up through the winding hollers and steep hills toward the western rim of the Ozarks . The road was deserted , and it was quiet and dark . Far out , and high on the gradual rise of the hills , Uncle Yancey paused and turned around and gazed back down on the town lights , which twinkled brightly through the trees . All his life folks had thought Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his windy stories whenever and whereverhe could get an audience . The touristers pointed him out among other hillmen as a typical shiftless , unconfined loafer who , like the rest of his tribe , was a simple , loose , and lighthearted clodhopperwho wanted nothing except the free and easy life the hills here afforded . They mistook his fierce silence for ignorance ; his crude tales they attributed to a dissolute and licentious character ; and his long hair , unshaven chin , and patched and baggy jeans and faded shirt they laid to the improvidence and carelessness of all who took to the hills to escape the responsibilities of an ordered society . But beneath the dark and sparkling eyes which danced with joy as he played and sang those idle ballads of his people , there was a keen and observing alertness that never missed things which went on about him , a brain that never failed to grasp their meaning ; and as he stood there , gazing at the twinkling lights of the town , the thought occurred to him that the coming of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until there was hardly a place now that reminded him of the peace and solitudehe knew here long ago . Happy Holler , which had weathered the slow intrusion of change , had been transformed in a few hours from a virgin , unspoileddale to a place like all those other faraway lands and cities beyond the hills . The coming of this furriner from California , with all his money and big talk and loud laughter and red hair , had touristers or the road builders or the linemen who drilled their holes and set their poles and strung their wire . Uncle Yancey fancied he had just witnessed the passing of the last of the Ozarks . Thinking of this , he turned quickly and bent forward as his long legs reached out , and he almost ran as he was seized with a sudden desire to get as far away from here as possible . He yearned to be at Lou 's old dogtrot house high up on the hill at the head of the holler , where he could sit on the gallery and hear the crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the pines and cedars and scrub oaks ; where he could watch the clouds drifting under the moon and smell the faint traces of burning logs mingled withp121the delicate sweetness of honeysuckle and dogwoods and the crisp freshness of Ozark white cedar and pine and warm earth . There with his old memories he could forget the change he had witnessed today and just sit and dream of things as they used to be . An hour or so later he turned off the highway into the dark and almost hidden pass through the thick growth of shrubs and trees that marked the entrance to the valley and led to the snakelike road that went upward toward the hidden holler , past Happy Holler school , the row of silver poplars , Piney Ridge cemetery , and up to the winding path which found the old home place , nestling snug against the hill at the head of the holler . As Uncle Yancey walked along in the darkness , seeing only a dim outline of the trees against the dark sky , the moon came out from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops of the trees and causing the dew sprinkled there to sparkle with the brilliance of a million precious stones . When the moon came out , big and round and the color of rich , creamy butter , a meadow lark running among the sedge grass which grew on the slope of the western ridge suddenly flew straight up and flapped his wings and swelled his throat and whistled a tumbling tune to his lady bird who waited for his call . From the topmost branch of a tall shortleaf pine came the bubbling song of a mockingbird , and other creatures scurried out to frolic in the light of the moon . The moon 's appearance was like a signal that awakened all those quiet things to new life and brightness , Uncle Yancey thought . He raised his head and looked far up on the hill where Lou 's cabin was hidden , and knew that she would be sitting in her squeakingrocker out on her gallery , patiently awaiting the first glimpse of Vigo as he would come , all hunched over , to climb the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him she would spring from her rocker and go running down the hill to meet him while her heart beat faster and her hair flew wildly and her skirts beat against her legs . Until he came she would sit there , even all through the night , alone and silent and patient as a tree . Time was short now , and she would n't think of wasting the last few hours in sleeping . There would be plenty of time for sleep , fitful and dark and restless , after Vigo was gone . Until then , as Uncle Yancey well knew , Lou would wait there on her gallery for Vigo , watching the moon as it passed over its pathway in the sky and disappeared behind the cabin to make way for the first bursting light of the morning .... What would he tell her ? Yancey wondered . Would he tell her the thought that had come to him away back there when he had realized that the coming of California Bartlett had affected the lives of everyone in the holler , and how his coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther back than ever before ? Uncle Yancey had seen the change on the faces of those men down in the town . Men who had never before tasted bonded liquor had drunk it by the bottle ; men to whom a cigar was the greatest luxury now stuffed the bib pockets of their overalls with the finest of them ; men who had never possessed more than fifteen or twenty dollars at one time in their lives now had rolls clasped in their sweating palms or burning holes in their pockets . There was a wild , crazy lust in their eyes as they had staggered through the crowd around the center of the town , locked arm in arm as they swaggered into one place and out of another , all the way from Bradley 's Corner and Charlie 's Social Hall to the dark , forbidden mystery of Cora 's row of bawdyhouses down by the stagnant pools under the willows of the old millpond . Soon a sudden change would come over the holler as men , carefreeand reckless with their sudden riches and the promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and packed their wives and children and began a new migration westward , down out of the hills and into the prairies so windy and bare . Even as Uncle Yancey left the town he had heard a few of them planning how they would save money by piling in together in a truck and striking out across the plains . Some would spend every cent they had on foolishments , and they would have to get there the best way they could in order to live up to their contracts . There was no way of beating the game , Uncle Yancey knew , because he had heard the sheriff promise California Bartlett that every man would live up to his contract or the law would step in and see to it that he did . There were some things Uncle Yancey could n't tell Lou , he decided . He could n't tell her , for instance , that Vigo and JuddP123and Mamie had gone toward the old millpond and Cora 's row of houses , for to his certain knowledge he did n't know whether they had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon lot and were wandering drunkenly along the street in the dark . As her own flesh and blood , however , he was bound to tell her that Vigo had signed up for himself and for his son Thad , and that1111 he had promised to be present in California in two weeks to fulfill his recruitment contract . Lou had a right to know Vigo had collectedone hundred and forty dollars by pledging himself and Thad to a year 's labor , and there was no way of squirming out of the obligation . She must be told that Vigo could not go away and leave Thad behind , because Thad was as much a party to the contract as Vigo , and Thad could n't go back into the hills far enough , or stay away long enough for the sheriff to forget him , because the sheriff had a list of every man who had signed or made his mark on those contracts . Most of all , Lou had a right to know that when Vigo went away this time , there would be no coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skies with yellow and red and gold . It was her right to know that this time , maybe , Vigo was going far away and maybe was n't coming back . That much he could tell her , Uncle Yancey thought , and maybe more . If he could see the wisdom of it , perhaps he could tell Lou that at this very minute Vigo was planning to run off with Judd Cossey and Judd 's wife Mamie , and it would n't be far from the truth . And if Lou could be sensible about it , she could see why it was that Vigo was trailing along after Judd and Mamie ; see somethingthat not even Judd himself was able to see ; that it was all because of Mamie that Vigo was usin ' around with them . That would be a sight easier than a lot of other things ; easier than sitting in her lonely cabin all through the twelvemonth of changing seasons , waiting for a man who might never come back ; easier than living for the day when he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . It would be a time of dark grief for Lou , but Uncle Yancey could hear with her until she was able to stand up and face what was to come in the future . He could tell her to forget and to wait for the morning , when the brightness of the day would banish the dim and dark sorrow of the night . She could cry herself out now , then be done with it forever , as though he were gone and dead and deep beneath the sod up there on Piney Ridge . After this first shock , this first sorrow , she would soon forget , and the days would be brighter , and there would be no more waiting and worrying for Vigo to come home , only to abuse her and torment her with more uncertainty until her whole life was wasted away just waiting and worrying over a man who was n't even worth the salt of her tears . Oh yes , it was easy enough to think of what he might tell her , but not so easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple enough to think that that was all there would be to it , and that Lou would take it as easily as he pictured . It would take a heap of courage to say , " Some sweet day , Lou , honey , the right man will come along and you will be glad that Vigo is no more , " because there are some women , constant and faithful like Lou , whose whole life is bound up in one man , and when he 's gone , no matter how better off the world may seem to some for his going , their life goes with him . So those were the terrible thoughts Uncle Yancey cogitated as he walked up the hill , closer and closer to the little rise from which he could see the cabin , illuminated in the soft glow of the moon . As he rose up the path , in full view of the gallery at the front of the dogtrot house , he saw Lou sitting back in the shadow against the log front , rocking quietly as she watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her feet , drew himself up on his front legs , whined and jumped off the gallery and ran down the path toward him . A short distance away the dog stopped , stiff-legged , his tail between his legs as he sniffed at the scent , then with a quick shake of his head and a wag of his tail he got down on his belly and crawled up to Uncle Yancey . Lou rose from her rocker and walked across the puncheons and leaned against the pole that supported the roof , standing full in the moonlight and shading her eyes from the glare of the moon in her face . " That you , Vigo darlin ' ? " she called , softly . " That you , darlin ' Vigo ? "  |p125Whatever  it was that Uncle Yancey wanted to tell her about Vigo , only because he thought it would be best for her , he forgot now as he heard her soft , sweet voice calling in the night . " No , Lou , " he replied . " Hit 's me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand come to her mouth and the other hand clutch the shawl around her shoulders , and he heard her murmur , " Oh ! " " Ai n't he home yet ? " Uncle Yancey said , patting the dog 's head as he walked up the path , catching his breath after the long climb . " No , he ai n't come home yet , " Lou said , backing into the shadows once more and sitting in her rocker . Uncle Yancey tried to laugh lightly . " He 'll be along d'reckly , I reckon , " he said . Walking along , dragging his feet wearily now that the hill was made , Uncle Yancey breathed deeply and caught the sweet scent of the honeysuckle , blooming in the night along the bank of the old creek which ran down along the lower end of the orchard , unchangedsince the time long ago when Great-great-grandma Jolly planted the few slips she had brought all the way from Cumberland and tended them until they got their first start and finally spread all along the upper bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their heavy sweetness . The honeysuckle had outlived that hardy old pioneer woman who had followed the first Jolly to this holler . As Uncle Yancey thought of it , the honeysuckle had almostoutlived him too , and long after he was dead and gone they would be perennial and fresh , their sweetness unchanged by the years which made men old and memory fade . Seeing Lou sitting in the old rocker , her nightgown tucked snugly around her legs and the shawl thrown loosely around her shoulders , and smelling the honeysuckle as it bloomed in the dewy dampness of the chill night air , Uncle Yancey was reminded of a picture , long ago in his boyhood , of a sweet little woman who had sat in that same old rocker that squeaked as it rolled over those same old puncheons of that same old dogtrot house . Uncle Yancey was born in that house , and it was here that he had lived as a boy , and the woman he saw was his old ma as she used to wait up for him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the hills.  | " Did ya see Vigo , Uncle Yancey ? " Lou asked as he walked slowly toward the gallery , silent with his recollections . " Yes , Lou . I seed ' im , down thar , a leetle while ago . " " Did he go t ' th ' talk meetin ' ? " " Yes , Lou , " Uncle Yancey replied , thankful at least that she knew . At least Vigo had told her this much , he thought . He came up to the gallery , unstrung the guitar from his back and leaned it against the pole which supported the roof , then sighed and sat down on the edge of the puncheons . He could see the outline of her face now , and the shadows cast upon it made her mouth appear small and thin and drawn . " I knowed about th ' talk meetin ' , Uncle Yancey , " she said . " I found some tore-up scraps o ' yaller paper down by th ' path , an ' I put hit t'gether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' know . " Uncle Yancey nodded understandingly . " Did he  --  is he  --  is Vigo a-goin ' , Uncle Yancey ? " she asked in a low and cautious way , timid and full of fear . Uncle Yancey nodded , wondering how to begin , what to say , how much to tell . She laughed a little strange , dry laugh . " Ya do n't hafta tell me , Uncle Yancey , " she whispered . " I know . I can always tell . I had a sign t' other day , an ' I knowed hit would come soon . " " Yes , honey , " Uncle Yancey replied , speaking softly and trying to let the way he said it tell her he was sorry . " I knowed , Uncle Yancey . " " Yes , honey . " " I knowed , all along , because I had th ' sign . " " Yes , honey . " " So you do n't hafta tell me , Uncle Yancey , if you do n't want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Yancey could tell that deep inside she was crying , although her cheeks were dry and there was not a trace of a tear in her eye as she sat , so small and patient , looking at him from the shadows of darkness which surrounded her . " I 'll tell you , honey , " he said , looking away from her and out across the holler at the gentle sway of the tall shortleaf pines thatp127rose above the crest of Piney Ridge . " I 'll tell you  --  yore Uncle Yancey wo n't keep hit from you , honey , never fear . " And he told her everything he knew , everything he himself had seen , and nothing more , leaving out everything else that others had told him about Vigo and Judd and Mamie . And all the while he talked he glanced toward her occasionally , watching the way she sat there , not saying a word and hardly breathing as she listened to everything he had to tell . Then , at last , when he had finished and looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , he saw how she began to rock slowly , careful not to let the rocker squeak , as she gazed steadily out over the moonlit holler . Lou just sat there for what Uncle Yancey thought was a quarter of an hour , almost not breathing , but rocking ever so gently and slowly , without making a sound or a whimper , or changing the expression on her face , or turning her eyes from the holler . Presently her ghostlike silence began to frighten him a little , and there crept upon him a guilty warmth in his cheeks and along the back of his neck . He waited for the first sign of a glassy , watery blur in her eyes , and the rise and fall of her bosom , but she showed none of those outward signs . Whatever it was he expected her to do , whether it was to cry and carry on as though Vigo 's going were like the final passing of a dear one , she did n't do it , and in a little while he began to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been if she had broken down and gone all to pieces . This silent grief , sitting there unable to cry or wring her hands and wail , was ten times worse than the way it would have been if she had let herself go , he thought , as his fear increased . It took more than courage for a woman who loved as deeply and intensely as Lou to sit there , silent and brave , without so much as a whimper or a sigh . It took something more than strength or courage , Uncle Yancey began to realize . It took the strong will of a full-grown woman , mature and wise . That 's what she was now . A woman fullgrown , and not a child like the memory of her he carried around with him whenever he thought of Lou , that yellow-haired , wild little animal who ran and laughed and squealed and cried , so sensi/tive and loving-tender he used to have to guard his tongue not to speak too quick or too harsh to her . Lou had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize . She was a woman now , strong and full of will , the will to fight and protect that which belonged to her , like Vigo or Thad or the girls or Little Lonzo . Directly she stopped her slow rocking and placed her hands on her knees , and she leaned over a little and looked down at her uncle Yancey , now almost breathless as he waited for her to speak . " I 'm glad ya told me , " she said , speaking softly yet firm . " I 'm glad ya told me . " " Maybe I had n't orta , Lou , " said Uncle Yancey , not looking at her . " Yes , ya done th ' right thing . I expected it of ya . " There was a smile on her face which he could see now plainly in the moonlight . She was looking straight at him , and there was a calmness in her blue eyes , as though she had come to her decision . " It was my duty , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what was my duty . " She nodded . " Hit was right . You 're th ' only one I have t ' turn to , Uncle Yancey , " she said , sweetly . There was gentleness and forgiveness in her voice , and the sound of it took a great worry from his mind , and he knew at once that she would n't go all to pieces as he had expected , and it made him glad that she had the strength to face it fairly and squarely . " What are you a-goin ' t ' do , Lou ? " he asked , looking at her with a sideways look and being careful not to let on how anxious he was to know what she had made up her mind to do . She sat back in the rocker and pulled the shawl around her shoulders and folded her arms across her bosom to keep out the chill of the night air . Then she began talking in a slow , thoughtful way . " This is my home , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the moon showed the distant haze of the faraway hills , topped with cedars and pines . " All my life this has been my home , where I was born an ' brung up , from a baby . And I 've been happy hyar , ' thout no worriments an ' no cares . They 's everythin ' hyar , everythin ' a body would want . With just apI29leetle toil , a woman an ' her family can live mighty good , with everythinga body needs. " 1 hai n't been no further away from home than Berryville , " she said , speaking calmly and gently , remembering back to her childhood . " I hai n't been no further away than that , but I 've seen th ' whole world from here . Th ' whole world . I know every tree , every rock , every grain of earth an ' blade o ' grass . " When I was a young ' un , I used t ' play hyar , on this gallery , with my rag dolls an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks . An ' I used t ' walk down this hill t ' go t ' Happy Holler school t ' of Miz ' Carithers , just like my own young ' uns is a-doin ' now . An ' when Grandpa Jolly died an ' Grandma was gone an ' th ' house seemed empty with just me an ' my ma an ' you an ' Aunt Carrie , I still wanted t ' live here , although with them gone it seemed so empty . " She stopped , and Uncle Yancey began thinking back to the days when his father , Grandpa Jolly , was alive , and how he liked to have his two sons around with him , and their families . Carrie , Uncle Yancey 's wife , had passed away many a year ago , and tonight was the first time he had heard the sound of her name in almost fifteen years . Carrie died right there in that parlor , in front of the hearth , where Little Lonzo used to lie when he first was sick , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the same thing that Little Lonzo had , but the doctors found out about it too late to do anything to save her , too late to take her to the sanitarium in Booneville . Others had died here in this dogtrot house , lying on a pallet by the hearth , just as she had lain , but they did n't call it consumption or tuberculosis , but milk disease or inflammation of the throat . Three of Lou 's family , a brother and two sisters , had died of it in this house , and two of Uncle Yancey 's own brothers had died of it when they were not yet in their teens . " I 've never wanted t ' leave this place , " Lou said , smiling with contentment . " I always said I would live an ' die hyar , jus ' like Aunt Carrie an ' Grandpa an ' Grandma Jolly an ' all th ' others , because if hit was good enough for them , hit was good enough for me ,  | " So it was allus my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' family an ' keep ' em well an ' strong with plenty o ' food an ' fresh air , a-growin ' up to appreciate th ' goodness of th ' earth and a-learnin ' th ' industry how t ' keep house an ' home an ' body alive an ' well with what th ' Lord give us . An ' then afore I was dead an ' gone , I would turn over this house to them so 's they could always have a home , allus have a comfortable place t ' live , an ' plenty o ' th ' comforts we ' uns had all our lives . I owe that much to my young ' uns , Uncle Yancey . " He nodded , remembering the good times and the bad which the Jollys for generations had had in this house , and it seemed to him that the good times  --  with plenty of everything , including laughter and music an ' play parties and love  --  had far outnumbered the bad times , through the cold winters when the Jollys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Yes , he thought , the Jollys had learned to take the good with the bad here , but there were so many good things to be had that they did n't mind the things they called bad , because time had taught them that , with a little industry , they could avoid the bad things like scarcity of food and warmth and what a body needs to keep the soul happy . And the Jollys had learned long ago that death itself sometimes can be good . So for all this they could be thankful to the Lord , as Lou had just explained . Lou paused for a moment and closed her eyes and sat there so still and quiet that her uncle Yancey began to think she had fallen asleep . But after a while she opened her eyes and brushed her right hand over them and began rocking again and trying to explain her decision : " Because so much could be had hyar , ' most ' thout even th ' askin ' , I could n't understand for a long time why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he 's been doin ' for so long . An ' atter a while , I finally decided that he was a-lookin ' for something more than is to be found hyar in th ' hills , where life is so free . " He used t ' say , when Little Lonzo was ailin ' an ' sickly , that this house was bad for us all an ' that it was th ' cause of so many people dyin ' hyar with consumption , or whatever ya call hit . He used t ' tell me about th ' houses folks in th ' cities lived in , with modern comfortsp131like built-in privies an ' ready heat . An ' he used t ' cuss this of house , with its wind a-blowin ' up through th ' cracks in th ' floor an " tween th ' chinkin ' an ' puncheons . An ' when he was in that frame o ' mind , he used t ' say that his wife an ' young ' uns desarved better than havin ' to use flour sacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a-livin ' like Indians , uncivilized an ' savage , more than a hundred year behind our time . " Let 's git out'n hyar , Lou , ' he 'd say t ' me sometimes . Let 's pack up our things an ' our young ' uns an ' leave these Gawd-damned hills an ' move t ' a civilized country an ' live like human bein 's orta live , stidder savages . An ' I 'll git me a job , a-carpenterin ' or a-workin ' in th ' coal mines like I uster , an ' I 'll give you an ' th ' young ' uns a betterlife than this . ' " But I allus stood by my folks an ' th ' way they lived , an ' I always said that what was good enough for them was good enough for me an ' my kin , my young ' uns . An ' I 'd never give in t ' him because I 'd allus say we was born t ' live hyar , an ' we would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' cities an ' out on th ' prairies , where everything you git has to be got with hard work . There ai n't no freedom when folks have to work so hard . But there 's freedom here in th ' hills , an ' plenty o ' time in which t ' enjoy th ' blessings o ' th ' Lawd . " We ' uns would be lost , Vigo , ' I 'd say to him . We do n't belong in that other life . We would n't know how to act , an ' like as not we would n't know how to live in any other way exceptin ' th ' way we 're a-livin ' . ' " An ' I tol ' him ever'body 's born an ' bred t ' live in a certain way , an ' us hill folks was born t ' live our way . And when I 'd tell Vigo thet , he 'd cuss an ' he 'd mope aroun ' an ' he 'd be like thet for days , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about th ' weariness in his bones , an ' Uncle Yancey nodded . " But he 'd allus come back , " he said , in defense of his own way of life . " He 'd allus come back , an ' that was a sign that the way we ' uns live was right an ' hit 'd allus win out in tit ' end . If a man 's born t ' be poor , he ai n't gon na be nothin ' else , Lou . "  | Lou stopped rocking and sat still for a moment while she looked at the moon and thought . Then with a little uncertainty , she said , " I do n't know , Uncle Yancey . I do n't know  --  ' pears like he allus tried to make a go of hit , just t ' show that he could do hit , an ' maybe a-hopin ' when he made . a go of hit , we ' uns 'd follow him . An ' e'en though he come back , he spent most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out there had , an ' a-complainin ' why he could n't have things like that . " " Money hai n't ever'thin ' , Lou , " Uncle Yancey said . " They 's a lot of things money cai n't buy . " " I do n't know , Uncle Yancey , " she said earnestly . " I jus ' do n't know . " THEY SAT THERE for a long time in the coolness of the night air , and after a while they both ran out of things to say , and , not wanting to hurry Lou in announcing her final decision , he took his guitar and played a few of the old ballads , picking softly with his thumb and fingers and fretting the choke so as not to wake up the young ones back there in Lou 's dogtrot house . Lou closed her eyes slowly and let her head fall against the headrestof the rocker and listened while Uncle Yancey ran through the chords of " Skip to My Lou " the way he always began his playing when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou had quietly disappeared , and another worriment had taken its place in her heart . Of all the things Lou wanted , keeping her family together was the most important of these . She wanted Vigo here where it was home . She had a warning , a strange and curious warning , that if Vigo left this time she would never see him again . Then there was Thad , almost grown now and soon able to take his place with men.  |p133Thad  would go away , and she might never hear from him again , ever . And he was still just a boy , actually , but that would n't keep him at home . A boy could make his place in the world . Thad wanted to have a mind of his own , he wanted what every boy dreams of : travel , to see new places out there beyond the hills where the prairies lead to the mountains and the mountains go down to the sea . He wanted to find adventure out there , adventure and romance and his fortune . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , but beforemany seasons changed , Sarie Bell would blossom all of a sudden , and some morning she would awaken and find herself on the threshold of womanhood , and before long there would be a change and she would be gone . It was a natural thing , but it would happen soon enough without Vigo speeding it on its way by leaving Lou to try and manage the children . In five or six years Addie Kate , too , would be ready to leave , and in a few more years Little Lonzo , her baby , would be the age of Thad , the age when a boy dreams of making his fortune . Of all the children , Little Lonzo was the one of whom Lou was most certain . Her instinct told her that Little Lonzo , more like her own people , the Jollys , was born to the hills to take root in them and become a part of them . Little Lonzo would never wonder what was on the other side of the hill , over in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonzo was satisfied with things the way they were , and he never wanted them to change or to change himself . Sitting there with her eyes closed as Uncle Yancey plucked his last chord , Lou realized that the most important thing in her life was keeping her family together as long as she could . The time would come soon enough when Thad and Sarie Bell and Addie Kate would finally walk down the path to the road which led from the holler and into the world outside . If she could keep them togethera little longer , that was all she wanted . To let Vigo go away now would be the first break in the ties that held them together . And when that tie was broken it would be like the cutting of the cord that holds a newborn babe to its mother ; the break would be forever and eternal , and it could never again enter into the place where it first began to take form and life .   Lou sat up suddenly , opened her eyes , and turned and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees while he looked out over the moonlit mist of the holler . Uncle Yancey felt her gaze upon him , and he turned his head slowly and saw that she was sitting erect in her chair , gripping the arms of it . Her eyes glistened with flecks of moisture and reflected tiny sparkles of light . Uncle Yancey looked at her , and there was a prickly race along his spine . He knew she had come to her decision now , at last , because her mouth was firm and her chin was set and determined , and he imagined that she was slowly gritting her teeth to give her courage . " Uncle Yancey --  " she said , pausing a little . " Yes , honey ? " Uncle Yancey replied , pretending to be unconcernedand casual about what he knew she was going to say . " Uncle Yancey , m ' mind 's made up . I 'm a-goin ' with Vigo ! " " What ? " " I 'm a-goin ' with Vigo . " " An ' leave this place ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up and it was final . " I 'm a-goin ' t ' Californy with him , Uncle Yancey , " she said , still sitting up straight in her rocker , with her hands on her knees , her head erect , and her eyes sparkling in the dark like a cat 's . " Ever ' which way he goes , I 'm a-goin ' , too . I ai n't a-goin ' t ' lose him any more . " " But , Lou " ' Tai n't no use , Uncle Yancey , " she said , finally . " I had a sign t' other day , an ' th ' sign tol ' me thet if he goes this time , he ai n't never comin ' back . I want t ' go where he goes . I want t ' be with him , always . An ' for him , I 'd give up m ' home  --  my purty home hyar . " " An ' leave yore young ' uns ? " " No . I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ever ' which way he goes . If he goes this time all alone , he wo n't come back . I know hit . I know hit for sure , Uncle Yancey . " The first thought that came to Uncle Yancey was Mamie Cossey , with her arms flung around Vigo 's neck , pulling him down withp137Vigo had gone into the barn and come out again with his long box of carpenter tools . " Be keerful , Lou , an ' do n't git him all riled up . Maybe he 's been a-drinkin ' a little , an ' ya know his mean temper ? ' Lou laughed and tossed her head back , throwing her hair over her shoulder in a gesture of defiance . " I hai n't a-feared o ' him , Uncle Yancey . Now you jus ' go in an ' try t ' git some sleep till full mawnin ' , an ' atter a while I 'll git you a nice breakfast . They 's a new day a-dawnin ' , Uncle Yancey . A brand-new day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAYLIGHT when Lou touched Uncle Yancey on the shoulder , and he jumped up , blinking his eyes and rubbing his nose . " Wake up , Uncle Yancey , " Lou said . " Hit 's time fer yore break-fast . " Uncle Yancey rubbed his eyes , blinked in the light , and turned to look toward the barn down the hill when he heard Vigo sawing wood . " Hope thar hai n't no fraction ' tween you an ' Vigo , " Uncle Yancey said , scuffling across the puncheons toward the front door of the cabin . Lou smiled and put her finger to her lips . " Sh-h-h ! " she whispered . " Th ' young ' uns is still asleep . " Uncle Yancey sat in a chair in the kitchen and tipped it back so that it was balanced on the two hind legs , with the chair back leaningagainst the wall . There he sat , cross-legged in the warmth of the kitchen as he watched Lou pour the coffee and place it before him on the table , then fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread beside the bowl . She had changed from her nightgown and r hawl , in which she had sat all night out there on the gallery , into a lean and freshly ironed flour-sack dress , unbleached and with the printing showing through it from the reverse side . The dress had no shape to it and hung loosely on her like a sack that reached to her calves . Only when she moved about did it reveal any of her figure beneath it . Lou 's face was turned away from him as she went back to the wood-burning stove , lifted off the coffee pot , and poured a cupful for herself . As she stood there for a moment , filling the cup , Uncle Yancey saw the glow of excitement which had filled her cheeks with color . Her eyelids , slightly drooping from weariness and the long watchful night , blinked slowly as she watched the dark coffee pour from the spout . She appeared to be absorbed in deep thought , because the cup was almost full before she realized it , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head and sat down . " C'm on , Uncle Yancey , " she said , " eat yore breakfast . " Uncle Yancey threw his weight forward on the chair , and the front legs came down with a bang . " Danged if hit do n't beat all ! " Uncle Yancey muttered . " What beats all ? " Lou asked , looking up from ' her cup . " Thet Vigo ! " Uncle Yancey said . " Do n't know whut a danged fool he is , that 's what ! Leavin ' a purty lil ' woman like you , an ' a good place an ' good grub fer scratchin ' an ' scrunchin ' all over Gawd knows whar at ! ' At 's what I mean beats all ! " Lou laughed and reached over and touched Uncle Yancey 's thin and bony hand . " Hit 's gon na be all right , Uncle Yancey . I hope you hai n't a-worryin " bout me none , air ye ? " Uncle Yancey slapped his hand on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danged well I 'm a-worryin ' , Lou . If I wuz a little younger , I 'd tan his hide , that 's whut I 'd do  --  a-goin ' off an ' a-leavin ' you this-a way . Hit 's a daggoned shame ! " Lou smiled at him , but Uncle Yancey 's chin was quivering , and he bit his lip as he sat there gazing down into his bowl of mush and corn bread . In her mind she knew Uncle Yancey had decided that Vigo was going away alone this time , that he had talked her out of it as before.  | " I 'm a-goin '  --  like I said , Uncle Yancey , " she announced slowly , looking at him over the rim of her coffee cup . Uncle Yancey 's pale and watery-blue eyes snapped up quickly , and he looked at her sharply . " Ye air ? " he said doubtfully . Lou nodded as she sipped her coffee and smiled . Placing it in the saucer , she sighed , leaned back in her chair and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uncle Yancey was still looking at her , and he was convinced now that she was telling the truth and not just trying to defend Vigo . Yet from the thin smile on her lips and the color in her face he could not tell whether she was glad or just trying to be cheerful about it for the sake of appearances while Uncle Yancey was here . He did n't know whether she was on the verge of tears or whether it was something else . There was a false color in her face , and her eyes , although dulled from the lack of sleep , were glittering with a strange luster . A moment ago , as he watched her pour the coffee and dish the mush , he had decided that at last she had given in to Vigo , that Vigo on some pretext or another had managed to convince her that he had to go away again although he could not say when he would come back . Although Uncle Yancey knew that , whatever it was between Lou and her husband , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own blood and kin and he had a right to defendher , even against that good-for-nothing sheercrapper who called himself her husband . Now , after he had heard her say she was leaving her home here and going with Vigo , Uncle Yancey did n't know whether to think she was sad or actually rejoicing in the prospect of leaving Happy Holler . Whatever it was , Uncle Yancey did n't know what else to do or what else to say . " He 's a daggone fool , thet 's what he is ! " " Now , now , Uncle Yancey ! " Lou said , scolding him like a child . " But he is , Lou , an ' you know hit ! " " He ai n't no sich-a thing , now . " Uncle Yancey emptied part of his coffee into his saucer , bracedhis elbows on the table , blew angrily into the saucer , and sipped it . " Hell-fire ! " he muttered . " Whut was Vigo a-doin ' all thet timep140I was a-lookin ' fer him , then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him about seeing Vigo and Judd and Mamie heading toward Cora 's place down by the old millpond . For less than nothing , Uncle Yancey was of a mind to tell Lou the whole thing . " Now there , Uncle Yancey , " Lou said , smiling sweetly , " do n't be too hard on th ' pore boy . Th ' pore sweet darlin ' . " " He give any excuses why I could n't find him an ' them Cosseys , Lou ? ' Ja tell thet no-account husban ' o ' your'n how I was a-lookin ' all over town fer ' im las ' night ? " Lou nodded . " He did . He told me ever'thin ' . " Uncle Yancey took a long drink from the saucer , then put it down beside the cup . " Oh , he did , huh ? " he exclaimed doubtfully . Lou continued to nod . " I said do n't be too hard on th ' pore boy , Uncle Yancey . Now you jus ' wait till you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamie and Judd had left the town and driven north to the hardwood-lumber plant , she said . There they had awakened the lumber boss and bought hardwood flooring , a hickory wagon tongue , tar paper , bolts , nails , and everything else which Vigo would need to build the trailer . Then , as they rode back to town , they began jawing and fighting because Mamie and Judd wanted to go along , but Vigo would n't let them go along with him to California as the Cosseys wanted to do . It was Mamie who had raised the most fuss , but in the end Judd had quieted her , and at last it was agreed that they were to get to California any way they could , and Vigo was to build his trailer . It was Vigo 's original plan to finish the trailer and strike out alone across the plains . " Then he 's not a-takin ' Thad ? " Uncle Yancey exclaimed . " Wait , " Lou said . " It was his original idy not to take Thad --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' up ferThad ? " Lou nodded . " Vigo war n't worried over thet , he said . He 'd explaint ' th ' shipyard people , an ' he said he 'd pay back ever ' cent he got in Thad 's name , " Lou told her uncle . " But thet 's takin ' money under false pretenses , Lou . "  | " Th ' way Vigo looked at hit , it ai n't breakin ' no law if you pays hit back . An ' that was what he was a-aimin ' t ' do  --  pay back ever ' cent soon 's he got out t ' Californy . " " But whut about yore decision , Lou ? " Uncle Yancey asked , dropping his hands to his lap . " I 'm a-comin ' to thet , Uncle Yancey , " she said with a grin . " Atter Vigo got through a-tellin ' his plans , how he 'd build him a trailer an ' cover hit with tar paper , then hitch hit up to Thad 's of car an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own self , then I sprung my idy on him . " Uncle Yancey gulped more coffee from his saucer . " ' Twar n't no argufyin ' with thet , " she said quietly . " At first he jus ' curled up his tongue in his teeth , madlike . Then he jus ' looked at me , rale studylike , an ' I looked square at him t ' show I made up m ' mind about hit . D'reckly he commenced t ' smile an ' Lou sighed , and her cheeks glowed , her eyes shone with a dancing sparkle , and Uncle Yancey thought he detected behind her sudden , shy smile a secret between her and Vigo , some secret she shared as a triumph . It was the kind of smile Uncle Yancey had seen on the faces of small boys who had bested others in dropping knives or swapping chinquapins for marbles . Lou thought she had won , but in reality it was Vigo who had actually won again , Uncle Yancey decided . Ever since he had been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , he had belittled this cabin and this life in Happy Holler , boasting how wonderful life was in that world of comforts and convenience he had seen outside the Ozarks . Uncle Yancey recollected how determinedLou had been in holding onto her way of life because it was the only way of life she had ever known . Uncle Yancey had often thought of it , and he had always come to the conclusion that Lou was in a fix ; holding onto this cabin and this way of life meant having to give up Vigo for a part of the time , while the only way she could hold onto Vigo was to give up this way of life . At last Vigo had won out , as he always did , and Lou  --  poor thing  --  thought instead that it was her triumph . " I 'm rale sorry , Lou , " Uncle Yancey said , lowering his voice and avoiding her eyes . " An ' I only hope that you can make th ' best of ever-what hit will be like  --  out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though we 're a-givin ' up this place  --  it ai n't as though we 're a-gittin ' shed o ' our land , like some of th ' folks is cogitatin ' doin ' , " Lou said . " What , Lou ? " Uncle Yancey asked , looking up from his saucer of cooling coffee . " Folks is a-gittin ' shed o ' their land in Happy Holler , Uncle Yancey , " she informed him . " They tol ' Vigo that they was through a-tryin ' t ' keep house in these hawg-wallers , an ' so they 're a-gonnaUncle Yancey slapped the table with the palm of his hand . " Hit do n't take no pains t ' keep a house in this hyar holler , Lou , " he said , defending the land and its abundance of everything . Lou shook her head emphatically . " Jus ' th ' same , they a-goin ' t ' sell their chattels an ' give up life hyar ' cause danged if they can see any sense in keepin ' things hyar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I hope you hai n't , Lou . " " Ai n't what ? " " A  --  ai n't a-goin ' t ' git shed o ' yore land an ' this hyar dogtrot house what you heired from yore Pa . " Lou glanced at Uncle Yancey as the thought lingered in her mind for a moment . " Vigo says t ' sell , Uncle Yancey , " she murmured . " I was a-goin ' by him an ' his idy . Never thought o ' nothin ' else but doin ' everwhatth ' darlin ' boy says t ' do , Uncle Yancey . " The old man shook his head sadly and pulled on the white beard on his chin . " Someday , Lou , " he said , " they 'll all come a-traipsin ' back hyar , a-wishin ' they had th ' old home place t ' come back to . Right now , though , they 're a-lettin ' a few dollars go t ' their heads . Money soon flies , but thar hai n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Vigo says we c'n sell our land an ' this hyar dogtrot house fer a piece o ' change an ' go out t ' Californy an ' strike hit rich out thar . An ' any time we ' uns wants t ' come back , thar 'll always be plenty o ' money an ' we c'n git us a place . " " With ever'body a-gittin ' shed o ' his land , prices wo n't be worth nothin ' , Lou , " Uncle Yancey told her . " If that 's their idy , why , youp143c'n buy cabins an ' land in a day or two for a song . Thar wo n't be no profit in thet , Lou . Th ' market will be flooded . Like as not , they 'll be so much on th ' market they wo n't be no takers . Farmin ' tools , livestock , an ' ever'thin ' they own they wo n't be able t ' give away Honest , Lou , " Uncle Yancey added with a shake of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . " Lou gazed at Uncle Yancey , and there was bewilderment in her eyes . " I 'd say not do it , Lou , " Uncle Yancey said . " You know how Vigo is , Lou . He starts out t ' do things , an ' sometimes he never finishes . Remember that barn he started t ' build ? Well , likely hit 'll be th ' same when he gits out in Californy . Maybe he 'll just lose interest , like he allus does in things . He 'll start gittin ' a hankerin ' t ' see some other place whar he 's not been , an ' first thing you know , you 'll be a-traipsin ' all over th ' country , a-follerin ' him . " Better hang ont ' th ' old home place , Lou , " he said , with an emphatic jerk of his head . " Maybe you 'd better have a place t ' come back to when th ' gold rush t ' Californy 's over . " " Th ' gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled look . Uncle Yancey nodded . " That 's what this is  --  a gold rush . I do n't know what 's got into folks , but they believes ever ' Tom , Dick , an ' Harry what comes along with a pokeful o ' money an ' a lot o ' big talk an ' promises . Seems like they never will be able t ' 1'arn ' em nothin ' . Must be magic in that name , Californy . Do n't know what else hit could be that makes folks go plumb off their judgment . Jus ' mention th ' word Californy t ' some folks , an ' they goes plumb hawg wild ! " Lou 's face clouded as Uncle Yancey went on : " They 'll be a coupla million folks a-goin ' t ' Californy , th ' way them fellers is goin ' around recruitin ' menfolks . Biggest land rush you ever saw , like as not . But when th ' shootin 's all over , they 'll be a whole nation o ' folks who wisht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californy , Lou . " So , better take my advice an ' hold onto these of hawg-wallers . Hit 'll come in mighty handy , just in case things do n't pan out , out thar in Californy , honey . "  |p144THE  SUN WAS HOT and straight up . Vigo straightened , wiped his forehead on his shirt sleeve , took off his hat , and backed over against the wall of the old log barn and looked at the work accomplishedso far . The trailer was about half finished . He had made the framework , laid the flooring , raised the skeleton framework and attached the springs , the axle , and rubber-tired wheels , and then bolted on the hickory wagon tongue . He was right in the middle of marking the plank siding ready for the saw when something made him stop , stand up , and look around him . Maybe he was forgetting to do something . He glanced quickly at the trailer , looked at the bolts which fastened the two-by-four uprightsto the bottom frame and at the smooth new floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he had to do now was to put on the siding , then the roof , cut a couple of windows and a door , then cover the whole thing with the tar paper . After that he would build two bunks , one over the other , along one wall inside the contraption , then make a few shelves and drawers for Lou to store her things . With a few finishing touches the trailer would be completed in a couple of days . Vigo turned his head and looked inside the log barn . Thad 's hound was lying in the shade , just inside the barn door , with his head on his paws and his eyes closed . Just as Vigo looked at him , the dog raised his head , blinked once or twice , sniffed at the air , then slowly got up , walked out into the sun , and faced toward the thicket of sassafras that grew up the slope of the hill at the head of the holler . " What is hit , boy ? " Vigo said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the back of his neck ; he whined , then turned around and went back into the shade of the barn and lay down . This time , however , he did not close his eyes , but keptp145watching the thicket just across the little gully and a few yards behind the barn . Maybe it was a breeze , or a rabbit , or someone up there on the hillside picking dewberries , Vigo thought . He shook his head . Too early for dewberries to ripen . They would not come in for another two weeks , maybe longer . " ' Tai n't no berry pickers , " Vigo said , rubbing the back of his neck with the palm of his right hand . He ran his hand down his back , along the soft warm flesh , moist with sweat . Maybe it was someone hunting up there on the hill . No one but Thad ever hunted on that hill , though , Vigo thought . " Better git back t ' work , " he said , picking up the handsaw he had laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark and pulled it across the edge of the board , but just as he ' began to saw , Thad 's hound sprang up and ran stiff-legged toward the thicket , . whining as he ran . Vigo threw the saw down and turned around , wiping the sweat from his face as he did so . Thad 's hound reached the edge of the thicket , stopped , raised his head and sniffed at the air , then turned around and walked back to the barn . " Aw hell , " Vigo said , going back to his work . Suddenly he thought of the beds he would build in the trailer . They would be wide and long , with plenty of footroom for his long thin legs and bony feet , and it would be soft as goose feathers , and low and comfortable . He smiled to himself . He could see a pretty woman lying in that bed , her arms folded behind her head , smiling at him . He would be standing in the doorway of the trailer , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him something like this , " My , but it 's hot today , Mister Hoxie ! " And he would ask , " What 's hot ? " and she would say the weather was hot , and he would laugh at that and ask her what she was doing in there on his bed , and she would say , " You ought to know because you put me here , you old he-dog , you ! " " Who in th ' hell are you anyhow ? " he would ask , and she would say , " What difference does it make who I am  --  you wanted me , did n't you ? Well , here I am , Mister Earthy Man ! "  | Mister Earthy Man ? Now he knew who she was . She was that redhead from St. Louis he met down in the While Away that time he took the corn liquor there for that tourister . He could hear her pleading with him now , just as he had imagined she pleaded with him every night since that day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by but that he had thought of her sometime during the day or night . Sometimes , as he worked in the fields pulling fodder or husking corn or stacking wheat bundles in the shock , he used to hold a conversation with her and tell her what he was thinking of , and it was always a very exciting thing to do , trying to imagine what she would say and how she would act after he said whatever came to his mind at the moment . " I like earthy men , " she had said , and to it she had added , " I can even smell the earth on you . Why do you stay here ? Bet all you do is just eat and drink and just go to bed all the time , so why do n't you be like that with me because I want to play , and why do n't you play with me , why do n't you come with me to St. Louis and I 'll give you all the eatin ' and drinkin ' and bed play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sawed end fell to the ground , and Vigo laughed as he picked up two more marked boards . What a woman she was , that redhead from St. Louis ! He never saw her after that , but he never forgot her . And what a Gawddamnedfool he was , too ! She had pulled him into the center of the room , but all he could think of was that door behind him , and the way it would open and how that sonofabitch would stand there with his legs braced apart and his fists doubled up , and how he would cuss and raise hell when he saw Vigo with his pretty little redhead from St. Louis ! It was a good thing he got out when he did . She was a crazy woman . The wild look in her eyes , the way her head fell back and her eyes closed and her breasts rose and fell when she had whispered , " Say something  --  say anything ! " She was a regular she-dog . Just like Mamie . Hotter than , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ozarks . She did n't have any of the sly ways like that redhead . Mamie came right out in the open , in the broad daylight , and said what was on her mind . But the redhead did n't , and that was what made her so fascinating to him and madep147him remember her all this time . Mamie was a little fool ; but not this redhead . She was nobody 's fool . Someday he would go to St. Louis and find her , just to see if she was like he remembered her . The sawed ends fell off again and Vigo stood up , wiped more sweat , and glanced over at Thad 's hound again . The dog was standing there , whining and wagging his tail . He had seen somethingthis time , someone he recognized and knew , or he would n't be wagging his tail . Vigo turned around and looked into the thicket , but he could n't see anything . He glanced up high on the hill and saw the tall , straight hickories and pines and the conifers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not a ripple among them , not a breeze anywhere . Slowly his gaze wandered over the hill , and he took a deep breath , glanced at the dog again , saw him wag his tail and then lie down in the shade ; keeping his eyes looking straight at the sassafras thicket just across the little gully behind the barn . " What is hit , boy ? " Vigo said , glancing from the dog to the thicket again . Just then he saw a movement in the thicket . The hound beat his tail on the ground as he lay there , looking straight ahead . Vigo looked again , and this time he saw what it was . It was a woman . Mamie . Vigo glanced quickly from Mamie up toward the cabin . Lou was inside the cabin . She had brought his lunch to him on a plate , then said , " Vigo , I been up all night a-waitin ' fer ya , an ' I 'm t'ard . If ya do n't mind , I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fait me some rest . " She was asleep now , he thought . Mamie did n't know that he had seen her . She called to him in a hoarse whisper : " Vigo ! " Then she stepped back into the thicket . Vigo glanced quickly over toward the bushes and saw Mamie 's bare arm as she waved to him , motioning for him to come to her . Her body was half hidden among the saplings , but Vigo could see her pale blue dress and her yellow hair . " Vigo ! " She must have crossed the ridge , climbed up the side of the hill ,  | circled behind Lou 's house , and come down the hill to the thicket behind the barn , Vigo thought . It was a hard climb , coming over from Judd Cossey 's place that way . She must have sneaked off and left Judd , or maybe Judd was down in Berryville making a deal with someone else to take them to California . Vigo glanced up toward the dogtrot house , then walked quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then climbed up the other side toward the thicket . Mamie backed deeper in among the sassafras saplings and leaned against a thick one . Her hands were behind her back , and her head was tilted a little to one side , and there was a wide grin on her face . The perspiration had soaked through her pale blue dress and made dark streaks down the sides . Her lips were glistening with moisture , and she was breathing heavily , as though she had run all the way. / igo ducked down below the low-hanging branches of the sassafrasand brushed them out of his face with his arms until he was deep in the shadows of the thicket . " Hello , Vigo ! " Mamie said , leaning forward as he approached near her. / igo reached down , grabbed her arm , and pulled her deeper into the thicket . The flesh on her arm was cool and solid and a little damp with perspiration . " Git back , outa sight ! " he growled , jerking her along as he waded through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Vigo " Mamie whimpered . " What in th ' hell 'd ya do this fer ! " he whispered sharply . " I had t ' see ya , Vigo , " she cried , softly . " I just had to . " " Yer a damned little fool an ' ya know hit , Mamie ! " She looked up at him and smiled , even though he was gripping her arm , pulling her along through the sharp limbs of the sassafras . " Ya hai n't got no right , a-comin ' hyar like this , a-sneakin ' like a slut ! " Vigo said , speaking through his clenched teeth . " I orta kill ya ! " Mamie continued to smile , and she did n't resist him or complain as he dragged her up the steep slope of the hill to a small shelf where the sassafras grew thin and it was sheltered and dark among the higher trees . He stopped and let her fall backward a little as he released her arm.  | . " I had t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be mad . " Vigo was breathing hard from pulling her along through the brush uphill . " You 're jus ' a-fixin ' t ' git me in trouble , Mamie , " he panted . " Judd 'll kill me an ' you both fer this if he ever finds out ! " Mamie shook her head and looked down at her feet . They were bare and red . " Whar 's yore shoes ! " She looked up at him and grinned . " I hai n't got on none , Vigo , " she said , laughing . " An ' I hai n't got on nothin '  --  but this hyar blue dress . " She seized the sides of her dress and pulled them out until the hem was above her knees . " Wan na see ? " she asked , laughing . Vigo shook his head slowly and bit his tongue , curled up between his teeth . " You 're nuthin ' but a she-dog , Mamie , " he said , looking into her face . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , Vigo , " Mamie said . " Hai n't got on no shoes , no petticoat , an ' no pretties , neither . An '  --  an '  --  I just had me a nice clean bath an ' put on this blue dress ' cause ya said once't ya liked hit . " Vigo leaned against a sapling . " Hit ai n't no use , Mamie , " he said . " Th ' deal ' tween me an ' you an ' Judd is all off . We had all that out las ' night . " Mamie shook her head , dropped her skirt , and folded her hands over her stomach . " I got a right , Vigo , " she murmured , looking at her feet , then quickly up at him . " Ya was a-goin ' with me , jus ' th ' same as ya was a-goin ' with Judd . " " I hai n't now , though . " " First off , atter we had a few drinks , ya was . An ' then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do hit  --  why 'd ya do thet , Vigo ? " Vigo looked down at Mamie . She was just like a baby crying forgar-tit , he thought . She was so open and unashamed about it that it left nothing about her untold . Every thought , every word , everythingwhich tarried for a speck was standing forth to be read in her eyes , the way she tilted her head and rolled her eyes up at him so plain and simple like a child . There was a time , he recollected , when he had shown some interest in her , when her naked , untaught frankness gave him a feeling of power and strength and manhood . When she was like this he used to amuse himself secretly by teasing her . Then she would cry and close her eyes tightly and grit her teeth and stomp the ground in a tantrum which would make him laugh . All this was before the coming of that redhead from St. Louis . After that , Vigo used to put the two together , side by side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to lose interest in Mamie because she was so unlearned in the art of making a man hanker after her , so common , so fast and loose . When Vigo lost interest in anything or anyone he was through with them forever . Now her coming to him like this , sneaking through the thicket to whisper his name , to motion him into the dark shade on the hillside , to display her bare feet and to lift her skirt to her knees and flaunt her nakedness before him , made him realize that he was getting very close to losing interest in her . If she could only be a little less open and plain to read , he thought . If she only would n't flounce herself around and throw herselfat him , so brazen and daring and vulgar . It unnerved him when he was alone with her , to say nothing of the fear it gave him when she did it the way she had done the night before , with Judd right there beside them , watching them and casting suspicious glances at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't caught on before now . " Answer me , Vigo , " she exclaimed . " What ? " " Answer me . " Vigo was far away , and he did n't realize it until she grabbed his sleeve and tugged on it . " I said why 'd ya change yore mind , Vigo ? " Mamie repeated . Vigo frowned down at her . " Ya know danged well why , " he said , nodding a few times . " First thing ya know we 'd git out somewhars an ' you 'd git out o ' line an ' Judd would find out an ' then kill us both , an ' then whar 'd we be ? " Mamie laughed . " Dead , I reckon , Vigo , " she said . " Anyhow , we 'd have a little fun t'gether , Vigo , would n't we ? "  |p151Vigo  shook his head . " Jus ' th ' same , Mamie , I hai n't a-goin ' that-a way now . Lou 's put her foot down . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " Mamie threw her head back and closed her eyes and laughed . " Ya was n't thinkin ' o ' them las ' night , Vigo . Ya was a-fixin ' t ' go away with I an ' Judd an ' leave ' em like you allus do . " " But Lou 's a-goin ' now . Hit 's different now , Mamie . Afore Lou would n't go , but now she 's a-goin ' an ' ever'thin 's worked out jus ' tine . " " But ya promised me , " Mamie said , whimpering a little . " Ya ai n't disrememberin ' thet , Vigo ? " Vigo laughed . " I was drunk , Mamie . So was you , an ' so was Judd . " " ' Tai n't no excuse fer breakin ' a promise , Vigo , " Mamie said , pouting . " Aw hell , Mamie , " Vigo sighed , " use some sense ! " Vigo bit his tongue , but promptly withdrew it from between his teeth and tried to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' think of , Mamie . I hai n't never done nothin ' beknownst t ' hurt ' em or mortify ' em . " " But ya said y'self Lou do n't want no more " Now , Mamie ! " he said , patiently . " Ya did , Vigo . Ya said " " Mamie ! " he scolded . " Ya said she did n't want no more , ya did . " " Did n't no sech-a thing . An ' I was drunk if I did . " " Vigo Hoxie ! " Mamie said , accusingly . " All I said was , Lou could n't . I did n't say she did n't want to . 1 hcy 's a big difference ' tween not wantin ' to an ' not bein ' able to . " " Well , they hai n't no strings on me , Vigo , " Mamie said earnestly . " I want to , do n't I ? An ' I can , cai n't I ? All right , Vigo . See ? See bow ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , Vigo . I want ' em , but Judd cai n't give ' em . You want ' em , but Lou cai n't give ' em . Now see ? Hit 's up t ' me an ' you , Vigo . Hit 's th ' onl'est way we can both git what we want , Vigo . You an ' me . See how it t is , Vigo ? " Vigo looked back through the thicket toward the barn . " What 's ya lookin ' at , Vigo ? " Vigo shook his head . " Nothin ' , " he said uneasily.  |p152Mamie  stepped up to him quickly , locked both arms around his right arm and held it close to her . " Vigo , le 's run away t'gether , love . Le 's run away an ' go som'ers an ' never come back . We both want th ' same things , Vigo , " she said , hugging his arm . " I 'll make you a good woman , Vigo . Will you ? " He pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stared down at her . " Ya orta be ashamed , Mamie , fer sayin ' sich a thing ! " Mamie pressed her body against him and looked up and grinned . " Ort I , Vigo ? " Vigo nodded and smiled wryly . " You 're actin ' like a young ' un , Mamie . A sp'iled one , to boot . " Mamie backed away from him , pulled her dress tightly across the sharp bones in her thighs and pressed her palms down against the flatness of her stomach and then held her hands to her hips as she looked at herself . " I hai n't no young ' un , Vigo . " " But you 're actin ' like one . " " Yo 're jus ' tryin ' t ' change th ' subject , " she said . Vigo was getting impatient . They were getting nowhere here . He wanted her to leave now . Her silly talk was grating on him . " I said you acted like a young ' un , an ' you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ort t ' be took across my knee . That 's what ya need , Mamie  --  a good birchin ' . " Mamie shook her head slowly and looked up at him without blinking . " Ya know better'n that , Vigo . That hai n't what I need . " " But hit 's what ya ort t ' get , Mamie . " Mamie pouted . " Ya promised me , Vigo --  " If I did , I had too much liquor in my gut . I 'm sober now . I got all my faculties . " He bit his lower lip and looked down at her , then said , " Maybe --  " But ya allus keep puttin ' me off , Vigo . An ' it 'll be never . That 's what it 'll be  --  never . Ya do n't care about me , like ya said you did . " " Ya ort to be ashamed , Mamie . " " But I hai n't , Vigo . I hai n't got nothin ' t ' be ashamed of . God made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' thet. "  | " Well , then ? " " Ai n't no use t ' back out , Vigo . Only thing 's wrong with you is , you 're afraid t ' let go o ' yourself jus ' once't , Vigo . You know what 'd happen if ya did . You could n't let me go , Vigo . I 'd h'ant ya , Vigo . Keep ya awake nights , th ' way ya keep me awake nights . Then ya 'd laugh outa th ' other side o ' yore face , Vigo . What I 'm a-talkin 's th ' ( ; od 's truth , Vigo , an ' you know ' t is . " Vigo had turned away and was looking down the hill through the darkness of the grove of sassafras saplings , but when she said that he turned his head slowly and tried to look at her ; but there was no smile on her lips now , and her eyes were looking steadily at him , and he knew that she believed what she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Maybe he was just a little bit afraid of her . Maybe if he let himself go he would never he the same again . He could n't let it happen like that , and he could n't let her know that there was any part of a truth in what she said . He looked at her quickly , then seized her and drew her up close to him and pressed his hands firmly against her back and held her that way for a moment , just to prove it to her . " See ? " he said , laughing at her . " I ai n't afraid , Mamie . Ai n't afraid o ' nothin ' . Ya do n't raise a bristle on my neck , Mamie . Not a single bristle . " She leaned back in his arms and looked up at him . " Then why do n't ya try an ' see , Vigo ? Why do n't you try an ' sec , if ya ai n't a-skeerd o ' me , jus ' little of me. , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and there was confidence in the way she looked up at him and smiled . He shook his head . " I cai n't , Mamie , " he said , seriously . " Maybe I 'd like to , sometime , but I cai n't  --  not now . " " When , Vigo ? " she said . " Before we go , maybe ? " Vigo said , " Uh-huh . Maybe . " " Do n't promise me , Vigo . Oh , do n't promise me an ' then not keep it . " He looked at her and nodded . " You 'll see , Mamie . " " I want t ' know definite , Vigo , " she insisted . Her voice was calm ,  | and there was none of that careless , high-pitched mockery in it any more . Her lips were pale , and her eyes were narrowed slightly , and they gazed into his with an unwavering calmness . Vigo relaxed his grip a little , but she held herself against him , firm and warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll see . " " But when ? Jus ' tell me when , Vigo . Ya wo n't be sorry , Vigo . I 'll do anythin ' ya say , Vigo . I 'll even promise never t ' see ya ag'in , if that 's what ya want . " Vigo moved his right hand up her back slowly until he touched her neck and held the back of her head in his hand and pressed her head toward him as he leaned forward and brushed his lips against her forehead . " I do n't want thet , Mamie  --  hit ai n't thet I do n't want t ' see ya , Mamie . Hit 's jus ' She nodded . " I know , Vigo . I know . Only stop yore teasin ' an ' talk serious . " Vigo laughed a little , and there was a weak and shaky tone to it . He glanced over his shoulder toward the direction of the dogtrot house , but it was hidden through the thicket . " Nex ' Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done then , an ' I 'll go down t ' Berryville an ' git me some gas . We 're aimin ' t ' pull out an ' high-tail it Saturday or Sunday , soon 's I git that damned trailer done . " Mamie smiled a little , but her smile was weak and her lips were almost colorless now . She licked her lips and swallowed hard . " Saturday , Vigo ? Whar 'll it be ? How about th ' graveyard , Vigo ? Up thar whar hit was thet I met ya that day  --  remember ? " Vigo nodded . " That would be good , Mamie . " " Hit 'll be quiet thar , Vigo . No one ever comes up thar after dark , Vigo . " " I know , " he said . " Ya wo n't back out on me , Vigo ? " There was anxiety in her voice now , and he could feel the rise and fall of her bosom . He could n't lie to her now , he thought . Not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known her to be this way before . This was the first time he had ever held her likep155this . Always before he had teased her and touched her lightly , never taking her in his arms and holding her close , never talking to her this way . " No , Mamie . I wo n't back out . " She put both hands to his cheeks and held them there . " Look at me , Vigo . Look at me an ' say thet . " He looked at her and smiled and nodded . " Oh , Vigo ! " she said , throwing her arms around him and placing her head against his chest . She began to sniffle a little . " Now , Mamie , " he said , trying to back away from her a little . " Vigo , " she said , presently , " if I thought ya would n't atter promlain ' me , I 'd kill m'self  --  that 's what I 'd do ! " " Aw , Mamie --  " Honest , Vigo . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judd 's no husband t ' me , Vigo . " " Mamie , do n't take it that-a way . " " Hit 's true , Vigo . " " But you ort n't " Ever since that mule accident , Vigo . Eight year ago  --  it 's been that long , Vigo . " " Mamie , stop hit ! " " It 's true , Vigo . " Suddenly Vigo recollected something that had happened just about eight years ago . Judd was trying to break in a young mule . Ile had him hitched to a plow , breaking new ground . The plow hit a stump , and the mule broke loose and dragged Judd over the stump . The reins were wrapped around Judd 's shoulders , and the mule dragged him across the field and finally broke the harness . Mamie found him about an hour later , and she thought he was dead . She ran over the ridge and got Vigo , and Vigo found him still lying in the field . He carried him into the cabin and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mule all the way into Berryvilleto get a doctor . The recollection made Vigo shudder . He looked down at Mamie , and the tears were rolling down her cheeks . He brushed them away with the tips of his fingers . " Mamie  --  Mamie , " he said , haltingly , " I did n't know this , Ma- mie . An ' all th ' time I been thinkin ' you was cagey an ' a-bitchin ' aroun ' . " Mamie nodded . " I know , Vigo . Ever'body thinks that . It 's why Lou do n't like me . Why no one likes me . But ' tai n't my fault , Vigo . ' Tai n't even his fault . " Vigo recollected something else . It was a year or so later . One day Vigo went across the ridge to see Judd and found him lying on a little grassy knoll , his head buried in his hands , and he was crying . Vigo started to back away , but Judd heard a twig break underVigo 's clumsy feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crazy man . Vigo thought he was drunk , but Judd told Vigo that Mamie was going to leave him and that was why he was crying like a baby . Vigo went home and told Lou , and Lou said Mamie was a bad woman . But Mamie did n't leave Judd . She stayed with him , and after that Judd was his old self again , but Mamie never was . She changed almost overnight from a quiet hillwife to a high-strung , nervous woman who laughed sort of crazy-like and whose eyes burned fiercely like a heifer in heat . She went from bad to worse after that . Vigo thought how many times he had laughed at her , and his throat went suddenly dry and his tongue became thick . He dropped his arms from around her and stepped back . " I got t ' go , now , Mamie , " he said , nervously . She brushed her hair back and touched her eyes with the back of her hand and looked at him , pleading in a silent way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo ? " Vigo nodded . " Then you 'll be gone , Vigo  --  an ' maybe I wo n't ever see you no more . " Vigo tried to smile , but it was n't the same any more . He was almost ashamed to look at her now . " Maybe we 'll meet in Californy , Mamie , " he said , trying to find something to say to be gone from her now . " Yes , Vigo . " " You better go home now , Mamie , " he said.  | " Yes , Vigo . " " You 'll be all right , Mamie , wo n't you ? " he asked , a little worried about her now . " I 'm all right , Vigo . You hai n't mad with me , Vigo ? " she asked , raising her eyebrows and tilting her head a little to one side , the way she always did . When she did that , she always reminded him of a kitten , somehow . " I ai n't mad , Mamie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming closer to him , " I do n't want you t ' feel sorry fer me . You wo n't feel sorry for me , will you ? " " I wo n't , Mamie . I wo n't feel sorry . " She smiled . " An ' you wo n't hurt my feelin 's none , like you did that day up in th ' graveyard ? " Vigo lowered his head . " Do n't say that , Mamie . I always regret that , Mamie . " " I wanted to die then , too , Vigo . I almost did , but Judd would n't let me die . I do n't know why I did n't die , Vigo . I should-a died , I reckon , though . Ever'body would-a been a lot better off if I did , I reckon . " " Do n't say that , " Vigo murmured , feeling a choking in his throat . Mamie ran to him quickly and threw her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoes and kissed his mouth . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grew all around , and stepped into the thick of them . She mopped , turned around quickly , and smiled at him . The next instantshe was gone . Vigo walked a little way down the slope of the hill , then halted and looked back up the hill and through the thicket , but she was out of sight . He wanted to fall down on the cool , dark earth and lie there and hide . He felt tired and ashamed and overcome . There was a weakness in his body , and the heat seemed to envelop him and he tried to breathe. , but it felt as if he were being smothered . He ran down the hill , out of the thicket , and down the bank into the gully behind the barn , then up the other side and stood in the sun . Thad 's hound was asleep in the shade of the barn , a hen was cackling inside the barn , and there was a breeze blowing up the holler , and it brought with it the smell of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the warm earth which waited for the plow was so refreshing now . Vico SAT DOWN on the pile of lumber and looked out across the holler and wondered about things . First he thought of plowing all that land and planting it with corn and sorghum cane and pole beans . He wanted to plow now , wanted to take the slick plow handles in his hands , throw the leather reins around his neck and under one arm and feel the pull of the mule against the reins and the soft , mushy turn of the soil against the plowshare , and walk in the furrow with one foot on the solid ground and another in the soft , freshly plowed earth ; wanted to see the blackbirds and the crows as they circled and landed in the newly plowed sod and pulled the earthworms from the crumbling clods . Little Lonzo always liked to follow the furrow and walk barefoot in the cool earth , just as Vigo liked to do when he was a boy . Thad and Addie Kate and Sarie Bell liked to wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to their knees and laugh and throw the soft black dirt at each other . Lou liked to stand on the side of the patch and watch him plow and smile at him as he passed by her , or carr the water jug to him and stand and wait for it while he drank the spring water so cool in the field . There was something wonderful and glorious about plowing , Vigo thought . This was the first time he had thought of it in exactlythis way , and thinking of it seemed to change everything . Somehow , for some reason he could not understand , he did n't want to leave here any more . He did n't have to leave any more . He wanted to stay here now and plow and plant and cultivate the land and hear the caw-cawing of the crows and the bul-linkkk of the blackbirds , the laughter of the young ones as they played inp159the fresh-plowed sod , and see the smile on Lou 's face as he went around and around the patch of land . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He did n't want to finish the trailer . All at once he had lost interest in it . Instead of building the trailer , he should be out there with Jack , his Missouri mule , raking the corn stubbles from the field and readying the land for the plow . There was that poke of seed corn li had brought home the other day in Judd Cossey 's wagon . It was still sitting in the corner of the kitchen . Up there in that warm kitchen , not too far away from the stove , that poke of seed corn would begin to mold , he thought . If it molded it would be unfit for planting . IT WAS THE COOL PART of the afternoon , and Thad was in the shed taking the nuts and bolts out of the engine of his car and shining them and polishing the copper tubes and rubbing the grease off the enginehead . " Ma ! " he called out to Lou , who was walking around the finished trailer , touching it here and there and admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Thad ? " " Ma , I know ever ' part o ' this machine . Took it apart ever ' day las ' summer an ' cleaned hit an ' put hit back t'gether ag'in . Betcha I could take this thing apart an ' put hit t'gether with m ' eyes blinded . " Lou smiled . " You ought to be a mechanic , Thad , " she said . Thad laughed . " Maybe I will , Ma . Maybe I will when we gits t ' Californy . " " Thad should n't take his motor apart , Ma , " said Sarie Bell . She was looking at the trailer , too , walking beside her mother around it as Addie Kate sat on the woven leather bottom of the lower bedp16o Vigo had built in . He had used old harness straps , weaving them together and nailing the ends on the framework of the beds . " He knows ever ' part by heart , Sarie , " her mother said , laughing . " But maybe he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part an ' do n't put hit t'gether rightly ? Th ' engine wo n't run , an ' we wo n't be able t ' go . " " Do you want t ' go , Sarie ? " her mother asked , looking at her suddenly . " You really want t ' go ? " Sarie Bell looked at her mother for a minute . " If you do , Ma . If you do , I do . " Lou shook her head . " This is a fine trailer , Sarie . Yore pa 's a good builder , honey . " " Do you want t ' go , really , Ma ? " asked Sarie . Lou thought for a minute . " At first I did n't . At first , it was . When I saw yore pa a-puttin ' this thing together "  --  she touched the tarpaperside of the trailer  --  " I was afeared . But hit 's a woman 's place t ' go ever ' which way her husband goes , Sarie . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Lou nodded . " I say I changed m ' mind . I was afeared , at first . But now I hai n't any more . 0 ' course " She stopped and looked around the place , first at the barn and then at the orchard and the cabin . " 0 ' course , I hate t ' leave this place  --  hit 's been m ' home fer sich a long time , Sarie . " Thad called from the shed where he was working on the car . " Ma ! " " Yes , Thad ? " " Ma , did Pa say when he 'd git back ? " " He went fer th ' gas , son , " Lou answered . " He took a five-galloncan . He 's got t ' walk t ' Berryville an ' th ' gas station . Hit 'll be atter dark , I reckon . " Little Lonzo came up and took his mother 's hand and stood beside her and looked up at her . " Ma , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 ' course , son . This 'll be our home till we gits t ' Californy . " Little Lonzo looked inquiringly at his ma . " Can I take my little old runt pig , Ma ? "  |p161Lou  laughed . " Th ' pig ? But whar 'll ya put hit , son ? " " I 'll make a pen , Ma . A little pen , an ' keep it in th ' trailer . " Lou shook her head doubtfully . " We 'll hafta ast yore pa , son . They 's room in hit fer us , but I do n't think they 'll be room fer th ' runt pig , son . " " But he 's only a runt , Ma , " Little Lonzo protested . Sarie pinched her nose and made a sour face . " He 'll smell , Lonzo . " Thad spoke up . " I 'm a-takin ' my hound dog , Ma , " he said , wiping his greasy hands with an old rag . " I ai n't a-leavin ' my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m ' raffle , too . I 'll need ' em when we pass them wild Indians on th ' trail t ' Californy , Ma . " Lou shook her head uncertainly . " We likely wo n't see much Indians , Thad , " she said , looking at him . " Wipe yore face , Thad . Ya got a smudge right by th ' side o ' yore nose . " " Can we take Daisy , Ma ? " Sarie Bell inquired . Lou laughed . " I do n't reckon so , honey . " " But folks used t ' take their cows , Ma . In m ' history book hit says how they hitched their cows t ' th ' back o ' their wagon an ' took ' cm all th ' way . Took herds o ' cattle , sometimes . Drivin " em along tli ' trail an ' swimrnin " em across th ' branches . " Lou shook her head . " Them was other days , Sarie , " she explained . " Hai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tag along behind . " Little Lonzo asked , " Then what 'll we do fer milk , Ma ? " Lou patted his head . " We 'll git by somehow , son . We 'll git by . " " Some folks is a-takin ' their goats , Ma , " Thad said , coming toward the trailer as he wiped his hands on the rag . " Shadder Bob 's a-takin ' his nanny goat . " Addie Kate laughed . " I bet th ' smell 'd be good , all right . Do n't know which 'd be worse  --  th ' ol ' nanny goat or them niggers . " Lou frowned . " Must'n talk that-a way , Addie , " she said . " Niggerscai n't hep it . " Lou was thinking about how they would live without their cow and the chickens and all the things which made it so easy here in the hills . " Maybe we 'll git a new cow in Californy , " she said thoughtfully . " An ' maybe we 'll git some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' be a place fer ' em in Californy . People 's got to live . " Little Lonzo said , " People in towns do n't have cows an ' chickens . That 's why they got them rollin ' stores t ' buy milk an ' eggs an ' gardentruck fer th ' city folks . They do n't allow no pigs in cities , neither . " Lou said thoughtfully , " Maybe we 'll git us a place , Lonzo , where you c'n keep yore little runt of a pig . An ' where Sarie 'll have her cow , an ' I c'n plant me a garden . But we 'll hafta live out'n a can fer a spell , " Lou added . Sarie laughed . " Out'n a can , Ma ? " " Yes , honey , out'n a can . " " What does that mean , Ma ? " Addie Kate asked , looking up blankly at her ma . " Ya seen them rusty tin cans down by th ' While Away ? In th ' ditch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out'n them cans . Tin cans . " " I know , " said Sarie . " They hai n't got no room fer cows an ' chickens an ' gardens , so Little Lonzo shook his head . " I wo n't like livin ' like that , Ma . I 'd ruther live hyar , Ma . Like we do . I like it hyar , Ma . I like goin ' huntin ' with Thad , Ma , like we did , did n't we , Thad ? " Thad was leaning against the trailer , rubbing hard on his hands to remove the grease . He laughed . " Ya did n't hit nothin ' with m ' raffle , Lonzo . " Little Lonzo smiled . " But I could , Thad . I could if I tried . On'y that was th ' first time I ever shot a raffle . I got t ' git used t ' hit , Thad . " Thad grinned and went on rubbing his hands with the rag . " Hai n't no use t ' worryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing back to look at the trailer . " Things 'll work theyself out , somehow . Yore pall find a way .

Ya cai n't tell less'n ya gives it a trial . Other folks live that-a way , an ' I reckon we ' uns can , if we try . "  |p163Thad  said , " Ai n't no use a-worryin ' about hit , Ma . Ya 'll like lip in ' like that . Wo n't be no trouble . All ya got t ' do is open a can . No work t ' that . No work like choppin ' weeds an ' hoein ' cawn an ' diggin " taters .

An ' they wo n't be no more grindin ' cane , an ' havin ' t ' milk a old cow ever ' night an ' mawnin ' . Hit 'll be a easy life , Ma . Easier'n tit ' way we live . " Lou nodded . She was thinking of the trailer and the airtight covering of tar paper . " Hit 'll git awful hot in that thing , son , " she said . " On'y two leetle winders an ' a thin door . " " Aw , Ma , " Thad said , laughing at his mother . " We 'll git us a electric fan  --  see ? " Lou put her arm around Little Lonzo 's shoulder protectively . " I hai n't a-goin ' t ' have no fan a-blowin ' on my baby , " she said . " Hit wo n't do him no good t ' have no fan a-blowin ' on him . I got t ' think of m ' baby , Thad . " She pressed Little Lonzo against her thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thad added , " in th ' wintertime hit 'll git awful cold in that thing ' thout no fireplace an ' no stove . " He dropped the rag on the ground beside the trailer . " But we ' uns can git us a oil stove ' at burns coal oil . Them stoves is jus ' as good as a fireplace . An ' you can cook on ' em an ' git warm by ' em . " Lou looked worried . " Do n't they blow up , Thad ? " " Aw , now Ma ! " " I do n't care , Thad , " Lou said , seriously . " I do n't know about them things . I ai n't used t ' livin ' out'n no can an ' havin ' a fan an ' a coal-oil stove . I ai n't used t ' livin ' any other way ' ceptin ' th ' way we live now . " Thad came up beside her , and they walked around the trailer together : Lou , Sarie Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , Ma , " said Thad . " Hit 'll be nice , livin ' that way for a change . " Lou looked around at her brood . " Whar 's Addie Kate ? " She glanced inside the trailer and saw Addie Kate sitting on the lower bunk . She had placed her rag doll in the bunk , across the woven leather straps , and was covering it with the greasy rag Thad had used to wipe his hands . " Pore leetle thing , " Lou said , looking at Addie Kate . " Look , young ' uns . Addie 's at home in hit already ! " Addie Kate looked up at her mother and smiled . Her yellow hair was curled up in little wet ringlets at her neck where she had been perspiring . The trailer was very hot inside , and it had the smell of raw lumber mixed with the strong odor of tar paper . " Ai n't ya about t ' die o ' th ' heat in hyar , honey ? " Lou askedAddie Kate looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it in hyar , Ma . Hit 's nice . Hit 's like a playhouse . When are we ' uns a-goin ' t ' go in it , Ma ? " Lou entered the trailer and looked again at all the things Vigo had built inside , and she showed the children all the storage space and the empty space in front of the door where she could sit in her rocker . Thad and Sarie Bell and Lonzo were standing on the empty space , and they had to get out of the trailer in order for her to explain where the rocker would be placed . Lou ducked her head and stepped up in the trailer and sniffed at the smell of new lumber and tar paper . " Hit 's nice in here , young ' uns , " she said , looking at the two built-in bunks Vigo had built , one over the other , and the drawers at the front end of the trailer . She scraped her feet along the smooth , new floor and smiled . " Wonder how m ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . Then she stepped back away from the two bunks and looked at the empty space between the bunks and the door . " I reckon I 'll put hit right over thar , " she said . There was not enough room in the trailer for Sark Bell , Little Lonzo , Thad , and their ma , and the three children backed out when Lou looked at the place where she thought of putting her rocker . " I 'll go an ' fetch hit , Ma , " Little Lonzo said . " No , Lonzo , " Thad said . " Hit 's too heavy fer ya . I 'll go an ' fetch hit fer Ma . " Lou walked to the door of the trailer and shook a finger at Thad . " Now you be keerful with that rocker , Thad . Hit 's old an ' rickety . Now do n't you go an ' drap hit , Thad ! "  |p165Thad  laughed and ran up through the orchard toward the galleryof the dogtrot house . Presently he came back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the trailer and placed the chair on the light new floor , then stood back and looked at it and smiled . " There , Ma , " he said , nodding toward the rocker . " Now set down in it , Ma , an ' try hit out . " Lou smiled and leaned over and kissed Thad , then turned around , placed her hands on the arms of the rocker , and sat down gently , afraid to rock in it . " Go on an ' rock , Ma , " Sarie said , smiling at her mother . " Go on . Hit 's all right . Th ' trailer 's good an ' strong . " Lou leaned back in the rocker and began pushing with her feet , slowly at first , and rocking back and forth so that the rocker began to squeak . She sighed and smiled and leaned her head back and closed her eyes and patted the arms of the rocker affectionately . " Hit 's th ' grandest feelin ' , honey , " she whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma , " said Thad . " Take out th ' squeaks . " Lou opened her eyes quickly , and they sparkled with a fierce brightness . " Don'cha dare take th ' squeak out'n this rocker , Thad Hoxie ! " Lou exclaimed . " That 's th ' most precious thing about hit . That squeak is like music . Better'n yore Uncle Yancey 's mouth organ an ' guitar . Do n't you dare take th ' squeak out'n this rocker , Thad . " " But , Ma " Thad protested . " Ya heerd me , son ! Now , I want ya t ' promise me . Promise me ya wo n't . Why  --  why , it 's th ' best part o ' it  --  that an ' th ' way it fits me , so snug an ' cozy . An ' if ya change anythin ' , hit wo n't be th ' same . No , ya got to promise me , Thad . " Thad laughed and leaned down and put his arms around his ma and pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her hand on Thad 's cheek and patted " All right , Ma , " said Thad . " I wo n't take th ' squeaks out  --  ' at 's a promise , Ma. "  | Lou leaned back , closed her eyes , and just rocked back and forth and listened to her chair squeak and sing . It reminded her how her mother used to sit in this very same rocker , her thin hands resting on the arms and her head leaned back and her eyes closed . Once , Lou remembered , when she was a little girl she had stood beside the rocker when it was empty , and she had placed her hands on the arm and rocked it back and forth . Suddenly her mother ran out on the gallery , put her foot on the curved bottom piece , and then swept Lou up in her arms and hugged her tightly . Lou 's mother 's face was ghostly white , and she pressed Lou close to her bosom and told her never to rock an empty rocker . Whoever sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to die , her mother told Lou . And it was n't long after that her mother lay down and died . After that Lou had always regarded an empty rocker with awe and fear if someone touched it or happened to rock it when empty . When Lou was a little girl the rocker seemed quite big , but as Lou grew older the rocker appeared to get smaller and smaller . There were marks on it Lou remembered seeing when she was a little girl . There on the curved piece at the bottom were the scratches made by the nails in the soles of her brogans as she had stood on the round piece when her mother sat there and rocked one day . The carpet bottom , once a mixture of dark brown and blue designs , was now slick and brown with dust of all the years . Once she thought of washing that carpet bottom , but Uncle Yancey told her that the rocker had come all the way from Cumberland , across Kentucky , down the Mississippi and up the Arkansas rivers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolly up from the bottom land and over hill and down holler until Greatgreat-grandpaJolly located Happy Holler . And once Vigo had offered to sandpaper and paint and varnish it and tighten the rungs and the joints where the legs were fitted to the rockers , but Lou would n't let him , because she was afraid that it would take out the singing squeaks , and they were the most wonderful things of all . Lou opened her eyes as her head rested there , and she saw Thad and Sarie Bell , Addie Kate and Little Lonzo standing in front ofp167her , looking down at her and smiling as she had rocked with her eyes closed , and Lou felt a sudden rush of warmth to her face . " If only hit war n't so hot , young ' uns , " she said , fanning her face with her hand as she sat in the chair . " This trailer 's th ' hottest place on earth . Hit hai n't like my gallery , even if th ' floor is new an ' smooth an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery . " Lou got up , dabbed her hand over her forehead and around her lips where the perspiration gathered in little dewlike drops . " Now ya can take m ' rocker back , Thad , " she said . " But , Ma , " Thad protested , " ai n't ya a-takin ' along yore rocker ? " " Certainly I 'm a-takin ' hit , Thad , " said Lou . " But I got one more night t ' rock on m ' own gallery , son . An ' I 'm a-gonna set there t'night , atter you young ' uns is in bed , an ' look out on th ' moonlit holler , an ' jus ' set an ' rock  --  rock an ' set . " Lou watched Thad as he lifted the rocker gently and carried it up through the orchard toward the house . " Ma ! " Little Lonzo said . " Ma ! " " Yes , honey ? " " Ma , there 's one more thing I 'd like t ' do afore we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonzo looked up at her as he walked along beside her through the orchard . " Remember that tombstone with th ' names of all them brave Cherokee warriors on it , an ' th ' stone with th ' great big angel on it , Ma ? " Lou nodded and smiled . The boy held her hand tightly . " Well , I 'd like t ' go up there an ' visit them once more afore we leave , Ma . " Addie Kate looked around her mother at Little Lonzo . " To th ' graveyard  --  that scary of place ? " Little Lonzo nodded . " Can we , Ma ? Can we go up there , jus ' once more afore we go ? Can we , Ma ? " Lou looked across the holler toward Piney Ridge and the graveyard , barely visible through the border of Ozark white cedars around it . The sun was beginning to lower behind the hills , and in a little more than an hour it would be dark , and soon the moon would rise behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight . In the graveyard , quiet and lonely , the air would be cool and the grass soon would be wet with dew . It was a place full of memories where Lou could walk in the peaceful stillness and think back on all happy times here in the hills . It would be a fitting thing to do , a sort of farewell to all those kinfolks resting there , beforeshe left the home here they had made for her . " Addie , you go an ' git m ' shawl , an ' me an ' Lonzo will pick a few sprigs o ' honeysuckle to take along with us , " Lou said . " But we cai n't stay long . We got t ' turn in early t'night , for it 's th ' las ' night here at home . T'morry we 'll be gone . " " All right , Ma , " said Addie Kate , breaking away from her mother and running up through the orchard toward the cabin . Lou and Little Lonzo walked up through the orchard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped its fruit in season and let it roll down the mossy bank , and they gathered big armfuls of honeysuckle to take to the cemetery . Addic Kate met them on the path leading down the hill from the cabin toward the road , and Lou took the knitted shawl from her daughter and threw it loosely around her shoulders . Little Lonzo divided his armful of honeysuckle with his sister , and they ran on ahead of their mother , down the winding path to the road at the bottom of the hill , where they waited for Lou to catch up with them . As she walked slowly down the hill , carrying the big bunch of honeysuckle , heavy with their sweetness , Lou let her gaze wander all over the holler and back up the ridges on each side of it . Once , halfway down the hill , she stopped and looked at the cabin sitting back snug against the wooded hill behind it , and she felt a swelling in her throat , a warmth rush to her head , and for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flowers she held close to her bosom and sink to the earth and cry until all the sadnesswent out of her heart . But as she stood there , looking at the cabin with its dark shake roof and the whiteness of the chinks between the peeled logs , she realized that this was almost the last time she would see it like this , and she wanted to take a long and lasting look so that the cabin , the log barn and the orchard in between , the curve of the hill and the dark green of the woods on the rise behind the cabin would stay forever in her memory , just as it was . She was still standing there , looking at the cabin and the orchardp169and the log barn , marking the impression deep in her mind , when Little Lonzo and Addie Kate called to her from down at the end of the path beside the road . Lou turned suddenly and ran down the path , grasping the honeysuckleclose to her bosom and letting her shawl and her hair fly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sprigs of honeysuckle on all the graves of the Jollys , and Lou stuck several broken stems into the soft earth of the mounds and patted the earth around them . " Maybe they 'll grow , " she said as she knelt beside the long , low mound and sank the broken end of a long shaft of honeysuckle into the soft earth . " An ' if they do , th ' graves will always be fresh with flowers atter we ' uns is gone . " " I hope they do , I only hope they do , " said Little Lonzo as he looked at the big white angel and the tombstone of the twenty-six brave Cherokee warriors who had died Christians and were buried in the white man 's burial ground . The red rim of the sun was just dropping behind the western ridge of Happy Holler when Lou and her children walked slowly through the damp grass and down the cool , dark scented lane bencaththe shortleaf pines , then climbed gradually up the winding road toward the path that led home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mamie , " said Judd as he took the harness off the two pegs rivved into the wall of their leantokitchen . Judd had learned a long time ago not to question too much Mamie 's manners and motives . Today , however , he was disappointed when she said she would n't go with him down to Berryville . " First time I ever knowed when ya did n't want t ' go , " he said as he walked down the little hill with the harness slung over his shoulders . Mamie stood in the doorway and leaned against the side of it and watched Judd as he walked down the hill , entered the barn . Presently he came out leading the mules and hitched them to the wagon , then climbed in , slapped the reins over their backs , put his feet up on the dashboard , and leaned his elbows on his knees , hunched over slightly . He turned past the cabin and urged the mules patiently on as they climbed the steep side of Piney Ridge . Mamie watched until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet on the dashboard , were a silhouette against the midafternoon blue of the sky . Judd turned around and waved to her just as the wagon started downhill on the other side of the ridge and out of sight . A little cloud of dust billowed on the hot dry top of the hill , and the rattle of the traces and the wagon wheels faded away over the ridge . She went back into the cabin and lay down on the cool bed and looked up at the rough rafters where the wasps had built their tiny round mud-daub nests . She thought of the long , slow ride into town and wondered what would be running through Judd 's mind as he sat in the spring seat , gazing absently at the rumps of his mules . Then she thought of Vigo and turned over on her stomach and buried her head in her arms . When she awoke , Mamie walked in her bare feet out to the well and drew up a bucket of water , poured three bucketfuls into a copper kettle and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the water was heating , she laid out her thin white dress and a fresh petticoat across the bed . Poking the fire in the hearth , she stood with her back to it as she looked at the dress , spread out neatly on the bed , and listened to the sizzling of the water in the kettle . " I hope he likes me in it , " she said , leaning back against the fireboard . " I only hope he likes me . " Presently the steam began to rise from the water on the stove and she lifted off the kettle and carried it into the front room and set it on the puncheon floor before the fire . Pulling off her dress , shep171stepped into the warm water and clasped her arms over her breasts until the warmth of it drove the chill from her body . She knelt in the kettle and cupped her hands and lifted the waterto her shoulders and let it trickle down her breasts , over her stomach and back down into the water again . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , and rubbed her body firmly with a yard of bleached muslin , then turned to the mirror on the mantel , combed her hair and tied it in a small knot in the back . " I hope he 's good t ' me , " she said , wetting the tips of her fingers in her mouth and running them along over her eyebrows as she looked into the mirror . " I only hope he 's sweet an ' kind , an ' I can make him glad . " As Mamie stood before the mirror she remembered what Vigo had whispered to her once , a long time ago , as they danced together in the hall down at While Away , the time the hillfolk and the touristers got together for a hoedown . Vigo and Mamie were waltzing the hall when Vigo , hot and breathless from the dance , leaned over and whispered to her . " Mamie , you 're th ' purtiest gal . Purtier than any o ' them tourister women . Yore eyes are browner an ' your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint like them furriner women a-standin ' over thar on th ' side lines . You 're th ' purtiest gal in this hall . " It was a long time ago , but Mamie never forgot it because it was the first real kind word Vigo had ever spoken to her . She dressed and then carried the kettle of bath water to the back door , set it on the doorsill and tipped it over , and let the water run down the stoop and onto the ground until there was nothing left but soap bubbles which broke and blew away in the wind . Then she hung the kettle on the peg rivved into the wall outside the back door , walked back through the house , across the gallery , and stepped down on the path that followed the wagon road over the top of Piney Ridge . At the top of the ridge she paused , looked down in the holler , and saw the empty , winding road and the long , dark shadow on this side of the western ridge behind which the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and little wisps of hair broke loose from the knot in the back of her head as she stood there , high on the top of Piney Ridge , gazing out over the holler . Back to the right and a little way down the hill and over on the next hill against the head of the holler stood Lou and Vigo 's cabin . The cabin was hidden behind the clump of shortleaf pines , but there was a thin blue strand of smoke rising from it like a cobweb against the dark green of the hill . To the left , along the top of Piney Ridge where it curved a little to the south , was Piney Ridge cemetery , and leading to it along the top of the ridge was a narrow hog track through the oaks and pines . She turned off the wagon road , waded through the tall grass , and entered the dim shadows of the woods until she found the trail . She ran along the path until she was tired , then walked slowly until she was deep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below the pines lay the cemetery , so she walked down the slope of the hill until she was almost out of the pines , then leaned back against a thick , rough trunk and watched the sun as it sank lower and lower until the red rim was barely showing over the top of the western ridge and reflecting gold upon the tombstones . Just then Mamie heard the echo of voices far down in the holler , and she stepped back into the shadows and looked carefully toward the sound . She saw a boy and a girl running down the cemetery hill through the green grassy meadow toward the road . They were holding hands as they sailed down the green slope , laughing and screaming as they ran . " Them 's Vigo 's young ' uns , " Mamie said to herself . " Addie Kate an ' Lonzo . " She watched the cemetery lane and presently saw the tall , slender figure of Lou walking slowly down the lane toward the road . Around her shoulders was a dark shawl , and she wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she walked , shoulders bent forward , head down . Mamie watched Lou as she meandered on down the shady side of the lane , turned off to the right , and began climbing the steep road . " An ' Vigo 's wife , " Mamie said aloud . Lou walked slowly up the steep road , taking long steps and occasionallyplacing her hands on her thighs as she walked . Now and then she stopped , turned around , and gazed back down the hollerp173and over toward the rise of the cemetery , where it leveled off a little against Piney Ridge . Mamie stepped back deeper into the pines and stood behind a tree . " She do n't know " she murmured , half afraid . " She couldn'tknow --  " But Lou looked back toward the cemetery once again , and this time Mamie thought she was looking directly at her as she stood there deep in the stand of pines . Mamie almost wished she had gone back still deeper , where Lou 's sharp eyes could n't penetrate , but she knew now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if Lou should come back ? Mamie wondered . What if Lou had seen her , hiding there among the pines and cedars , and intended to circle back over the ridge and watch and see what Mamie was doing up there all alone just as the sun sank below the hills . Mamie laughed . Lou would n't do that . She might tell Vigo that Mamie was a bad woman , and she might go for many years withoutso much as speaking to her , but Lou would n't spy on her . She had no right to do that . Mamie had a perfect right to go to the cemetery in the cool of the evening shade , even if none of Mamie 's folks was buried there ; even if she was still only a stranger in this holler after living so long here as Judd 's wife . At last Mamie saw Lou turn around , gather the shawl more closely around her shoulders , and walk up the hill and out of sight on the winding path that led to her dogtrot house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled over the holler and the thin mist of evening began to rise from the warm bottom land between the sheltering hills of the holler , Mamie saw a dim light in Lou 's cabin  --  a lamp in the window which would light Vigo 's way home tonight . Mamie came out of the pines and walked slowly down the steep hill into the glen behind the cemetery , then up through the glade to the rise at the end of the long lane of shortleaf pines . Stopping there in the darkness , she waited for a little while and rubbed the flesh along her upper arms , now prickly with nervous proud flesh . Soon she would be warm , she thought , and she would forget the chill of darkness which now blanketed the holler . And in a little while the moon would come out and the warm air would rise from the holler . She began walking down the lane of whispering pines where Lou had walked a little while ago , and she saw the dark , scuffed patches in the needles where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway down the lane and looked around her at the dark little mounds and silent , glistening stones which stood among the night shadows . Between each mound was a low depression , soft with the new shoots of spring grass . It would be there , between two of those mounds , lying against the warm earth and with the scent of the freshness of the ground and the clear cool smell of the cedars and pines , she decided . She would close her eyes and lie back against the soft earth and look up at the dark sky and the glittering stars . There would be deep shadows under his eyebrows as the moon lit his forehead , and a thin smile would be on his lips as he said again , " You 're th ' purtiest girl . . . th ' purtiest girl in this hall . . . " and she would lie rapturous and still and it would be a night to always remember . . . . Mamie resumed her walking on the soft padded cover of needles which spread over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wings folded close to its body and the long , crooked shaft in its hand , and its smiling face and stony features , lit by the shadows of twilight , were almost real , and this was heaven , she thought . She looked beyond the angel and saw the plump , round form of the cherub carved in stone at one grave , and the sight of that fat baby with its arms outstretched to her almost made her believe that it , too , was real ; that it was running toward her , calling her name , clasping her legs and holding them tightly until she reached down and lifted it to her bosom and hugged it tenderly . . . . No , she decided , it would be here , beneath that fat and happy baby , smiling at her , arms outstretched and waiting to come to her . This was where she would lie . . . . The presence of that cheerful cherub would have miraculous and wondrous powers . . . . Suddenly , without reason , she broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks tingled her flesh and brushed away the tears . All at once she was at the end of the lane , standing be/ncath the spreading boughs which formed a dark shelter down by the road where she would wait and listen for his footsteps coming up the lush holler . She leaned back against the tree until her head touched the rough bark , and she closed her eyes and listened to the gentle whisper of a light breeze blowing through the tops of the pines . Somewhere across the holler a meadowlark sang and night-flying swallows darted swiftly across the purple sky . Suddenly all the birds in the holler burst into a spontaneous chorus , and Mamie recognized a mockingbird singing from some high perch in a treetop , a whippoorwilland its lonely call , and a brown thrasher darting and singingsomewhere among the brier patches which grew farther down the holler . She even heard the chirping of a squirrel as it bounced across the limbs somewhere behind her , and far away there was the lonely , low mourning of a turtle dove . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft trickle of water , and all the holler echoed with sounds of life and gladness at the expectancy of life in this lovely , unspoiled place . Mamie opened her eyes . Far down the road she heard the steady thump of footsteps , and she pressed herself hard back against the tree and held her breath as she listened . Yes , he was coming . Through the long , spreading limb of the tree she saw the dark outline of his head and shoulders bent forward slightly as he trudged slowly up the road . As he climbed nearer and nearer up the gradual winding slope , she saw more of his body ; first his long waist , his swinging right arm , and the straight left arm which carried a shiny square can , his long legs , and the faded and threadbare light blue denim at his knees . Just then , from over the hill behind her , the moon rose slowly and lighted everything in the holler , and at once he came in full view of her as she leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was walking with his head turned toward the cemetery , looking up there toward the moonlit whiteness of the dew on the grassy slopes , and there was a thin smile on his lips and deep shadows around his eyes . Mamie leaned closer against the tree and closed her eyes and waited.  |p176THEY  HAD LEFT Little Lonzo sitting on the gallery as they carried stuff down through the orchard and loaded it into the trailer . " You jus ' set an ' wait , Lonzo , " his ma had told him . " Do n't want ya t ' git all het up , ' cause ya cai n't disremember what that nurse said down in th ' Booneville sanitarium ! " So Little Lonzo had sat on the gallery almost all morning as Addie Kate , Sarie Bell , and Thad helped his ma and pa carry the things down and load them into the trailer . He had watched the sun come high in the sky until it was noon and his ma brought out a plate of cold corn bread and hominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little runt pig had climbed up on the gallery , and Little Lonzo broke tiny pieces of corn bread and gave it to him . Finally the runt curled up in one of the holes where the hens had been scratchingand went to sleep in the sun . Now Little Lonzo was sitting on the end of the puncheons , lettinghis feet dangle over the edge of the gallery as he looked out over the holler and across to the cemetery , when a thought came to him . Quickly he glanced down through the orchard where his ma and pa and Thad and the girls were carefully loading the trailer . " They 'll be a long time , " he said . " Hit 'll be time enough . " Then he slid off the gallery , ran down the path to the road and down the road to the cemetery lane . As he ran he thought what he would do . He would climb slowly up the lane beneath the cool shade of the shortleaf pines , walking slowly , just as though it were any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit in the graveyard as he did every Sunday . He would look at the headstones , feel the slick surfaces of them , run his fingersin the dark , mossy recesses of the carved letters and read the inscriptions written there.  |p177There  would be Abraham Clemens , Shadder Barry , and AugustusErasmus Canary . Then Chief Soaring Cloud of the Quapaw Tribe of American Indians , who died a Christian , too . And CaptainWilliam Henry Cain of the Confederate Army , killed in the Battle of Pea Ridge , March 8 , 1862 , and the Twenty-six Brave Cherokee Warriors of the Army of General Albert Pike , also killed at Pea Ridge , same month , same day , same year . Presently he would find the right spot and lie there between the mounds , his head propped up with his chin in his hand , kicking the toes of his bare feet into the soft earth as he looked up at the angel with the great feathered wings . And when he got tired of looking at the angel , he would drop his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep much last night . He had lain there thinking , long after Thad began breathing evenly and finally started laughing fitfully in his sleep . Little Lonzo heard his ma packing dishes , and after a little while he heard her sit in her rocker on the gallery , heard the rocker 's sweet and squeaking music as she rocked hack and forth while she waited for his pa . At last Little Lonzo had heard his pa step up on the gallery and heard him say , " I 'm tar 'd , Lou  --  awful tar 'd . I carried that gas all th ' way from Berryville , an ' my pore back is Ellin ' me , an ' I jus ' want t ' go t ' bed an ' git some sleep  --  an ' nothin ' else . " Little Lonzo heard his Ma say , " But hit 's Saturday night , Vigo , darlin ' . " Her voice was very soft and low . But Vigo had answered with a whine , " My back , Lou  --  hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pa were asleep , Little Lonzo began thinking of the things Thad had told him as they lay there in the deep softness of their straw tick and feather bed . Thad told of the way he would drive his car on the smooth , level highways , and the sights they would see . Somewhere over the wide prairies they would see a wild Indian , and Thad would stop his car and untie his hound , and Thad and ? , little Lonzo would go stalking on tiptoe across the sedge grass and catch the rest of the Indians , whooping and crying savagely and with murderous fire in their eyes , as they rode their wild mustangs out of the buttes and down into the prairies to surround their cara/van . Thad had been down to Berryville to the picture show , and he had seen the wild Indians and how they attacked innocent pioneerslike his ma and pa on their way to California ; and it would be just like that when they crossed the prairie . So that was the night Little Lonzo had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft wind blowing under the puncheonsand between the chinking of the logs and flapping the tar paper hanging down over the window . There were so many thoughts to think : there was the sanitarium down in Booneville , Logan County , where the long , low whistle of the Rock Island locomotive , heading west to Oklahoma , sounded like the howling of a crazy loon , and where from his window in the five-story brick buildinghe could look far out over the farms and fields and see the roundtoppedOuachitas and the rising , thickly wooded slope of Mount Magazine and the Ouachita National forest ; and there was old Miz ' Carithers , sitting up at her desk , scratching away with her pen on the paper in the big dusty room where all the seats were empty excepthis , and him sitting quietly with his hands folded on the top of the desk as he gazed out the window toward Piney Ridge while he waited for the teacher to stop writing the note that promoted him to the fifth grade ; and there was Thad , shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thad 's homemade bullet hit him ; and there was Little Lonzo himself , holding the long rifle and squinting down the barrel to the silver tit on the end as he watched the squirrel sitting on the limb , rolling her eyes and chatting away to her mate who hopped on the thin , high branches and switched his tail and babbled with her . Oh , this was the life for Little Lonzo , all right . These were the things he wanted to do . He was happy here , happier than he ever was down there in the sanitarium in Booneville , where the nurses passed his bed and smiled and bent down and kissed him when they thought he was asleep . He wanted to roam the hills and seek the herbs which Thad gathered and dried and bundled and shipped to that herb company down in Little Rock . Someday he wanted to show Thad that he could really shoot that long rifle which Thad had heired from all the Jolly boys since Great-great-grandpa Jolly 's boy Robin , who could knock the eye out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this very same old rifle , Fussbudget . In Robin Jolly 's time a boy had to learn to shoot straight and true , or he was not likely to fare as well at the table . They did not shoot just for the sport of it , because they knew that everything which ran and romped and played in the wilds loved this life in the Ozarks , just as much as human beings loved it . So , Little Lonzo thought , he would show Thad that he could shoot , not just for the sport of killing , but to provide fresh meat and game for the table when they wanted a change from salt pork and smoked ham and pickled pigs ' feet . Someday , he thought , as he walked up the cemetery lane , he would memorize all the names on those headstones , and from his mother he would hear the story each had to tell . His ma knew every headstone in that graveyard , had known their stories ever since she was a little girl . Once , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery of the old home place when suddenly up the holler came the sweet , shrill notes of a fife playing " Dixie . " Deep as thunder came the roll of the drums , and up the winding road came a long procession led by a fifer and drummers and a color guard of soldiers dressed in their Confederate uniforms , their medals dangling on their chests and their buttons polished 1 ) rightly . Behind the long procession of marching soldiers , some now hardly able to walk , so old and gray were they , came six jet-black horses whose coats glistened in the sun , and they were drawing a long black wagon , trimmed with bright brass fittings , and on the wagon was a long , flag-draped casket . The procession , as Lou saw it and remembered it to tell Little Lonzo , turned , and up this very same lane of pines they marched , not even losing a step in the steep ascent . At last the marching music was stopped and there was nothing but the slow , mournful beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the grave wide and deep . Lou told Little Lonzo how the six black horses stomped and pawed the earth and switched their tails as some of the Civil War soldiers came up to the wagon , lifted off the flag-shrouded coffin and carried it carefully and slowly between them to the great hole in the earth , then lowered it gently as anothersoldier held onto the flag . Then all the soldiers stood at attention and an officer , wearing the uniform of a colonel and distinguished by his long white beard , raised his sword arm and with a snap of it held it poised and ready while a squad of those old soldiers raised their rifles to their shoulders , pointed them to the skies , and when the colonel 's saber flashed in the sun , they fired a ringing volley into the air . After that , the earth thundered on the top of the long pine box , and the low sad notes of a bugle , sounding very faint and far away , echoed over Happy Holler . Presently the hole was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the earth that was left over was hauled away , and soon the old men in their uniforms and dangling medals and polished bright buttons formed in ranks , and the fifer , his head cocked on one side and his elbows held up high as he fluted his instrument , again began playing " Dixie . " The drummer and all the rest stepped high and marched back down the hill , leading the other soldiers and the color-bearers , the riflemen , and the six jet-black horses pulling the empty , long black wagon down the hill and out of sight . This , his ma told him , was one of her best childhood memories , and she told it to him faithfully because long before Little Lonzo was born the last soldier had been carried to his grave and Little Lonzo would never live to see that happen in his time . Lou had led Little Lonzo to the grave , marked by a granite headstone on which were carved crossed draped flags , crossed rifles and sabers , a drum , an eagle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : COLONEL JOHN JOSEPH SHOTWELLConfederate ArmyDistinguished at the Battle of Pea Ridge8th day of March , 1862 . Born 1847 , died April 3 , 1919 . Little Lonzo left the lane and ran to the headstone and leaned his arm on the top of it and read the inscription again . The carved letters in the stone had become dark and weathered , and in thep181sharp corners of the carved letters there grew tiny green sprigs of moss , collected there during many winters cold and damp and summershot and dry . As Little Lonzo stood against the headstone , tracing his fingers in the soft , slimy moss that grew in the carved letters , he tried not to remember that he had run away from the gallery where his ma had told him to wait . They were probably still loading that tar-paper-covered trailer , tie thought . Why had he come here ? he wondered . Maybe it was to find someone who would talk to him and answer all those questions which were jumbled together in his mind , to hear the conversation carved in stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the images of those wild and woolly Cherokee warriors who had died in the Battle of Pea Ridge ; the image of Augustus Erasmus Canary , who Little Lonzo imagined must have been a very lighthearted fellow who always whistled and sang if he was anything like his name ; and there was Shadder Barry , who must have been an ancestor of Shadder Bob who lived down by the swamp with his seven big black sons , all shiny and shiftless and lazy as any Negro in Arkansas . This Shadder Barry buried here was a slave who had run away from a plantation in Louisiana and had found refuge in the wilderness of the Ozarks , his ma had once told him . There were very few Negroes in the Ozarks in those days , his ma had said . Little Lonzo turned from the tombstone of Colonel John Joseph Sliotwell and walked past the little baby with outstretched arms and sunny face and dimpled cheeks , and there between the two mounds he saw that the grass was trampled down and flat against the ground , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream and see the same images he saw here , and to listen to the i niversations in stone . Little Lonzo stood and looked at the trampled , mashed-down grass , and he knelt down in the same spot , fell forward on his stomach , and lay there with his chin in his hands and looked up at the fat and laughing baby . How soft and warm the earth was beneath him , yet how cool it felt as he lay there in the sun , looking up at the fat round arms and chubby legs of the cherub ! " I could stay right hyar by m'self , " he said aloud . " Or I could go into th ' woods an ' wait till they was all gone , an ' when they was gone , I 'd come out of my secret hidin ' place an ' go back home an ' live thar all by m'self  --  just me an ' old Uncle Yancey . Let Ma an ' Pa an ' Thad an ' th ' girls go to that ol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit ! But I could stay right hyar ! " But that would not be right , he thought . Why , at this very minutehis ma was probably looking all over the holler for him , calling his name , ready for him to pile into Thad 's car with the rest of them and get started down the winding road that leads to Highway 62 , then west through the Ozarks and down on the prairies of Oklahomaand across the mountains into California . He raised his head from his hands and let his arms fall down , then rested his head on them like a pillow and closed his eyes , and then a sudden sadness came over him . . . . " We 're a-leavin ' these ol ' hawg-wallers , Lonzo , " he thought he heard Thad say . " Yes , an ' they got orange trees out thar , too . " " Me an ' m ' young ' uns is a-goin ' with you this time , Vigo . " " Lou , I 'm tar 'd  --  m ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want t ' go t ' Californy , Ma ? " " Yes , Sarie . Hit 's a woman 's place t ' go ever ' which way her husbandgoes . " " Lonzo , you wait right hyar , honey , on th ' gallery . Ya cai n't disrememberwhat thet nurse said . " " Thad , show me whar y ' git yore yarbs , please , will ya ? " Voices . His ma talking . His pa whining . Thad boasting and bragging about the game he had killed . Sarie Bell and Addie Kate giggling in their room in the dark . The wind howling and the tar-paper flap slapping the window sill . Questions . Answers . Conversations . Talk excited . Laughter . . . . Then all of a sudden he heard no more voices , but saw only hisma , sitting in her rocker in the dim and flickering firelight of the 83hearth , her hands folded in her lap and gazing so long and patiently into the glowing coals . He saw her lowering head , saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem of her gown , heard her blow her nose softly as she sat there in that silent loneliness when she thought he was asleep in his straw tick by the fire . After that a new image came to him . This time his ma was smiling sweetly as she walked arm in arm down through the orchard with Vigo toward the new trailer he had just finished . She touched it gently and patted it and smiled up at Vigo and said , " Is hit done , igo , darlin ' ? " And his pa nodded and took her by the arm and led cr inside the trailer and showed her the two wall bunks and the iipboards and drawers and shelves he had built , so neat and comet . Then he heard his ma laugh with glee and say , " I 'm ready , igo . Ready t ' go now . Guess we 'll give up this hyar place now an ' on t ' Californy . " He saw his pa take his ma in his arms and stroke er hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . ' You 'll be glad you left this place , Lou . . . . " His ma then pulled crself away from his pa and said , " But I do n't want t ' sell th ' of ome place , Vigo . Hit hai n't worth much , exceptin ' a sentimental lue to me , so we 'll hang ont ' hit , darlin ' , if you do n't mind . " Little Lonzo buried his head deeper in his arms until the brightness f the sun no longer penetrated his closed eyelids , and he lay there reathing the rich warmth of the earth and the smell of the broken , ampled sprigs of grass beneath him . Finally he began to cry , and t last he fell asleep . I le awakened with a start . Someone was calling him . It was daylight , and he raised his head and looked about him and w all the tombstones and the little ripples of heat which rose from c ground . " Lonzo ! Lonzo ! Where you at , Lonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was calling , and there was anger in his ice . Little Lonzo rubbed his eyes and started to rise from the ground , t just then he saw his pa , and he was walking up the lane beneath c shortleaf pines , looking this way and that and calling his name . his right hand he carried a long , slender limb of a peach tree which he switched against the leg of his overalls every time he took a step . Little Lonzo sprang to his feet , and just as he did so his pa saw him . " Hyar I am , Pa , " Little Lonzo said , trying to walk , but somehow his feet felt as if they were stuck to the ground . His pa 's tongue curled up between his front teeth , and he put his right arm behind his back , hiding the peach-tree switch as he advancedacross the cemetery between the rows of tombstones toward Little Lonzo . " Lonzo ! What ya doin ' up hyar ? " Little Lonzo tried to talk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer me ! What ya a-doin ' , layin ' down b'tween them mounds ? Answer me ! What ya doin ' in that place ? " His pa 's eyes were tiny and sharp , and his mouth was open and his teeth were bared angrily . " I was jus ' layin ' down , Pa . " His pa came closer , then stopped and still held his right arm behind his back , trying to hide the peach-tree switch . " Jus ' layin ' down , huh ? How 'd you happen t ' pick that pertic'lar place t ' lay down ? " his pa asked suspiciously . Little Lonzo looked up at him wonderingly . He did n't know what his pa was trying to say . " Answer me ! How 'd ya come t ' lay down  --  there ? " The boy shook his head . " You 're desecratin ' a sacred place , son , " his pa said softly as he looked first at the cherub , then at the little valley between the graves . where Little Lonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suddenly Vigo reached out , caught Little Lonzo by the wrist and jerked him forward , and Little Lonzo heard the peach-tree switch swishing through the air , and he felt the sharp sting of it across his back and on the calves of his legs . " I 'm a-whuppin ' ya fer runnin ' away , " his pa exclaimed . Little Lonzo wanted to cry out , but he could n't because all the crying and tears he had were used up a long time ago , and he just danced around while his pa gripped his wrist in one hand and flayed him with the peach-tree switch in the other , all the way back to thep185lane of shortleaf pines that led down to the road . Beneath the lane of pines the switch broke , and his pa threw away the short end and freed him . Little Lonzo wanted to run down the lane and up the road and the winding path to home , but instead he walked along behind his pa , who growled under his breath and bit his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonzo . Soon Little Lonzo stopped and turned around and looked back at he cherub with the outstretched arms , the angel with the long crook , the eagle with its outspread wings , and the pointing dog , and a realization came to him like the sharp blow of the peach-tree switch . Up to now the captain on the great white horse , the angel , the cherub , the dog  --  and even the plain stone marker that stood over the grave of the twenty-six brave Cherokee warriors  --  had been real , live images which told to him their stories often as he lay there gazing at them . Now they were no longer real and alive and friendly . They were nothing but cold , hard stone which had stood still and rigid and unmoved , even as his father had switched him and dragged him away . Even the twenty-six brave Cherokee warriors , who had whooped and hollered down the road with him on the way to Happy l f caller school one day , were nothing but an inscription on a big hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone after his pa with their tomahawks and bows and arrows to defend him the way Little Lonzo had a right to expect they would . His pa , walking down the lane ahead of him , stopped and turned around . " Come on , Lonzo ! " he shouted . " We should-a lit a shuck from hyar a long time ago ! " The angel said nothing , and the captain on the white horse said nothing , and the eagle spread its wings , and the dog stood straight and stiff , with its nose pointing toward the western ridge of the holler . And for the first time in his life Little Lonzo realized that all the images carved in stone were facing toward the western ridge , where the sun went down every evening , and in that direction was Cali- ( ( it nia.  |p186They  had known all the time , and they had n't even told him , he , who had put lilies of the valley on their graves  --  Little Lonzo , who was their friend . UNCLE YANCEY WAS SITTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroking his chin and squirting ambeer into the dust and enjoying the warmth of the Sunday sun and the sweetness of the breeze up the holler when Vigo 's car and trailer rolled down the winding road and came to a stop as the dust gathered beneath the car and blew on ahead with the wind . He rose from his rocker and stepped down off the gallery and walked toward the automobile . Lou and Vigo were in the front seat together in the old sedan , and Lou was wearing her sunbonnet and looking straight ahead . Thad sat in the far corner of the back seat , and his long frontier rifle was leaning against his shoulder , and at his feet lay his hound . Between Sarie Bell and Thad sat Little Lonzo , squeezed down low , and his cheeks were streaked with the marks of tears , and his mouth was small , and his face was long and solemn . In front of Little Lonzo , leaning with her arms on the back of the front seat , stood Addie Kate , smiling and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms on the top of the steering wheel and leaned over and looked past Lou as Uncle Yancey stepped up to the side of the car nearest Lou . " Well , Uncle Yancey , " Vigo said , sighing as he spoke , " I reckon we 're a-fixin ' t ' light a shuck outa hyar . " Uncle Yancey nodded , glanced back at the tar-paper-covered trailer with its door ajar and tied with bailing wire , and spat a shot of ambeer into the dust . " What you think o ' thet contraption , Yancey ? " Vigo asked . Uncle Yancey nodded and stroked the white beard on his chin . " Looks right dandy , " he said . " Looks jim-dandy an ' solid . "  |p187Uncle  Yancey dismissed the trailer from his thoughts as he looked first at Thad , smiling and stroking the barrel of his rifle . Sarie Bell smiled stiffly , then her face was straight again . Little Lonzo looked up at Uncle Yancey , and his pale blue eyes were streaked with red and his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to hold back something inside , Addie Kate grinned , shy and bashful , and looked down at her fat little hands , lying one on top of the other on the cushioned back of the seat behind her ma . Lou sat rigid and erect , her hands folded quietly in the lap of her long , full , and faded dark flour-sack dress , and her eyes were hidden by the hood of her gingham sunbonnet . To Uncle Yancey came the recollection of the looks on the faces of those people the " sooners , " who had stopped briefly in Arkansas on their way to Oklahoma Territory and whom he as a boy had seen when they urged on their six-yoke teams of young steers , yelling to them as they lashed their sides with long hickory switches , " G'long , thar ! Git up ! Giddy , you ! " Uncle Yancey recollected how those wooden wheels rolled and rattled over the roads of logs laid crosswisein the deep ruts to prevent breakage of the wheels and axles of the heavily loaded wagons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anxiety and expectation on the faces of those pioneers then , and it was the selfsame look Uncle Yancey saw now on the faces of Thad , Little Lonzo , Sarie Bell , Addie Kate , and Vigo . Lou 's face , partly hidden , was calm and without expression as she held her lips firmly together , her eyes straight ahead , too proud , too defiant and brave to let looks reveal what was in her heart . " Lou , " Uncle Yancey began . Lou hesitated a moment before she finally turned her head and looked at him . There were tearstains on her cheeks , too . " Yes , Uncle Yancey ? " she murmured . " Lou , I want t ' bid ya good-by , " Uncle Yancey said , putting his hand through the open window of the sedan . Lou took Uncle Yancey 's bony and wrinkled hand and held it lightly , then dropped her hands back into her lap . Still looking straight ahead , she said : " Be shore an ' look atter th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore will , Lou , " said Uncle Yancey . " An ' our cow , Daisy . " Uncle Yancey nodded . " Give her milk t ' th ' hawgs , Uncle Yancey , " Lou said . " I will . " " An ' throw some sorry nubbins o ' cawn t ' th ' hens . They 's enough in th ' crib t ' last all summer . Attcr that , ya c'n sell th ' chickens down t ' th ' tourister lodge , Uncle Yancey . " " I 'll do thet , Lou , " he replied , lowering his gaze and shooting ambccr into the dust at his feet . " An ' when th ' dry spell comes in July an ' August , will ya water th ' plants an ' Gran'ma Jolly 's honeysuckle down by th ' bank o ' th ' crick ? " Uncle Yancey nodded silently . Vigo cleared his throat . " Might as well move right on up t ' th ' old home place t'day , Yancey , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo , " Uncle Yancey snapped angrily at Vigo . " I reckon I can red up th ' house an ' take care o ' things . " " All right , " Vigo said , meekly . He recognized the fire in Uncle Yancey 's eyes , and he wanted no fraction with the old man now . Lou 's hands came up quickly , and she bowed her head and shielded her eyes with them . Uncle Yancey reached inside the car and touched her shoulder . " I h-hope I  --  I hai n't  --  I hai n't disremembered nothin ' , " Lou stammered , sitting erect once more . Uncle Yancey nodded . " Do n't fret , Lou . I 'll go right on up an ' look atter things . I can keep care o ' ever'thin ' all right . " Vigo said , " Sure he can , Lou  --  he knows better'n we can tell him . " " That 's right , Lou , " Uncle Yancey said , with a mean eye on Vigo . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vigo nervously fingered the ignition switch . " Well , Yancey he began . Lou suddenly turned her head and leaned over and put her arms around Uncle Yancey and drew his head toward her and kissed his forehead . " Aw , Lou ! " Uncle Yancey said , pushing away from her . " You'llp189see me ag'in . Why , I 'll live t ' be a hundred . Like as not , one o ' these days I 'll pack up an ' come on out t ' Californy m'self , t ' set with you . " Uncle Yancey stepped back and looked at Lou , and he thought how good and fine and proud she was , even though she was a hillwomanand , according to the best standards of the world outside these Ozark hills an ' hollers , a poor and backward creature who would be lost and out of place among those fine-haired people . Whatever happened to Lou in the future could be blamed on Vigo , Uncle Yancey thought . He was taking her out of these hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her will , her wish , and her want . Her place was here , in the hills with the people and customs she knew , not out there beyond the hills . Whatever becameof her and those frightened , anxious young ones sitting there in the back seat , wondering whether there would be wild Indians lurkingbehind every tree and bush and rock on the road to California  --  whatever became of them , good or bad , Uncle Yancey could blame Vigo for it . As he thought of this , Uncle Yancey looked sharply at Vigo , who was still fingering the ignition switch , and the old man 's eyes narrowedand his jaws set and he gazed at Vigo for a moment . " Take good care o ' Lou an ' them young'uns , Vigo , " Uncle Yanceysnapped , almost with a threat . Vigo lowered his head and nodded . " I shore will . " Uncle Yancey reached in and patted Lou 's arm . " An ' take good care o ' yourself , Lou . " She nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native flower or bush or tree that grew only in the Ozarks , Uncle Yancey thought . It had often been tried , but there were some things that would n't grow anywhere else in the world the way they grew here in the Ozarks . Take , for instance , the tall and stately shortleaf pine . There was something peculiar to the soil , something it found here in the land , the climate , and the rays of the sunlight , that made the shortleaf pine grow hardy and free here and die almost at once if transplanted anywhere else . The Ozark white cedar , some said , was the same kind of tree known elsewhere as a Mexican juniper ; but , be that as it may , it grew nowhere else in the world as hardy and luxuriant as it grew in these hills and hollers.  | Lou 's roots , like those of the shortleaf , were deep in the soil of these hills , where they found the stuff that gave her life and growth and womanhood . Here , also , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell , Addie Kate and Little Lonzo . Maybe some would not survive , or if they did maybe they would not be the same , Uncle Yancey thought . Lou 's roots were too deep , and those of her young ones were too tender , and they might not take hold anywhere else . " Good-by , " Uncle Yancey said , nodding and trying to smile at all . Vigo nodded , turned on the ignition , and gently cased his right foot off the brake . Lou kept her eyes straight ahead , shielded by the sides of her sunbonnet . " Good-by , Uncle Yancey , " Thad said . Sarie Bell and Addie Kate smiled and waved at him . " Good-by , Lonzo , " Uncle Yancey called as the car rolled past him slowly . " Keep care o ' yourself , son . " Lou put out her hand , and Uncle Yancey caught it in both of his as he jogged along beside the car for a few paces . She glanced at him , and there was a smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Always , Uncle Yancey , " Lou said , quickly , " when I hear that song  --  you know which one  --  I 'll think o ' you . " Uncle Yancey released her hand , and the car rolled on . As he stood there , watching the car and the black tar-paper trailer roll down the hill , gathering dust as it went , Uncle Yancey thought of saying to her that the folks out there beyond the hills did n't know her song , and likely they had never heard of it . Little red wagon painted blue Little red wagon . . . " There goes Vigo an ' his Gawd-damned ambition , " Uncle Yancey muttered to himself as he watched the rear end of the trailer disappeararound the bend in the road where it joined the junction of the gravel highway numbered U.S. Highway 62 . " A terrible thing , ambition , " he thought as he spat fiercely into the dust . " Hit wo n't let a man rest when he 's a mind to , and hit won'tp191let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' sometimes hit kills them that has it , an ' hit can cause a great deal of misery to everyone else around them . " THE ROAD TURNED SLIGHTLY to the south beyond Elk City , Oklahoma , and it ran in that southwesterly direction almost until it reached Erick , then pointed westward toward the Panhandle straight into the blazing orange and red of the setting sun . Night had been coming quickly over the prairie , and now in that brief and breathlesstwilight before the darkness Lou looked far ahead and saw a tiny red glow and the thin trail of smoke of a campfire off to the left of the road . When darkness came , many of the cars and trailers stopped , made camp by the side of the road , and folks ate and rested through the long night for an early start at dawn . " We 'll stop up yonder , Lou , " Vigo said in a tired and weary way as he shifted his position on the hard and lumpy seat of the car . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " She glanced over at him and saw the white prairie dust caked on his stubble of beard and the dry wrinkles around his mouth . His eyes were dry and appeared burning in those dark shadows . They had stopped only once before , and that was the second night of the journey . Vigo had driven all day and all night of the first day , and now darkness of the third night was coming on , and Vigo was tired and his voice was weak and his eyes were red from the strain of the wind and the sun and almost thirty-six hours without sleep . Wearily now Lou closed her eyes and looked back over the long , slow journey since they had turned west out of Happy Holler and onto the highway which twisted and turned up through the hill country , through the deep cuts in the mountain rock , past the summitsof Eureka Springs and higher into the peaks of the Ozarks , then down the steep road into valleys wide and green with spring crops until at last they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ozarks . Beyond the river they passed through the flat , rich bottom land and the level green fields and orchards , and through the pretty towns of Rogers , Springdale , Fayetteville , and finally through Prairie Grove and across into Oklahoma . The highway out of Oklahoma City , through El Reno , Weatherford , and Clinton cut across the wide level plains in a straight line toward the lowering sun . To the north and west the plains curved over the rim of the earth in an unbroken line , and to the south the wide prairie extended to the dim and distant foothills of the Wichita Mountains . Across this plain the wind had blown all day long from the southwest , and it was like a strong and steady arm that kept pushing them back , cutting down their speed and making the water gurgle in the radiator of Thad 's old sedan , already strained by the weight of the trailer , loaded heavy with things . In midafternoon Vigo had stopped to let the motor cool , and Lou and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the narrow shade which the sun cast between the trailer and the hard , dry earth . As she lay there looking at the land , she saw that the ground was crusted with small white stones , left bare by the unceasingwinds which carried away the soil grain by grain . As the trucks and cars sped by , Vigo filled the radiator , and Lou lay there in the shade and recollected that for a hundred miles along the highway she had looked out over the plains and seen the dried tufts of hummock and piles of sun-bleached bones of animals which had perished in the bitter cold of winter or the dry desolation of summer wind and sun . Then Vigo had come around the side of the trailer to lie in the shade beside her . Thad and Little Lonzo and the girls were exploring the ground beside the road . " Hai n't much like home , is it , Lou ? " Vigo sighed . Lou had sat there silently , and Vigo had said , " Maybe I should n't ' uv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had looked up at him and smiled . " I hai n't sorry , not one bit , Vigo . I 'm glad you brung me , darlin ' . I want to go ever ' which way you go , Vigo . " Vigo had sighed and slid down beside her and licked his dry lipsp193and let his head rest against her shoulder while she rubbed his forehead with her fingers . " Ya still got a little o ' th ' scent o ' th ' hills about you , Lou , " Vigo had whispered , as he dozed off . Lou had watched Sarie Bell and Addie Kate as they had gathered small bunches of pale blue flowers which grew on slender shoots in the ditch by the side of the road . Thad and Lonzo were wandering across the open land among the low brush , the hummock , and the shallow , rocky gullies . Presently Thad came back , squinting his eyes in the bright sun and swinging his rifle at the balance at his side . Behind him Little Lonzo walked insecurely over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carrying a bleached and broken pair of steer horns . Thad climbed across the shallow and dry rock bed of the ditch and walked up to the trailer and leaned his rifle against it . " Ma , " Thad had said directly , " th ' whole place is dead an ' dried up an ' blowed away . Hai n't a livin ' thing as far as eye can see , except jack-rabbits  --  an ' I hai n't got th ' heart t ' kill th ' pore little of things . " Little Lonzo had stumbled up the side of the ditch and showed her the broken steer horns . " Dead , too , Ma , " Little Lonzo said . " Nothin ' c'n live hyar , Ma . " Lou looked down at Vigo 's closed eyelids , then up at the two boys . She whispered softly , " Th ' dewberries would be gittin ' ripe athome in about a week . " Vigo rubbed his eyes and sat up . " Well , " he said , looking far out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' afore we ' uns dry up an ' blow away , too . " All day long , wherever they had stopped for gasoline or oil or water , or just to rest briefly from the hard strain of riding , Lou had heard people talking of war and the new jobs which were opening up all the way from the bayous of Louisiana to the gulf towns of Texas and the coast cities of California , Washington , and Oregon . The people she heard talked of whole sections of the country being loaded into cars and trucks and trailers , busses , and trains and movingoff the land and into the towns and cities where there were jobs to do and money to make . Whole caravans of trailers , painted silver and glistening in the sunlight , moved swiftly about the highways into the setting sun , and children laughed and waved from them as they passed Lou and Vigo on the road . At night the highways were dotted with their campfires , and the roadhouses and trailer camps were crowded with them . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dry , rough ground , and there they built their campfire . After a supperof some of Lou 's canned goods , stored in the trailer , Vigo stretched out on the floor of the trailer , covered himself with a blanket , and went to sleep . Lou sat in her rocker facing the small fire as she listened to Thad and the girls talking about things they had seen and what lay ahead of them . Little Lonzo sat on the ground with his head against Lou 's knees , and Thad cleaned his long rifle and glanced sharply beyond the fading firelight into the dark shadows now hiding the small clumps of hummock and gnarled brush scattered over the plains . The wind never ceased , and it fanned the fire and made it burn brightly . At last the fire died out and Thad crawled into the back seat of the car and laid his rifle across his arms as he gazed sleepily out over the moonlit prairie . From her pallet on the floor beside Vigo , Lou heard the sudden roar of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind in its wake . When Thad opened his eyes next there were tiny sparkles of dew along the cold barrel of his long frontier rifle and the sky was gray with a false light of morning . This dew along his rifle barrel would ripen the berries back on the hills of home , he thought , but out here it only created a thin mist which disappeared as soon as the sun came out . IT WAS JUST AFTER they had eaten hamburgers at a roadside stand outside Amarillo , when Vigo pulled into a filling station and Lou and the children piled out and went into the rest rooms.  | " Headed for California ? " the filling-station man asked as he filled the tank . Vigo nodded . " Which is th ' best way , mister ? " The man grinned . " Straight ahead on Sixty-six . Takes you to Albuquerque , Winslow , Needles , and right into the San Bernardino Desert . Then you 're in California . Ca n't miss it . All roads go there anyhow . " Vigo walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of people goin ' to California . Never seen so many before . It 's the war . I 'd sell out an ' go too , only a fellow ca n't get no prices for things now-day . So I suppose I 'll stay on . This place 'll be good after the war . Th ' bottom will drop out of everything , just like it did after the last one . " Vigo nodded . The filling-station man went on : " War 's no good , only while it lasts . After that  --  well , it 's the same old story . I suppose you folks , know what you 're doing , though . You 'll see lots on the road , just like you . " Vigo said , " I got a contract . Got a job guaranteed when I get thar . " The filling-station man nodded . " Lots of folks got contracts . Seems like everyone 's got contracts in California . Pretty soon there wo n't be no one left at home . All be in California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Soon as th ' war 's over . " " I ai n't comin ' back , " said Vigo . The filling-station man leaned back from the radiator and looked at the license plate on the front of the car . " Arkansas ? " he said . Vigo nodded . The man chuckled . " Ca n't say that I blame you for not wantin ' t ' go back to Arkansas . Must be a hell of a place . " Vigo nodded . " What part ? " the man asked . " Happy Holler , " said Vigo . " Never heard of it . " " No ? " asked Vigo . The man shook his head . " Oh , I guess there 's some places that 's all right . But I would n't live in Arkansas . Corduroy roads , ai n't they ? " Vigo nodded . " In some parts . " " Yeah . A sorry place . Hillbillies , every one of ' em . Half of ' em ca n't speak English , I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vigo nodded . " You 're not from one of them parts , though , I can tell , " the man said . " I can understand you , all right . But it 's when they come from some of them real backwoods hill places that it 's hard to understand their lingo . Would n't live there myself . Ignorant people , they are . " The man replaced the radiator cap and turned and looked at Vigo . " Now if you want to avoid all that heat of the San Bernardino Desert , " he said , going back to what he had started to say before , " you can take Highway Eighty-seven , which runs northwest out of Amarillo , until you hit Colorado , then Highway Fifty to Salt Lake City , then across the Lincoln Highway  --  Number Thirty  --  through Nevada and into northern California . But it 's about five hundred miles outa your way . " Vigo nodded . He wanted to say as little as possible after what the man had said about that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo had learned long ago to keep his mouth shut when the talk turned to Arkansas , because it usually led to a fraction . " I 'd still take Sixty-six , though , " the man said . " It 's a straight shoot , right across New Mexico , Arizona , and California . Most peopletake either way just so they get there , and when they get there , well  --  I guess it do n't make much difference . As long as they get to California . That 's th ' main thing . " Vigo said , " Yeah , " and handed him a ten-dollar bill . " Say , I guess I 'd better give you a road map . That 's th ' best way . Then you can see where you 're going . " Vigo muttered , " Thanks . " The man gave him his change . " How about water ? Got plenty of water bags and canteens ? " Vigo shook his head . Lou and the children came out of the rest rooms and climbed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be driving through a long stretch of desert between here and California . You 'll need plenty of drinkin ' water and water for your car . " Vigo nodded . " Ai n't they places t ' stop an ' git hit ? " The filling-station man looked at Vigo suspiciously . " Cit hit ? " he asked , puzzled . Vigo nodded . " Th ' water , I mean . " " Oh , " the man laughed . " I thought you said hit . ' Sure . I mean , no . No , there 's very few places to get water . Most places , they charge two bits a quart . Of course if you 've got plenty of dough --  Vigo shook his head . " We got money , but we ort t ' save --  " Sure . " The man went into the filling station and brought out a dark brown canvas bag with a stopper in one end of it and handed it to Vigo . " There 's th ' thing , mister . Holds three gallons . Ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other for your family "  --  he glanced into the car at Lou , sitting in her sunbonnet in the front seat , and Thad with his rifle resting across his arms . " And I 'd take a coupla extra quarts of oil and a five-gallon drum of gas , if I was you . Just in case . " Vigo pulled the stopper from the water bag and smelled inside . " How much ? " he asked . " Three bucks . I 'll make it two for five . " Vigo said , " All right . Fill ' em up , too . " " Sure , " the man said . " Now how about the gas and oil ? Want that , too ? " Vigo nodded , and the man went in and brought out two tin cans of oil and a five-gallon can , which he filled with gasoline and set on the ground . " Now , " he said , " that 's five for the bags , and one-fifty for the gas and oil  --  six-fifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map , mister . I 'd keep right on Sixty-six . There 's just you and your wife and kids , is n't there ? " Vigo nodded . " No little babies or old folks to worry about ? "  | Vigo shook his head . " Then the straight shoot through the desert is the best . Babies and old folks do n't take to the desert much . But you look strong and healthy . I 'd stick to the straight shoot , mister . " Vigo climbed into the car and pulled out of the driveway and into the street and up to a corner where there was a stop sign and a U.S. Highway marker with " U.S. 66 " painted in black and white on it . Beside the road sign stood a short , thickset man who had a heavy black beard about three days old , thick black eyebrows , and large round eyes . He was wearing dusty overalls , a battered felt hat , and across his back was slung a grimy blanket roll tied with binder twine . Vigo pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main street of Amarillo at the low , flat buildings . Farther up the street the buildings were taller and the traffic was heavy . But at this intersectionthere was no traffic and the buildings were low and flatroofed . He was thinking about what the man had said about Arkansas and was just about to tell Lou when the man by the roadsideheld up his hand . " Hey , mister , " the man said , stepping up to the side of the car on Lou 's side , " how about a ride ? " Vigo and Lou had seen many men and boys along the road . They had stood just outside the towns and had tried to wave them down , but Vigo always shook his head and drove past them . " How about a ride , mister ? " the man asked . Vigo shook his head , said nothing . " How far you gain ' ? " Vigo 's lips did not move . Lou glanced quickly at Vigo . " Answer ' im , Vigo , " she urged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , mister ? " the man asked , placing his hand on the door of the car . " If you are , I 'd like t ' go along . I 'll pay you . I got to get there in a hurry . Got a job . Got a job waitin ' for me . " He looked at Lou and smiled . " Oh , hello there , madam , " he said , tipping his hat and showing his even row of teeth . Lou 's face reddened.  | " Ho'dy , " she said . " Say , " the fellow asked , jerking his thumb toward Vigo , " what 's th ' matter with him ? " Lou smiled . " Hai n't nothin ' th ' matter , " she replied . " Ca n't he talk ? " Lou looked up at Vigo and smiled , and Vigo 's eyes snapped over toward the fellow . " Go on , buddy , " Vigo said , harshly . " Hey , wait a minute , " the man said , squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , th ' guy actually talks ! " " Sure . Take yore hands off ' at car ! " Vigo exclaimed . " Now , wait a minute , mister --  " You heerd me , buddy . Take yore hands off ' n ' at " Wait a minute , mister . All I did was ask ya fer a ride . " Thad and Little Lonzo sat in the back seat and looked at the man . Thad 's rifle was butt down on the floor of the car , with the barrel lying between him and Little Lonzo . Thad reached down and touched the muzzle of the rifle , feeling the octagonal shape of the barrel . " I do n't keer , " Vigo said . " I shook m ' head , buddy . Reckon you know what hit means , huh ? " " Look , mister . Lemme ride back here with these kids . I been standin ' here for two hour , waitin ' . No one come along . I 'm gittin ' tired standin ' . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't give a Gawd-damned if ya stan ' thar all day . " The man laughed , and his teeth , contrasted with his black beard , were glistening and white . " Aw , come on , mister . You would n't want me t ' get a sunstroke , now , would ya ? " Lou looked at Vigo and touched his arm gently with the tips of her fingers . " Vigo  --  Vigo , why cai n't we ? " Lou begged . " Gawd dammit , Lou , I said no ! " " Thanks , lady . But say , mister , how about lettin ' me ride back in that trailer ? " Lou said , " Our two young ' uns is back thar. "  | " Two more ? " the man asked , raising his eyebrows . " Say , how many kids ya got , anyhow ? Four ? " Lou nodded . " Two boys , two girls . " The man laughed . " I 'll give ya fifteen bucks if ya let me ride back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , buddy , " Vigo said , throwing the car in gear and starting off . " Hey ! " the man said , laughing and running along the side of the car as it crossed the main street . He hopped on the running board and rode across the street . Vigo pulled up and stopped . " Listen , buddy , " he said , angrily , " ya better high-tail it outa hyar , or by Gawd , I 'll whale th ' tar out'n ya ! " The man stood on the running board , holding onto the top of the car with one hand and the door with the other . " Listen , mister , I 'm tryin ' t ' make a deal with ya . I 'll give ya fifteen dollars t ' let me ride back there in that trailer , all th ' way t ' California . I got ta get there in a hurry . Now whadda ya say ? Come on , mister , have a heart . . . . Be patriotic , why don'cha ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into his lap . Lou looked at him and tried to smile at him , but Vigo 's tongue was rolled up between his teeth , and he was beginning to bite it . " Vigo , darlin ' , " Lou began , " why do n't we fetch him t ' Californy . We got lots o ' room People walking along the sidewalk had stopped to listen to the argument . Vigo 's trailer was blocking the crosswalk , and some of the people walked around in front of the car to get by . " Lou , I would n't take this dead beat ! Not fer fifty dollars ! " " An ' why not , mister ? It 's okey-doke with your wife . Do I look like a common ordinary bum , madam ? " Lou looked at him closely . He looked like any other ordinary man . He was much younger than Vigo and built heavier , like a fighter . Vigo shook his head . " I 'm tellin ' ya , jist this once't more  --  an ' atter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git ya ! " The man smiled , and his smile was so boyish that it was hard for Lou to dislike him . He looked to be about twenty-five years old , and he was apparently not afraid of Vigo , Lou thought . He had to get top201California in a hurry , and it was a long way to walk . Lou did n't blame him for hanging on . There was room in the back seat of the car , if only Vigo would take him . " Please , Vigo , " Lou said . " He 's all right . He wo n't hurt nothin ' . Why cai n't we ? " Vigo bit his lower lip , and his eyes burned fiercely as he looked at Lou . " I 'm a-goin ' t ' have a talk with you , Lou , " he said . " They 's things you got ta know , Lou ! " " Look , mister , " the fellow was saying , " how about it ? " Vigo opened the left-hand front door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off the side of the car and backed away and dropped his blanket roll in the street . He quickly pushed up his shirt sleeves above the elbows and threw his hat down and took his stance , waiting for Vigo . " I 'm ready , mister  --  only you 're gon na be sorry , " the young fellow laughed . " You do n't know who I am . And if it 's a fight you want , by God , mister , I 'll give it to you ! " Vigo had got halfway around the front of the car when a black Ford sedan , covered with dust , turned the corner and came to a screeching stop beside Vigo 's car . A tall man , wearing a wide sombrero and pearl-handled pistols in polished leather holsters , jumped out of the car and ran around the rear end of the trailer and grabbed the man just as he squared off to hit Vigo . " Hey ! What 's goin ' on here ! " the policeman asked , jerking the fellow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose and turned to face the policeman . " Officer , " he said , " these people are tryin ' t ' get away and leave me here . I paid ' em twenty-five dollars , back in Oklahoma City , to take me to California . Now they 're trying to welch on me . Kicked me out and tried to get away with my dough ! " Vigo dropped his arms and came up to the policeman . " He 's a Gawd-damned liar , mister ! He stopped us right over thar " Vigo turned and pointed across the street . A crowd had gathered now , and the people were closing in all around the trailer , the policeman 's car , and the front of Vigo 's car . " Do n't believe him , officer , " the stocky fellow said , pretending to be sincere . " Either make him take me or give me back my money ! " Thad put his head out the car window . " That man 's a-lyin ' , sub ! " he yelled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skun nobody out'n nothin ' ! " Lou rose up in the car and tried to get out , but people were pressing their backs against the car and she could n't budge the door . " All right , you ! " the policeman said , advancing toward Vigo . " How about it ? " " Mister , " Vigo said , grinning suddenly , " me an ' my wife an ' young ' uns stopped right back thar at that fillip ' station , an ' we bought some gas an ' oil an ' two water bottles . There war n't no one else with us , ' ceptin ' my wife an ' four young ' uns . You can ask that fillin ' - station man . Then we pulls out'n th ' fillin ' station an ' up t ' that stop sign , an ' we seed this feller a-standin ' thar , a-hitchin ' a ride . He come up an clum ' on th ' side o ' our car , an ' says , How about a ride , mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ketched onto th ' car door an ' rid across th ' street . Right hyar 's whar we stopped . Up t ' then , I never seed this man afore in my hull life . An ' that 's th ' honest-t ' - Gawd 's truth ! Ai n't hit , Ma ? " Vigo turned to Lou , and she nodded . She was trying to say something , but the words would n't come out . The policeman turned around and looked at the crowd . " Anyone here seen this man standing over there by the corner ? " the policeman asked . No one in the crowd spoke . " Who saw anything ? " the policeman asked . A woman volunteered and came forward . " Officer , I saw this man jump onto th ' side of their car and ride across th ' street . Then this fight started . " " Anyone hear what was said ? " The woman stepped forward again . " I heard this young man say please take him along . That 's all I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I reckon we 'd all better go down to headquarters and get this thing straightened out . Looks like we cai n't get it straightened out this way . We 'll let th ' judge decide Lou reached back into the car and grabbed Thad 's rifle and yanked it across the back of the seat and held it with the barrelp203pointing straight at the fellow . The crowd jammmg the door saw the long rifle barrel , and they moved back . Lou opened the door and stepped down on the running board . Pushing her sunbonnet on the back of her head , she said : " Now looky hyar , mister . I hai n't been away from my home afore , but if thar 's one thing I know , hit 's when a man 's a-lyin ' , an ' a-lyin ' in his teeth . Now , stidder goin ' anywhar 's , I think we ' uns c'n settle this hyar fraction th ' quickest way . " The policeman backed away and began raising his hands to a level with his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction where the rifle was pointed , while Vigo backed up to the side of the car and stood there , watching Lou as she braced herself on the running board , clutching the rifle firmly with her right hand at the grip and her finger on the trigger , her left hand forward on the piece at the balance . " Keerful , Lou . Remember ' at ' ere hair trigger ! " Vigo shouted so everyone could hear . " Now pull back yore rooster , Ma , an ' take a good , study aim -- Thad jumped up and leaned over and tried to whisper to his ma . Lou placed her thumb on the hammer and pulled it back to the ready . " Ma ! " Thad whispered , hoarsely . Lou turned around , and her eyes were blazing . " Shet up , Thad ! " " But , Ma ! " Thad insisted . Lou released her left hand from the front grip on the barrel and pushed her sunbonnet back still farther over her forehead . " Now you , Mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still held his hands up politely  --  " this hyar polecat claims we tried t ' skun him out'n his filthy dollars an ' says we tried t ' throw him out'n our cyar  --  hai n't that right ? " The man yelled . " That 's right , officer . That 's what happened . They tried to throw me out and run off with my money  --  would n't even let me get my things ! " Lou laughed dryly . " All right , son , " she said , pointing the rifle at him . " You ast fer hit , an ' yore a-goin ' t ' git hit , shore as Gawd made little apples ! " The policeman backed away , and the crowd cleared the street.  | " Officer ! Officer ! " the fellow screamed . " Take away that gun from that crazy woman . She 'll shoot me ! " Someone in the crowd which cowered against the sides of the low buildings laughed to see the fellow cringe . " Officer , " Lou went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hyar piedy-eyed , tie-whackin ' sheer-crapper , he says we tried t ' not only skun him out'n his money , but we would n't let him git his things . Now , sir , " she added , pointing with the rifle , " if you 'll jist look over thar , by th ' side o ' th ' road , ye 'll see that ' ere blanket roll , all tied up ' ith binder twine . An ' if ye 'll open up that ' ere roll , ye 'll find ever'thin ' this feller owns in th ' world , all tucked in thar , jus ' like hit was when he rolled hit up last . " Lou stepped down from the running board and stood with the rifle at the ready position while the policeman turned and looked at the blanket roll lying in the street where the man had thrown it as he had squared off to meet Vigo in combat . The policeman reached down and picked up the blanket roll and took a knife and slit the string , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a razor and soap , a black leather wallet , and a long-bladed knife . " Now , I ast ye , folks , " Lou went on , raising the rifle so that the butt rested under her arm and the muzzle still pointed toward the fellow cowering in the street , " if we tried t ' skun this feller out'n his money an ' tried t ' skeedaddle out'n hyar with his things , how come all his things is done up in that ' ere blanket roll ? " " How about it , you ? " the policeman asked , advancing toward the other fellow . But just then the fellow turned and tried to run through the crowd , but a fat woman grabbed him and laughed as she held him by the collar . Lou lowered the rifle and spat into the street . " Th ' yaller dawg ! " she exclaimed . Thad leaned over and touched his ma on the shoulder . " What is it , son ? " Lou asked , glancing impatiently back over her shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " hit ai n't loaded  --  I fergot t ' load hit las ' night ! "  |p205By  this time the policeman had grabbed the fellow by the neck and was pushing him toward the patrol car . Then he turned to Lou , tipped his hat and grinned. ' lids may be your first trip away from Arkansas , ma'am , " he said , " but you 're gettin ' pretty wise to the ways of the world out-side . " Vigo walked around and got into the car and started it and drove on through the town and out on Highway 66 . Thad and Little Lonzo were laughing and whispering to each other in the back seat , but Vigo was silent for a long time . Lou moved over closer to him and put her left arm around him and laid her head on his shoulder . " Darlin ' , " she said , slyly , " back yander , ya said thar was somethin ' ya had t ' tell me . Said thar was a few things I ort t ' know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . What is hit that I ort t ' know ? " Vigo 's tongue curled up between his front teeth for a moment , then he looked at the road ahead . " Nothin ' , Lou , " he said , gazing at the faraway purple of distance . " I reckon ya know hit already , an ' if ya do n't know hit , ya wo n't be very long in ketchin ' on . " WEST OF AMARILLO through Vega , high up in the Texas Panhandle country , and through Tucumcari and Santa Rosa on the banks of the shallow Pecos in New Mexico , the highway crosses the Trans-Pecos highlands , ridge country and high plateau between the Pecos and the Upper Rio Grande . Ragged mountains lying over the hump of the range on either side of the road slope up gradually toward the west until they rise to great blue heights , then drop off sharply on their western fronts . Between the dim blue fringes of mountains are the valleys , wide and level , dropping off into bolsdns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basins which caught the sparse rainfall but gave it no outlet . Somewhere between the Pecos and the start of the Colorado plateaus is a long basin which the early Spanish explorers called Jornada del Muerto  --  the Journey of Death  --  because the basin is many days across on horseback and there is no water , no animals , not a living thing except the tall stumplike cactus , low sagebrush , mesquite , and other snarled desert growths scattered over the white rocky floor of impure salt and alkaline crust , caked and cracked and dried like mud pies Mother Nature made when she was only a mischievous , prankist little girl who dabbled in earth and water and sun . The road finally descends to the floor of the basin , where the land is the driest and the sun hottest . This stretches forth for many miles , but the naked eye can not see very far because the shimmering heat distorts the vision , making strange shapes of the distant mountains , the desert brush , the dried salt beds , and the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ahead on the pavement of the highway which stretched without a turn for many miles , and the pavement was wet for a great distance and then appeared to end abruptly on the shores of a clear , blue lake . They marked the shores of the lake by the sight of a barren white rock far ahead , but when they reached the spot where the wet surface had appeared a little while ago , there was nothing but blazing white pavement , coated and caked by the dust blown upon it by the sudden night wind . Beyond the Pecos nearly a hundred miles the highway took a sudden upgrade turn , through the low hills covered with bunch grass and yucca which gave way gradually to small pines and cedars as the hills got steeper and steeper until they reached the foothills of the sloping Manzano Range of mountains , in the dead center of New Mexico , a full four days and three nights away from Happy Holler . Lou and Vigo and Thad and Little Lonzo sat in the car , and Sarie Bell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors across the bolsons which gleamed white and gold and flaming red below the deep blue sky of the day , then turned to burnt orange and brown and then deep violet as the sun sank swiftly behind the Manzanos . Then out of the velvet blackness which followedp207there came a sudden brilliance as though a huge bucket of sparks had been dumped in the skies , and the stars hung there almost at Lou 's fingertips . With the coming of night , the wind increased and turned e old . At last it became so cold that Lou gathered her shawl over her sunbonnet , wrapped it around her shoulders , and huddled close to Vigo , who was constantly beating his hands together and blowing on his fingers . " Lou , " he said , at last , " I 'm durn nigh froze to death . We 'll hafta pull up an ' light us a fire . " Just then , ahead of them along the road , they saw a tiny gleam of firelight glowing orange and red in the darkness . " Hit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think you can make hit t ' thar ? " Vigo nodded and pressed the accelerator to the floorboard . Fifteen minutes later they came to the roadside camp where the firelight clearly outlined the shapes of the automobiles and trailers parked in a half-circle around it . Dim figures moved in the light of the fire , and a faint murmur could be heard above the crackling of the blazing dried wood . A dog barked and ran out toward them . Vigo slowed the car and came to a dusty stop at a place where the car tracks were barely visible and turned off the highway , crossed the low , flat ditch by the side of the road , and drove among the sparse shrubs which marked the trail to the campfire . The little dog , white and noisy , ran out , barking , but as Vigo approached he came up to the car , wagging his tail and whining . " Hit 's a friendly little dawg , " said Lou . " But maybe we hai n't welcome , Vigo . " Vigo wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of boiling coffee and frying meat on the cold night air . " Maybe we ort to keep on drivin ' until we find us a good place , Vigo , " Lou said , timidly . " I hate t ' come a-usin ' around other people'scampfires . " Vigo stopped the car and turned and looked back at Thad and Little Lonzo , huddled together , asleep . Sarie Bell and Addie Kate were back in the trailer . Lou was waiting for him to decide . " I reckon we ort to go in , Lou , " Vigo said , rubbing his hands together . " I 'm t'ard an ' hongry , an ' th ' young ' uns is , too . An ' you ,  | Lou , " he added , seeing her face in the dim light , " look t'ard an ' like ya could do fer some rest . So they cai n't turn us out , Lou . I reckon they 're travelin ' t ' Californy , jus ' like us , an ' thar hai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . " Lou nodded as Vigo drove over the bumpy hard ground toward the semicircle of trailers parked on the prairie . A little girl ran from between two long silvery trailers , and the little dog went up to her and she picked it up and held it in her arms . Vigo stopped the car beside her and leaned out a little and spoke to her . " Ho'dy , miss  --  reckon we ' uns can stop hyar ? " From the circle of firelight came the soft twang of a guitar and the mellow notes of an accordion . Vigo looked up and saw coming between the two trailers a short , stocky man whose cigar glowed in the dark . The man stopped beside the little girl and patted her head , then came toward Vigo 's car . He shaded his eyes against Vigo 's headlights and looked out into the darkness at them . " Hello , folks , " he said . " Looking for a place to stop ? " Vigo hesitated a moment , then said , " Yep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thought The man laughed . " Drive right on in , folks , " he said . " There 's an open space on the other side of the camp . Drive right on- in . " " Thank ye , " Vigo said . Then he waited a while and added , " Sure we ' uns ai n't a-buttin ' in ? " The man laughed again and took the cigar from between his lips . " Of course not , folks . Of course not . My name 's Hogan , " he said , walking up to the side of the car and extending his hand to Vigo . Vigo took it . " We 're Hoxies , " he said . " Meet m ' wife , Lou . M ' two boys is asleep back thar "  --  he jerked his head toward the back seat " an ' m ' two girls is in th ' trailer . " The man nodded . " You need a good place , and you 've come to the right place , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan of folks who are going to California . We cook all the meals , build the fires , haul the water and wood , and look after their needs , generally . We were in business together , me and Epstein , back in Jersey . We got a truck/load of supplies , plenty of gas and water and oil . We 'll be glad to accommodate you for the night . " Vigo looked at Lou wonderingly , and she nodded . " We want t ' thank ya , Mister Hogan , " she said . " We was a-gettin ' mighty yard an ' hongry , an ' hit looked like we war n't a-goin ' t ' find no place t ' stop . " I Logan laughed and motioned Vigo forward . " Drive right on in , Mr. Hoxie . I 'll go see what Epstein has for dinner . You 'll find our prices are reasonable and our food is delectable . " Vigo swallowed . " How much ? " he asked . Lou shook his arm warningly , but he ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vigo ! " " Why , why , that 'll be a dollar apiece , " Hogan said . " That includesa place to stop for the night , shower baths if you want them , your dinner , and a good breakfast in the morning . How 's that ? " Vigo looked at Lou , and she was silent . " We got plenty of fresh eggs , butter , and milk , " Hogan was saying . " Epstein buys them off the farmers . We keep our supply truck well stocked . Back in Texas we got some good steer steaks . That 's what we 're having tonight , I think  --  western steaks , potatoes , gravy , coffee . " Vigo hesitated . " That 'll be six dollars , Mister Hogan , " he said . " Hit 's a lot o ' money . " " More'n hit costs us t ' live a whole month back home , " said Lou . Hogan laughed . " All right . I 'll make it five . Five dollars for all six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorry , though , no hot water . " He laughed again . Vigo wondered if the man were joshing him , but he nodded . " All right . If we ' uns war n't so t'ard an ' hongry -- Hogan rubbed his hands briskly together . " Of course . Of course . I 'm sure you wo n't be sorry . " Vigo drove to the empty space by the big long silvery trailer . There were lights in the trailer , and from it came the faint music of a radio . Lou got out , placed her hands at the small of her back , and straightened herself while Vigo awakened the young ones . Thad and Little Lonzo climbed out of the car , blinking their eyes and rubbing them as they looked toward the firelight in the center of the big semicircleand saw the people moving about the fire.  | " Mus ' be a dozen trailers , Pa , " Thad said , counting them . Lou explained to Thad that it was a regular business among some folks to cater to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caravan of trailers and taking care of their needs along the way . The little girl carrying the white dog came toward their trailer and approached Sarie Bell and Addie Kate . " I 've got a little puppy , " the girl said . " He smells another dog . Do you have a dog ? " Thad and Little Lonzo and Sarie Bell and Addie Kate stood beside the trailer , their hands folded behind their backs , as they looked at the little girl and her dog and grinned . Thad said , " We got a dawg  --  a houn ' dawg  --  a great big ' un , but he 's tied up in that ' ere trailer . " " Why do n't you turn him loose ? " the little girl asked . Thad laughed . " Aw , little girl , " he said , " that big ol ' dawg o ' our'n would cat up yore little ol ' runt of a dawg . " The little girl laughed . " I 've got a runt , " said Little Lonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A runt . A pig , " said Little Lonzo . The little girl pinched her nose . " Pew ! They smell ! " Little Lonzo nodded . " I know . That 's what yore dawg smells . He smells my pet pig . " Just then a woman 's voice called , " Alice ! You come here ! " The little girl backed away . " That 's my mother , " she said . " Mother do n't allow me to play with strangers . But wait 'll I tell her about your pig . Will you let me see him ? Will you let me see your pig ? " The woman ran from the fire and took the little girl by the hand and led her away . Just then Lou called to her children and they went into the trailer . She gave them clean clothes , which she took from one of the drawers Vigo had built . Hogan knocked on the door of the trailer , and Lou stuck her head out . " Here 's your towels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the showers I Iat the end of that big tank truck over there , " he said , pointing around the other side of the campfire . " I was just gettin ' their things , " Lou said . " Th ' young ' uns hai n't had a bath since we left home , an ' I reckon we 'd all feel right better . " I Logan nodded . " Right over there . Just pull the chain and the water comes out of the tank truck . It 's very simple . " Vigo came out of the trailer with fresh , clean overalls and shirt thrown over his arm . " And when you 're all bathed , come on back to the fire and we 'll sec you get plenty to cat , " said Hogan . Vigo led the way toward the water wagon . They had to pass through the firelit circle to reach it , and as they passed a hush settled over the circle of people gathered around . Lou , walking behind Vigo with a daughter on each side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campfire . On their way back from the showers , Hogan met them at the edge of the circle . " Just a minute , Mr. Hoxie , " he called , running up to Vigo . Vigo and Lou stopped , but the children went on , carrying their old clothes back to the trailer . " Mr. Hoxie , " Hogan began , taking his cigar from between his lips , " we carry a good stock of ladies ' dresses , girls ' dresses , shoes , stockings , slacks , sweaters  --  anything you need . " He looked first at Lou 's long flour-sack dress which had been dyed a dark blue , but which was now beginning to fade . The brand name printing showed in reverse across the back of her dress in a diagonal line . Lou had her old knit wool shawl thrown over her head and draped down on her shoulders to cover her hair , which had got wet under the shower . " Do n't you want to dress like the others ? " Hogan said , motioning toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " Maybe something more stylish  --  slacks , maybe . Or a nice print dress , straight from New York ? " he said , indicating Lou 's garmentswith a motion of his hand . Lou felt the warmth rise to her cheeks , and she quickly grasped Vigo 's arm and stood close to him.  |p212Vigo  asked , " What 's th ' matter with my wife 's things , mister ? " His voice was low and almost a hoarse whisper . Hogan hunched his shoulders and rocked back and forth on his heels as he shoved his hands deep into his pockets . " I was just suggesting something more stylish . " " I 'll pay ya not t ' say things like that , mister , " Vigo said quietly . " But I was n't making fun , " Hogan replied . " I know , " Vigo said . " I was just suggesting Vigo started to advance a step toward him , but Lou held him back . " I said I 'd pay ya not t ' say things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back toward the fire . Epstein was dishing the food on tin plates and passing them around to the campers . " Who are they ? " he asked Hogan . " From Arkansas , " Hogan replied . " They 're going to California , ai n't they ? " his partner asked . " Sure , " Hogan answered . " And they got money , ai n't they ? " Hogan nodded . " Then why do n't you sell ' em something ? " Epstein asked . Hogan bit the end off a fresh cigar and spat out the end into the fire . " Wait till you see these people , Epstein , " he said . " They 're hillbillies . The woman 's wearing an old-fashioned homemade shawl and a flour-sack dress . You can still see the Gold Medal label printed on the cloth . She 's got Eventually  --  Why Not Now ? ' printed right across her butt ! " Epstein shook his head . " Eventually  --  Why Not Now ? ' ! " he repeatedwith a chuckle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't waste any water , " Epstein said presently . Hogan laughed . " They 're probably afraid of it . Maybe they do n't take baths in Arkansas . " A short , fat man walked up to the table where Epstein and Hogan were preparing the plates . " Say , who were those people that passed through here ? " he asked  |p213E|pstein  said , " Ask him , " indicating Hogan . " He invited ' em . " " They 're from Arkansas , " Hogan said . " Probably from the Ozarks , from the looks of ' em . " " The Ozarks , eh ? " the fat man said . " That 's interesting . " " What 's interesting , Dr. Titus ? " Epstein asked . " A problem in constructive sociology , " said Dr. Titus . " The Ozark people , I mean . I once made a study of the region when I was in college . " " Yeah ? " said Hogan . " Yes , " said the doctor . " Completely isolated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely isolated they 're actually hostile to outsiders . Even hostile to their own people who live on the next ridge or over in the next valley . " Hogan laughed . " Yeah . They 're hostile , all right , " he said , thinking of Vigo and the way he acted a moment ago . The doctor went on . " The government tried building roads , putting in electricity and telephones , you know . But did you know that these people actually threatened to shoot the road builders ? " " No ! " The doctor pursed his lips and nodded , with his eyes closed . " That they did . Actually threatened to shoot the road builders . " The doctor 's wife came up and clasped her arm through that ofher husband . " Who threatened to shoot who ? " she asked , laughing . " Oh , hello , dear . I was just telling Epstein and Hogan about the Ozarkians . " Mrs. Titus shrugged . " Oh ! Them ! " " Very interesting segment of civilization , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trash , that 's what they are ! They do nothing but eat , sleep , and fornicate ! " Hogan laughed . " Not a bad life , eh , Epstein ? " Epstein shook his head , seriously . " Now , I would n't say . " " It 's true , " Mrs. Titus said . " Those people cohabit with anything . Tell them about the man and the goat , Felix , " she prompted her husband . " Now , now , dear ! " the doctor said .   " Go on . Tell them . I 'll go and let you boys talk , " his wife said , laughing . " Well , " the doctor said , " I was making a study of a particular Ozark region where tuberculosis was prevalent . I happened upon an interesting discovery , one of the most unusual of my career . It seems that there was an old codger who lived in the hills , and Hogan put his hand on the doctor 's arm . " Sh-h-h ! Here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of the fire . Vigo and Lou were walking together , and their children were trailing behind them . Little Lonzo was carrying his runt pig under his arm , and Thad was leading his hound by a long rawhide thong . Everyone stopped eating as Mrs. Titus whispered to the couple sitting on campstools next to her . The couple held their plates on their knees and looked up . The fire made deep shadows under Vigo 's eyes , accentuating his long nose , high cheekbones , dangling arms , and long legs which he raised just enough at the knees to keep his feet from dragging . Lou walked erect with her shawl thrown over her head , her left arm through her husband 's right arm , and her hands clasped together at Vigo 's elbow . Hogan stepped away from the serving table to meet them . " Come right on up , folks , " he said . " Do n't be afraid . " He walked over and showed Vigo a place to sit next to a young couple on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania . Mr. and Mrs. Slovac , this is Mr. and Mrs. Hoxie of Arkansas , and family . " Mr. Slovac got to his feet and extended his hand to Vigo . " Pleased to meet you , " he nodded . " Ho'dy , " Vigo said . Mrs. Slovac remained sitting on the ground . She wore a blue quilted robe which was buttoned together in front . Lou looked at her and saw the fullness in the front of her robe . " How do you do , " Mrs. Slovac nodded . " Excuse me for not getting up , but you can see " She looked down at her stomach . Lou nodded . " Hit do n't make no never mind , honey . Jes ' keep yore seat . " P215Dr . ' Titus looked at his wife and nodded . She smiled , then nodded to Vigo a'ul Lou . Hogan stepped into the circle and introduced Lou and Vigo simply by announcing them to everyone at the same time . The women smiled and the men nodded , looked first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Thad and his hound , and Little Lonzo and the pig in his arms . " I io'dy , folks , " Vigo said , lowering his head . Lou looked around the fire and smiled . Epstein came forward with two tin plates which he gave to Lou and Vigo as they sat down . In the plate was a steak , mashed potatoes , gravy , peas , and two slices of bread . The little girl came around the circle of fire and stood before Addie Kate and Sarie Bell . " Did you have a shower ? " she asked . Addie Kate giggled . " Hit was cold , " she said . " Hit was awful cold , " Sarie Bell added . " I like showers , " the little girl said . " At home we have a shower and a bathtub in our house . " " You mean a water wagon like that ' ere one ? " asked Thad , pointing in the darkness toward the tank truck where they had just bathed . The little girl laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower and a bathtub ? " The girl 's mother called to her . " Alice ! Come away and leave those people alone ! " The little girl smiled down at Addie Kate and Sarie Bell , then turned and ran around to her mother and sat down . Epstein brought them each a plate of steak , potatoes , gravy , and bread . Addie Kate looked up from hers and said to her ma , " They got sweet bread , Ma . " " Hush , honey ! " Lou whispered , shaking her head at the girl . " But Ma , " Addie Kate went on , " they got sweet bread ! I hai n't tasted sweet bread but once't , an ' hit 's been so long that I disrememberwhat hit tastes like ! " " I said hush , honey , " Lou scolded.  | Mr. and Mrs. Slovac moved over to make room for Lou . " Oh , do n't fret about us , ma'am , " Lou said . Mrs. Slovac tucked in the edges of her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas ? " Dr. Titus said , leaning over and looking past the Slovacs at Lou . " Tell us about the Ozarks . " The doctor smiled . " I was just telling about them . I was just speaking of the isolation and the resultant excessive individualism Lou looked at her plate , then at Vigo . Vigo picked up the two slices of bread and bit into them , looked at Lou , then raised the plate to his chin and lifted the end of the steak with his fingers and put the end in his mouth and bit off a chunk . Dr. Titus looked at Vigo , then at Lou again and smiled . " What was that , sir ? " Vigo asked . " I was just telling of the complete isolation and hostility of the Ozark people , and I thought it would be nice to hear you tell about it . Little Lonzo looked down at his plate , then at his pa , and saw the way his pa was eating , then picked up the dripping steak and bit off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runt pig to lick . One of the women across the fire laughed and then covered her face in her hands . Several others snickered , but their faces were solemn as Vigo looked across the fire at them . Epstein came up and held his hands behind his back as he looked down at Vigo and the children eating with their fingers . " Good ? " he asked . Vigo took another mouthful of bread , looked up at him and nodded . " We ' uns was powerful hongry , " he said . " We hai n't et nothin ' since breakfast . " Lou glanced around her at the others . They were not eating , but held their plates in their laps and smiled at the Hoxies and Epstein , standing over them . " Th ' sweet bread is right good , " Lou said , smiling at Epstein . " Sweet bread ? " " Yeah , " said Vigo , picking up one of the slices and waving it . " That 's whut we calls hit back home  --  sweet bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding , " you mean white bread ? " His face colored , and she nodded . " Hit 's a reg'lar treat , " she said , biting off a portion which had lain in the gravy . " We do n't have much of hit at home , " she said . " Hit 's mostly cawn bread . " Epstein grinned , and taking one hand from behind his back he licld out knives , forks , and spoons to Lou . " Do n't suppose you use these much in Arkansas , either , " he said . M ts . Titus laughed , and the others around the fire snickered . Vigo gulped the dry bread , reached up and grabbed the knives , forks , and spoons from Epstein and gave them to Lou and the children . " I was just wonderin ' if you ' uns et without no utensils , " he drawled . " Back-actually , " he added , looking squarely at Epstein , " we hai n't used t ' eatin ' slop like this hyar grub ya give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' attack hit  --  seein ' as how ya give us grub that 's just about fit'n fer this hyar little old runt pig my boy Lonzo 's got hyar , I thought you ' uns et like hawgs , too ! " Epstein turned away and went back to the table without a word . There was a brief silence , and the others around the fire continued with their meal . The man with the guitar rose and walked over and sat on the running board of a Packard sedan and began picking a chord . Presently the man with the accordion followed him and ran his fingers over the white keys . Mrs. Slovac spoke first . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hoxie , " she said , " but I 'm afraid they are n't very hospitable . It was a mean trick Epstein just pulled . You 've got to watch him . He 's full of tricks like that , but he does n't mean any harm . " Lou ate in silence for a while . " Hit 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' uns hai n't like you ' uns . " Mrs. Slovac reached over and touched Lou 's arm . " We 're all Americans , " she said . " We ought to get along together , especially in times like these . " Lou nodded and went on eating . " I reckon , " she said , finally , " we had no business buttin ' in like this  --  but our young ' uns was jus ' about done in , pore little of things . An ' Vigo , he looked so yard an ' wore out . Been drivin ' fer days , hit appears like . Hit 's a right fur piece from whar we come from t ' whar we 're a-goin ' . "   Mrs. Slovac smiled sweetly . " Just the same , I think we all ought to forget our little prejudices . " Lou did n't look up from her plate . She only nodded . She watched Little Lonzo throw the crust of his bread to the pig , and saw Thad eat only half his steak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's a Pole , I 'm Irish , " Mrs. Slovac continued . " Mr. Epstein 's a Jew , and Hogan is part English , part Irish . Dr. Titus is Austrian-born , and his wife 's from Vermont . We ought to all get along together , but my husband hates Mr. Epstein , and the same goes for Epstein , too . I guess people just ca n't forget their little prejudices  --  but they ought to . That ' ' what we 're all made up of  --  all kinds of people . People lose their identity in America . Their racial identities , I mean . That 's the way it should be . We 're all Americans . " " I reckon , " Lou said . " But we 'll just stay hyar t ' night an ' then go on along b'fore sunup t'morry . " Mrs. Slovac put her hand on her side and held it there . " I wish you 'd stay with us until we get to California , Mrs. Hoxie , " Mrs. Slovac said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her . " I mean it , " Mrs. Slovac said . " This is to be my first baby . I do n't know anything about it , and all these women here have never helped in childbirth . They 've always had a doctor . " Lou looked at the fat man sitting beyond Mr. Slovac . " What about him ? " she asked . Mrs. Slovac shook her head . " He 's not a doctor . He 's a sociologist with a doctor of philosophy degree . " " Oh , " Lou said , somewhat bewildered . " That does n't mean he knows anything about child deliveries , " Mrs. Slovac said . " And I 'm actually afraid . " Lou looked up at her and smiled . " Hai n't nothin ' t ' be afeared of , ma'am , " she said . " Women 's been havin ' babies fer a right long time . " " I know , " Mrs. Slovac said with a worried frown . " But I have n't . " Lou patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . Little babies jus ' come , honey . An ' when they do , nature takes its course . " Mrs. Slovac turned a little pale and shook her head . " I 'd be scared to death  --  my husband does n't know anythingP219about it . If you and Mr. Hoxie could just come along with us , I 'm sure everything would be all right . I would n't be afraid with you along . " Lou looked at her , and there was moisture in the woman 's eyes , and her fingers were nervously touching her lips . She glanced quickly at Lou , then down into the burning coals of the fire . Lou patted her arm . Her husband was talking to Titus . " There , there , now , now , honey , " Lou said , soothingly . " Hit 'll be all right . But me an ' Vigo 's got to go on by our own self , honey . We ' uns know when we ' uns do n't belong . " Mrs. Slovac covered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Lou . " What 's th ' matter with my wife ? " he demanded . Lou shook her head , and Vigo looked at Slovac . " What did you say to her ? " Slovac exclaimed . Vigo half arose and faced Slovac . " She did n't say nothin '  --  hit was yore wife that was a-doin ' all th ' talkin ' ! " Slovac put his arm around his wife . " It 's her first child . She 's nervous . The least little thing excites her . You should n't have said whatever it was . " Lou looked at him and shook her head . " I 'm right sorry , mister , " she murmured . " But hit looks like we got off on th ' wrong foot . " Slovac got up and lifted his wife to her feet . " Aw , forget it ! " he grunted , leading her away . " She 'll be all right . " Lou stood up . " Come on , young ' uns . " She motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sleep. - Ya can see we do n't b'long . " As Lou and Vigo walked out of the firelight and back toward their trailer , Vigo said : " They 're spiteful people , Lou . " Lou was silent as she walked along , holding Vigo 's arm . Finally she said , " I reckon hit 's we ' uns , Vigo . But we 'll go on alone , t'morry . " After the children were asleep , Lou and Vigo lay together in a thin pallet and covered themselves with a quilt . The low strumming of the guitar and the mellow tones of the accordion came to them in fading sounds as the wind changed often , carrying the sound away and across the prairie . A coyote , attracted by the fire , slunk among the scrub a few hundred yards away and began howling .   Thad 's hound , sleeping at the foot of the bed where Thad and Little Lonzo were curled up together beneath the bunk where the girls slept , stirred and growled , then slowly lowered his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . They felt the vibration of the wind against the trailer , and far away there sounded a deep and distant rumble of thunder , and presently a few big raindrops splashed on the tar-paper roof of the trailer , then ceased . The wind increased , and small particles of earth and sand and sticks blew against the side of the trailer and rattled along the ground . Lou felt Vigo huddle against her , felt his warm breath on the back of her neck . " Thar hai n't much room in hyar , Lou , " he said hoarsely . " I war n't figurin ' on no weather like this . In Californy hit 'll be warm . I war n't figurin ' on no six people , a dog , an ' a little old runt pig all sleepin ' in hyar t'gether , Lou . " Lou turned from her side and lay close to him . " Hit 's all right , darlin ' , " she whispered , brushing her forehead against the sharp stubble on his chin . " Some folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An ' they got built-in stoves an ' heat , but we hai n't in our'n . " Lou laid her hand gently on his cheek and patted it . " Hit 's good , Vigo . Hit'il do till we ' uns git t ' our nice home in Californy . " Vigo put his arm under her head and pressed her shoulder against him as he lay on his back , looking up in the darkness . " Hit ai n't allus goin ' t ' be this-a way , Lou , " he whispered . " SomedayI 'm a-goin ' t ' build you a nice place . An ' you 'll have nice things . " Vigo sighed . " Hit 's all right , Vigo . I do n't care if they laugh at me . Long as I c'n always be with you , darlin ' . I do n't care what they say . " Vigo rolled his head from one side to another on the thin blanket on the floor . " Wisht I had n't of got mad at Mister Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' th ' girls some of them nice clothes . But someday , Lou , " he sighed , wearily , " someday Lou kissed him , then lay quietly for a long time . " What ya a-thinkin ' of , Lou ? " he asked . Lou lay silent for a moment . " About that Miz ' Slovac , Vigo , " sheP22Isaid . " She 's a-goin ' t ' bear a child soon . An ' she 's afeared o ' havin ' hit alone -I wish we could go along , for her sake , Vigo . I could help her , an ' she would n't worry so . Them other womenfolk , they do n't know how to be any help to her when her time comes . " " To hell with ' em , Lou ! " Vigo grunted . " To hell with all of ' em , humiliatin ' us right before their very eyes . Let ' em have their young ' uns . Let her have her little old brat , an ' let her do hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no skin off'n our Lou laughed softly . " Now , Vigo ! " she scolded him gently . " That ai n't no way t ' talk , Vigo . Th ' pore thing . She needs someone Vigo turned over angrily . " To hell with ' em , Lou . She would n't do nothin ' fer us . No siree ! Would n't turn a hand t ' help us if we was in trouble . " " Now , Vigo , " Lou said , sleepily , " ya cai n't never tell . She might do us a right good turn someday . " The coyote howled again , but Thad 's hound was asleep , and so was Vigo . Lou lay there for a long time , wondering about poor Mrs. Slovac . Lou would have to help her somehow . She had a strange and unusual feeling about Mrs. Slovac , as though the woman needed her very much . It was a sign  --  a strange and peculiar sign that Lou could not ignore or forget , even as she slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embers of the fire and darkness closed in everywhere. 27Lou LAY AWAKE for a long time , listening to the wind and the sand blowing against the tar-paper sides of the trailer . Once in a while she dozed off , but soon she awakened and lay there looking up at the dark window . Once during the night she heard Thad 's hound get up , heard his claws click across the new plank floor as he walked to the door , pushed it open with his head , and went outside . At last the sky through the small square window in the trailer showed gray in the east , and Lou got up quietly , dressed , and went outside . Thad 's hound crawled from under the trailer , sniffed at the hem of her dress , and brushed his cold nose against her hand and whined . Lou looked toward the semicircle of trailers , and she saw the dark shadow of a man moving in the gray false light of morning as he carried brush for the fire . There was a light in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn curtains . " Hit 's her , " Lou whispered to herself . " Hit 's her , an ' she 's likely awake and frettin ' . " Lou began walking toward the center of the camp , followed by Thad 's hound , who sniffed at the air and growled once at the man who moved around the dead ashes of the fire as he prepared to light another . Approaching to within a few feet of the trailer where the light was burning , Lou stopped and listened . Someone was moving inside the trailer . She stepped to the side of it , and Thad 's hound sat down on his haunches and whined . " Sh-h-h ! " Lou said . The dog got up and followed . Now she could hear someone walking slowly inside the trailer . It was a man 's footsteps , pacing up and down . Lou drew in her breath quickly and knocked on the door softly . The footsteps came to the door , and it opened a little way . Lou looked in past the man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms folded over her face , shielding her eyes from the light . " Who is it ? " the woman called , raising herself on one elbow . " Good mawnin ' , Mister Slovac , " Lou spoke softly . " I could n't sleep las ' night fer thinkin ' o ' her " Who is it ? " the woman called again . " It 's her , " said her husband , as he opened wide the door . " Wo n't you come in , Mrs. Hoxie ? " He stepped back and motioned for Lou to enter , but she stood on the step , looking inside . " I could n't git no sleep , ma'am , " Lou said softly . " But I do n't want t ' bother ya none . " " I 'm very glad you 've come , Mrs. Hoxie , " he sighed heavily . " Oriana has been awake most of the night . " P223Lou stepped inside and nodded . " I knowed hit , " she said . " I jus ' knowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed and pulled the blanket up to cover her bosom . " What did you know , Mrs. Hoxie ? " " I knowed ya was in misery , honey , " Lou replied . Lou looked at Mrs. Slovac , and the young woman 's cheeks were swollen and puffy . Lou recognized the symptoms . " Yore face is all swole to a strut , honey , " Lou said , kindly . " An ' you been a-cryin '  --  I can tell . " Mrs. Slovac nodded and lowered her head . " Are you going to come along with us , Mrs. Hoxie ? " she asked , her voice hushed . " No , honey , " Lou said . " You ' uns is a-comin ' with me an ' Vigoso'sI can look atter you , honey . I 'm a-gonna keer fer you until that baby comes . " Mrs. Slovac looked up at her husband and smiled . He said , " That 's what she 's been crying about , most of the night , Mrs. Hoxie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou said , sitting on the edge of the bed and stroking Mrs. Slovac 's head . " I got th ' sign , honey . " Slovac went on : " I tried to tell Oriana that you did n't want to be bothered with us , but she would n't listen . She wants to leave these people and go with you and your family . " Lou looked at Mrs. Slovac and smiled at her . " That 's what I knowed , all night long , " she murmured . " I reckon ya call hit th ' gift  --  I had a sign or a token , an ' th ' sign never fails . " " I 'm glad , for my sake , " said Mrs. Slovac . " I suppose I 'm just selfish . But I 'm so afraid  --  oh , so afraid he will be born and there will be no one who knows how to help me , and he will die . " She covered her face with her hands and began crying . Her husbandjust stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do when she gets this way , Mrs. Hoxie , " he said . " I 'm completely lost . I guess I 'm not a very good one to have around at a time like this . " Lou patted her head and leaned down and whispered to her . " When 's yore time , honey ? When 's yore time suppose t ' be ? " The young woman said uncertainly , " It 's  --  it 's  --  not for a month ,   I guess . But I feel it 's so near  --  I do n't think it 's long off  --  but I d-do n't knowLou nodded . " I see , honey , " she said understandingly . " No one but Gawd knows , honey . " Slovac came closer to the bed . " Please , Mrs. Hoxie , " he began , " may we come along with you ? We 'll do anything you say , Mrs. Hoxie . We 'd both feel so much better about it if you would let us  --  would n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . " Then hit 's all settled , folks , " Lou said , rising . " We 're a-fixin ' t ' leave soon atter breakfast  --  but we go slow . We hai n't got much of a cyar , an ' hit goes slow , kinda . So ya wo n't git thar as quick if ya tag along with us . " Slovac knelt beside the bed and took his wife 's hands . She gave him a faint smile , then he turned to Lou . " I want to apologize for the way I acted last night , Mrs. Hoxie . I guess I was n't very thoughtful . " Lou rose and looked down at Mrs. Slovac as she sat up in the wide bed . " Hit 's all fergot , " Lou said . " An ' now I got t ' go . M ' young ' uns 'll be wakin ' up any minute , an ' m ' husband 'll be a-waitin ' . " Slovac got up and walked to the door with her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes in the way he smiled . " We 'll be ready , Mrs. Hoxie , " he exclaimed , speaking as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders . " You do n't know Lou stepped out the door . Thad 's hound stood up and wagged his tail and sniffed at her dress . Lou looked at the sky ; the darkness had almost faded . " Yes , " she said . " I know  --  seems like I got a way o ' knowin ' P225THEY DROVE ALL DAY , and just as the sun was at four o'clock Slovac pulled up alongside Vigo and nodded over to the side of the road . " Guess we 'd better stop , " he yelled to Vigo . " She is not feeling well , Mr. Hoxie . " Slovac slowed down , and Vigo drove out ahead for several hundred yards and began to slow down . Lou leaned out and looked back along the road . " They stopped , Vigo , " she said . " I hope nothin 's th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yore signs ! " he muttered . " Hit 's been like this all day . Cai n't pass a fillin ' station er a tree er a bresh ' thout stoppin ' t ' let her get out . " " Now , Vigo ! " Lou said . " Hit 's near can'lelight , an ' hit 's time we stopped , anyhow . " Vigo still grumbled . " But I feel like I could drive all night , Lou . This-a way we 'll never git to Californy . We hai n't made a hundred mile today . " Thad , armed with his rifle , and Little Lonzo with an ax , wanderedout over the low hills and gathered dead branches of the low , nutty pinon and piled it high in the shelter of the two trailers . While the fire began to blaze , Addie Kate and Sarie Bell got out the frying pan and the makings of a meal . Vigo and Thad and Little Lonzo sat around the warm fire , and Lou , attending Mrs. Slovac , prepared a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly in the wide bed . Mr. Slovac stood beside the bed and looked down at the pale , swollen face of his wife . " Hit 's th ' ridin ' , Mister Slovac , " Lou said . " We 'll have t ' take hit easy for th ' rest o ' th ' way . Only a few hours a day , then a long night 's rest an ' plenty o ' sassafras tea an ' good victuals . Some women gets affected this way . Their ankles and their wrists and their face swells plumb to a strut . Best thing for hit is rest . "  | Slovac looked down at Lou , kneeling beside the bed , and his face was colorless , his eyes questioning . Lou shook her head to reassure him . " No , hit ai n't her time yet . Maybe two weeks , maybe more , if all goes well . . . . Now you go on out with Vigo an ' m ' young ' uns an ' jus ' set an ' smoke yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D'reckly I 'll fetch her supper . " Vigo was sitting on the running board of Thad 's car , his legs stretched forth toward the fire , dozing , his hands folded across his stomach , when Slovac walked through the flickering shadows toward the fire . Sarie Bell was squatting before the fire , holding the skillet steady as she balanced it over two stones . Slovac sat out of the firelight , with his back to Vigo 's trailer , and lit his pipe . Thad and Little Lonzo watched him light it , then smiled timidly at him and went on playing with the dog and the runt pig . Addie hate sat straight-legged in her ma 's rocker , and her arms were resting on the rocker arms as she watched Sarie Bell prepare to cook the meal . A car passed on the highway , and as it went by in a gush of wind the driver blew his horn two short blasts , and Vigo stirred , opened his eyes , and sat up . " Good evening , Mr. Hoxie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " Vigo replied , shifting his position a little . " Sorry if we 've delayed you any , Mr. Hoxie , " Slovac sighed . " You were very kind to take us under your care . " Vigo sniffed , rubbed his nose vigorously to hide his discomfort . " Oh , hit 's my wife you should thank , " Vigo grunted . " She 's a wonderful woman , " Slovac said . " She knows exactly what to do . Oriana  --  my wife  --  is much better already . " Vigo coughed uncomfortably . " Thought back there a way I was going to lose her , " Slovac added . " She did n't want to be left behind . She wants her baby to be born in California . " Lou closed the trailer door softly behind her and walked toward the fire . While Vigo sat sullenly on the running board , Lou fried cornpone in the skillet , kept the salt pork warm in a pie pan , set thecoffee boiling , and opened a quart jar of her home-canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Slovac said as Lou started toward thep227long silvery trailer with a hot plate of food and a cup of strong coffee . Lou smiled . " Never you mind , " she said , motioning him back . " You go on an ' eat your victuals , sich as they be . Jus ' do n't be dauncy about ' cm , that 's all , an ' I 'll take good keer o ' my patient . " Slovac went back and sat down , and Sarie Bell brought him a plate of food and a cup of coffee , then took her ma 's place and served her pa and Addie Kate and the boys . Vigo ate in silence , and presently Slovac got up and refilled his pipe . " Thanks again , Mr. Hoxie , " he said . " You do n't know how much I appreciate what you folks are doing for us . " Vigo nodded , but did not look up from the fire , and Slovac walked back through the shadows to the trailer . Presently Lou came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and sat in her rocker and slowly ate her dinner , looking at Vigo as he stared grimly into the fire . " Darlin ' , " she said presently . " Now what ? " Vigo grumbled . " Darlin ' Vigo , " Lou began , rising and walking across to where he sat . Putting her arm around him , she said , " Mister Slovac thinks you do n't want them to come with us , Vigo . " Vigo sniffed and rubbed his nose and looked into the fire . " Try an ' enjoy ' em a little more , darlin ' , " Lou pleaded with him . " Maybe they got a better trailer'n we ' uns , an ' maybe they 're outlandishfolks , but they 're right good , Vigo , an ' they 're in trouble an ' need a friend . " Vigo ran his fingers through his hair and scratched his head , sniffed and glanced sideways at her , then back to the fire . " I 'll try , Lou , " he mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached up and kissed him on the cheek . " Now that 's a good ' un , " she said with a sigh . " You hai n't been pertic'lar nice , Vigo , an ' that pore Mister Slovac is all wrought up over hit . He 's got enough troubles , Vigo so try an ' be nice t ' him . " Vigo nodded . " Please , Vigo . For my sake ? " " I will , Lou , " Vigo exclaimed , reluctantly .   Lou got up and went back to her rocker and looked at her children . " Now , honeys , " she said , " they 's somethin ' I want t ' say t ' you ' uns . " " Yes , Ma . " Addie Kate sighed as she sat down beside her ma and laid her head on her knees . Lou put her hand on the child 's head and stroked it as she looked across the fire at Little Lonzo , sitting beside Thad , and Sarie Bell , who was sitting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Darlin 's , " she went on , " when we gits t ' Californy , I wants you should go to school an ' 1'arn an ' grow up an ' have a good name  --  I been a-thinkin ' o ' my young ' uns all day . " The children gazed into the fire as their mother talked on . " Som'ers in my things I got my old Appleton reader an ' m ' bluebackspeller , an ' if hit war n't so late , we 'd have a lesson , darlin 's . I hate fer ya t ' miss a day o ' school . I reckon th ' thing I hated most about shuckin ' out'n Happy Holler was takin ' you young ' uns from old Miz ' Carithers . " She looked at Vigo . " Reckon they got good schools out in Californy , Vigo ? " Vigo nodded . " Better'n Happy Holler , Lou , " he said . " They do n't study-out , in Californy . They do n't holler their lesson , but reads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kinder like th ' old-fashioned way , Vigo . Th ' young ' uns Tarn their phon'ics th ' old way , a-spellin ' out an ' a pernouncin ' words like C-A-L , Cal ; I-F , if ; O-R-N , orn ; I-A , in , as in EE  --  Californy ' 95Vigo said , " Only we ' uns do n't say hit right , Lou . Should n't be with a EE ' on the end , like in bee , ' but a yuh ' on th ' end . " Lou laughed . " What I was a-tryin ' t ' explain , Vigo , " she said , " was that spellin ' out is a right good system . " " Oh , " Vigo said , yawning and unfolding his hands from his stomach . Lou motioned the children into the trailer , and without a word they filed by her one by one and kissed her good night , then went inside the trailer , leaving her alone with Vigo . " Hit 's a good fire , Lou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . " Hit warms th ' soles o ' my feet an ' makes me drowsy . "  |p229Lou  glanced back over her shoulder toward the Slovac trailer , and it was dark . " I hope she rests well , Vigo . I only hope she does . " Vigo coughed , and Lou knew there was something on his mind . " What is it , Vigo ? " He looked at her for a moment , then at the fire again . " Ya hai n't been out'n th ' Ozarks afore , Lou , " he began . " But atter ya been out as long as I have , ya 'll 1'arn not t ' go trustin ' ever ' Tom , Dick , an ' Harry . " " Meanin ' , Vigo ? " " I was a-thinkin ' more about that feller back in Amarillo , an ' ag'in , that feller las ' night , back in Hogan 's caravan . There you 1'arnt how folks rag an ' tag us folks from Arkansas , make fun o ' our talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure an ' simple . But ever-whutyou calls hit , Lou , it 's th ' first thing ya got t ' 1'arn about an ' look out fer . " Lou nodded . " I think I know , Vigo  --  " " I suppose ya git if know about human nature more out o ' th ' Ozarks than in ' em . My pa , back in Indiany , used t ' say that a man or a woman with a square chin was fair an ' square , an ' anybodywith a chisel chin , or no chin a-tall , was folks t ' watch out for an ' not to trust . Now , Lou , " Vigo explained , " I been skun more , . cheated an ' ruinated more by folks with square chins than by th ' same amount o ' folks with weak chins . So you got t ' learn about humannature by yore own self , I reckon . " " That feller back in Amarillo , Vigo , " Lou said , shaking her head sadly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ya 'll meet some mighty sorry folks outside th ' Ozarks , Lou , " Vigo said . " An ' in ' ern , too , I reckon , " Lou said , thinking of no one in particular . Vigo sniffed and rubbed his nose and glanced up at her quickly . " That raffle gun , Vigo , " she said . " Hit war n't loaded . " " Then you should-a chunked him one over th ' head with th ' raffle butt , " Vigo exclaimed . " I was actually skeer 'd , Vigo . Hit shore 1'ar n't me a lesson . " Vigo nodded . " Like I say , Lou . We ' uns is goin ' if meet up with a whole generation o ' folks what I would n't trust as fur as I could chunk that ' ere trailer . There 's folks ya 'll have t ' jew down , an ' folks that 'll try t ' make you think you 're a-gittin ' somethin ' fer nothin ' , " he said , jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a boy , " he went on . " I went into a carnival side show , an ' they was a big sign out in front that said , Th ' Greatest Truth on Earth  --  A Lesson from King Solomon , Only Twenty-five Cents . ' Well , sir , I paid my two bits an ' like a whole nation o ' other folks went right on in an ' got me a front seat right up thar . An ' what do you suppose hit was ? " Lou waited anxiously . " What was hit , Vigo ? " " Well , sir , " he said , " there on th ' stage set a big fat man  --  fattest I ever did see  --  an ' all about his feet was a pile o ' shavin 's where he 'd been whittlin ' an ' a-cuttin ' on a piece o ' pine wood with his jackknife . An ' you know what he kept on a-sayin ' , Lou ? " Lou shook her head . Vigo chuckled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' then say , Always whittle from you and you 'll never cut yourself , ' and he 'd whittle some more , and say hit ag'in . " Lou repeated it . " Always whittle from you and you 'll never cut yourself . " Vigo nodded . " While there 's a heap o ' 1'arnin ' in that old sayin ' , hit taught me somethin ' else too , Lou , and that was that thar hai n't nothin ' free in this world , not even th ' wisdom o ' King Solomon . Ya got t ' pay th ' price fer hit , I reckon . " Lou nodded . " Hit was a good lesson , Vigo , " she said . " An ' I 'll never disremember hit , Vigo darlin ' . " Vigo looked into the fire for a long time , then he said : " Lou , in th ' past , I reckon I hai n't been a very good husband , but now hit 's all changed . " Tears came to her eyes suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could only nod . " When I heerd you say , a little while ago , Lou , that you wanted yore young ' uns t ' get a education , I thought to myself that th ' richest man on earth hai n't got no calluses on his hands , no bent back from stoop labor , but he 's got two keen eyes , a mouth that knows when t ' keep shut an ' when t ' open , an ' a brain that 's beenP231trained t ' know when hit 's th ' right time t ' do somethin ' an ' when it 's th ' right time not t ' do hit . " Now , Lou , that 's what I want fer my young ' uns -- a chance't t ' get a good education out'n books , a chance't t ' use their brains as well as their backs . I want ' em t ' get more out'n life than me or you ever had , Lou , " he said , looking at her and smiling as the firelight danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' fer yoga , Lou , " he went on , his voice soft and whispering , " I want a nice home an ' all th ' comforts th ' other women I seen in my travels has had , an ' I want ya to be happy  --  not just satisfied with life , Lou . I reckon that 's all I want , Lou , " he added , " but hit 'll take a lot o ' scrapin ' an ' savin ' t ' do hit , but if we ' uns make up our minds , I reckon there hai n't nothin ' we cai n't do  --  me an ' you , honey  --  together . " Lou got up and ran to him and threw her arms around his neck and cried on his shoulder . Presently Vigo got up and picked up the end of a small round log that had burned out and tossed it onto the dying embers and watched the sparks go up with the smoke . " Come t ' bed , darlin ' , " Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou , " Vigo sighed , " you go an ' get some rest . I reckon I 'll jus ' set out hyar an ' think . Somehow , this talkin ' an ' lookin ' into th ' future has set me t ' thinkin ' , an ' they 's a whole lot I hai n't got thought out yet . " Lou paused in front of the door of her trailer and looked beyond into the darkness at the Slovacs . " I only hope she rests well , Vigo . I only hope she 's a-goin ' t ' be all right . " Vigo nodded . " She will , Lou , with you a-grannyin ' her young ' un . " Lou smiled . " Good night , darlin ' . " " Good night , Lou . " Vigo watched the log burn , and he wished that something there in the back of his mind would go away . It had come to him at some of the most peculiar times , at the most peculiar places . Maybe it was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree or at a cloud in the sky , or , again , it was just a little while ago when he had told Lou that he had n't been much of a husband up to now . It was Mamie , and that was plain to see . He tried to think that it was nothing but a lie , tried to forget about her , but what she had said that day when she had sneaked up through the thicket behind the barn kept ringing in his ears . " I 'll ha'nt you , Vigo  --  keep you awake nights , like you kept me . . . " He was n't superstitious  --  not like Lou and her uncle Yancey and all the native folks of the Ozarks ; but there Mamie was , haunting him again , and there was no denying that some things warned of often came true , and Mamie haunting him was one of those things . A rattle of the dry stones on the ground startled Vigo , and he looked up . There was Slovac , standing on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across at Vigo . Vigo wondered if he had been talking his thoughts aloud , and if he had , whether Slovac had heard him . " I hope yore missus is better , " Vigo said , nervously . Slovac stood there and nodded , drawing on his pipe and blowing the smoke along the pipestem . " She 's asleep now , " he murmured . " I 'd like to just sit and talk . There 's so much to look forward to . " Vigo moved over and made room for him to sit on the running board , facing the fire . He could n't seem to get Mamie out of his mind , even now . " They shore is , " Vigo replied . " They shore is. " 29THROUGH Holbrook and Winslow and high in the Arizona plateau the traffic increased and great double-length trucks , powered by loud and smoking Diesels , passed them on the road . Around the roadside stands and filling stations were clustered trucks , automobiles , and trailers of the westward-moving traffic . California wasp233only one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat close to him , her head on his shoulder , and was lulled by the steady hum of the motor . " Maybe we orb t ' stop som'ers , Vigo , " Lou cautioned him . " Miz ' Slovac might not feel up t ' drivin ' any longer than we 're used to . " The Slovacs were following them now . " Got to stop an ' git some gas anyhow , " Vigo said . " We 'll stop an ' talk hit over , whether t ' drive all night an ' reach Californy in th ' mawnin ' , or stop an ' git a good night 's rest . " " I think we 'd better stop an ' be fresh fer tomorry , Vigo , " Lou suggested . " Wisht I could drive all night , Lou , then Thad could take th ' wheel iri th ' mawnin ' an ' b'fore you know hit we 'd be in Californy . " " But thar 's th ' Slovacs t ' think of , Vigo . " Vigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Dang ' ern ! " " Now , Vigo ! " Lou scolded him . Vigo watched the road ahead . " Looks like a good place up thar , " he said . " Next place is Flagstaff . On th ' map hit shows Sixty-six takin ' a turn south to a town called Wickensburg , an ' then thar 's a highway goin ' north through Ash Fork an ' Kingman . Reckon we ert if stop an ' ask th ' best road , anyhows . " Vigo put his left hand out and signaled a slow-down to Slovac , then pulled into the gravel driveway of the filling station , stopped , and walked back to the Slovac car . " I 've got an idea , " Slovac said . " What do you say we all go insideand have a big dinner  --  on me ? I 'll foot the bill . Okey ? " Vigo nodded . " What about yore missus ? " he asked , looking at Mrs. Slovac . She smiled at Vigo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " And I 'd like a dill pickle . " Her husband laughed . " She gets th ' craziest ideas , Mr. Hoxie , " he said , cheerfully . " When a woman 's that way , they gits pecul'ar notions , " Vigo said wisely . Lou came back , and Mrs. Slovac got out , and they went to the rest room together . " Looks like a nice place , Mr. Hoxie , " Slovac said , looking at the filling station , the restaurant , and the grove of palm trees beyond it . " They have a trailer camp and cabins . Would n't want a better place to spend the night , would we ? " Vigo nodded . " Might as well , " he said . " Then git a good start to-morry  --  huh ? " " We 'll see how my wife feels , Mr. Hoxie . A good meal ought to fix her up . " Vigo and Slovac waited with Thad and Little Lonzo until the women came out together , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to warn him off . He put his hands to his face and felt the sudden feverish warmth of his cheeks just as Lou turned and looked at him . " What 's th ' matter , darlin ' ? " Startled , Vigo said , " I ort t ' shave . " Lou laughed . " Yore all right , darlin ' . Maybe if you washed yore hands an ' face . You ort t ' thought o ' that before , but we 'll wait , wo n't we , Mrs. Slovac ? " Vigo and Slovac , Thad and Little Lonzo walked across the gravel driveway to the men 's washroom . Vigo dipped his fingers into the water . It was cold , and he dabbed some of it on his face , then dried his face with a paper towel . While he was looking at himself in the mirror , the thought came to him of Mamie , who had rubbed his cheeks just like that in the dark , her fingers cool and soothing and smelling of the fragrance of pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a sudden weakness in his stomach . He thought , " I 'm jus ' hongry  --  jus ' hongry an ' nervous an ' fidgety ' cause we 're gittin ' so close to Californy . " But it was n't hunger or the nearness to California , although Vigo had a good appetite and he was anxious to get to where they were going . It was something else , something he could n't quite understand , something which made him almost afraid . He thought of going back to his car and driving off without going into the restaurant and eating . He pictured the lunch counter and the people sitting at it . Maybe Mamie and Judd were there , sitting at the counter . She would see him , and there would be a tense minute when neither spoke , and then he would have to speak to her and Judd and introduce them to the Slovacs . Lou would be watchingP235Vigo , and she would see the look on his face when Mamie came up to him . " Come on , Mr. Hoxie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ladies are waiting . " Vigo turned from the mirror and pushed open the door and looked around carefully outside before he stepped down on the gravel walk . It was only about four-thirty o'clock and full daylight , but Vigo expected to see shadows , expected to see her hiding somewhere in them , waiting to surprise him . He would enter the restaurant with his head down , he thought . Would n't look at a soul . If Mamie and Judd were in there he would not see them at all . Then , if Mamie came up to him suddenly , he would have a right to turn all kinds of different colors , and Lou would understand it and see that it was surprise on his face and nothing else . " What kept ya , Vigo ? " Lou laughed . Slovac laughed , too . " He was looking at himself in the mirror . Looked as though he 'd seen a ghost , " he joked . Lou smiled . " He 's gittin ' pertic'lar about his looks , now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shave , do n't ya , darlin ' ? " Lou said , putting her arm through his . Vigo nodded , glanced behind him at the grove of palm trees and the trailer camp and cabins there . Maybe Mamie and Judd were stopping at that trailer camp , he thought . They had probably pitched in with someone from Berryvilleand had come this far and were getting a good night 's rest beforedriving across into California tomorrow . Because of the Slovacs , he had n't made very good time on the road . If it had n't been for Mrs. Slovac , he would have been in California by now . With Thad helping with the driving while Vigo slept , they should have made it in three days and three nights of steady driving . This way , they had been on the road for five days . Lou touched his hand . " Why , darlin ' ! " she cried . " Yore hand 's as cold as ice , an ' you 're shaky all over ! " Vigo tried to smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks were cold and stiff , and they felt as though they were going to crack . His forehead felt hot , and his tongue was dry and thick .   " ' Tai n't nothin ' , Lou , " he said , hardly above a whisper . " Hit 's th ' long , t'arsome drive , honey , " Lou said . " Ya need arest . I been watchin ' ya , darlin ' , an ' you 're ' pearin ' t ' worry a gooddeal . " Vigo wanted to throw off that uneasiness he felt . " I 'm all right , Lou . Maybe I 'm hongry  --  jus ' hongry . " Little Lonzo came up and took his other hand . " I 'm hongry , too , Pa . " " An ' so 'm I , " said Addie Kate . " We 'll eat a big dinner , " said Slovac . " I want to show you my heart 's in the right place . The whole thing 's on me . " " Can I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should she , Mrs. Hoxie ? " Her husband turned to Lou . Lou nodded . " Th ' child ort t ' have ever-what she wants . " " See ? " said Mrs. Slovac happily . " Everybody wants dill pickleswhen they 're like me , " she laughed . " Here we are , " her husband said . Little Lonzo opened the door and held it for his ma . Vigo stood beside him while all the others entered . Then he touched Little Lonzo 's back . " G'wan in , son . " Little Lonzo looked up at his pa . " You look awful sick , Pa . Yore lips is blue an ' yore hands is cold an ' you got a piedy , hippoed look in yore eye . " Little Lonzo entered , and Vigo kept his eyes gazing at the floor ashe walked through the door and followed Little Lonzo 's footstepsuntil they stopped and Vigo saw the brown , varnished round leg of achair . They were all sitting at a long table over by a window . Vigochose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in the place . Sarie Bell looked at her pa . " You shore look like a dishrag , Pa . " " Leave yore pa alone , honey ! " Lou warned Sarie Bell . Mr. and Mrs. Slovac sat together and held hands as they lookedat Little Lonzo , then smiled at each other . " What 'll hit be , folks ? " Vigo said , trying to forget . Mrs. Slovac cupped her hand under her husband 's chin and patted his cheek with her fingers . " We want a boy , do n't we , Peter ? " she said.  |p237Lou  's face went crimson . In the Ozarks no boy is given a name like that , she thought . Thad looked at Mr. Slovac , grinned , then lowered his head . His ma , sitting across the table from him , touched his foot as a warning . Vigo grinned . " I was a-talkin ' about grub , " he said , looking up at the menu sign on the wall . " Hit says dinners , two dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised you a steak dinner , and that 's what it 's going to be , " he said . Lou shook her head . " Hit 's a awful lot o ' money . " " What do we care , eh , Mr. Hoxie ? " Slovac exclaimed . " We 'll be making lots of it before long , wo n't we ? " Vigo nodded . " Wonder how much  --  a couple dollars a day ? " Slovac grinned . " Are you serious ? It 's more like ten dollars a day . Back in Pitt I dragged down eight and ten in the steel mill . Would n't have left home if they had n't offered better than that , with a few extras thrown in . A man 's a fool to . Now they promised new houses and a decent place to live , plus good wages . That 's enough to make any man want to go to California . " The waitress came , and Slovac ordered steak dinners for everyone , plus a pickle for his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , " she smiled . Vigo gradually turned around and looked at everyone in the place . Two men in greasy work clothes were sitting beside two uniformedsoldiers at the counter . There were a dozen others , but no one Vigo recognized . " Going to California , folks ? " the waitress asked , writing on her pad . Vigo nodded . " We drove from Arkansas , " Addie Kate volunteered . The waitress looked down at her and smiled . " You did , honey ? " Addie Kate blushed and nodded . The waitress said , " There were some people came in here at noon from Arkansas . They were bound for California , too . " Vigo looked at his hands , folded on the edge of the table . " They was ? " Lou asked . The waitress nodded . " Jim put them up for the night in one of his cabins . You could find out who , if you just went to see Jim . He keeps a ledger with everyone 's name . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lou said , wistfully . Vigo thought Lou was looking at him , but he kept his gaze down . " That all , folks ? " the waitress asked . Vigo nodded , and she left the table . " Can we see who they are , Pa ? " Little Lonzo asked . " Shut up , son ! After we eat , we 're a-gonna drive on . " Hearing Vigo 's unceremonious decision , Mrs. Slovac glanced quickly at her husband , then at Lou . Lou and Mrs. Slovac began talking , but Vigo did n't hear them . Judd and Mamie were in one of those cabins . He knew it now . He had felt it awhile ago . Now he was certain . That was why he got cold and nervous , why he had felt her nearness , why he was afraid to come into the eating place . All of a sudden he had been given the power to feel her presence , and the thought of this worried him more than anything else . Mamie was bedeviled ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a road map , and he was looking at it . He was saying , " I 'd say we take the road to Clarksdale , Jerome , and Prescott , then across the border at Blythe , California . We ought to go straight to Los Angeles , because we want to see the Pacific Ocean first of all , do n't we , Oriana ? " Vigo heard that much , then he thought again of Mamie . At this very minute she and Judd might be heading for the restaurant . She was probably walking under the broad leaves of the palm trees by the side of her cabin now. " . . . beyond Blythe is the lower part of the Mojave Desert , " Slovac was saying . " There are n't many towns up through the centerof California , except along the coast . I 'd say that was the best way to go , would n't you , Mr. Hoxie ? " Vigo looked up from his hands . " What ? " " I said I think the coast route , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best road , do n't you ? We 've had enough plains and prairies and deserts . " Vigo nodded , then sighed and straightened up and unfolded his hands and ran his fingers along the edge of the table . Skip to My Lou 239 " Wonder if we ort t ' drive  --  th ' way Vigo 's a-lookin ' ? " Lou 's eyebrows were knit in worry . Vigo glanced up and saw that Mr. and Mrs. Slovac , Lou and Little Lonzo were gazing at him wonderingly . " I 'll be all right atter I 've et . " Slovac pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered one to Vigo . " Here . " Vigo took it , and Slovac struck a match for him . " Do n't smoke much , do you ? " Vigo held the cigarette awkwardly and blew a full mouthful of smoke across the table . " It calms some people 's nerves  --  smoking , " said Slovac . " I thought it would calm you down a little , Mr. Hoxie . You seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepped on it . " Wish folks would n't keep harpin ' on me , " he grunted . " I said I 'd be all right atter I 've et . " He showed his feelings too plainly . It was Mamie . She was making a fool of him . He hated her for it . He could kill her . " Well , here she comes , Pa , " Thad said . Vigo jumped up , startled , and glared at the woman approaching the table . Then he sat down with a grunt . It was only the waitress . The waitress placed the tray on a serving table and set the platefulsof steak before them , and all at once Vigo forgot Mamie . After the meal was finished , Vigo leaned back and patted his stomach . " Hit was good . " Slovac nodded and lit a cigarette . " Now what shall we do ? Drive on or stay in the cabins overnight ? " Lou looked inquiringly at Vigo , then at Mrs. Slovac . " How do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a ruddy glow on her cheeks , and her lips were red , her eyes clear . " Never saw her looking better , " Slovac boasted . " It 's for Mr. Hoxie to say . " Vigo cleared his throat , looked around the room quickly . " I say we drive until about nine o'clock , then stop an ' git a good night 's rest fer t'morry. "  | " It 's all right with me , " said Slovac , nodding to his wife . They rose , and Slovac paid the check . Outside , Vigo offered to pay for the gas for both cars , but Slovac pushed his hand away and gave the operator a new twenty-dollar bill . Vigo climbed quickly into the car , waited for Lou and the children , then shifted the gear and slowly released the clutch . As he drove past the little lane of palm trees bordering the rows of cabins , Vigo glanced down the driveway just as one of the cabin doors opened and a woman stepped outside on the stoop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was complete his car had passed the end of the driveway and the woman was hidden behind the broad green leaves of the palms . Lou moved over and put her arm through his . " Feelin ' better , darlin ' ? " she asked , nestling close and comfortablebeside him . Vigo nodded and sighed heavily . He felt better , much better , he decided . He was thinking of the woman in the doorway of the cabin . It could have been Mamie , but he could n't be quite sure . " I feel good now , Lou . " Vigo sighed , relaxing in the seat and resting his back against it . " I hai n't got that weak feelin ' in my belly any mores . " Lou laughed softly . " Ya look better , Vigo darlin '  --  since ya et that two-dollar steak LITTLE LONZO STOOD on his tiptoes and stretched his neck to see over his pa 's shoulders as they rolled down the hill and into the broad , fertile valley . In the center of the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with concrete flood-control gates which opened and irrigated the lands through which it flowed . The fields were checkered with the green and white of alfalfa andP241cotton . On the west bank of the river the abundant fields stretched upward to the white bleakness of the desert , shimmering in heat waves far beyond the river . " That 's Californy , Pa ! " Little Lonzo exclaimed . " Yes , son . " " Do n't go so fast , Vigo , " Lou warned . " I 'm only coastin ' , Lou . " " Th ' fields is green all around th ' river , Pa , " said Thad . " But th ' green do n't go very fur beyond th ' river , son , " said Lou , disappointed . " I 'd feel better if ya did n't go so fast , Vigo , " she added . Vigo put his hand out the left side of the car and waved back at the Slovacs , who answered with several short blasts of their automobilehorn . They had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They see hit , Pa , " said Sarie Bell . " They know hit , too . " Vigo nodded . " Yeah . They see hit 's Californy . " " Wonder if hit 's all desert an ' hard scrabble , Pa ? " Little Lonzo asked . " Hit do n't look so good from here , " Lou said . " Not much like home . " " No , son , " his pa replied . He was thinking . He had faith in that land ahead , even if Lou did n't . He had dreamed of it many nights as he lay awake thinking of the country at the end of Highway Sixtysix . Someday , after he had fulfilled his work contract in Richmond , he would go out and buy him a piece of that land . It would n't be like it was a few years ago . Today it was different . A totally differentday and time . He had heard many people say that times had changed all of a sudden . Now they wanted people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filling-station operator had told Vigo not to take a job as a field hand . " Farm help 's hard t ' get , now-day , " he said to Vigo . " There was a rancher in El Centro or a few miles east of there who had three Mexican laborers on his place . The government imported ' em . But when a farmer next door offered them five dollars a day , their board and found , and a bottle of whisky , the Mexicans quit the first farmer and went to work for the second farmer . So the first farmer got his242 shotgun and killed the second farmer for stealing his Mexican farm hands . " The filling-station operator said any man could get any job he wanted now-day . The thing to do was to hold out for the best job , the best wages . " Sure been a change in everything , " said the filling-station man , shaking his head wonderingly . " I remember the time " The man shook his head again but did n't finish what he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now they 've even got a reception committee waiting for you at the California border line ! " " A what ? " Vigo had asked . " A reception committee . " What was that ? " Why , they 've got a man stationed at the state line who asks you what kind of work you want , and he gives you a list of places where you can get it and how much they pay . Practically kidnaps you , he does . " Vigo did n't believe it . " You 'll see . You 'll see for yourself . But do n't let him sell you on th ' idea of workin ' on none of them farms , stoop labor at pickin ' celery or lettuce or chopping cotton ! " Vigo and Slovac explained that they both had work contracts for Richmond . The filling-station man laughed . " Do n't mean a thing . They need men so bad in California right now , they do n't mind doing a little labor piracy now and then . " " Doin ' what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man explained . " Like that farmer who took them two Mexicans from the other one . " " Oh ! " Vigo said . So there was the reception committee down there by the side of the road right now . Vigo looked ahead and saw a sentry box beside the road . A man was walking out into the center of the road . He stood behind a big sign that said , " Stop . " Off to the right of the road was another sign which said , " California Welcomes You . Information about War Industries furnished Free . " sp243Vigo had explained about the reception committee to Lou . Lou nodded . " Now do n't let him change yore mind , Vigo . " Vigo laughed . " I 'll have some fun . " Thad 's sharp eyes caught sight of a California Highway Patrol officer standing beside his motorcycle behind the little striped buildingby the side of the road . " They 's two of ' em , Pa . " " I seed ' em . " " One 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know hit . " " Now be keerful , Vigo , " Lou warned . " Do n't let him talk you into breakin ' yore contract . " Vigo only said , " Watch me have some fun  --  I 'm gon na git even . " As they slowed for the stop sign , Lou wondered what he meant when he said that . Get even for what ? she wondered . You said that when you had a chance to repay someone for some evil deed done before , something which you could n't forget and had to repay , like being cheated in a game , or being teased when you were a little young one and unable to get back at the person who teased you . Lou remembered she had said that . " Jus ' wait , I 'm gon na get even , " she had promised . But when the time came , she could n't do it . And now she wondered why it was that Vigo wanted to get even , and for what . For all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket to show for his hard work in the sun ? How could he get even with this man for that ? Was this man at the state line someone who represented something Vigo had sworn to get even with at some future time ? Some person or group of persons , maybe ? Lou tried to understand the meaning of it , but the answer would n't come , even as she glanced at Vigo , saw the way his eyes were squinted and the way his tongue was curled up between his front teeth and the way he bit it with testy little movementsof his jaws . He stopped at the sign , and the man came out toward the car . He was carrying a small wooden board , and on the board was clipped a sheet of paper upon which he made a mark when he observed the number of persons in the car .   " Good morning , " he said , politely . " Mawnin ' , " Vigo nodded . The highway patrolman in the shiny boots walked over from the sentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to the other fellow : " From Arkansas . " To Vigo he nodded and said , " Good morning . " Vigo nodded to the officer . " How far you going , sir ? " asked the man in the wide-brimmed hat . " Into Californy , " Vigo replied . " You intend to work ? " Vigo said , " Yep . " The policeman came closer . " He 's gon na give you some free information . He 's a spotter for the war plants of California . " Vigo asked , " A what ? " " The patrolman calls me a spotter , " said the man in the widebrimmedhat . " I suppose that 's what you 'd call me . " The patrolman laughed . " He spots workers . Finds out what they can do and tells them where to go to find work . " " That 's right , " said the spotter . " You got any special skills , sir ? " he asked , glancing at his paper and getting his pencil poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenterin ' a special skill , " said Vigo . " Ever do any rigging ? " " Any what ? " " Rigging . You know , building scaffolds and the like . " " Built a scaffold once't t ' paint a barn . " The patrolman laughed . " Ever do any mechanical work , machine-tooling , lathe operat-ing . " Vigo shook his head . " My eldest boy 's purty good as a mechanic . " " How old is he ? " " Goin ' past seventeen . " " Can you do anything besides carpenter work ? " " I can drive a car . " " If he can drive a car , he can drive a truck , " the highway patrolmanvolunteered .   " That 's right , " said Vigo . " How 'd you like to work in San Diego ? " the spotter asked . " That 'd suit me fine , " Vigo replied . Lou nudged him . " Vigo ! " " Ever work in an airplane factory ? " " Nope , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'd like hit right well . " Vigo was grinning . Lou nudged him again a little harder . " Think you could operate a small tractor , hauling finished planes off the assembly line and out into the landing strip for a trial flight ? " " I shore could , mister , " Vigo said . " I driv ' a tractor one summer , haulin ' hay from th ' fields to a barn . Got a dollar a day an ' m ' keep . " " How 'd you like to earn ten dollars a day driving a tractor ? " " That 's shore a lot o ' money . " Lou placed her hand on Vigo 's arm . " Vigo darlin ' . " Vigo looked at her and smiled . " You could drive a tractor , or build crates , I suppose . Which of those two jobs would you like the best ? Driving a tractor  --  or buildingcrates in which to ship plane parts ? " Vigo shrugged . " Either one , mister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A-drivin ' a tractor , you 're a-settin ' down all day . A-buildin ' crates , you 're a-standin ' up an ' sawin ' an ' swingin ' yore hammer arm . " The patrolman covered his mouth and chuckled . " That 's right , sir , " said the spotter , with a grin . " Would you rather sit down and work , then ? " " I 'd just as soon . " " All right , " said the spotter . " Then I suppose that 's the job for you . In case you decided to change , you could always go back to carpentering . Now could n't you ? " Vigo nodded . " I reckon I could . " " And now , son , " the spotter said , walking a couple of steps back and speaking to Thad . " You say you 're past seventeen . " " I shore is , " said Thad .   " Good mechanic , huh ? " " Yes siree . " " Is this your car ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit . " " I see . Ever take it apart and put it back together again ? " Thad laughed . " Yes siree . I bought hit an ' right off I tore hitdown an ' polished all them parts an ' then put hit back t'gether . " " You know auto parts pretty well , then ? " " I growed up with this hyar cyar . Know ever ' nut , bolt , cotter key , an ' wire in ' er . I c 'd tear her down an ' put her t'gether ag'in with m ' han 's tied b'hind me ! " The highway patrolman laughed . The spotter laughed weakly because he was annoyed at the patrolman . Vigo laughed , too . " ' T is th ' Gawd 's truth , mister , " said Thad . " I believe you , son , " said the spotter . " Now how 'd you like to work on real motors  --  airplane motors ? " " I 'd like thet right well , " said Thad . Lou turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Thad Hoxie ! " " But I would , Ma , " said Thad . " Hit ai n't no lie . " " Please , madam , " begged the spotter , " but if you do n't mind Lou said , " I 'm beggin ' yore pardon , mister . " The spotter nodded seriously . " It 's quite all right . " He turned to Thad again . " So you 'd like that , huh ? " " Like what ? " The highway patrolman snickered . " Like working on airplane motors , of course , " said the spotter , a little out of patience now . " I said shore . Shore I would , mister , " Thad replied . " Ever earned ninety cents an hour ? " he asked Thad . " How much ? " " Ninety cents an hour . " " Mister , " said Thad , solemnly , " I worked a whole week a-haulin ' ax handles fer a dollar a day . I ai n't never made ninety cents a hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . The Consolidated plant needsP247bright young men like you . You 'll be taught a trade . How 'd you like to learn a trade , a regular skill that would stand you in good stead for the rest of your life and assure you of an income comparableto that of the professions ? " " What 's that ya say ? " asked Thad . " I said Oh , never mind . How 'd you like to learn to be anairplane mechanic ? It 's the coming thing , you know . " " That 'd suit me fine , " said Thad . Vigo turned around in the scat and tapped the spotter on the shoulder . " Look , mister , " he said , " I wisht ya 'd hurry up an ' git this over with . Hit 's awful hot , a-settin ' hyar in th ' sun . We come a long ways . All th ' way from Arkansas . An '  --  an ' " I know , sir , " the spotter said . " But it is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of California , and to give information as to where they can get jobs most suited to their particularskills . Now " Look , mister , " Vigo said , tapping him on the shoulder again , " why did n't ya say so in th ' first place ? " The spotter raised his eyebrows , and his mouth fell open . " But I did , sir . I  --  I  --  I " Did n't hear ya , mister . ' F I did , hit did n't sink in . That 's why I retched back jus ' now an ' give ya a tap on th ' shoulder . " " But it wo n't take but a minute . There are a few more questions I 'd like to ask your son . " " But hurry it up , mister , " Vigo said . " We got a long drive ahead o ' us . We 're a-goin ' all th ' way t ' Richmond . " " You 're what ! " the spotter exclaimed , falling back a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways t ' go yit . We 're a-goin ' all th ' way t ' Richmond . " " You mean to Richmond , California ? " " That 's right , mister . " " You  --  you  --  you have a job in Richmond , you mean ? " the spotterexclaimed , stammering and turning a little pale . Vigo nodded . " That 's right , mister . An ' them folks in that trailer back of us  --  they 's a-goin ' t ' Richmond , too , so you 'll save time not t ' stop ' em . " The policeman laughed at the spotter , who pushed his widebrimmedhat back and wiped the sweat with a bandana .   " God , man ! Why did n't you say so ! " Vigo laughed . " But you did n't ask hit , mister . " The spotter was licked . " Aw , forget it ! " Lou looked at Vigo and shook her head scornfully . " Hit was a mean trick , Vigo . You did n't have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou , " Vigo whispered with satisfaction . " Gittin ' even fer what ? " Vigo shrugged . " Just gittin ' even , " he said . " It war a unkind thing to do , " Lou said , watching the grin fade from Vigo 's face . Sometimes she could n't understand him , she thought . First there were his actions toward the Slovacs when they left the caravan and came with them . For no good reason Vigo was sulky and silent all during the first day 's journey with them . Then last night , back at the restaurant , when he suddenly announced his decision to drive on toward the desert , knowing Mrs. Slovac would suffer after riding so long . And now , making that poor man stand in the hot sun and go into all those questions when all the time Vigo was intending to announce they were going to Richmond . Something had come over Vigo ; something which made him moody , pouty , and cross , made him almost appear to find pleasure in making others miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at the road ahead , Vigo had sat without saying a word , and often when she spoke to him he appeared not to have heard her and left her questions unanswered . Then when she had reminded him of it he had become cross , like a spoiled young one . Lou tried to believe that this change in him was caused by his anxiety , his eagerness to get where they were going in a hurry , but it was more than that . He had hardly spoken to the children , and not once had he come to her in his sly way , whispering and playful and tender . That he was neglecting her never seemed to occur to him , for it appeared to her that he was being that way on purpose and for a reason she could not understand . Ever since thatxtight he had walked up the hill , carrying the can of gas and complaining about his back , he had paid little attention to her in that way . Compared to the way he had been before , this was unusual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a mind to . P249Vigo started the motor and drove out of the green valley of alfalfaand cotton and up into the glaring whiteness of the desert which extended on both sides to pale blue peaks of mountains far away . On a long stretch of the road which rose gradually toward sharp , steep hills ahead of them , Slovac signaled with his horn , and Vigo turned to Lou with a frown . " Now , what ? " " It 's her ag'in , " Lou said . " I better go back an ' see . " Vigo pulled up and stopped with his right wheels off the pavement , and Lou hopped out of the car and walked back to the Slovacmachine . Mrs. Slovac was sitting beside her husband , and her head was leaning back against the top of the seat cushion and her eyes were closed . He was nervous and afraid . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hoxie . She seems to be in pain . " Lou opened the door of the car and reached in and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cool . Then she placed her other hand below her eye , pulled Mrs. Slovac 's eyelid open and saw that her eyeballs were turned back and glassy . Lou shook her head uncertainly . " She 's in pain , all right . We ort t ' take her out an ' lay her down fer a spell till th ' pain stops . Hit could be only her kidneys , from ridin ' . " Slovac 's lips were thin , and he was perspiring freely . " You do n't think ? " he started to ask . " Now , now , there , there , " Lou said , trying to be soothing . " Hit ai n't no use t ' worry , son . Likely , hit 's only th ' first o ' th ' false labor signs  --  could n't be nothin ' more , I  --  I  --  do n't think , " Lou added , cautiously . Lou stepped back . " We ort t ' pull off'n th ' highway an ' park so we c'n git her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tell Vigo . " She ran back quickly to Vigo . " We got to pull off'n th ' road , Vigo , " Lou said , firmly . " I think her time is come . " Vigo 's tongue came between his teeth , and his jaws went up and down on it . " Dammit , Lou  --  not right out hyar in th ' middle o ' th ' desert ! "   Lou looked at him fiercely , her eyes narrowed . " Vigo , " she said , " when hit 's time fer a young ' un t ' come , hit do n't make no never mind whuther hit 's sleet or snow , sunshiny or rain , or out in th ' middle o ' th ' desert ! Now you pull off'n this hyar road an ' git over thar an ' park  --  or clang it , Vigo , you c'n go on ' thout me if you want to ! " She turned and ran back to the Slovac car , got in beside Oriana and took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now ya c'n drive off'n th ' road an ' out by that clump of brushes , son . Now take hit easy , son ! Try an ' not t ' jar her unduly . " Slovac , his lips pale and the perspiration popping out on his forehead and dripping off his jaws onto his white shirt , started the car and drove off the road carefully and onto the hard crust of the desert . Ahead , Vigo was pulling off the road while Thad stood in the hard scrabble , showing his pa where to drive . While Vigo and Thad and Little Lonzo looked on , Lou and her daughters and Mr. Slovac lifted Mrs. Slovac out of the front seat and carried her back and laid her on the wide bed in the trailer . Then Lou told them all to leave , and she closed the door and pulled down the little roller shades at the trailer windows . Presently she came out of the trailer rubbing her hands and shaking her head . Slovac came up to her quickly and stood for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ya ort not t ' stand out in th ' sun ' thout no hat , " Lou said , speaking to everyone except Vigo , whose battered dark felt hat was pulled down over his eyes . Slovac swallowed . " How  --  is  --  s-she ? " Lou shook her head . " Hai n't her time . " Then to her young ones she said , " Now go on back to our cyar , honeys  --  they 's some things I got t ' tell Mister Slovac hyar . " After the children and Vigo were gone , Loy said , " Hit 's jus ' like I thought  --  a false labor pain , son . Hit 's nothin ' t ' git all het up about . Happens all th ' time . She 's normal , an ' she 's havin ' a right easy time of hit now . " Slovac rubbed his hands , put them in his pockets , fingered a package of cigarettes , then put them back and rubbed his hands again . " Hit 's nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured him . " Onlyp251I think she ort t ' ride layin ' down , an ' with me a-lookin ' atter her needments , if ya do n't mind . " Slovac nodded . " Anything you say , Mrs. Hoxie . You just say it . Maybe we ought to take her to a hospital . " Lou shook her head . " She wants to wait until she gets thar , son , " Lou explained . " I jus ' talked to her about thet , an ' she said she wants t ' hold out till we all gits t ' whar we 're a-goin ' , where her child can be born in a regular home . She 's lookin ' forward to thet new home , son . " " All right . " " I 'll go tell Vigo , " Lou said . " Then I 'll come back an ' git in yore trailer an ' ride with her . " Lou walked across the white , glaring hard ground to where Vigo was leaning against the side of the trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , Vigo said , " Tell him he can ride in th ' trailer , too . Thad can drive his car just as well " We better stick t ' th ' roads where they 's th ' most towns , Vigo , " Lou suggested . " I 'd hate t ' git caught out on a Gawd-forsaken place like this with her when her time comes . " Lou walked back to the Slovac trailer , then came back again . " He says for Thad to drive his car , Vigo . " Thad turned a little pale , then grinned and climbed out of the back seat . " Can I come , too , Thad ? " Little Lonzo asked . " Ask Ma . " " Can I , Ma ? " Lou nodded . " Hit 's all right , son , only do n't bother yore big brother . He 'll have his hands full , a-drivin ' that big cyar all by his-self . " " Now if ya want me t ' stop , Thad , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long toot on that horn . " " I will , Pa , " the boy replied , taking a long breath and letting it out again . " Now do n't be nervous , son , " Lou said . " I reckon drivin ' one car is jus ' like drivin " ary other one . " Thad and Little Lonzo walked ahead of her , and soon both trail- ers were back on the road , driving through the sand plains spotted with tawny cactus and on toward the pass which lay between the San Jacinto and San Gorgonio . Up the steep road to the pass , through its windy passage , and down the winding slope of the highwayand into the green valley , checkered with grain fields and citrus groves . The low , rounded hills below the pass were covered with waving golden fields of poppies and bright masses of blue lupin and wild yellow mustard , and beyond the small white farmhouses which were surrounded by great flocks of white leghorns , the road began to widen and road signs gave the mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her husband and set her jaws as she watched Vigo 's trailer climb the ramp and ride up i toward the sky on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge . Her husbanddropped his hand from the steering wheel and clasped his wife 's in his and squeezed it a little . " Hold on , darling , " he whispered . She sat quietly looking at the rising height of the bridge . The sun was rising over the bay , and it cast long shadows down the side of the hill and over the roofs of the houses and buildings of Oakland and Alameda and made a shimmering silver path across the water toward the bridge . Vigo looked at the sparkling light across the water , then glanced at Lou , whose head was leaning sidewayson the back of the seat where she was slumped over , asleep . She had slept for hours that way even during the brief stop when Vigo had asked a highway patrolman directions as they entered San Francisco . The streets were empty except for the early Sunday morning milk trucks whose grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , row upon row on the avenue which led to the heart of the city . " Shipyards ? Sure . Just keep to the right on this street as far asp253Harrison Street , turn right five or six blocks and you 'll see the approach to the bridge . Across the bridge is Oakland . Turn left just over the bridge . You ca n't miss Richmond . You 'll see a big arched sign over the road . . . " Vigo wanted to ask more questions , but the sun was just coming up , and he wanted Lou and the children to rest as long as they could , because there would be a busy time ahead , moving their things into the new home , getting their new place " red up . " It was Sunday morning , and there was plenty of time for rest . Over the high and rolling rise of the bridge , shining in silvery light , its high steel uprights towering hundreds of feet above the bay , drove Vigo . Then he let the motor coast down the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island which acts as an anchor in the middle of the bay for the two parts of the bridge . " To the left , " the patrolman had said , so Vigo looked out across the bay to the dark horizon far off to the left , and he saw the tiny reflections of the sun in the windows of the houses which snuggled close to the side of the many hills across the bay . " . . . You 'll see an oil refinery . That 's Richmond , " the policemanhad added . There were the storage tanks , big and round and also gleaming silvery on the far hills . His gaze wandered back toward the low , flat land along the far shore of the bay , but just then the view becameobscured with the sudden decline of the bridge deck as the car approached the shiny whiteness of the porcelain-tiled tunnel . Driving through the tunnel and hearing the reverberating roar of the two motors in it , Vigo glanced again at Lou . Her head had sunk a little lower on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly on her head with the chin tie pulling tight at her cheeks . Might as well let her sleep on , he thought . Then he remembered what Thad had said last night when Vigo figured that they should be arriving in Richmond just before dawn . " Be shore an ' wake me up , Pa , when we git in sight o ' Richmond . I would n't miss that sight fer nothin ' in th ' world . " And Lou had smiled and said , " Do n't know how I 'll act in m ' new home . I hope hit 's purty , an ' I hope hit 's white an ' clean , Vigo . " Then Vigo had told her about the things California Bartlett had said back in the talk meeting in Berryville . He told how he had stumbled up the steps onto the stage of the auditorium , where the high school gave " literaries " and singing contests and spelling bees and box socials . " Your name , sir ? " California Bartlett had asked Vigo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-eight . " " Occupation ? " " Farmer . " " Any special skills ? " " What you mean ? " California Bartlett had looked at him patiently and smiled . " Can you do anything else besides farming ? " " Shore can . I can carpenter . Drive a team . Drill a hole , tamp my shot , shoot down m ' coal an ' load hit . " California Bartlett shook his head and said , " We do n't need coal miners , " to Vigo , and to his secretary he had said , " Put him down as a carpenter . " " Now , Mister Hoxie , can you write your name ? " That angered Vigo . " Hell , yes , mister ! " " Sorry . So many here today ca n't . Just sign your name right here . " Vigo had signed , and in his temporary anger he had almost forgotten to ask the one question which was on his mind . " One question , mister , " he had said . " You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house  --  now whut exactly does they mean ? Hit do n't mean they 'll furnish hit like ya do when ya put in a table an ' chairs , does hit ? " California Bartlett was all very patient . He shook his head . " Now , " he explained , " it is n't exactly the shipyard management 's place to give you a house , Mr. Hoxie . The housing authority of Richmond will do that . " He gave Vigo the money and wanted him to move on , but Vigo wanted to get it all very clear in his mind . " Hit 's mos'ly about th ' house , I 'm consarned , Mister Californy Bartlett , " Vigo had explained . " Ya see , we always lived in a of dog-P255trot house  --  a log cabin , you might say . Hai n't never lived in anythin ' else hyar . If I decide to take m ' wife and young ' uns  --  I always been promisin ' my wife a nice white house t ' live in , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . I see . Well , you can rest at ease , Mr. Hoxie . Now move along , please . We have to hurry . There 's more men waiting . " So that was what he had told Lou last night as they talked about it , and that was what was running through his mind now as he drove out of the tunnel , up the gradual rise of the bridge again where he could get a good view of the rest of the bay , the hills behindOakland and Berkeley , straight ahead , over the low , flat land of Richmond far off to the left , across the calm , smooth water where the rising sun was just beginning to penetrate the blue-gray haze . Going down the long decline toward the toll plaza , Vigo wonderedwhy he could n't see the houses of Richmond and the shipyards , but at last he decided they were obscured by the blue-gray haze which appeared to hover over the far end of the Bay of San Pablo . As he drove through the toll plaza he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Vigo 's twenty-five cents , Vigo asked him quietly , so as not to awaken Lou , the way to Richmond . The man pointed back beyond him , looked at Lou as she slept , and nodded and said nothing more . Through the toll gate Vigo held out his left hand in a signal to Slovac that they would take the insideturn to the left , then along the bay . The sun now was high over the hills and directly behind Vigo after he turned under the ramp and came out at last on the straight hard-surfaced road which bordered the bay . To his left the dark water lapped along the shore , washing driftwood high upon the beach , and from the surface of the water came little clouds of vapor which rose to a low-hanging bank of fog hovering not more than ten feet over the dark water . To his right were the willows and coniferswhich bordered the highway , and above and far beyond them Vigo saw the blue-black hills of Berkeley , dotted with white houses and dark roofs . Vigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old car lurched forward with a sudden burst of speed .   Ahead , not more than three or four miles on that smooth , broad highway , lay Richmond . Lou AWAKENED , pushed her bonnet back on her forehead , and blinked just as Vigo came to the intersection where the highway joined the avenue that ran beneath the great arched sign which had on it , in big white letters , " RICHMOND . " Lou sat up quickly and rubbed her eyes . " Vigo ! Vigo darlin ' ! " Vigo laughed and reached over and put his hand on her knee and gripped it firmly . " Vigo  --  am I a-dreamin ' ? " Vigo laughed again and threw his right arm around her shoulderand drew her over to him in a sudden , uncontrollable show of happiness . " That 's hit , Lou , " he said , calmly . " That ' ere sign p'ints th ' way t ' yore new home in Californy ! " Lou 's face went colorless for an instant , then deepened with excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the arched sign over the street . " Oh , glory ! " Vigo slowed down . " I 'm hongry , Lou . " She looked at him in wonderment . " How can ya be hongry , Vido , at a time like this ? Let 's hurry . I want t ' look an ' see m ' new home , Vigo . " Vigo shook his head . " I 'm still hongry , Lou . They 's plenty o ' time , Lou . This is Sunday mawnin ' , an ' hit 's too early fer them folks  --  an ' b'sides , I promised t ' show Thad th ' first sight o ' Rich-mond . " " All right , Vigo . Stop an ' we 'll wake up th ' young ' uns and She caught her breath and clapped her hand over her mouth . " My Gawd , Vigo ! I disremembered pore Miz ' Slovac ! " P257Vigo grumbled , " She 's all right . They promised t ' honk at us if anythin ' went wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he hai n't honked at us once't . " " Stop , Vigo  --  stop right hyar ! " Lou exclaimed , excited . Vigo pulled over at the curb and stopped , threw his leg over the gear-shift lever , and slid out after Lou . While Lou ran back to the Slovac trailer , Vigo unwound the baling wire that held the door shut and stepped into the trailer . Thad and Little Lonzo were lying in the lower bunk with their arms about each other , and Sarie Bell and Addie Kate were in the upper bunk , and Sarie Bell 's bare foot was sticking out of the covers . Vigo touched Thad 's shoulder , and he jumped up , fully clothed , just as he had gone to bed last night , and ran past his pa and out of the door of the trailer . " Thar she is , Pa ! " he yelled , pointing toward the sign . " We 're hyar , by Gawd ! " Lou came up behind Thad and touched his shoulder . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ya a-talkin ' that-a way . You hai n't no man , yit . " " Aw , Ma ! " Thad whined , glancing at his pa . Vigo winked at Thad , and Thad said , " If I 'm old enough t ' do a man 's work , Ma , I 'm old enough t ' talk like a man . " Vigo laughed and came out of the trailer and put his arm around Thad 's shoulder . " Lea'n th ' boy alone , Ma . He ai n't liable fer whut he 's a-sayin ' . I reckon we ' uns is all so excited , hit 's a wonder we got any sense . " Mr. and Mrs. Slovac walked up presently , and he said to Vigo , " Well , what do you think of it , Mr. Hoxie ? " Vigo turned and looked at the sign . " Hit looks mighty good . " Slovac looked out across the fiat land beside the bay and saw the low-hanging fog which obscured the land . " I see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . I won-der Vigo interrupted him . " I 'm hongry . Let 's all go an ' git some breakfast , first  --  afore we do anythin ' . " He turned around and saw a long , low dark red diner across the street . An orange neon sign was glowing in the steamy window , 258 and cars were parked at the curb in front of it . For the first time , Vigo noticed the street , and it was full of cars parked diagonally at the curb , and there were men and women in work clothes walkingalong the street and going into the restaurants and stores . It did n't look much like Sunday morning here , Vigo thought . They crossed the street together , and as Vigo and Lou waited for the children to enter the door of the diner , Lou turned to him and said , " Ya know , Vigo , I 'm right chilly . Hit 's cold , like a day in fall back home . " Vigo smiled . " Th ' sun is shinin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills of Berkeley . Lou was looking toward Richmond , in the opposite direction . " But hit 's rnislin ' weather over thar , " she said.  |p258Vigo  sniffed at the foggy air and announced , " I like hit , Lou . I reckon I 'm gon na like hit hyar right well . " Lou shook her head uncertainly as she glanced back over her shoulder at the fog bank , now glistening opalescent in the sunligtht and hiding whatever lay beneath it around the water 's edge and the low , flat headlands of the bay . Vigo stepped inside the steamy heat of the restaurant , which had one long counter down the length of it and booths back along the windows facing the street . The counter was about half full of workmenin shiny tin hats and women who wore blue denim overalls , with kerchiefs over their hair and black smudges on their faces . At the end of the counter sat two sailors , one with his head in his arms on the top of the counter . A waitress in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailor with her hands propped against her hips , and she was shaking her head . " Out  --  cold as a chisel ! " she said . " Give ' im some black coffee , " one of the women in overalls said . " Poor boy , he 's probably celebrating his first liberty ashore in a long , long time . " Vigo looked at the opposite end of the counter , and there sat a man dressed in faded blue overalls , thin at the knees , a black felt hat . In addition he wore a sheepskin coat . He was just finishing his breakfast . While the others took the long line of empty seats at the counter , P259Vigo sat down absently and breathed the smell of frying grease and boiling coffee . The waitress , her maroon dress pulled tightly across her bosom and her broad hips bouncing as she walked , passed before Vigo and stopped in front of the man sitting beside him and gave him a check which she tore from a small green pad hooked at the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said , raising his voice . " You can read , ca n't ya ? " the waitress growled . " Yimminy , but that 's high ! " the man said . Vigo glanced sideways at him , then at the waitress . She was standing with her hands on her hips , her lower lip sticking out as she looked down at the man . " I do n't care , " she said . " You ate it , an ' now ya can pay for it ! " The man stood up and fumbled in his pocket and took out a small black leather snap purse and opened it . " It ai n't right , " he protested , in a high and whining voice . " I yust had toast and scalded milk and cheese . Yesus Christ , it ai n't right ! " Vigo recognized the man 's talk . He had heard men who talked like that in Nebraska and South Dakota and Minnesota . Swedes . That 's what this fellow was . A Swede . " Come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding her hand out . The Swede took two half dollars from his snap purse , and he had a long face as he handed them to her . " And three cents tax , buddy ! " the waitress added . " Do n't forgetth ' sales tax  --  gim me three more of them rusty pennies you got ' way down in that purse ! " The Swede grumbled and counted out three pennies and slapped them beneath the palm of his hand on the counter . Then he turned and walked out the door . The door slammed . " God-damned Swedes , " the waitress said , speaking to no one in particular . " Ever since they came , they been growlin ' and gripin ' about everything . But they use our john . Dozens of ' em at a time . They shave in it , wash their dirty old drawers in it , and then they raise hell if we charge ' em a decent price for food . Never seen a Swede in my life that was worth a Goddam ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash register beside the doublecoffee urn , and turned and looked at Vigo . " What 'll you have ! " she demanded , snarling at Vigo . Vigo glanced quickly at the signs nailed to the wall behind the polished glasses , the bubbling beer signs and the coffee urns . " We 'll jus ' have a cup o ' coffee , some milk an ' cawn-meal mush , ma'am , " Lou said . The waitress looked at Lou , then at Vigo , then at Thad and LittleLonzo and the girls . " You all together ? " she asked . Slovac , sitting at the far end of the seats , said , " Yes . We 're all together  --  eight of us . " " My God ! " the waitress exclaimed . Then she turned to Lou . " Ai n't got no corn-meal mush , madam . We do n't serve it for breakfast , and how many times have I got to tell you ? We do n't serve corn bread or corn-meal mush for breakfast ! Jesus Christ , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred million times in the last two weeks ! " A sailor at the far end of the counter laughed . " Shut up , you damned souse ! " Then she turned back at Lou , took her pencil from behind her ear and unsnapped the little green ' pad from the side of her apron . " I can give you ham and eggs , bacon and eggs , toast , coffee , orange juice Little Lonzo said , " I do n't want no orange juice , Ma . " " All right , Lonzo , " Lou said , thinking . " Hit makes me think o ' castor oil , Ma , " Little Lonzo added . " All right , son , " his ma replied . " Gim me some " Vigo started to say as he bit his tongue a little . But the waitress interrupted : " What about your wife and kids ? " Lou said meekly , " I 'll take toast and coffee , ma'am . " " And what about these kids ? " Lou looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was thinking , the waitress said , " We have oatmeal . But we have n't got no damned corn-meal mush  --  mush , mush , mush ! Never seen so many damned hillbillies eat so damned much mush in all my life ! My God , do n't you ever eat meat and eggs ! " P261Lou looked quickly at Vigo , then down at her hands , folded on the counter . The waitress was grouchy , Lou decided . Awfully grouchy for early on a Sunday morning . Vigo eyed the waitress . She was about Lou 's age , but she was heavy , with a big bosom and short bobbed hair . Her cheeks were rouged , and her lips glistened with red lipstick . Her nails had deep red polish , almost black . She wore a small white apron with ruffles around it and up over her shoulders . The apron was pulled too tight , and her stomach protruded roundly beneath it . She turned and stuck her head through a small opening in the wall . " Mush on eight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice repeated , tired and colorless . " Mush on eight , and butter four . " The waitress took four cups and saucers , balanced them one on top of another as she filled them , and placed them in front of Lou and Vigo and Mr. and Mrs. Slovac . Lou watched the glass gauge as the coffee drained out of it , and then watched how the waitress balanced the cups and saucers in one hand . The waitress got four glasses , set them in front of Addie Kate , Sarie Bell , Thad , and LittleLonzo , and then poured milk into them from a quart bottle . She touched Addie Kate under the chin . " Hiya , honey ! How ya doin ' ? " Addie Kate looked up quickly at her mother , then smiled . " Fine , " she said , gulping with surprise . The waitress smiled at Sarie Bell . " That your sister , honey ? " Sarie Bell looked first at her mother . Lou nodded , and Sarie Bell nodded to the waitress . " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally , " the waitress exclaimed , laughing and turning quickly and going through the door . Presently she came out , carrying eight bowls lined up and balanced on her solid left arm and extending from her fingertips to her elbow . She took them off one by one and placed them on the counter in front of everyone . Then she got the four plates of toast and set them before Lou and Vigo and the Slovacs . Vigo looked at his . " I did n't order hit , miss , " he said softly . The waitress looked at him and frowned . " But you 're gon na eat it , mister . It 's the cheapest thing in the house , and that 's what you want , ai n't it ? " Vigo picked up the spoon and put it into the bowl . Lou slid her bowl in front of her and dipped into it . The waitress leaned back on the red " coke " cooler and wrote out the tickets and turned them face down on the counter before Vigo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing her pencil back into her hair over her ear , " if many more of you people come here , I swear to God , I do n't know where they 're gon na put all of you . You think you got problems now . Well , buddy . You just wait ! " Vigo nodded . He did n't know what she meant , but he wanted her to go away and leave them alone . He wanted to talk to Lou . He was thinking about the fog over the low , fiat land near the water . " Last night a guy broke into th ' house next door to th ' woman mayor 's . They called th ' cops , but you know all that fellow wanted was to use th ' john ? At least , if they do n't give you a place to live , they ought to build a public toilet . People ai n't gon na put up with you people breaking into homes just to use their johns . And the restaurant people is getting sore , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just from you people using the john and flushing it ' just to see the water run . By God Lou looked up from her bowl . " What 's that ? " " Th ' john ? " the waitress exclaimed . " Aw now , come on , lady . Do n't gim me that ! " Lou looked down at her bowl again and ate slowly . " You used our john just a while ago , did n't you ? " the waitress said , speaking to Vigo . " And ai n't I seen you before , a coupla days ago ? Was n't you in here with two other fellows , drunk ? Was n't that you I saw ? " Vigo shook his head . The waitress was pointing her finger at him accusingly . " No , ma'am , " Vigo said . " We jus ' come . We ai n't been in hyar afore now . Just now got in . " The waitress put her hands on her hips . " Well , I 'll be damned ! I'd-a swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Vigo and frowning . Then she shook her head and raised her hand and made a gesture as though she were waving him away .   " Oh hell . You all look alike , anyway ! Could n't tell one of you guys from the other , anyhow . And your wives and kids . They all look alike , too ! " Vigo ate his mush , then drank the hot coffee slowly , sucking in the air with the hot coffee . The waitress put her hands on the edge of the counter and leaned over and looked at Vigo more closely . " Say , " she said , " you mean t ' tell me you just come here ? " Vigo looked at her over the rim of his cup and nodded . " Honest ? " the waitress asked , raising her eyebrows . Vigo put the cup down and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . " Here 's a napkin , " the waitress said , reaching into a metal containeron the counter and handing Vigo a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy , all I can say is , you better turn right around and go back . " Vigo held the napkin to his mouth , then dropped it beside his plate . " Here 's one for you , lady , " the waitress said , handing the napkin container to Lou . " They 're free , so give one to th ' kids , poor things , " she said , looking at Sarie Bell and Addie Kate . She went over and cupped her hand under Addie Kate 's chin again . " Sweet little thing ! You do n't want t ' stay here , do ya , honey ? " she asked . Addie Kate nodded . " I wan na stay with my ma an ' pa . " The waitress looked at Sarie Bell . " How about you , honey ? What 's your name ? You wan na stay here , too ? " Sarie nodded . " Uh-huh . I wan na stay with my ma an ' pa , too . We just come t'day . Just got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's your name , honey ? " the waitress asked . " Sarie Bell . " " Sarie Bell what ? " " Hoxie . " " Sarie Bell Hoxie ? " " Uh-huh . " " How old are you ? " the waitress asked , frowning a little . " Goin ' on sixteen . Be sixteen jus ' b'fore 01 ' Christmas . "   " Sixteen , huh ? Ever been away from home before ? Say , where 's home ? " " Arkansas , " Sarie Bell replied . " Place called Happy Holler . " " Happy Holler ? Is that in th ' Ozarks , by any chance ? " Sarie Bell nodded , then looked at her ma , and Lou smiled . The waitress reached under her apron , took out a small white handkerchief and dabbed the corners of her eyes with it . Then she turned to Lou and said , " Look , honey , why do n't you take these kids back ? This ai n't no place for you and them . God Almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee back . It was only half finished , and she had n't touched the toast . " I do n't know whut ye mean , " Lou said , half frightened . Vigo looked at her . Lou 's face was a pasty , yellowish color , and it looked pained and full of worry . Out there on the street just a few minutes ago her cheeks were red and her neck glowed red . Vigo finished his coffee with a gulp . " Come on , Lou , " he saifl , hardly before the coffee was down , " let 's go . We got lots to do . " He glanced down at the Slovacs ; they had been eating and listening in silence . The waitress held out her right hand in Vigo 's direction . " Just a minute , there , " she exclaimed . " You people ought a hear this . If you just came , someone ought to put you wise . Better get goin ' while th ' gettin 's good ! " She reached down and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on the floor . " Look , there . I tore it up ! Do n't spend another cent here . Save your dough to send your wife and kids back home ! Take these kids back to the Ozarks . Take this little fellow over here "  --  the waitress put her hand on Little Lonzo 's head and looked at him while he held the glass of milk to his lips  --  " take him back , too . This ai n't no place for nice young kids like these . " Vigo stood up and looked at the sailors sitting at the far end of the counter to the left . They were leaning forward , looking at Little Lonzo as the waitress touched his head . There were no smiles on their faces now , and they had pushed their coffee away . Vigo 's face burned . He wanted to get out of there . Quick . BeforeP265Little Lonzo started bawling . It would n't take much . His mouth was puckered up and drawn down in the corners , and his little chin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vigo said , taking Lou 's arm and half lifting her up . " Come on The waitress walked over and stood in front of Vigo . " Honest , mister . You do n't know what you 're gettin ' into . Why do n't you send your wife and kids back home ? What 'd you bring them out here for ? In the first place , what for ? " Vigo looked at her , and his eyes narrowed . She was a regular she-bitch . He knew that when he first laid eyes on her . The way she talked to that Swede , banging her knuckles on the counter and demandingthe money from him ; the way she cussed and swore and used bad language . There was a mean streak in her . Her hair was tinted red , and her nails were blackish red , and long and sharp like a panther 's claws . She was full-chested and meddlesome . He had seen women like her before . He remembered the first one . She was one of those case workers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuffing little young ones under the chin , telling them about their bare feet and dirty rags and the things they ate and the way they lived , a low-down , meddlesome she-bitch who went around sticking her nose in , stirring up trouble , making men get out and work , telling women not to have any more babies . She was a home wrecker . Ab Turrell had an experience with that redheaded she-bitch . Vigo remembered it well . Ab Turrell told about her one day , down at Les Persinger 's store . " . . . An ' when she got through with m ' wife , I durn near could n't git nigh m ' of woman fer a week . Put fancy idees in her head about not havin ' no more intercourse with me . Said I was too ignorant t ' kn+ w better'n have young ' un after young ' un , like a stud horse . I 'm a-tellin ' you , Vigo , do n't ever let I hat woman come t ' yore place , or she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little apples ! " Vigo remembered how Ab Turrell described the woman , and she looked just like this woman , this waitress who was already meddling in his affairs , trying to fill Lou and the young ones with ideas of fear . Trying to make them urn back and go home when they had just got here .   " ' Tai n't none o ' yore business , " Vigo said , calmly . " We come hyar , an ' that 's that . An ' we ' uns all are aimin ' t ' stay hyar , come hell or high water ! " The waitress shook her head . " All right , buddy . But do n't say I did n't warn ya . " She leaned back against the cooler , took the pencil from behind her ear and began writing out another check . She handed it to Vigo , and he glanced at it . " Two dollars ! " The waitress nodded . " Plus six cents sales tax , " she snapped , holding her lips firmly together as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's high , ai n't it ? " Vigo asked , fumbling through his pockets . " Mush fifteen , coffee twenty , toast thirty . Add it up , buddy . Two dollars , plus six cents tax  --  state sales tax . " Vigo reached into his pocket and pulled out a few pieces of silver and pennies , counted out two dollars and six cents and slapped it down on the counter . Lou and the children rose and turned and went toward the door . The Slovacs got up and went out together . The waitress yelled after him . " I warned you , buddy , " she said ' " Told you t ' go on back and take them kids with you . ' Offered to tear up th ' check and give you a free meal , but you would n't listen to me . Now , if you 're gon na stay here , buddy , you got ta pay th ' price ! " Vigo opened the door for Lou . He was biting his tongue , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Buddy , if you 're gon na stay here , you got ta pay the price . " Vigo slammed the door after him and stood on the steps and looked out over the flat land and the water . The fog had been partially blown away by the icy wind from the bay , and now the sun was shining on the few distant hills of Point Richmond , and except for the silvery oil storage tanks and the cluster of dark buildings of the refinery , nestled at the base of the hills , the scene that Vigo beheld might have been any of those small , wind-swept towns he had seen across the prairies on one of his journeys from home . P267There was a low , brick-red railroad station , long , thin strands of glistening steel rails , a few dingy clapboard houses with peaked roofs and high porches , a store or two , one or two small hotels , a row of low houses for railroad section hands , and here and there a gnarled tree and a few round green shrubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where along the shore of the bay he saw the rows of black pilings stuck in the mud ; a few derricks , dredges , and pile drivers on long black floating barges ; raw brown lumber rigging which resembled a skeletonized crate enclosing the dark hull of a halfcompletedship ; a dozen or more new buildings and warehouses , and a parking lot filled with cars ; and around all this there was a high board fence . This was the shipyards , he thought , shifting his gaze from the yards to the marshes of the flat , black tidal land . Here , crisscrossed on the flat land to the far right of the shipyards was a pattern of wide concrete streets with weeds growing along the curbstones and up through the cracks in the pavement . There were four or five deserted-looking houses plunked down in the middle of those vast vacant plots of ground overgrown with weeds , and the whole scene reminded him of the abandoned real-estate developmentshe had seen around Kansas City or Omaha a few years back . Yet , clustered here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew in from the sea , were several groups of automobiles and trailers , still partially hidden by the thin , windstrewnfog , but there were no houses , no little white houses . . . 33THEY TURNED OFF San Pablo Avenue to the left and drove down one of the long , empty streets toward the Richmond hills , more than a mile away . In the air was the tangy smell of fishy salt sea air mixed with the acrid fumes of the refinery . Vigo looked to the left as he drove toward the town across the wide , vacant marshland and saw the dark green choppy water of the bay , and in the distance tha thin gray steel span of the Bay Bridge , extending from the Oakland side to the island in the middle of the bay , then reaching across to San Francisco , whose hills and towering skyscrapers were barely visible through the bluish haze . The sun was obscured by the billowingbank of fog which hung over the entire bay from the Golden Gate to beyond the hills of Berkeley and Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristling along his legs as the wind blew up through the floorboards and penetrated the thin cloth of his overall legs . " I just got t ' stop , Vigo , " Lou said . " I been in misery so long I cai n't hold hit in any longer . " Vigo pressed his foot down on the gas pedal . One of the tires on the trailer was almost flat , and the trailer wobbled because of the low , rolling flatness of the tire . Little Lonzo 's pig was squalling in his crate in the trailer , and its muffled , hungry cries annoyed Vigo . " Pore little ol ' thing , " said Thad . Lou held Little Lonzo on her lap . She felt his forehead anti , looked up at Vigo . " He feels like a fever , Vigo . " Vigo bit his tongue . As though he did n't have enough to worry about already  --  a flat tire , a squealing pig , complaining young ones , and no place to go  --  without having a sick child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' railroad station , Lou . They 's bound to be one in thar . " " Pore Miz ' Slovac . We got t ' git a place fer her t ' stay too , Vigo . She cai n't wait her time much longer . " " Pa , if we do n't git Lonzo 's pig out so 's he can root aroun ' fer somethin ' t ' eat , he 's a-gonna squeal all day . " " Dammit , Thad , shut up ! I cai n't do ever'thin ' at once't ! I got to find a privy fer yore ma , an ' I got t ' find a place t ' stop , I got t ' hurry up an ' light so 's Miz ' Slovac can have her young ' un , an ' I cai n't be worried about no little ol ' runt pig ! We ort t ' butcher th ' danged thing an ' put ' im out'n his misery . " Little Lonzo raised his head from Lou 's bosom and opened his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes again . " Do n't worry , darlin ' . " Lou patted his warm cheek with her cold fingers . " I wo n't let yore pa kill that pore little thing . " P269Little Lonzo smiled weakly and pressed his cheek against her bosom . " If only I could git m ' hands on that Californy Bartlett feller " Now , Vigo ! " " He lied t ' our faces , Lou . He 's th ' cause o ' all this ! " " Them folks over thar is in th ' same fix , Vigo . " Lou looked across the vacant , weed-filled muddy lots at the group of trailers . From a short black stovepipe stuck up through the roof of one came a thin and wavering trail of black smoke . " But this hai n't whut I promised ya , Lou . " Lou let her left hand steal over until it touched his knee . " Thar hai n't nothin ' else t ' do , Vigo , but make th ' best o ' hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his level best . " Vigo went up to the next cross street and turned off to the left toward the railroad station . A dozen cars were parked in front of it , and gathered there on the concrete porch in front was a group of men and women and children . They appeared to be in some sort of line , as though waiting to get inside the door . Vigo pulled up and stopped the trailer . " I 'll git out an ' look hit over , Lou . " " But hurry , Vigo . I reckon we 're all in pain . Ask Mister Slovac if his wife 's all right , Vigo . " Vigo walked back to the Slovac trailer , and Slovac got out of his ( ar and met Vigo in front of the radiator . " I 've simply got to find a toilet , Mr. Hoxic . I ca n't " We 're all in th ' same fix , " Vigo said impatiently as he looked toward the station . " Thar 's bound t ' be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot toward the railroad tracks , then walked on the gravel between the ties until they came to the freight platform . Vigo walked along the ties until he heard the ( licking of a telegraph key , and then he glanced up , saw the telegraphersitting at the window and pecking on a typewriter , and behind him the clerks in the station . Around the place where the telegrapher sat at the window , which protruded a little to afford alear view of the tracks both ways , was the front door , and grouped around the front door were a couple of dozen men . Some stood with their backs against the front of the station , others squatted against the building and flipped gravel stones across the tracks . Some wore mackinaws , others wore tan sheepskin coats and corduroy hunting caps , and others were dressed like Vigo , in blue denim overalls , overall jumper , and dark felt hat . They appeared to be waiting for the train , because scattered among them were handbags , gunny sacks , and bundles tied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slovac approached around the front of the telegraphwindow , a few looked up , saw Vigo and Slovac , then ignored them . One man , however , nodded to Vigo as he entered the door . Vigo stood inside the waiting room and looked around . The slick green benches were filled with men , women , and children . ' The room was hot and full of smoke and stale air , and around the small , potbellied stove stood a few men with their backs to the warmth . Then , for the first time , Vigo saw the meaning of the formation he had seen a while ago out on the concrete porch of the station . The two long rows of men and women were waiting at the rest roome , and the lines extended out through the front door , which was closed to keep out the cold wind , and out on the concrete front porch of the station . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Slovac mumbled . " They 's a long line waitin ' t ' git in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Mr. Hoxie ! " Vigo watched the man who waited at the head of the line at the men 's toilet . He was standing with his legs crossed , both hands dug deep into his overall pockets . Above the hum of voices in the tiny , packed waiting room , Vigo heard him exclaim , " Good God , that guy must-a fell in ! " The man behind him laughed . " He 's catching up ! Probably waited two or three days just for this chance , and now he 's enjoying it . " " If this keeps up , I 'm gon na get me a pound of cheese . . . " Vigo turned and spoke to Slovac : " If you got to go , you 'd better git to some place else . " One of the men in the line looked at Slovac and motioned toward the door . " Get to the end of the line , buddy . Wait your turn , by God ! "   1Slovac 's face reddened , and he spoke to Vigo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children , Mr. Hoxie . My poor wife , she " Lou , too . " " Let 's get out of here , then . " Suddenly there was an argument at the ticket window , and Vigo t limed from the crowded seats and looked at the broad back of the fellow who stood at the ticket window . " . . . By God , you got to sell me a ticket , ma'am , " the man was saying . Vigo saw the ticket clerk at the window close her eyes as she shook her head . " Sorry . I ca n't sell you a ticket . " " But , by God , you ca n't keep me here ! " " I 'm sorry . No ticket . " " Say , what 's going on here , anyhow ? " the fellow demanded , hammering the ledge of the window . " Th ' railroad in cahoots with them damned shipyard people ? They got us out here on a promise , and now you railroad people wo n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God-damned deal is this , anyway ? " The ticket seller again shook her head and closed her eyes at the same time . " I 'm sorry , mister . " She pulled the little window down , and the man grabbed the small round iron bars in front of it and shook them . " Hey ! Open up ! I 'll tear up th ' damned joint ! " But he walked away and grumbled : " I 'm gon na go to Oakland and grab me a handful of boxcars . Damned if they 're gon na keep me here ! " Vigo and Slovac followed the man out the door and onto the station platform in front of the tracks . Vigo and Slovac watched him as he turned and joined a group of men squatting by the front of the station . " Any luck ? " one asked . The man shook his head . " Well , " said the first one , " we 've all tried . Nothing to do but wait until the next freight passes . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell when the next one is due . "   " All right . So we wait . By God , I 'll wait here until hell freezes over . " " Hell 's done froze over , as far as I 'm concerned , " the man said , turning up his sheepskin collar . Slovac and Vigo jumped off the end of the freight platform , and their feet sank in the soft , black earth . They walked together across the lot , each thinking about the people who waited in the station or stood in line for the toilets , or waited outside in huddles and quiet groups . These were the ones who were disappointed . Somethingsomewhere had gone haywire . Someone had forgot to prepare for them . Oh , they did n't want much  --  just a place to flop , three squares a day , a bath now and then , and a place where they could have a little privacy . But here , in this tank town , there was n't even a place to sleep , a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame the shipyard people for this , Mr. I-Ioxie , " Slovac tried to argue . " It 's up to the community to provide the proper facilities for the people who come here . " " But thar 's fifty people standin ' in line t ' git in them privies , Slovac . Thar 's no place fer ' em t ' go , no place fer ' em t ' stay . Those that come in th ' train cai n't git back , an ' those that come in their own jalopies an ' trailers hai n't even got a place to park , not even a privy . What in th ' Gawddam hell kind of a deal is this anyhow , Slovac ? " " No one 's to blame , Mr. Hoxie . In wartime they " Th ' hell with that , Slovac ! Ya cai n't make me believe that just because they 's a war th ' whole world 's gone crazy . Why , th 's place is so crowded ya even have t ' stand in line t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hai n't Slovac laughed dryly . " I 'm not complaining , Mr. Hoxie , although I have a perfect right to complain . My wife 's going to have a baby , and there is n't a decent house we can find where I can take her until her time comes . We 'll have to live in that damned trailer , instead of a house . But I 'm not complaining . My wife ca n't wait , Mr. Hoxie . I 've got to get her to a doctor  --  but quick ! Babies on the way do n't wait for anything . " Vigo slowed his walk . They were approaching the trailers now , and Vigo could see Lou looking at him anxiously , and Mrs. SlovacP273was sitting there in the front seat of her car with her head leaned hack and her eyes closed . " What 'll we do ? Whar 'll we ' uns go at , now ? " Slovac turned around and considered the line at the station . " First let 's find a public rest room for the women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park our cars . Then  --  then Ile paused and sucked in his lower lip and bit it while he wondered . " Then I 've got to find a doctor . Oriana ca n't wait any longer . It 's just a matter of a few hours  --  maybe not that long . " Vigo thought , " I 'm glad I ai n't in yore fix , Slovac . I 'm glad Lou liai n't that way . " They separated , and each went to his wife . When Vigo climbed into the seat beside Lou he saw Little Lonzo still sitting in her lap , his head pressed against her bosom . " What in th ' name o ' Gawd is th ' matter with him ? " Vigo was impatient now . Lou babied Lonzo too damned much . He was ten years old and no longer a baby . It made Vigo mad , the way she humored him . " He 's jus ' t'ard , Vigo . An ' car-sick , I reckon . His little insides is likely all upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hai n't no place t ' go , Lou . " " Maybe thar 's a fillin ' station , Vigo . " " Slovac 's got t ' find a doctor . Says his woman feels like hit 'll be soon Oh , Gawd dammit t ' hell ! Ever'thin ' all at once't ! Sickyoung ' uns , a woman in th ' family way , a squealin ' pig , you , and a cyar full o ' young ' uns with a bellyache  --  an ' a flat tire on th ' trailer ! Dammit , Lou , I cai n't pull this hyar trailer with a flat tire much longer ! " Lou tried to soothe Vigo . He was whimpering and whining . " I hai n't complainin ' , Vigo . I 'm ready t ' make th ' best o ' hit , Marlin ' . " Vigo spat out the other side of the car . " You an ' that damned Slovatt . He ai n't complainin ' , neither . None o ' this is no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one 's fault , he sez . All right then , Gawd dammit , whose fault is it , then ? " " Now , Vigo ! " " But I 'm askin ' ye , who 's t ' blame ? Somebody 's t ' blame ! If I could only git m ' han 's on that Californy Bartlett , by Gawd " Lou lifted Little Lonzo up on her lap and got a better hold of him . He was almost asleep now and was sliding off her lap . " Let 's not set hyar , Vigo , please . Let 's go an ' find a fillin ' station first . I an ' th ' young ' uns an ' Miz ' Slovac will go an ' do what we want , an ' you can git th ' air in th ' tire  --  kill two birds with one stone , Vigo . Then we ' uns  --  th ' Slovacs an ' us  --  will go an ' find a place t ' park our trailers . Hit 's all so simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' one thing at a time . Now cease yore frettin ' , darlin ' Vigo , an ' let 's go . " Vigo was biting his tongue and shaking his head stubbornly as , he started the motor . " Hit cai n't be did , Lou . Hit jus ' cai n't be did , " he kept repeating . Lou stroked Little Lonzo 's head . " Whar thar 's a will , Vigo , thar 's a way . Ever'thin 's gon na be all right , darlin ' . Pore Miz ' Slovac will have her baby , whether or no . An ' hit 'll be b'cause we all pitched in an ' helped . I can granny her child if it comes down t ' that , Vigo . I hai n't afraid  --  not o ' nothin ' on earth  --  an ' you need n't be afraid , neither . Jus ' grit yore jaws an ' make th ' best o ' hit , Vigo darlin ' . " Near the center of the small town they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked away while Vigo looked for the air hose. 34THEY DROVE TO THE CENTER of the town , and Slovac leaned out and asked the way to the nearest doctor 's office . " Ai n't got no doctors left in this town , buddy . There was one or two before th ' war , but God only knows where they went to . Might try th ' hospital , " the man told him , directing the way to the hospital . The day nurse shook her head . " Only for emergency cases , sir . " P275Slovac told her it was a maternity case . The nurse shook her head . " We refer all O.B . cases to family physicians . You 'd better see your family physician . " Then he patiently told the nurse how it was . She only shook her head . " I 'm sorry . We do n't have a public maternity ward . Nearest maternity hospital is in Berkeley or Oakland . There 's a little private hospital back down San Pablo Avenue in Albany , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid you 'd better take her to one of the larger public hos-pitals . " Slovac made a design in the polished linoleum floor with the toe of his shoe . He was thinking . He shook his head . " There is n't time for that . " The nurse said , " If you want to bring her in as an emergency case , I 'll let her in . But she ca n't stay . You 'll have to transfer her to a private hospital . And , besides , this is Sunday , and I 'm not sure I ( ' an get a doctor for her in less than an hour or so , at the earliest . " Slovac turned and started out . " There is n't time for that , miss . " " The town 's crowded , sir . There 's fifty times more people than there are doctors for them . Since the war " I know , " Slovac said , impatiently . " Yes , I know . " He turned around and made one more appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , is n't there someone who can handle a situation like this ? I 'll pay for it . I 'm not broke . We 've come a long way  --  all the way from Pennsylvania  --  but I 'm not broke ! " The nurse shook her head . " That 's the way it is , sir . Unless you want to take her to Berkeley or Oakland We 're just notequipped to handle all the maternity cases that come in here , that 's all . We 're too small . Even before the war weHe turned around and ran down the corridor and pushed open the swinging door and leaped down the steps . Lou was standing beside the car when he ran up . He just shook his head ; that was all . He looked at his wife , and she raised her head from the back of the seat cushion and smiled weakly but 1 , ravely . Lou took his arm and led him back beside the trailer , away from Oriana . " She 's nigh , son ! She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  I know . But they ca n't take her in here , and they ca n't get a doctor for a couple of hours ! In Oakland , they said Lou shook her head . " Pore Oriana , she jus ' cai n't wait that long . " Slovac brushed past her . " We 'll try one more place . I saw a doctor 's sign at a place on San Pablo Avenue a while ago . We 'll try that , Mrs. Hoxie . Then " Then what , son ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Hoxie . I just do n't know . " Lou put her arm over his shoulder . " Now do n't go all t ' pieces , son . Hit 's not so bad as all that . We 'll make out . I can do hit , you1know . I hai n't afraid , son  --  if you only could trust me . " The young man was bewildered , and tears came to his eyes . " It 's  --  it 's not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that Oriana wanted to have her baby in a n-nice place  --  not in a hellhole like this . " Lou patted his shoulder . " Th ' baby Jesus was born in a reg'iar old cow manger , son . " Slovac put his right hand to his forehead and pressed hard against his temples with his fingers . Lou saw his lips quivering and the whiteness of his face and thought he was only just a little more than a boy , not over twenty-five , at the most . They were such nice folks , Oriana and this young husband of hers . Nothing fine-haired about them . Just plain folks . He was just a big , tough , overgrown young ' un , that was all . Worked hard in the steel mills . Oriana had told her about that one night . She said he had always tried to put on a tough , hard-boiled front around men , simply because he was a rolling-mill boss in the steel mills , where men are tough and have to be . But at heart he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was so generous , so bighearted , so softhearted , even . Now , Lou could see that . He did n't whine and whimper and rave and cuss like Vigo . He just broke down and cried , and it was not because he was n't every inch a fine young man . He was n't a weakling . He was just so bewildered . " What do ya say , son ? Oriana 's a-waitin ' in th ' cyar . " The young fellow uncovered his face and looked steadily at her with his red-streaked eyes .   " All r-right , Mrs. Hoxie , " he stammered . " But let 's go somewhere , quick  --  I ca n't stand to see her in such pain . " Lou looked back over the flat lands bordering the bay . There was one bare spot where no trailers had parked , although more were coming in every minute . There was one turning off the mudcoatedconcrete pavement now , and it was bumping over the curbstoneand pulling across the weed-filled lot and miring down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as any , " she said , pointing toward the far end of the low , level ground at the junction where San Pablo Avenue joined the main street toward the shipyards . Slovac reached out and took Lou 's hand quickly and pressed his two big , rough hands around hers . They were cool and strong . " I want to thank you , Mrs. Hoxie , for " Lou laughed , and it was a nervous , embarrassed sort of laughter that sounded strange to her . " Now , now , son , you do n't hafta do thet . Hit 's my duty now . " Hs ran to the other side of the car and turned around quickly and started toward the open lots where Lou had pointed , and behind them Vigo drove slowly , almost stubbornly , as he complained about the flat tire , how driving on it like this would ruin the casing , and there was nothing in the world that was right . " My pore darlin ' ! " Lou said , trying to comfort him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two trailers on one of the empty mud lots , placing them end to end in an L shape , and Lou sent Thad and Vigo down to the shore of the bay for driftwood . " Got t ' b'il some water , Vigo . Got t ' git ever'thin ' ready ter Miz ' Slovac . " Then Lou and Sarie Bell went with two pails each and filled them at the nearest place , and while they were gone Slovac carried some stones and bricks and piled them close together for the kettle . With the wood Vigo and Thad brought back , Lou then built a fire under the big washtub and started it simmering . " I 'll go buy some groceries , Mrs. Hoxie , " Slovac volunteered . " That 's th ' least I can do . " " You go on an ' go , Mister Slovac . I an ' th ' girls will look atter her . " " They hai n't nothin ' I can do , is they , Lou ? " " No , darlin ' Vigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rest . Pore darlin ' , you look t'ard . " " I am , Lou . I 'm awful t'ard , Lou . " Lou let the water simmer while she watched Mister Slovac as he waded across the soggy field to the street toward San Pablo Avenue and the stores . Lou was thinking back , trying to remember what Sophie Persinger , the old granny woman of Happy Holler , had done when she prepared for the delivery of a child in the Ozarks . The water was on the fire , the sheets were hung over the chair 11esideOriana 's bed , and Oriana was being kept warm with blankets while she lay on her back , rolling a little from side to side . There were two washpans on the step of the trailer , and they were clean and waiting . Lou had a pair of scissors in the pocket of her dress , and piled on an overturned pail beside Oriana 's bed were the clean , bleached flour sacks with which to wash the baby . Sarie Bell could prepare the meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . Mister Slovac would n't eat much because he was too excited , and Little Lonzo , lying in the top bunk , would be satisfied with some warm milk and mush . Thad , Addie Kate , and Vigo would eat , but she would n't want much . So Sarie Bell could handle the meal while she stayed neu.r Mrs. Slovac and waited . Lou remembered how she had lain in her feather bed and looked up in the firelight and watched Sophie Persinger as that old granny woman hustled about Lou 's dogtrot house , preparing everything for the arrival of Little Lonzo . " Now , Lou , jus ' lay still , honey . . . " She remembered Sophie , her wrinkles deepening in the shadows as she smiled at Lou . " Now , Lou , jus ' hold onto them ties I laid by yore side  --  jus ' hold on an ' pull , Lou  --  jus ' pull , Lou . . . . " Yes , Lou had remembered to tie a couple of strips of cloth toP279the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull when the time came . Maybe her husband could help her , although Sophie Persingerwould n't admit Vigo to the room whenever Lou was having a baby . Sophie had worked all alone , preparing the bed , the ties , the water in the pans , the clean flour sacks , the scissors . Then , when little Lonzo came , Lou had closed her eyes and from far away had come the first wailing of the baby . A long time afterward Sophie had told her that as soon as the baby had cried , she had put it down and turned quickly to Lou . It had seemed like a long time to Lou , a long time between the first cry of the baby and the time when Sophie had come up and with a warm cloth washed Lou 's face and brushed her hair back on the pillow , started the flow of breast milk and done all the other things which had to be done . Lou remembered how Sophie had changed the sheets by rolling her over from one side of the bed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lou had slept ; then at last , when she had awakened , Sophie and Vigo were standing beside her bed , and in Sophie 's arms was little Lonzo , sleeping and quiet in his swaddling clothes . Mrs. Slovac was calling her now , her faint cries coming from the trailer . Sarie Bell rushed up to her ma 's side and touched her hand . " Ma , she 's callin ' ya ! She wants ya , Ma . " " All right , honey . I 'll come . Now you stay out hyar with Addie Kate -- an ' , Sarie , when I call , you bring me a pan o ' b'ilin ' hot water . " " I will , Ma . " Sarie 's face was colorless . " Maybe , if I need help , honey , I 'll call ya . " " Me , Ma ? " Addie Kate asked anxiously . " No , Addie . I 'm talkin ' t ' yore sister . You 're too leetle , honey . " " But I hai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , honey . " " I cai n't help bein ' skeerd , Ma . T'think a little baby 's life is about t commence " Lou looked at Sarie Bell and smiled . " Jus ' keep th ' water a-Wilin ' , honey . " She opened the door and stepped inside the trailer where Oriana lay . P28o " Lou  --  oh , Lou ! " Oriana was crying , and her head was rolling from side to side on her pillow . Lou tiptoed across the trailer floor and bent over Oriana and wiped the perspiration from her forehead and brushed her hair back on the pillow . Oriana licked her lips and swallowed . " Want a drink o ' water , honey ? " Oriana closed her eyes and licked her lips again . " Should I , Lou ? I 'm so afraid Lou smiled . " Yes , honey  --  anything yore darlin ' heart desires . " Lou went to the bucket of cold water sitting by the door and dipped a tin cup into it , carried it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head and lifted it off the pillow . She touched the cup to her lips , and Oriana drank a few swallows ; then her lips closed tight in pain . As Lou gently laid her head back on the pillow , Oriana put her right arm over Lou 's shoulder and drew her down close , and Lou felt the smothering warmth of her body . " It will be yours , Lou , " Oriana whispered . " If anything happelTs  --  to  --  me  --  Lou , will you ? " Lou hugged her . " Do n't fret , honey . Hit 'll be all right . You 'll see . You 've got t ' have faith , Oriana . " Oriana relaxed on the pillow and closed her eyes . " It is n't far off , Lou  --  I can tell , now . " " Yes , honey . " " I 'll never forget you , Lou . You 've been so good to me . Someday I 'll  --  someday I 'll do something for you . " Lou stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden movement beneath the covers . " Now , honey , " Lou whispered , " jus ' take a hold o ' these ties . " She placed the strips of flour sacking in Oriana 's hand . " It 's gon na be over soon , an ' you 'll have yore baby . " Oriana looked up at Lou , and her eyes were larger , with more of the whites showing . She tried once to smile , but the sudden pain made her teeth come together sharply , and her lips parted , and she closed her eyes as the perspiration came out all over her face and her hair clung wet to her temples . " Now , Oriana  --  pull , honey  --  jus ' pull rale hard on them ties , honey . . . . " P281In the gathering twilight fog which hovered over the low , flat land and the cluster of trailers there , Slovac looked up from the fire toward the trailer door . It had been almost two hours since Lou had gone in there alone . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's sharp cry , and after a few minutes of deathly silence the door opened and Lou , her face lit by the flickering light of the fire between the two trailers , smiled and motioned for the father . " You can come in now , Mister Slovac . " He rose , walked quickly toward the trailer door . " How is she ? " he asked , hardly above a whisper . Lou opened wide the door and let him enter into the dim light of the trailer . " She 's fine , Mister Slovac . But yore son  --  he 's awful puny . He do n't weigh no more'n a mite . " Lou closed the door behind her and walked out and sat down in her rocker in front of the open fire . Sarie Bell threw Lou 's shawl around her shoulders as she leaned forward and held her hands out to the fire . She gazed into the flames for a moment , then raised her eyes and looked at Sarie Bell . " Hit 's a awful puny child , Sarie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puny . " " It 's got a good and husky cry , Ma . " Lou gazed into the fire for a moment and shook her head wonderingly . " I do n't rightly know , Sarie  --  I jus ' do n't rightly know . . . " I , OU WAS AWAKENED by the noise of many automobiles passing on the street , and she got up and dressed and went outside and kindled the fire . Lights of the automobiles lit San Pablo Avenue , and where they turned off the avenue onto the street that went past the shipyards their headlamps cast long , . flashing and quick-moving beams across the trailers . It was Monday , and the early shift was arriving for work . Lou put the coffee to boil , placed the corn meal in the pan and poured two hot cups of milk over it , then one cup of cold water , set it to simmer over the open fire between the two trailers , and went in to awaken Vigo and Thad . As they stood around the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " First off , Vigo , I 'm a-gonna take th ' young ' uns t ' school . Addic Kate an ' Little Lonzo . Sarie Bell can stay home from school an ' help her ma t'day , an ' t'morry , when Miz ' Slovac is good and strong , Sarie Bell , she can go t ' school like th ' others . An ' atter that , I 'm a-goin ' t ' a sawmill an ' git me some lumber an ' build me a. lean-to . Cai n't all o ' us sleep in that ' ere trailer , Vigo . I 'll git th ' lumber an ' I 'll build hit m'self if I have to . " Vigo ate and nodded . " I 'll be so t'ard after work , Lou , " he said . Slovac came out of his trailer , and Lou went in , carrying a bowl of hot mush and some warm milk for Oriana . " Feel better , honey ? " Oriana rubbed her eyes and shaded them from the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . The swelling was gone from around her eyes , and they were bright and clear , and her complexion was like the skin of a ripened peach , Lou thought . Oriana raised her head from her pillow and ran her hands back along the sides of her hair , brushing it back . " I 'm fine  --  but a little weak , Lou . " Lou looked at her closely . There was a peculiar note in Oriana 's voice , almost like disappointment , Lou thought . " What is hit , honey ? They 's somethin ' on yore mind . Tell Lou . Tell Lou what makes ya sound so sad . " Oriana glanced down at her child and tucked the sheet and blanket more closely about him as he fed at her breast . Then she shook her head , and there was a wondering sadness in her eyes . " He 's so small  --  so tiny , Lou ! " she sobbed . Lou 's hands were folded down in front of her , and she looked at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she held that tiny form there in her two strong hands . She opened her fingers and looked at them , and then she looked over at Oriana . " Lou , " Oriana whispered , " Lou , is  --  is there anything the matter with him ? " P283Lou gazed unflinchingly at her . There was no use lying . " He 's  --  he 's puny , I know , honey . Lots o ' babies is born puny , but they soon git over hit . " " Then you 're afraid , Lou . You 're afraid he 'll  --  he 'll " Shebroke off and began to sob . Lou knelt quickly beside the bed and placed her cool hand on Oriana 's forehead , moist and warm . Lou wondered how long Oriana had lain there worrying about the tiny body lying so close and warm beside her . " Hit ai n't fer me t ' say , honey . Only th ' Lord knows thet . He 's puny , shore enough , but I 'd say he was normal in ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red face and squinting eyes as the infantnursed at her breast . " My husband did n't want to start to work this morning because he 's worried . But I let him go . Tonight he is going out to find a doctor . " All at once Lou thought of Little Lonzo and the way he had lain close to her , his flesh so hot that she thought his little body was burning inside . But they had let it go . Sophie Persinger , the granny woman of Happy Holler , said it would pass and that the thing to do was to tie a small red wool string around the young ' un 's neck and the " sick " would pass . A few years later , when the nurse came and they took Little Lonzo away to Booneville Sanitarium , the nurse had told Lou , " If you had only noticed it when he first showed the symptoms . . . " Lou looked at the child beside Oriana , and she had a sudden impulse . " I got to see about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . But when she stepped outside and looked around the fire where Thad and Vigo and Peter Slovac had been a few moments ago , she saw that they were gone . Lou went back into the trailer and placed the mush on the overturnedpail and took the child from Oriana 's breast and held it close to her bosom and looked down at the squinted , wrinkled face and those tiny fingers , no larger than a sparrow 's leg , doubled up in its tiny fist . " Hit 's a sweet thing , honey , " Lou said , placing the baby in the big clothesbasket she had fixed last night . " Hit 's a darlin ' sweet t hing . "   " It 's yours , too , Lou , " Oriana smiled . " You brought him into the world , Lou . If we ca n't get a doctor , I suppose you 'll have to teach me how to take care of him  --  my little Pete . " Lou stood over the basket and watched the child as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load , honey . I brung up four young ' uns , Oriana , and I tell you , they 're a joy , but you got to watch ever ' least thing . " She straightened and turned to Oriana . " Tell you what , honey . I was a-thinkin ' about takin ' Sarie Bell an ' th ' least ones t ' school this mawnin ' , but I 'll leave Sarie Bell hyar t ' look atter you . An ' atter that , I 'll go an ' fetch that doctor if hit 's a-goin ' t ' worry you any , honey . " Oriana rolled her head on the pillow . " I do n't know , Lou . It 's him  --  my husband . He 's worried , but I 'm not . I do n't know anything about babies , and if you say he 's all right , Lou  --  well Lou leaned forward and kissed Oriana 's forehead , then went out , filled the tin washpan , and called Addie Kate and Little Lon4p to wash for school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept thinking of that puny little thing lying in there in that basket , and she wondered what Sophie Persinger would recommend . Sophie , the most faithful of all granny women in living up to the signs and superstitions of the hills , always had her list of warnings , her dos and don'ts for every new mother . Even to Lou , who had given birth to four children with Sophie as her midwife , those warnings were calculated to have some effect upon the newborn babe 's later life . Lou had been first reminded of one of Sophie Persinger 's wise precautions when , back on the road that day , Oriana had felt a sudden appetite for dill pickles . Sophie would have said that if Oriana had n't got her dill pickles and satisfied her craving for them then , her baby would have suffered a mark inside his stomach , and he would have craved dill pickles all his life . Again , while bathing Oriana 's newbornbabe , Lou remembered what Sophie once said about bathing the palm of a child just out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so for the sake of Oriana 's child she had carried out faithfully all of those old warnings of Sophie 's as well as she could remember them . She knew all the signs had been right forP285Oriana , but in her own heart there was an uneasiness she could not put out or really forget , and that in itself was like a warning . If only Sophie were here , she would know what to do . She dipped the washcloth in the cold water and rubbed the soap against the cloth until the water was smoky blue . Then , putting Little Lonzo in front of her , she bent him forward over the pan to wash his neck and ears . When the cold water touched him , he began to whimper . " Now , Lonzo , a little cold water is good fer ya , son . Hit 'll make yore cheeks rosy an ' yore blood circulate . " But Little Lonzo cried and fretted . He was ailing , too , she feared . " You got t ' keep clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if we hai n't got much else fer folks t ' talk about , at least we can be sure that we 're clean an ' neat  --  even if we ' uns is clothed in flour sacks . " Going into the trailer , she dug deep in the drawer Vigo had made for her and laid out a pair of faded overalls and a flour-sack shirt for Little Lonzo , and clean shirtwaist , bloomers , and dress for Addie Kate . And from the bottom of the drawer she brought out a small card of rick-rack and cut it and made two small blue bows for Addie Kate 's hair . After it was done , she stood back in the trailer and looked at her two least ones . For a fleeting instant she thought of Oriana and her baby , and all at once she was grateful . " My darlin 's , someday yore ma 's gon na make you a nice new outfit . I love my young ' uns so . Always mind yore ma , darlin 's , and be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Little Lonzo looked at his ma , and his lower lip quivered a little and his eyes became misty . " You hai n't got no new things , Ma  --  you 're still wearin ' that old raggedy garment Lou looked at them both for a moment , then held up her hand . " Wait ! " she cried . " I got a dress I been savin ' . " And she turned to the lower drawer , where she had stored the sheets and flat things , and took from it the faded blue dress , sprinkled with dried old English lavender . She had ironed and folded it neatly a long time ago back in Happy Holler and brought it along to wear only on occasions as special as this . Holding it by the shoulders , she let it unfold in front of her and fall full length . " Here hit is , darlin 's . I made hit five years ago , but hit war a mite too small , so I put hit away t ' keep fer good  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma t ' look rale purty ! " She had bleached and dyed , then washed it until the dye was faded to a pale blue like the Ozark sky on a sunny day . There were . wide ruffles around the hem , at the shoulders , and around her sleeves , and there was a wide belt which tied in a bow at the back . The neck was high and fitted tightly with a row of three pearl buttonson one side . " Now turn yore heads , darlin 's , while I put hit on . " Little Lonzo turned his head and looked out the door and across the flat land toward the bay . More trailers were turning off the avenue and coming into the vacant lots , and Little Lonzo counted twenty-three at a place where there had been none yesterday . " Now you can look , darlin 's , " he heard his ma say . Little Lonzo turned slowly and looked first at the ruffles at the bottom of the dress , which reached almost to his ma 's ankles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , flaring skirt the tight belt high up at her waist , the full bosom and high neck , the ruffles and the flared puffs at the shoulders , the long balloon sleeves . He inspected the dress for a moment , then saw his ma 's stringy hair , her face , glowing warmly , her eyes bright and sparkling . There was a glistening redness in her lips , and her mouth was opened a little in a faint , expectant smile as she waited for Little Lonzo to pronounce his judgment . Little Lonzo stood for a moment looking at her , trying to think what to say . All at once he remembered a small tintype photograph which he had seen on the mantel in his uncle Yancey 's cabin just down the hill . It was a photograph of Uncle Yancey and his wife when they were married more than fifty years ago , and Uncle Yancey'sbride , in the tintype , was wearing a dress just like his ma was wearing now . Little Lonzo ran toward her , held his arms outstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma 's arms around his shoulders as he buried his face in her starched bosom , fragrant with the scent of old English lavender . He heard Addie Kate come and place her arms around her ma , too , and he stood there as Lou pressed them close to her and laughed for joy as the tears came .   " My darlin 's  --  my precious darlin 's ! " Then she pushed them away , caught the hanging ends of her hair and pushed them back on the top of her head and held them there with both hands . " If I only had a lookin ' glass ! " she exclaimed . " If only I could see how I look in my purty blue dress ! " Addie Kate remembered the mirror which hung by the door just inside the Slovac trailer . " Ma , I know whar 's a But Little Lonzo grabbed the back of Addie Kate 's dress and ! gave it a little warning jerk , and Addie Kate was silenced . " How do I look , darlin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they stood off and looked at their ma . He glanced out of the corner of his eyes at Addie Kate . She was waiting for her brother to speak . Addie Kate had seen the tintype on Uncle Yancey 's mantel , and she , too , remembered it and was about to say what was on the tip of her titongue when Little Lonzo tugged sharply at the back of her dress again . " You look fine , Ma , " he said , solemnly . " You look as purty as th ' picture Uncle Yancey keeps on his mantel , do n't she , Addie Kate ? " Addle Kate peeped sideways at Little Lonzo . " Yes , Ma . " " You look beautiful , Ma . " " Thet 's it , Ma , what Lonzo said . " Lou beamed at them . " Now run along , darlin 's . I 'll jus ' put up my hair in a knot in th ' back an ' be ready in a minute . Now do n't git yore clothes dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " t ' Miz Slovac an ' her nice new baby , but do n't bother her . Sarie Bell 's a-settin ' in thar b'side her , a-takin ' care o ' any of her needments , an ' she needs rest . So do n't bother about askin ' t ' see th ' baby . Hit 's such a puny thing . " Little Lonzo followed Addie Kate out of the trailer and stood outside the door with his hands clasped behind his back as he leaned against the trailer in the sunlight . He looked at the toes of his shoes , then glanced quickly up at Addie Kate , then down at his shoes again .   " Lonzo ! " Addie Kate was scolding him . But Little Lonzo did n't give her time . " I 'm goin ' t ' see th ' new baby , Addie Kate . An ' atter that I 'm a-goin ' t ' school . " As he walked across the open space between the two trailers Litt1 , e Lonzo looked toward the sun-whitened fog hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenue , drove down the muddy street , bumped over the curb and into the open field of the new trailer town , and all at once , there in the glistening opalescence of the fog between the sun and the earth , he saw a little schoolhouse in the morning shade of Piney Ridge , saw the bright leaves of the silver poplars along the wiggle road up through the holler , and the sound of the laughing children filled his heart with such a longing for the hills of home that he would carry it with him as long as they stayed here in this cold and desolate place . Oh , what was there here that made people come in such great droves ? he wondered . Oh , what was here . . 37ON THE LONG WALK from the mud lots to the low red-brick school Addie Kate and Little Lonzo sloshed along the slippery , mudcoatedstreets and played a game of guessing the next license plates they saw on the next trailer , the next carload of men and women they saw along the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only yesterday there had been but a few trailers in the mud lots , but . this morning it was as though a jam which clogged the roads had broken and cars and trailers by the scores had descended all at once on those soft and sloppy weed-grown lots , making there a new trailer town . There were sheepskin-coated men with stubble beards from the Dakotas , Minnesota , and Wisconsin who came by train and trailer , long , tall men and square-jawed women from Texas and Oklahoma and Kansas , Jews from New York , Massachusetts , and New Jersey , colored folk from Alabama and Louisi-P289ana and the Carolinas , and lean hillmen and farmers from Illinois , Tennessee , Kentucky , Arkansas , and Missouri ; men and their families from wherever the labor recruiters had gone , as far north as Wisconsin and North Dakota , as far south as New Orleans and Key West , and as far east as New York and Boston . Some came under contract , others on just the word that there were jobs , big pay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked their trailers just any old place , on the streets , behindbillboards which gave shelter from the wind , in vacant lots , down side roads  --  anywhere convenient to the group of new buildingsand the high board fence where the long line of men formed in front of the employment office of the shipyards . It was wonderful to Addie Kate , but to Little Lonzo it was something he could n't understand . There was nothing beautiful about this place . It was so crowded , and the wet and slippery streets were crowded with folks just walking , just seeing the sights , or standing in the sun and the sharp , cold wind and talking . As they entered the little town on the way to school , Little Lonzo saw that these people filled the stores , stood gaping at the shop windows , or wandered up and down just walking and getting the feel of the place . Some , like Lou , had already set out to take their young ones to one of the all too few schools in the place . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , ruffled dress and holding the hand of one child on one side and anotherchild on the other , she saw the line on the sidewalk , and it extended from the street up the steps of the school and into the principal'soffice . The line moved swiftly , however , and at last when Lou and Addie Kate and Little Lonzo entered the long hall whose polished linoleum floor was tracked with the dried mud of hundreds of children , a woman met them at the door and ushered them quietly into an office . There another woman behind a desk looked up over her glasses at Lou . " I want t ' enter my young ' uns in school , ma'am , " Lou said . " We jus ' come hyar yest'iddy , but I do n't want ' em t ' miss a day . " The woman first observed Addie Kate and Little Lonzo , then she contemplated Lou ; she seemed more interested in , the dress Lou wore than anything else at the moment . She leaned over the desk ,   surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Lonzo saw the meaning of the look the woman gave his ma , and he shifted his weight from one foot to the other . His ma apparently had forgotten all about the dress , and she mistook the woman 's smile for something else . But Lonzo understood it . " My , but that 's  --  that 's a pretty dress you 're wearing . " The woman smiled . " Are you going to a party ? " Lou looked down at her bosom and the broad starched expanse of the flared skirt . " No , ma'am . Hit 's a dress I made m'self , five year ago . I just sorta saved hit fer good  --  cai n't afford t ' wear hit ever ' day . " The woman adjusted her glasses , cleared her throat , and switched suddenly to the work at hand . " Now let me see , how many childrenare you registering this morning ? " She still regarded the dress with a humorous glance , Little Lonzo observed . " Two hyar , an ' one more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school t'morry , if hit 's all right , ma'am . " " What are the names and ages ? " Lou gave them , starting with Sarie Bell . When she came to Little Lonzo , she said , " My least ' un , Little Lonzo , war jus ' permoted t ' th ' fifth grade afore we left Happy Holler  --  to th ' fifth grade , ma'am . " " Where did you say they went to school ? " " Happy Holler , ma'am . That 's in th ' Ozarks . Jus ' a little old country school , but a good ' un . I went thar m'self , an ' so 'd all my folks afore me . " " I see , " the woman said , writing something on a little white card for each of Lou 's three children . " You 're from Missouri ? " " Lord , no ! We ' uns is from Arkansas , ma'am , " Lou exclaimed with pride . The woman looked up from the little white cards . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over ever ' which way , ma'am , " Lou explained . " Some 's in Missouri , some 's in Arkansas . Th ' part in Arkansasis th ' purtiest , o ' course . " " Of course . " The woman erased what she had last written andP291corrected the card , then folded her hands on her desk . " Now I 'll have to explain a few things , Mrs. Hoxie . " " I allowed they 'd be a little trouble at first , ma'am . I know th ' system is not like hit is in Arkansas , leastways , in the Ozarks , where th ' young ' uns read out loud  --  ' study-out , ' they call hit . " " Naturally , " the woman said , patiently . " But what I wanted to explain , Mrs. Hoxie , is this : Last year we had 6,300 children registered . An average of twenty-seven to a room . That is considered the largest classroom load that is consistent with good teaching standards . " " Yes , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were only twenty-seven children , representing all grades . The principal tapped her pencil on the desk . " Before the war we had ample teaching facilities , but since so many people have come here , we have n't the space or personnel adequate to meet the demands . So we have had to rearrange things a little . " Lou nodded understandingly . " Anythin ' that 'll give my young ' uns good - " " What I 'm trying to explain , Mrs. Hoxie , is that we are in the process of making changes . Temporarily , we have arranged classes on a two-a-day basis . One group begins at seven o'clock in the morningand the other begins at one o'clock in the afternoon . " " That sounds all right , ma'am . " " Let me continue , please , " the woman said , tapping her pencil impatiently . " If the present in-migration continues , we shall have to divide our classes into three or four a day . That , of course , is not the problem of the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that having your children in school only half a day places an added burden upon the parents . " Lou agreed that it would . " There are no playgrounds , Mrs. Hoxie . No supervised recreation . The juvenile delinquency rate is serious " Th ' what , ma'am ? " Lou did n't understand . " The juvenile delinquency . By that I mean minor infractions of the law , and so forth , " the teacher explained . " We ' uns do n't aim t ' have no fractions with th ' law , ma'am ! " The woman was a little slow in grasping Lou 's meaning , but at last she went on to explain : " What I am saying is that idle children , with little or no parental supervision , get into trouble . They associate with delinquents , and they are bound to get into trouble . " Lou swept Addie Kate and Little Lonzo against her , protec- tively . " I 'll kill anyone that gits one o ' my girls in trouble ! " The teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mrs. Hoxie . I just wanted to explain that under the present crowded conditions which do not permit your children to attend school all day , you 'll have your hands full . " Lou hugged her children close to her and looked into the face of each , then up at the principal , and with a proud fling of her head , she said , " I want m ' han 's full , ma'am . They 're mine , ma'am , an ' I want ya t ' know thet I 'm perfectly well an ' able t ' take keer o ' my own young ' uns . " The principal nodded encouragingly . " I did n't mean to offend , Mrs. Hoxie . I just wanted to say that a very bad element has come to this community . Naturally we must protect the children while they are in school , but when they are home , the rest is up to the parents . " Lou smiled and said firmly , " I reckon I know what 's right an ' what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git m ' young ' uns signed up an ' entered in school . I want t ' keep my little of family t'gether as long as I can , ma'am , an ' I had t ' come plumb out hyar t ' do hit . Now if usin ' th ' hickory a little now an ' then will keep ' em in line , ma'am , I give you my consent t ' give ' em a lavish of hit when hit 's needed . " The principal held up both hands and shook her head . " That 's old-fashioned , Mrs. Hoxie . Children nowadays should be talked to , consulted , reasoned with . " Lou eyed her sharply . " Th ' only reasonin ' I ever saw that ever did a young ' un any good , ma'am , was t ' be found at th ' business end o ' a good peach-tree switch . Now maybe if ya used a little o ' thet , maybe thar would n't be none of this fraction with th ' law you 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The principal rose . " I suppose you know how to keep a control over your children . " " You 're clang right , ma'am , " Lou said with a firm nod . " ButP293what I want t ' know is , are ye a-goin ' t ' take my young ' uns or ai n't ya . " The principal walked around the desk and put her hands on the heads of Addie Kate and Little Lonzo , and she smiled down upon them . " Of course we 'll take them . I 'll show them to their classroomsnow . " " How about schoolbooks , ma'am ? " " They 're free , Mrs. Hoxie . " " Free ? " " That 's right . " " Then if they 're free , ma'am , " Lou said , anxiously , " I want ' em t ' git all they can git . Thar hai n't nothin ' too good fer my young ' uns , ma'am . " The teacher took Little Lonzo and Addie Kate by the hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to do is to perform your duty as a parent and keep them under control . " " I 'll do thet , ma'am , " Lou exclaimed with finality . " An ' they 'll be hyar ever ' day , although they hafta walk all th ' way from th ' flat lots down by th ' water , ma'am . " The teacher stopped and turned around . " But that 's more than a mile away ! " " Hit 's all right , ma'am . They 're used t ' walkin ' . " " We 'll have to see what we can do about transportation for the little ones who live so far away . " Lou followed the principal out of the door of her office and into the hall where they were being led down between the dark , silent , and empty walls . She called after them , and her voice echoed down the long corridor . " Now darlin 's , mind yore teacher . . . " Little Lonzo turned suddenly and saw the light as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something about his ma , the way she stood with her hands clasped at her bosom and with the light showing through her hair , that reminded him of the angel with the folded wings in Piney Ridge cemetery . The principalpulled him along gently , and when he turned around to look at his ma the second time , she was gone .   BACK in Mrs. Slovac 's trailer Lou worked swiftly at tidying up the place and caring for the baby . At last she sat on the overturned pail and remarked the milky whiteness of Mrs. Slovac 's complexion , the color in her cheeks , and the clear brightness in her eyes . " Fer a few days atter childbirth , Oriana , " she explained , " yore skin will be like the color o ' good rich cream , an ' to th ' touch , hit will be like velvet . " Oriana 's face glowed . " She had a good long nap , Ma , " Sarie Bell said . " She went t ' sleep d'reckly atter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyv.s . An ' her little darlin ' baby boy , he ai n't cried or whimpered once't . " " I had a good rest , Lou , " Oriana said , sighing . " I 'm not so much worried about my baby any more . " Lou was relieved . " He 's a quiet little young ' un , honey . " Lou went to the basket , lifted him , carried him over to his mother , and laid him beside her breast . " I cai n't say , Oriana , whether he favors his ma or his pa . " Oriana pressed his little body against her and watched him as he took the nipple in his mouth , and his little nostrils wiggled as he breathed and nursed at her breast . Finally she glanced up at Lou . " I want to find a nice place for him , Lou , as soon as I 'm able . We can get a little apartment somewhere . I 'll put him in his basket out in the sun and let him grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sticky mud and the low-hanging morning fog , and all at once her thoughts went back . " I recollect in Happy Holler , " she began , and told how she had placed Little Lonzo in a tomato crate , all lined nicely with muslin , and let him lie out in the orchard and look up at the sky and the dancing leaves of the old pear tree blowing in the breeze . All his life Little Lonzo had loved the outdoors . Maybe too much of it had been the causeP295of his sickness . But Vigo always claimed , she recollected , that it was their old dogtrot house with the loose puncheon floor and the cracks in the chinking which let in the whistling wind . As Lou and Oriana talked , the conversation finally came around to Lou 's dress , and she rose and stood before the foot of Oriana 's bed and let her see the magnificence of it . She told Oriana how the principal had remarked about it . " Hit made all th ' folks along th ' way stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way Oriana eyed it quickly , smiled , and looked away made Lou ask , " Hai n't hit all right , honey ? " " Of course it 's all right , Lou . Only maybe it 's a little formal for so early in the day . " " Hit 's th ' best I got , " Lou remarked with pride as she pressed down gently over the starched smoothness . " Maybe hit 's too fine fer these folks . Maybe I ort t ' put hit back in th ' old English lavenderan ' save hit fer good  --  fer rale good . " Oriana nodded . " Maybe you had . " Then she avoided Lou 's eyes as she contemplated the red face of little Pete , her son , feeding at her breast . " When I 'm able to be up , Lou , I 'd like to take you shopping with me . I 'd like to take you through the big department stores and let you see all the nice things they have there . I could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . " " I 'd like thet , Oriana . I 'd like thet right well . " Lou glanced down at the ruffles of her dress as she began to realizewhat Oriana was trying to tell her . Once before , out there on the prairie when Hogan had suggested to Vigo that he buy her a new dress , Lou had felt this way . Now , however , Oriana did not mean to make fun of her . " I never bought no dress in my life , Oriana . I always made ' em in'self . Made all my young ' uns ' things , an ' shirts fer Vigo , as is a woman 's duty whar we ' uns come from . Our family always made their own things . Washed the wool and carded hit , spun hit and dyed hit an ' then threaded th ' loom an ' made homespun . All our woolens we spun at home , and when we wanted cotton things , we used flour sacks for th ' coarser things an ' sugar sacks for th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she found out about Vigo and Mamie . And then he thought of Lou , all alone out there , and Vigo mixed up with another woman , and Lou with no one to turn to , and the thought of all this filled him with such fear that , for a minute or two , he was on the verge of telling her everything he knew about Mamie and Vigo . Uncle Yancey knew a lot , a lot that people never suspected anyone else in the world knew or had a way of finding out . " Hit ai n't worth it , Lou , " he started to say , getting up enough courage at last . " Hit jest ai n't worth it . " Lou shook her head . " Nothin ' you can say will make me change m ' mind , Uncle Yancey . M ' mind 's made up . I 'm a-goin ' , an ' I 'm a-goin ' if give up this place , an ' I 'm a-takin ' my young ' uns with me  --  Little Lonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an ' I 'm a-goin ' t ' be with m ' darlin ' Vigo till th ' end . " Uncle Yancey sat there for a while , and at last he decided that this was Lou 's right , to be with her husband , and there was nothing he could say that would change her mind now . She was a woman , full-grown and strong , and she knew her own mind , knew what was best for her and what was best for her young ones . After a while he rose and started to go . It was hours after midnight , and he had a piece to walk to get to his own little cabin , down in the holler . " Do n't go , Uncle Yancey , " she said . " I want you t ' set hyar an ' wait for Vigo with me . I 'm a-goin ' t ' wait up for him . " " But it 's cold , Lou , honey , " he said . " Why do n't you turn in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he comes home I 'll wake you and you can tell him . " " No , " she said . " I 'm a-gonna set hyar an ' wait fer Vigo . Even if it 's mawnin ' afore he comes . I 'm a-goin ' if wait fer m ' darlin ' Vigo . " Uncle Yancey shook his head wearily and came back and sat down on the edge of the gallery . " You can go in an ' lay down , Uncle Yancey , " she said . " You can have my bed , ' cause I wo n't be needin ' hit t'night . " " No , " he told her , " I 'll wait up with you until Vigo gits home , even if it 's daylight when he finally comes . "  |p136IT  WAS IN THE COLD GRAY of early morning when Vigo and Judd and Mamie drove up the hill in Judd 's Studebaker wagon , and the mules stopped beside the barn and Judd and Vigo hopped out besideit . The wagon was loaded with lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn . And they unloaded two rubber-tired wheels and an axle and a pair of springs , and a new hardwood wagon tongue  --  everything Vigo needed to build the trailer Mamie and Judd had persuaded him to build . Lou and Uncle Yancey sat on the gallery and watched them unloadthe lumber and the wheels and heard the murmur of their voices as they talked about it . Finally Judd climbed back into the wagon and sat down beside Mamie and backed his mules until the wagon was ready to start rolling down the hill . The misty dimness of the early morning light was rising fast , and Lou and Uncle Yancey could see the outline of their faces , and they appeared to be quarreling . Finally Judd slapped the reins over the backs of his mules , and the mules braced their legs and pulled back so that the wagon tongue came up between their heads as they held the wagon back . Vigo stood with his hands braced on his hips as he watched them go down the hill , and he was still so standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road across the ridge toward the Cossey place . Then Vigo gave his attention to the lumber and other things he had piled by the side of the barn . " They had a fraction , Lou , " Uncle Yancey said . " Vigo an ' Judd an ' Mamie had a fallin ' out ; I could tell by th ' way they all three was a-actin ' . " Lou pulled her shawl closely around her throat and rose from her rocker . " I 'll go down an ' see Vigo , " she said calmly . " An ' I 'll go along , Lou , " Uncle Yancey volunteered . " No , " Lou said &bravely.; " I got t ' face him m'self . I got t ' tell him my decision . "
