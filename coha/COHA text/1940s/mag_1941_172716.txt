One day last week the British expected to start 225 Nazis rolling from Teheran for internment in India ; the Russians had earmarked 50 for Soviet sojourn .

Says an Arab proverb : There are three plagues in the world-the Kurd , the rat and the locust . <P> &gt; The fierce tribes in the southwest were reported rising . <P> &gt; In Kermanshah disbanded Iranian soldiers were reported peddling their new German rifles in the bazaars . <P> &gt; Food was running short . <P> &gt; This week it was reported the royal bootsman had abdicated.
