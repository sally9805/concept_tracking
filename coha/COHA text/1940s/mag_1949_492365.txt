The Big Ancestor Hunt By MILTON LEHMAA1 Could it be that you are descended from Thomas Jefferson , Richard the Lion Hearted , or Lady Godiva ? Have you ever wondered if you are kin to Lizzie Borden , Typhoid Mary , or Jesse James ? It 's questions like these that keep thousands of people busily checking up on the family tree . ALTHOUGH it 's a rare American who knows his own great-grandfather , thousands today are eagerly tracking him down . In Pennsylvania they search for his will in ancient courthouse records . In Massachusetts they value the pedigree more than the family silver . In New Jersey they band together as the Tombstone Hounds , seeking clues to the family tree in abandoned cemeteries . From Los Angeles to Long Island , the ancestor hunters are trying to find where they came from . The genealogy room at the Library of Congress , in Washington , D.C. , is one of the happiest hunting grounds , a lush forest of family trees where grandfathers roost on every branch . Here , less than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . in funereal quiet . Most of them are aging , and some are grandfathers themselves , but nothing distracts them from their daily task , neither the snows of winter nor the first robins of spring . Even on the hottest days last summer they crowded the reading tables . There was a former bank president , searching the records of Fauquier County , Virginia , to find his great-great-grandfather . Near by , a stolid dowager was preparing her lineage for application to the Daughters of the American Revolution . ' Next to her , a retired engineer was intently adding pages to his family history , already five generations long . Directly across sat a newcomer , a little gray-haired lady in a threadbare jacket . Shy and uncertain where to begin , she appealed for help . Patiently , the ex-engineer told her how to prepare a family chart , how to trace herself back from generation to generation . The little novice had spectacular luck . In the first week , she discovered her great-grandfather . In the second , she backtracked to the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century , she became greatly excited , talking to herself and whispering to her neighbors . " Madam ! " the engineer finally exploded . " A little more quiet , please ! " " Sir , " the lady snapped back , " I 'll have you know I 'm descended from William the Conqueror ! " Today , more Americans are rushing headlong into the past than ever before in our history , embracing the ghosts of kings and founding fathers . Genealogy always has gained impetus with each crisis in the Republic . It is now a national pastime . When the nation was founded , there was of course , no provision for hereditary rank . The founding fathers , eagerly escaping from their ancestors , were more concerned about where they were going than where they 'd come from . But now the ghosts of the fathers themselves are the prime ancestors of all . It 's a long , hard job discovering whom you come from . " It takes a lot out of you , " says Mrs. Mittie Dorsey Egger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent twenty years tracing various branches of her family to fifteen Revolutionary soldiers . " But you end up with pride , and it 's always a comfort to know you 're well descended . " The ex-engineer compares his efforts with the feat of the salmon , jumping the rapids to reach his spawning ground . " The work is exhausting , " he says . " You 've got to beat your way upstream and you 've got to fight the current . " Despite these difficulties , today 500 persons a week pad silently through the marble halls of the Library of Congress to the genealogical sanctum . Most of them are determined amateurs , returning each morning with jammed brief cases , sharpened pencils and fresh hope . Others are from out of town , rushing in on week-end visits after renting inexpensive rooms in near-by hotels . Some are professionals , busily tracking a client 's lineage for substantial fees . " Nowadays , " declared a brisk professional genealogist , " we do n't go looking for work . The work comes to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good psychiatrist . " Although the ancestor hunters are jealous of the calm and often spiritual atmosphere of the room , there are occasional disturbance &; Not long ago they were outraged when a crowd of noisy folk stampeded the room trying to find among the musty historical documents the identity of Mrs. Hush , for which a radio program offered a vast assortment of worldly goods . Others have come to the book-lined room to prove their kinship to large unclaimed estates , such as the Garrett fortune , left by a childless Philadelphia snuff merchant . Several years ago the reference stacks were overrun by claimants to an estate reportedly left by one William Buchanan , brother of President James Buchanan . The estate was said to be valued at $850,000,000 , including a sizable portion of real estate in midtown Manhattan . For months , Buchanan and their collateral cousins were absorbed with their ancestors , some of them claiming direct descent from the President , who had died a bachelor . There was so much noise from the Buchanans and protest from the steady clientele that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a myth and suggesting that the fortune hunters go home . For the amateur genealogists , yesterdays of marching knights and prancing steeds are always more fascinating than today 's drab realities . " What 's gone before , " says Mrs. Edith Ashby Turnbull , paraphrasing the poet , " is prelude to the future . " Mrs. Turnbull , a determined lady of Scotch-Irish descent who uses neither lipstick nor rouge , is still trying to convince her husband of the value of ancestors . Mr. Turnbull works daytime as a shipping clerk in a Washington furniture store , and when he comes home evenings , he wants his dinner . " Sometimes I get lost in my work , " Mrs. Turnbull says , " and dinner is n't ready . I try to explain to the mister that ancestors are important , but he does n't seem to understand . " Mrs. Turnbull , however , has had remarkable success in tracing her family line . She began her research in 1934 , remembering her father 's vague suspicion that the Ashbys were descended from the Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " she says , " was that daddy lived in Kentucky . " Since then , Mrs. Turnbull has tracked back through yellowing courthouse records in three states . She has studied ancient wills , explored abandoned cemeteries and plodded through the Congressional Library 's references to the Ashbys and their related kin . On her fiftieth birthday a few months ago , Mrs. Turnbull spent her day as usual at the library . " There 's so much more to be done , " she says wearily . Evenings , after the dishes are washed and put away , Mrs. Turnbull tells her husband of her di3-coveries . She points with pride to Gen. Steven Ashby , who helped settle Kentucky and killed a hundred Indians , and to John Ashby , who was a chain carrier for George Washington when the Father of His Country was a young surveyor . She talks of Grandfather Joseph Sylvester McCoy , who was assistant adjutant general for the War Department , and of her ancestors , the Shepherds , who served with Daniel Boone and may have been related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voluminous files in a large trunk , many ancestor hunters are preparing their findings for publication . These family histories range from mimeographed folders to ornately printed volumes . For the average amateur of modest means , the cost of publication must be borne by subscription of interested cousins , uncles and nephews . " Sometimes , " says John McGill , a white-haired enthusiast from Warrenton , Virginia , " it 's a problem to please your subscribers and still remain faithful to the facts . " Mr. McGill has chosen to stick to the facts . In his research of the McGill ancestry , he discovered that most of his kin were ministers , physicians and public servants . But he did not close his eyes to a distant cousin named Mackall , a professional dancer who was disowned by his family and changed his name . When the dancer and his wife appeared in a floor show at a Washington hotel recently , the sedate Mr. McGill spent an evePHOTOGRAPHY BY OLLIE ATKINS ning with them . " And I enjoyed every minute of it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore them , but I told them , By jingo , they 've got McGill blood and in they go ! ' " Now nearing seventy , Mr. McGill leads a Spartan life . Since his retirement a few years ago from the Department of the Interior , he has devoted full time to his father 's family and to the Beverleys , his mother 's ascendants . Between the two branches , he has discovered 14,000 blood relations . Both of his own children are married , and McGill makes his home and working quarters with a maiden sister . On days when he works at home , he gets to his books at 7:30 . At noon his sister leaves a luncheon tray at his door without disturbing him . The McGill Family History , with an index alone of 150 pages , is now almost complete . Before it 's printed , however , the author plans to sail to Scotland to verify some of his ancestors . " I 'm leaving this behind for my children , " he says , " and I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quest for accuracy , McGill has paitistakingly checked thousands of ancient documents . He has also visited several cemeteries in Maryland and Virginia to study the names on tombstones . In the venerable Mt . Olivet Cemetery of Frederick , Maryland , the stones were so overgrown with moss and lichens that he was obliged to scrape them clean with a board . At another graveyard , long abandoned , most of the stones were gone and the rest were mysteriously rubbed smooth . An aged farmer near by recollected that the graveyard had once been next to a hogpen ' and that the stones had been rubbed by the animals scratching their backs . ( Continued on rage 819 ) THE BIG ANCESTOR HUNT ( Confirmed from Page 23 ) Unlike many of his colleagues , Mr. McGill has declined to join any of the numerous hereditary orders , although he has turned up enough ancestors to qualify him for several . Today there are more than 100 of these societies in America , most of which , like the General Society of Mayflower Descendants , the Daughters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are content with ancestry traced back to the American pioneers . Others , however , go far beyond colonial days into the royal and noble houses of Eilrope . The Order of the Crown of Charlemagne , for example , requires pedigrees running back to the Frankish monarch . And the Baronial Order of Runnymede , founded by a Philadelphia businessman , is open only to Americans related to the English barons who watched the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 . Perhaps the most exclusive of these societies is the Order of the First Crusade , established in 1934 by a California lawyer named Howard Kellogg James . Mr. James required that his members beat their way back to 1096 and prove their descent , as he did , from one of the seven leaders of the First Crusade . Of all the ancestor clubs , the Daughters of the American Revolution is the best known and least exclusive . To join the D.A.R. , a candidate must merely prove the " service " of a forefather in the Revolution . It is not required that the ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for substitutes make as eligible ancestors as the Revolutionary soldiers themselves . Today the D.A.R . has a membership of 150,000 , and the waiting lists of itsnationwide chapters are swollen . To meet the current boom , the D.A.R . headquarters in the nation 's capital has appointed well-established members to investigate the qualifications of applicants . Mrs. William F. Hellmuth , a high-spirited lady , spends her days between the Library of Congress and the D.A.R . ' s own library of Revolutionary records . " I 'm a verifier , " Mrs. Hellmuth explains . " We try to be sure that the ladies do n't trace themselves back to the wrong ancestors . A long time ago one of the Daughters came in on Heze kiah Royce , who fought in the Battle o . Bennington . It was n't until long after that we found there were two Hezekiah Royces , and the one she came from was actually a Tory . We do n't want that to happen again . " Mrs. Hellmuth , who belongs not only to the D.A.R . but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1812 and the United Daughters of the Confederacy , devoutly believes in her ancestors . " If we do n't care who our ancestors are , " she says , " we wo n't care who our progeny are . " Because the ancestor societies require elaborate pedigrees , many joiners turn to the professional genealogist for help . The Library of Congress and other institutions with genealogy collections supply lists of competent professionals who are skilled in research and know how to unearth the necessary ancestor in the shortest possible time . Harry W. Newman , a bland , experienced Washington professional , has brought many a client face to face with his forebears . " It 's dig , dig , dig , " says Mr. Newman . " For one client , I worked fifteen years , but I finally took her back to the Puritans . The trouble was finding the right wills in the county courthouses . Last testaments are always helpful , because they give the names of the heirs . In genealogy , we always say , ' Where there 's a will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Page 82 ) ( Continued front Page 80 ) Mr. Newman , whose own line ascends to William the Conqueror , is a scrupulous craftsman . Before taking on a new client , he warns him that he 'll supply only the truth , letting the forebears fall where they may . A few years ago , he recalls , a lady from Maryland told him she 'd been invited to join the Society of Americans of Royal Descent , provided she could supply the necessary lineage . " It should n't be too hard , " she said . " My father always said we were descended from French royalty and that his great-great-grandfather was the son of a duke . " Mr. Newman noted the lady 's name and was somewhat skeptical . " I told her I 'd never heard the name before , " he relates , " but she commissioned me to go ahead . I went back from her father to her grandfather to her great-grandfather , using census records and visiting courthouses . After that , it got tough . Five generations back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , I stumbled on the man who should have been a grandson of the duke . " It was very discouraging , " Mr. Newman remembers . " The grandson turned up as a river stevedore on Chesapeake Bay , and he was so illiterate that he signed his will with an X. Well , I could n't go back any farther . There was nothing more to do , so I brought the family chart to the lady and said , ' I 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is . ' She took one look at the chart and threw it across the room . " Some pedigree practitioners are willing to " prove " their client 's descent from any given ancestor . " If you find the customer what he wants , " one of them argues , " why should anyone object ? " Not long ago , however , the United States postal authorities did object to a Washington outfit known as the Media Research Bureau . Media advertised in newspapers and magazines that it would supply family histories for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " distinguished American families . " For a slightly higher fee , Media also supplied " genuine coats of arms , illuminated and handsomely mounted . " More scrupulous genealogists objected mildly that thousands of unrelated families travel under the same name , and that Media 's charts could seldom bring you within hailing distance of your own kin . When the English first used surnames , for example , the names Lee , which meant " meadow , " and Cooper or Smith , which referred to trades , were adopted all over the island . Today , there is only the faintest chance that any given Lee is kin to Gen. Robert E. Lee . Media went out of business before the Post Office Department completed its investigation . The reason for this sudden departure , according to the Washington professionals , was that Media tried to sell former Secretary Harold L. Ickes an Ickes coat of arms . " Nobody 's ever found a coat of arms for my family , " the old curmudgeon roared , " and plenty of people have tried . " At best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Ickes family entirely . Mr. Ickes ' impatience with the whole thing  --  an impatience shared by many Americans ? is , of course , in line with the philosophy upon which this coun-try was founded . The Declaration of Independence decreed that all men were created equal , and by this injunction the pioneer genealogists felt restrained . For a long time , ancestor worship in America was nothing like that in Europe , where the Italian family of Colonna , for instance , mounted beside its coat of arms a painting of the Last Judgment , showing four generations of Colonnas ascending to heaven , assisted by kindly angels . In the last century , when ancestor hunting was still in its infancy , a French lecturer named Paul Bourget scolded American audiences for not knowing their great-grandfathers . Mark Twain replied that most Frenchmen did n't even know who t heir fathers were . Since then , however , America has become as grandfather-conscious as any nation on earth . Not only the impecunious gentlewoman but many of the country 's leaders have found their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor Charlemagne . Herbert Hoover , through his brother 's wife , is kin to King David I , of Scotland . While the vogue in ancestors has changed through the ages , William the Conqueror , who defeated the English in 1066 , is still one of America 's favorite forebears . In the early days of the republic , the American Indian was considered a poor relation by the ancestor-minded . But today , many Americans pride themselves on Indian forebears . The Indian was first made respectable as an ancestor by the second Mrs. Woodrow Wilson , who announced her descent from John Rolfe , of Virginia , and Pocahontas , the daughter of Chief Powhatan . Some genealogists go in for the science of heredity . Among the Washington ancestor hunters , the expert on this subject is probably Herbert F. Seversmith , whose name was originally plain Smith . A short , stocky bachelor , Seversmith works solemnly by day in a Government office . In the evenings , and on week ends and holidays , he puts on a sport shirt and turns avidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetics , Mr. Sever-smith points out the fallacy of considering your ancestors a part of yourself . His theory is rather involved , going back to the way the sex cell is formed of wandering chromosomes through a mysterious joining process known as synapsis . " The way synapsis works , " Seversmith declares , " it 's even possible not to be descended from your own grandparents . As a result , I 'm just as interested in my great-grandfather , who threw his daughter out the first-floor window , as in my **28;3546;TOOLONG , who came over on the Mayflower . " Mr. Seversmith declines to take on paying customers , but he has known the greatest professional genealogists of the day . Although there are some 20,000 practicing professionals at present , he considers only twenty or thirty truly distinguished . His favorite genealogist was a spectacular gentleman named Charles A. Hoppin , whom he met in the NewYork Public Library during his salad days in ancestor hunting . Mr. Hoppin was then digging up ancestors for the late Evalyn Walsh McLean , daughter of a millionaire mineowner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he eventually succeeded in grafting to George Washington 's family tree , kept Mr. Hoppin busy for five years and brought him $50,000 . " The old gentleman took a liking to me , " Seversmith recalls , " because I loved to sit and listen to him . He had a handsome white beard he combed in the middle , and he was always popping peppermint candies into his mouth . He had overwhelming contempt for everybody else in the business . " From old Mr. Hoppin , Seversmith learned to be skeptical of all genealogies , and he became a tireless opponent of error in ancestry . It cheered him greatly to disprove an elaborate genealogy prepared for a Cromwell family in Westchester , Connecticut , which ( Co el on Pose 81 ) 84 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 15,1919 ? ? ? ( Continued from Page 82 ) claimed descent from Oliver Cromwell . But his masterpiece of detection was his critique of the celebrated family history of one Clarence E. Pearsall , a wealthy California lumber dealer . The Pearsall genealogy , published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who produced it for the lumberman at a cost of about $70,000 . The genealogist not only took the Pearsalls through pioneer America but also carried them back to a medieval spawning ground through Rollo , the Dane , who conquered Normandy in the tenth century . He also suggested , through complicated charting , that the Pearsall path wound on through forgotten centuries to Odin , the deity of Norse mythology . Seversmith ran afoul of this monumental work while searching his own ancestry for a woman named Pearsall-Brush . " When I started on the Pear-Balls , " he says , " everything went sour . " The key to the American Pearsalls , Seversmith discovered , was an emigrant ancestor named Thomas , who had supposedly come to Long Island , New York , from Warwickshire , England , to found the family . " I looked everywhere for Thomas Pearsall , but I could n't find a trace , " Seversmith says . " It was impossible to stop at that . " Months later , he published a report in the American Genealogist , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pearsall genealogy , " he wrote , " has developed an exceedingly unsatisfactory state of affairs of alleged published relationships which we can not possibly concede to be correct . " With skill and scholarly phrase , Seversmith unwound the Pearsall family and examined the wreckage . " No such Thomas Pearsall , " he claimed , " has ever existed on Long Island ! " In Washington veteran ancestor hunters gather monthly for lively chapter meetings of the American Society of Genealogists . The society is often called on to settle disputes over forebears . The most . bitter conflict among the hunters , however , is preserved in a remarkable volume in the Library of Congress called Pedigrees of Some of the Emperor Charlemagne 's Descendants . The book was edited by Prof. Arthur Adams , an eminent genealogist and regent general of the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne . Recently a scholar examined the volume and discovered , in the margins flanking Professor Adams ' text , a running comment written in a furious , shaking hand with indelible pencil . Beside the professor 's injunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angry critic scrawled , " How about yourself , Professor Adams ? " Elsewhere beside the professor 's academic text the hand has inscribed : " You are a past master of the above which you accuse others of doing . " " The Society of Colonial Wars has many members with faked lineage sponsored by Professor Adams . " " Pretty fishy , Professor Adams , " and , in a final fury , " Your grandfather , Arthur Adams , is decidedly not Blood Royal ! " No one ever caught this critic in the act of penciling these slurs , but Washington genealogists strongly suspect that Professor Adams ' invisible foe was a candidate turned down by the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne . While most ancestor hunters are sharply scrutinized by their colleagues , none has yet disproved the elaborate claims of the late Orra Eugene Monnette . Mr. Monnette , a ponderous banker from Los Angeles , produced more volumes of personal ancestry and joined more patriotic societies than anyone else in the nation . His seven-volume treatise called First Settlers of Piscataway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research but a bewildering assortment of personal tributes from his friends and employees , family photographs , memoranda to his secretary , poems , injunctions to his children and business correspondence . " We 'll never unravel Monnette , " one of his critics observes . " We do n't know where to start . " Mr. Monnette belonged to sixty-one historical and patriotic societies . He belonged to the foremost noble and regal clans  --  the Baronial Order of Runnymede , the Colonial Society of Americans of Royal Descent , the Society of the Descendants of the Kings of the Most Noble Order of the Garter , the Society of the Imperial Order of the Yellow Rose . He belonged , furthermore , to such other groups as the Order of the White Crane , the Order of the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe , the Military Order of Pulaski and the Piscataqua Pioneers of New Hampshire . The beginning ancestor hunter , however , will be wise to postpone thoughts of Runnymede and the Order of the Garter and get to work first on his next of kin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Gilbert Harry Doane , a veteran genealogist whose Searching for Your Ancestors is a textbook for amateurs . Mr. Doane cautions his students to proceed backward with care . " If you try to get too much information at any one time , you will risk the displeasure of the person to whom you are talking , " he says . But you must n't be too slow about it , either . " Talk to the old folks and get everything you can from them , " he suggests . " They have a positive genius for dying just before you decide to go back to them for further informa tion . " From his own experience , Mr. Doane proposes that the beginner take his grandfather and great-aunt out to the family cemetery to study the tombstones . " It will jog their memory and recall many details you might otherwise miss , " he says . " This way you will save yourself much time and trouble . " Several hunters have pushed their claims all the way back to Adam . George Edward Congdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady named Mrs. Robert Richardson Gum , of Frankfort , Kentucky , have both accomplished that feat , and lived to publish their findings . Mrs. Gum flew backward through time from America to France to Scotland to Ireland , where she discovered the Irish kings of the pre-Christian era , one of whose daughters married King Zedekiah , of Judah . In that misty past , with the help of a Gideon Bible , she raced on breathlessly through Jacob , Isaac and Abraham , through Noah and Methuselah , Cain and Seth . And then , 156 generations removed from Frankfort , Kentucky , she joined herself to Adam and Eve . But the experts were not much impressed . Aside from the fact that all of us are presumably descendants of Adam and Eve , a veteran hunter named Henry Kendall long ago concluded that everybody everywhere was related to everybody else . His theory followed a statistical study of the way ancestors multiply . " You begin with two parents , " he observed . " That gives you four grandparents and eight great-grandparents . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in twenty you have 1,098,576 . And if you dare go back to Adam , you have a downright foolish situation to contend with . " That would be 5000 years ago , according to my figures , " Mr. Kendall declared , " and your ancestors would add up to **27;3576;TOOLONG , - **32;3605;TOOLONG "
