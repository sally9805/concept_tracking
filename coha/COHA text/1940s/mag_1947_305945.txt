At exactly 3:52 of a wintry Chicago afternoon in 1942 , a scientist working in the University of Chicago 's tightly guarded athletic field house dryly announced : " The curve is exponential . " The speaker was Dr. Enrico Fermi ; his four quiet words meant that a chain reaction had just been successfully brought about in the experimental uranium pile . Last week a TIME correspondent witnessed the unveiling of a plaque to mark the site : <P> The air was damp and chilling . Overhead , leaden black clouds were pushed across the sky by a gusty wind . The snow on the street was flecked with coal dust and dirt . It was melting slowly , producing desolate puddles of cold water . <P> To the right of the field house 's entrance stood a somber platform draped with faded purple and new black bunting . Radio men puttered about , four microphones . Photographers arrived . <P> A little crowd gathered-mostly students in odds &; ends of G.I. clothing . A young man with a red face , an Army combat jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . " What 's happening , Mac ? " he asked . I told him they were going to unveil a plaque marking the approximate spot where the atom bomb started five years ago this afternoon . " They ai n't makin ' no bombs there now , are they ? " he asked . I told him I did n't think so . He said : " Wadda ya know " and went back down in the excavation . <P> Weather-beaten George Mirandi came out of the field house and looked up at the wall . " I was in there five years ago this afternoon , " he said . " I was a security guard , but I did n't know what I was guarding . If I knew then what I know now , well , brother , I would have started running and would n't have stopped until I was eight miles north of Evanston . " <P> A blue bus arrived from downtown and a lot of important-looking people got out . You could n't miss tall , grey Robert Maynard Hutchins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The important people mounted the platform and the photographers started taking pictures . <P> Hutchins looked around . " Where 's Fermi ? " he called . Several underlings started yelling for Fermi . He was standing in the dirty snow talking about the atom . I asked him how it was five years ago . He said shyly : " Well , it was awfully cold , and there was a wind blowing . " I asked him how he felt when the curve was " exponential . " " I did n't think much of anything because I knew it was going to work , " he said . And what did he feel this afternoon , five years later ? He looked at the slush and shrugged his shoulders : " Well , for better or for worse , it 's here . . . . " He grinned through his teeth and mounted the platform . A photographer yelled : " Hey , Fermi , take off your hat . "                 @ @ @ @
