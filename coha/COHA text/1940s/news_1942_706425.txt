txt It was not disclosed here tonight in just what form the Russians had communicated to the British Government their fears that Germany was planning to use poison gas against them . However , it was the belief in diplomatic circles here that matters must have gone far for Prime Minister Winston Churchill to have uttered his grim , forthright warning . The warning was cited as further proof of the unity and solidarity in which Britain and the Soviet Union are standing side by side against the common foe . To the British people gas is the most repugnant form of warfare , but tonight , after Mr. Churchill 's speech , the comments of the average folk on streets and in bars generally approved the Priine Minister 's declaration that Britain was prepared to take swift , drastic steps without flinching at the consequences once provoked by Nazi ruthlessness . While it is not known what special knowledge Mr. Churchill has received about the German plans , it was recalled that Tass , the Russian news agency , last night charged the Nazis were using gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British recently have been perfecting their preparations for meeting gas attacks . Gas Not Expected at Start In the beginning of the war it was thought unlikely that Adolf Hitler would risk the retaliation he was certain to draw upon himself because the British civilians were better equipped than Germans with gas masks , but whether that is still true is not definitely known . Experts in chemical warfare believe that gas is a less efficient weapon than high explosives for aerial attack , but this theory might be exploded in actual practice . Mustard gas is believed the most likely choice for spraying from the air , for it can be carried , in bombers ' wings nd released as a fine , colorless rain . A more effective , more concentrated , method , of using it would be by gas bombs . It was recalled tonight that Sir Nevile Henderson , former British Ambassador to Berlin , on asking for his passport following the declaration of war , inquired whether Germany would observe the terms of the Geneva protocol , signed on March 4 , 1929 , prohibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warfare . Subsequently Viscount Halifax , then Foreign Secretary , told the House of Lords that the German Government through the Swiss Minister to London had promised to abide by their Geneva protocol pledge , reserving full liberty of action if the protocol was violated by the enemy . Germany was the first country to use poison gas in warfare , and it was four years after Britain and twenty-six other States had foresworn its use that Germany agreed never to use it again . Japan never ratified the Geneva protocol and as far as is known has not yet replied to the British Government 's request for information regarding her intentions in this war . China has charged the use of poison gas by the Japanese on several occasions and made another charge at the end of March during the fighting for Toungoo in Burma . A Japanese newspaper correspondent asserted this month that British and Chinese troops in Burma were using gas and said the Japanese were considering adoption of the same method of fighting . The only authenticated instance of the use of poison gas since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aroused world-wide condemnation . Last January it was alleged in Moscow that among captured staff papers was found instructions to Nazi officers indicating the intention to use gas as a last resort to stabilize German lines . In 1928 Herr Stocker , speaking in the Reichstag with a German gas bomb before him , said he did not believe the other powers would adhere to the protocol and that " feverish preparations " were being made all over the world for gas war , including Germany . How " feverish " were Germany 's preparations about that time were disclosed by Dr. Hugo Stoltzenberg , owner of the Hamburg Chemical Works , who published a monograph , called " Super Poisons , " describing the distribution of gas from the air , which had been practiced by German airmen sixteen years ago under the guise of spraying to kin insects . Hamburg was a victim of its own factory in 1928 when a phosgene gas tank exploded in a thinly populated area , killing seven and incapacitating 100 others .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
