txt The fact that still needs most to be reported about Detroit and the labor situation here is that things are relatively quiet and that it looks now as if they would be for some time . The sooner Detroit and the rest of the country stop asking when the trouble will start , the sooner the problem will resolve itself to the point where trouble may be avoided . The possibility of a strike , which would take effect not less than a month after a strike vote , still exists . Impatient elements on each side are hurling charges and challenges . Dramatic strategical moves in the big labor-management duel ' invite jittery specula-1 tion and big headlines . The fact remains that emotions are not overdisturbed , no explosion is imminent , and the situation contains more of the ingredients of compromise and peace , than of serious industrial warfare . That is the picture today . Considered opinion is that the auto capital need not look for a real outburst until perhaps next spring , when the manufacturers are well into production of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be understood . The only answer of the General Motors Corporation to the United Auto Workers demand for a 30-per cent wage increase , with the ending of the union deadline , is warning that unless a work stoppage in an Ohio plant whichsupplies parts for General Motors cars is stopped , many General Motors plants themselves may have to close , with a layoff of as many as 25,000 . As in the case of Ford , the plea that a parts shortage is the only reason for a shutdown is received with skepticism on the other side . The move is held a part of employer strategy , aimed at meeting and wresting from the union the initiative it already had taken . It must be remembered that this is a business of bargaining . Every demand made , every charge or challenge . every step taken , is open to interpretation as a bargaining gesture . Behind this sort of give and take lies a real and serious difference of opinion , but one which is not insoluble and which is always nearer solution than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noted in another dispatch that failure of Washington ' so far to offer promise of effective settlement machinery has turned attention back here to the seat of the difficulty , it must be said that in the end the whole thing hinges on action in the nation 's Capital. , It is the opinion of experienced observers , including Frank Rising , Manager of Automotive and Aviation Parts Manufacturers , that the key may be in the coming labor-management conference . It is generally agreed that the new labor department set-up offers little encouragement of accomplishment here . The present strike threat , it is believed by Mr. Rising and others , will " blow over , " and the real test will come when the auto plants are under full steam in the very early spring . Federal Legislation ? Looking ahead : 0 this later tE st , possible settlement there c ill hinge on the labor-management conference decisions . If the proper machinery should not be set up then , the inevitable result , thinks Mr. Rising , is Federal legislation providing for compulsory arbitration , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not and will not be . it is held by many cbservers , the wage increase itself . Labor asks for 30 per cent . Management , it can be said , with good authority , is ready , or will he when the time comes , to grant from 10 to 15 per cent . The real stumbling block will be the union 's insistence on retaining and increasing broad measures of authority in plant personnel practices , and management 's determinatiou to wring from the unions vssurance , in black and white , of discipline and responsibility , and uninterrupted producing schedules . Wrapped up in this , as was pointed out in an earlier dispatch , is the future status of the unruly United Auto Workers . The grand strategy of the union has been upset , first by the Ford shutdown and now perhaps by the gesture of defiance from General Motors , the plant which had been marked as No , 1 in the " one company " plan of complete industrial boycott . Prospects of a delay of the real showdown until spring may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , it still must unify its dwindling and increasingly restless membership . The current layoffs. boosted by the Ford shutdown . have not brought about a critical problem . The Michigan jobless insurance law provides $20 a week for 20 weeks , with an additional S2 a week for dependents up to four . The State Unemployment Compensation Commission has foreseen this situation since the days of conversion to war work . It is figured that , even if 600,000 jobless draw the maximum amounts , the fund would not be wiped out . Jobless Ford workers , numbering some 50,000 , are of course eligible for these benefits , though only a portion will draw them . It has been impossible to determine the extent of wartime saving among these Ford workers , and there is no way to tell now whether any large number will leave the region . There are , however , few places for them to work yet , for all large employers are in the midst of reconversion . Effect of Layoff The effect of the layoff will be to eat deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized labor in the auto industry to weather a strike , whether it hits at Ford or not . The union has a carefully collected fund of about $4,000,000 which , it says , it can use to finance i=-p ; l.9:47 AM 9/14/2009f a strike . But that would not go far , even were a strike confined to the 300,000 General Motors employees . Both sides are vulnerable , and each is fully aware of his own and the others ' problems . Sentinent probably is veering now a bit over on the employers ' side , if only because the work stoppage and threat of further trouble means that those new cars will not be available so soon . News that the new Kaiser-Frazer team has leased the iabulous Willow Run plant , operated by Ford during the war to make Liberator bombers , has caused less stir in the industry than among the public , The big auto makers profess to have little concern that the new outfit will be able to bite very deep into the market . Radically Wrong ' DETROIT , Sept. 20 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the several affected companies in the strikes and layoffs idling more than 80,000 auto industry workers , charged today that " something is radically ? trrong " with union leadership . In a paid advertisement In newspapers , the Corporation said all its activity on a $6,000,000 reconversion and expansion program had been halted by a strike by the United Automobile Workers ( Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , " Because of the actions of irresponsible union leaders , " the Corporation said , " our national economic machine may be so hopelessly stalled that we will be headed straight for another deIpression.
