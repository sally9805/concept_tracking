The programs are strongly reminiscent of daytime radio : setting-up exercises , Broadway gossip , popular music , women 's news-everything except soap opera . <P> The chief innovation is a television baby sitter called Du Mont Kindergarten at 8:30 a.m . This features a young woman named Pat Meikle , who tries to keep small fry pinned to their chairs with 30 minutes of fairy tales , alphabet instruction and handicrafts .
