 | How quickly you can learn a foreign language depends on how thoroughly you want to master it . If you want to speak it fluently with little or no accent , understand it perfectly , be well versed in its literature ? that will take years . But if you simply want enough to make foreign trips fun , to get the gist of foreign broadcasts , to use in emergencies or as a foundation for acquiring expert knowledge later on ? you can have that in six months . Or less . It does n't call for intensive study , either . One hour a day , six days a week , is enough . This is because teaching methods have been simplified ; learning has been made easier , quicker . The old days , when you approached a language by toiling over irregular verbs , are over .

We were lucky at the war 's outset that our General Stillwell spoke perfect Chinese ( especially as Chiang Kai-shek speaks no English ) . But we were unlucky in that only a handful of Americans ( not counting Japanese Americans ) could speak and write Japanese fluently . We 're making up for it now . The fighting forces are sponsoring courses in Japanese , Chinese , Bengali , Hindustani , and Burmese , as well as in the tongues of Europe . Civilians are being urged to learn Spanish and Portuguese , which with English are the languages of western-hemisphere solidarity . Spanish is considered the easiest foreign language to learn .

Jacques Strumpen-Darrie , president of the Berlitz School , probably the most farflung language school in the world , goes so far as to say that " you can learn any language provided that you do not study it . " Mr. Strumpen-Darrie believes we should learn a foreign language the same way we learned English , just by listening to it and trying to speak it little by little , but never once studying it . Did your mother teach rules about nouns and pronouns and the subjective and objective cases ? No . You merely learned words and ways to put them together . You were given actual tools of the language to work with , rather than the blueprints to study . Result ? You spoke fairly good English before you ever attended your first grammar class .

Page 13 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our popular magazines . Lumping together and averaging the estimates of half-a-dozen language authorities , we get the following probabilities for the time required to get a working knowledge of the major languages : Spanish ? 100 hours . Italian ? 125 hours . French and German ? 150 hours . Portuguese , Swedish , Norwegian , Dutch - 175 hours . Russian , Czech , Finnish ? 200 hours . Japanese and Chinese ? 700 to 1,00 ) hours . These hours may be devoted to class study , study by phonograph , or exercise in conversation . The only essential is that they are hours entirely without English . If it 's Spanish you are after . you must plunge completely into a Spanish atmosphere . Your ear must soak up Spanish . Your eye must see only Spanish . You must actually think in Spanish . One hour a day , six days a week , is considered the best allotment of time for language study . It provides approximately 25 hours per month . Thus six months yield the 150 hours necessary for French or German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian , Czech , or Finnish . At two hours of study a day , six days a week , the number of months may be cut in half . This , however , is considered the maximum daily dose of study suitable for the ordinary student . As one teacher put it : " The time between studies is almost as important as the study itself . That 's when the language sinks in . " To attempt to rush through 1G0 hours of study by putting in five hours a day for twenty days would defeat the " sinking in " process . It would also hasten the forgetting process . Students who have crammed for examinations know that overhasty learning means overhasty forgetting . BEAR this in mind when you read advertisements of language courses offering suspiciously quick results . And by the way , before you pay your money for any form of instruction , it 's a good idea to talk to someone who has been through the mill and find out just how much he did or did n't learn . Even a cursory knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it 's discouraging to expect too much and then have to be content with modest results . The important thing is to use your second tongue once you acquire it . Suppose you learn Spanish . How can you hold onto it ? First , speak it regularly . even if you speak it only to yourself while you 're doing chores around the house . Second , watch for movies with Spanish dialogue and radio programs in Spanish . Third , find some place where you can converse in Spanish , perhaps forming your own foreign-language club or seeking out a Spanish restaurant where the native tongue prevails . Fourth . keep a Spanish book or magazine o. ; hand and read aloud occasionally . Fifth . read Spanish newspapers as often as you can . Good foreign-language newspapers to practise on are : . in Spanish Eco ; in French , La Victoire ; and in German , the Staats-Zeitung . These , and others in other languages , are published in this country and can be bought at most newsstands in large cities and at out-of-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested a:so in Excelsior , an outstanding Mexico City newspaper , widely circulated in this country . In dollars and cents , the acquisition of a second tongue need not be a large investment . There is a wide range of prices to choose from . Berlitz Schools , in twelve American cities , give a five-month course of forty lessons for $60 . Private instruction costs double . Linguaphone 's standard courses cost $50 . The phonograph records may be obtained by mail from the New York City headquarters in Rockefeller Center or from record shops in large cities and a few major bookshops . Other phonograph methods ? Cortinaphone , Languagephone , Hispanophone , and Francophone ? range from $50 down to $16.50 , depending on their thoroughness . Lewis Bertrand , crackajack linguist , now serving as a government translator in Washington , maintains a general clearinghouse and lending library for all these various discs at his Language Service Center , 18 East 41st Street , New York City .

Private tutoring , with a qualified teacher , can range anywhere from $2 to $5 a lesson . No one can say with absolute authority which method is best . The " shortest " course is n't necessarily the worst , any more than a formal university course is necessarily the best . For adequate " workMg " knowledge ? that is , the ability to buy a railroad ticket or order a meal ask a policeman the way to a hotel ? the training you get through one of the methods described above will do . For the person who wants thorough cornd of the language , nothing takes the ce of hard , intensive study of gram , plus constant practice . So get started now .
