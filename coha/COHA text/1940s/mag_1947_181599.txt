Last week British Communist Party Secretary Harry Pollitt , standing before Lenin 's portrait , briefed the Party Executive Committee on the new party line from Moscow . British Communists must pep up their policy of gnawing into the trade unions and nagging at the Labor government ( which they helped to elect in 1945 ) for cooperation with the U.S. Pollitt declared war on the Labor Government , which he sneered at as " Right-Wing Social Democracy . " British Communists , said Pollitt , must start an organizing drive among trade unions . Their immediate objective was the same as that of French , Italian and U.S. Communists : to scuttle the Marshall Plan . <P> Pollitt then laid out the party tactics . By encouraging Britain 's workers to demand higher wages and a bigger slice from British production , Communists would try to upset Cripps 's carefully calculated program for economic recovery . " In our anxiety to drive for increased production , " said Pollitt , " we have sometimes done far too little in the fight for wages and conditions . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated and steps must be taken to secure immediate wage advances to meet the rising costs of living . " <P> British Labor promptly hit back . Arthur Deakin , Ernie Bevin 's successor as head of the powerful Transport and General Workers ' Union ( 1,250,000 members ) , called on British Labor to oust Communists from their high councils* : " The activities of the Communists within the trade unions are mainly directed to propagating their political faith . . . . We can not afford to allow the Communists ' attempted infiltration into and domination of the trade unions to succeed . " <P> The Trades Union Congress , over Communist protests , voted to support the Marshall Plan as " a statesmanlike approach to the problems of Europe . " <P> The Labor Party had already censured the British Communists ' most eloquent spokesman , who is not a Communist-burly , buck-toothed Konni ( " Zilly " ) Zilliacus , intellectual Laborite M.P . who wants Britain to help Communist Russia set up control of Europe against U.S. " imperialists . " Zilly and twelve other Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly message to the Russian-sponsored " People 's Congress " in Berlin . The Parliamentary Labor Party passed a resolution that " This meeting . .. dissociates itself from the message . . . which in no way reflects our attitude or views . . . . " <P> <P> *Conspicuously high-placed Communists in British unions : Arthur Homer , general secretary of the Mineworkers ; Jim Gardner , general secretary of the Foundry Workers ; Abe Moffat , president of the Scottish Mineworkers . Seventy out of 833 delegates to the last Trades Union Congress were Communists , as are eight of the 33 members of Deakin 's own executive board .
