 | High Blood Pressure ? Do n't Be Alarmed By Joseph Weitzenkorn MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN sat patiently waiting her turn in the hypertension clinic of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center . She was trembling a little , for this was the first time she had left her bed in 12 years . Her affliction ? high blood pressure . Someone had told her about the hypertension clinic at the Presbyterian Hospital and she finally summoned enough courage to break her bedridden routine . She sat there wondering , fearing , hoping . She was examined . Her pressure was 200/120 . She had only slight cardiac damage . She said her hypertension had begun at least 20 years before and that she had finally been ordered to bed by a physician . " That was 12 years ago ? " they asked . " You 've stayed in bed all that time ? " Yes , she told them . " You did n't get up at all ? " " Well , " she said shyly , " when I went to the bathroom . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I crawled . " The clinic doctors were stunned . Accustomed as they were to the Abnormal fear people have of high blood pressure , this was about the most extreme case they had run into . They urged her to stay out of bed and to resume normal living . They told her that her fears were un-reasonable , that she had every chance for years of healthy , happy living , just as much chance as she had in bed . Beyond telling her to  | act her age , they placed no restrictions on her activity . Today ? long after ? this woman is a healthy , happy human being who works and maintains her home . Her blood pressure ? It 's still the same . The clinic did n't attempt to reduce it . It is concerned with more important things , like dispelling the fears that beset hypertensives , fears that dominate their lives , close their businesses , send them into exile at dietary spas or send them cringing to bed . From what the Columbia-Presbyterian hypertension clinic has learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing is to turn miserable hypertensives into happy ones . And they are succeeding . They have learned impressive facts concerning this greatly feared condition which afflicts , by conservative estimate , at least ten million adult Americans . These facts have been reported not only by the group at Presbyterian Hospital but also by other doctors at other hospitals . However , they have not reached general circulation . When they become common knowledge , a brooding and paralyzing fear should lift from the land . A foremost observation made by the clinic concerns the significance of the pressure height itself the factor which probably causes the greatest alarm to the patient . Usually , people with only a slight or moderate - elevation of the blood pressure do not worry too much about their condition . It 's the high pressures that create fright and constant anxiety . But physicians of this clinic have observed thousands of cases over the course of the past 25 years and have found that it made little difference how high the pressure went once it rose above the normal range . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ignored . Not at all . Hypertension is a condition people are better off without . What the clinic doctors do say is that , once you have it , it does n't matter whether your blood pressure is up a little bit or a whole lot . You are no worse off with a pressure of 250 over 150 than with a pressure of 200 over 12o or rho over 10o . You 're not more likely to get a stroke or an enlarged heart or any of the other damage associated with hypertension , and your living chances are just as good as any hypertensive 's . This point can not be overemphasized . Very high pressures play mental havoc with people . Patients become faltering automatons , afraid to work , afraid to play , unable to enjoy life . There are many doctors who still believe that the higher the pressure the worse off the patient . On the basis of the clinic 's findings , there is simply no evidence to support this timeworn theory . Furthermore , as many people have strokes asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to be told that blood pressure is lower when you 're asleep or inactive . You may be interested to know that normal arterial walls can withstand pressure twice as great as any ever found  | in hypertension . Put these facts together and draw your own conclusions about how to live even though you have high blood pressure . The Columbia-Presbyterian hypertension clinicians have accumulated more than 2000 case histories from hospitals , clinics , private physicians and industrial sources . From these they selected the 300 which had the most detailed and reliable histories . Ages in the group ranged from 11 to 85 . None had had hypertension less than two years . Several had documented records of hypertension for more than 40 years . The average duration of disease for the group was 13 years . The doctors eventually developed a clear picture of what the disease did in its various forms and stages to all kinds of people under all sorts of conditions over wide ranges of time . They compared people with moderately high pressures to people with severely high pressures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tested livers and kidneys and peered into eyeballs . If patients died , they made microscopic examinations of arteries , inspected organs and weighed hearts . One of the most significant observations was that high blood pressure is not the savage destroyer it is supposed to be . At the present time 255 of the 300 intensely studied cases are still alive ! Remember , the average individual had had , hypertension for 13 years , and there were three persons who had had it for more than 40.  | The conclusion is obvious . Hypertensives can have decades of life with good health . Another survey was made by the clinic to determine the time of life when hypertension most frequently begins . This is difficult because many people go for years with hypertension before discovering it . But careful sifting of the 2147 cases discovered 200 whose records showed normal pressures over a period of years before these people developed hypertension . The general impression is that hypertension is an affliction occurring after middle age . But study of the 200 cases disclosed that it often begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-four developed it before they were 40 . And every one of the 200 had hypertension before the age of 48 . Of the entire 2147 cases observed , only five percent , a few more than i oo individuals , had " malignant " hypertension that is , showed serious , rapidly progressive complications . It is of course a foolish belief , commonly held , that your blood pressure should be " your age plus 1 oo . " After maturity , any persistent elevation of blood pressure is the result of some underlying pathological condition . The belief is doubly absurd because it concerns itself with the less important pressure the systolic . Take a pressure of 120/70 . The first number represents the systolic pressure ? when the heart surges into its beat . The second number is the diastolic when the heart is at rest . This , the constant minimum pressure pushing against the arteries , is more important and the one doctors are chiefly concerned with . Yet it is the systolic that laymen use when they start adding hundreds to age . Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since high blood pressure occurs early in life the life expectancy of people with hypertension is longer than supposed . Granting all this , still , is n't high blood pressurea bad thing to have ? Does n't it damage the heart , the kidneys and the blood vessels ? The answer to that is : Not necessarily . It is questionable whether high blood pressure itself is a real villain in these complications . A woman with a pressure reading of 225/140 ? a high pressure for more than 16 years was X-rayed . Comparison with the X rays taken 16 years before showed that her heart had not increased in size during the entire period of hypertension . Now the heart of an individual with hypertension is laboring under an additional strain . It is working harder , trying to drive blood through thousands of narrowed arteries . But the human heart has vast reserves of strength . It rests half its lifetime . Doctors now doubt whether an enlarged heart is produced solely by high blood pressure . The same thing is true of other complications associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hypertension , although they often  | occur together . High blood pressure need not cause arteriosclerosis and arteriosclerosis need not cause high blood pressure . There may be completely independent processes at work causing one or the other , or both . Hypertensive people complain of headaches , of being nervous , tired , unable to sleep , or that their hearts jump . But people without high blood pressure also experience such t roubles . Moreover , the hypertensive individual 's abnormal state of worry can easily bring on any or all of these symptoms , or he can imagine them . If a man stays awake all night muttering to himself , " My God ! I 've got high blood pressure , " it is n't exactly fair to blame high blood pressure for Isis sleeplessness . One firm conclusion emerged from the clinic 's studies : The degree of high blood pressure had nothing to do with anything . Not with cardiac hypertrophy . Not with oronary heart disease . Not with arteriosclerosis . Not with strokes . Not with any kind of organic or vascular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pressure meant precisely nothing . There is cold scientific logic behind these findings . High blood pressure is really not a disease at all . It 's a sympto1n , in the same sense that a fever is a symptom and not the disease itself . Furthermore , the intensity of a symptom does not necessarily indicate the severity of a disease . So do n't be frightened out of your wits if the doctor says you have high blood pressure . You do n't have to relish your condition , but you need not dread it . You do n't have to worry about the height of your pressure or how long you 've had it . Obviously , you must treat it with proper respect . Rely on the periodic checkups advised by your physician and report any new symptoms . Every individual requires individual treatment ; do n't try to prescribe your own . Here 's the cheerful advice the clinic gives its hypertensives : Cast away your fear . Do n't withdraw from life . You will probably live for decades in good health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
