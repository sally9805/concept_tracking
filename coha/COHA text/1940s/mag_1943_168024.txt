Horrible Holocausts Sirs : <P> . . . Our forces ended the Bismarck Sea action ( TIME , March 15 ) by wiping out barges , lifeboats and rafts from the sunken enemy vessels . <P> Americans were proud and delighted when they received the news of the amazing success of MacArthur 's flyers in destroying the entire enemy flotilla . They can not have the same feeling regarding the cold-blooded slaughter of the helpless . . . . <P> Another matter that is being freely mentioned , even in high official quarters , is the destruction of " the paper cities of Japan , " by aerial bombing . In plain words , this means that we propose to burn to death a countless number of women and children , the aged and the helpless . ... But Americans want no horrible holocausts endlessly to poison the relationships between our countries . . . . <P> J. HOWARD CLIFFE Ivyland , Pa . <P> &gt; For advice on how to wage war on the Japanese , by an American who has often visited Japan , see p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am getting tired of the attempts by Westbrook Pegler and others to try to " debunk " our national anthem ( TIME , March 15 ) . <P> The Star-Spangled Banner is not , and has never had any pretensions of being a martial song . ... It expresses , rather , the deep and reverent feeling inspired in the hearts of a peaceful people when they are confronted with the symbol of the ideals which lie at the basis of their national life . . . . <P> The chief criticisms of the anthem come from people who , like Mr. Pegler , seem to look upon America with something of the same grade of sentiment with which a college sophomore looks on his alma mater .

Cohan ; let our soldiers march to the strains of Dixie and the Battle Hymn of the Republic ; but let us reserve for our national anthem a composition which expresses the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEVELAND Princeton University Princeton , N.J. <P> Great Organization <P> Sirs : <P> The following passage seems to me worth printing far &; wide as one of the finest tributes to the U.S. Army 's World War II training system . It comes from a private letter written to me by a brilliant young Czech , who left Prague just before the fatal 1939 invasion , after graduating from the Prague University Law School with a year 's military service , then coming to a U.S. university law school , and now a corporal in one of our camps , after four months of indoctrination as a private : <P> " The U.S. Army is a great organization , as you know , and for anybody with a European military experience it is incredibly human . We get fine food , we are well housed , the personnel is very , very good . Reasoning , explanation and persuasion is the method used rather than compulsion . " <P> JOHN H.
