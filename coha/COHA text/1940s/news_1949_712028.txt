txt A girl photographer from Greenwich Village testified at the Communist trial yesterday that she had spent the last seven years in the New York Communist movement as an undercover ' agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . The new surprise witness was Miss Angela Calomiris , who has a studio at 9% Jane Street and specializes in animal pictures . She said she had been active in the party and - had become financial secretary of its Hells Kitchen branch , and executive secretary of a " front " organization known as the Photo League . This is on the Attorney General 's subversive list . - Miss Calomiris told how the party used false names for members , underground cells , secret meetings , secret schools and other conspiratorial devices in teaching the need for violent revolution to set up a Soviet dictatorship . Since the present prosecution began , she said , the party has stopped issuing membership cards . She said old cards had been destroyed . The witness identified four of the eleven defendants as men she had had dealings with on party business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councilman Benjamin J. Davis Jr. , legislative chairman ; Robert G. Thompson , New York State chairman , and Gilbert Green , Illinois chairman . . All eleven defendants as members of the party 's American Politburo are being tried for conspiracy to organize the party to teach and advocate overthrow and destruction of the United States Government by force and violence . Miss Calomiris was called to the witness stand by United States Attorney John F. X. and was questioned by Edward C. Wallace of Government counsel . She is a slight young woman with black cropped hair and an air of quiet composure . She appeared unconcerned at the expressions of mingled sur // prise and distaste that her appearance evoked from the defendants and their adherents , who daily take up a large part of the public section of the court room . When the defendants she identified made derogatory gestures after shay walked up to them and pointed them out , she smiled and shook her head in a pitying way as she walkee back to the witness stand with a confident air . She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to heckle her , and she made it clear she was not afraid of their efforts to attack her , like every previous witness , as a " spy . " Soon after she took the stand the FBI issued a public statement lauding her for " patriotic assistance to the United States Government . " Miss Calomiris said she became a member of the Communist party in 1942 as a result of her membership in the Photo League . She was asked to join the party , she said , by Sidney Grossman , then director of the Photo League ; Leona Saron , Communist branch organizer in the Tenth Assembly District , and Marion Hills . At first she did not accept . Then , she said , she received a visit from the FBI . Later , when the invitation to join the party was repeated , she joined . She said she made regular reports to the FBI on party activities " from the very day I joined " right up to the present . She was still a party member up to the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right name to the party but her name was not used publicly . " I was told by Grossman and Miss Saron to take an assumed , name , " she said , " and used the name of Angela Cole . " At the time she joined , she said , 1 the party was " partly underground , " and was divided into " cells " on a " group system " for reasons of " security . " No records were kept . Instead , she said , the group " captain " was responsible for such information . Soon after joining , she said , she attended . a meeting , of 1,000 to 1,500 persons at which new members en7olled in a recruiting drive were welcomed . Mr. Green told the recruits , she said , they would be taught the principles of MarxismLeninism . These principles proved to be those of violent revolution as taught at party schools she attended , according to the witness . She first attended a new members ' course and later a special Marxist course at the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . Miss Saron , her branch organizer , recommended her for the second course . In the second course . she testified , a lecturer named Francis Franklin taught the necessity of violent revolution to put socialism into effect . She quoted him as saying that all existing agencies and machinery of capitalistic government must first be smashed so that the dictatorship of the proletariat could be set up , and that this would bring in socialism . " He said socialism could not be achieved by evolution , " she testified . The witness said she received a diploma after attending the second course . After the FBI made a photostat copy , she regained possession of it in time to turn it over to her branch organizer , Miss Saron , who asked for it . She said she also had to turn her party cards back , but managed to get them to the FBI to be copied before she handed them over to the party membership director in her branch . " This was the regular practice in the party , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the membership director tore up my card in my presence . " During the war when the Communist party was dissolved temporarily and the Communist Political Association was set up for cooperation between communism and capitalism , she said , the whole form of organization changed . " Branch organizers became chairmen , " she said . " We had a recording chairmen and kept minutes for the first time , and I held that office in my branch , the West Midtown branch . We called ourselves brothers and sisters or friends , instead of comrades . Our meetings were no longer secret . We were allowed to bring in friends . In fact , the whole neighborhood was invited . " The Communist Manifesto and all the Marxist-Leninist books were cleaned out , and we got new books and leaflets by Earl Browder , then head of the party , in favor of class cooperation instead of class war . " " This all changed again in 1945 , when the Communist party was reconstituted . The office of recording secretary was abolished , all our former titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was resumed . " She said the party also went back to 1945 to secret meetings and the use of the traditional revolutionary salutation of " comrades . " Miss Calomiris said members of her branch were ' " stunned " and " embarrassed " and thrown into " confusion " by the 1945 publication of an article by Jacques Duclos , French Communist leader , which preceded dissolution of the political association and reconstitution of the party . This article attacked Browderism and dedemanded a return to MarxistLeninist principles by American Communists . After the national board or Politburo published a resolution supporting Duclos and opposing Browder , she said , all her branch members came out for Duclos except one man , who backed Browder . " What happened to this man ? " she was asked . " He was expelled , " she said . Federal Judge Harold R. Medina decided that testimony of William Z. Foster , the party 's national chairman , could be taken by deposition . This reversed a previous ruling . Judge Medina appeared tired after Monday 's stormy session in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from arguing contrary to his directions . In another clash with defense counsel yesterday he said : " This continual wrangling is wearing me down so that I do n't see how I can finish this trial . Something has to be done to stop it .
