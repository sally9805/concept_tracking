 | Something about being the mother of an unmarried girl in her midtwenties does things to the maternal instinct . Faced with the problem of how to make the girl happy , how to avoid for her the social stigma ? real though idiotic ? of spinsterhood , how to arrange for her to meet eligible males and marry her off to the first willing victim , many a mother becomes an expert in refined torture . There is , first of all , the mother who schemes to create opportunities for her daughter to meet the sons of her friends . Usually the son and his parents are soon aware of the real motive . A young man , scenting a huntress on his trail , reacts violently against the unfortunate girl , talks about her , and , very likely , ruins her chances with other potential swains . Then there is the woman who follows her daughter 's dates with avid interest ? waits up to talk over what happened and what he said and what she said . Her very eagerness is upsetting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clam . Or ? remembering that her mother will want know everything ? she will become painfully self-conscious in the pres ence of her beau . Another mother will pick out the stagline , so to speak , the man considers an outstanding candid , and begin to praise him . " So-and. is so attractive , " she will say to 1 daughter . " His family is so nice . is doing so well at his job . " Daughter naturally rebellious at this his handed archness , may remark , think he 's terrible ! " Whereup angry and genuinely hurt , Mother will make a bad situation worse exploding : " Just keep on being choosy and see where it lands y You are n't getting any younger , y know ! " There are any number of otl cruelties , which have the dual eff of antagonizing the daughter sacrificing the peace of the hou , hold . Constant reference in pub serious or humorous , to your dau ? ter 's unmarried state makes her w to run and hide . " Oh , Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with Ruth in the room ) . " She we take any pains with her social 1 Ha-ha . " Fluttering over a daughter 's yoi men , pressing hospitality upon the letting them see that their preset is an important event are unforg able sins . Daughter suffers agony r probably promises herself never have another date when Mother around . Then there is the father w goaded by Mother , after Daughter third date with a young man , sett down heavily on the living-room couch and engages him in conversa tion . If he is an old hand at it , can usually discover ( a ) the yot man 's salary , ( b ) his cash on ha ( c ) the extent of his life insurar ( d ) his idea of a " good time , " ( e ) what he thinks of marriage is hard to figure out what Fat will do with all this information , the odds are that the young r wo n't be caught dead in that hou hold after such an overhauling . Again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl to her tort while she is safely out of room . " You know , Emily never to spend a cent in beauty pail Her hair is naturally curly , and s. so clever at doing her nails ! " Eno of this , and Mother wo n't be abL give Emily away . Perhaps the most insidious t1 of all is to make Daughter suspici about a man 's intentions . " All want the same thing , " Mother i warn her darkly . " Do n't ever ches yourself by letting a man kiss That comes after a girl is enga , not before . Be modest . Be careful will respect you much more for If Daughter is old enough to sider marriage at all , she should informed sufficiently to handle situation that arises . Early trait should take  | care of this . Old wives ' tales will make her behave so stiltedly and self-consciously with a man that he would be heroic to make another date with her . Every mother longs for her daughter 's happiness . But does marriage automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the fundamental foundations for happinessnatural love , devotion , mutual ideals , and a real desire for a home and children . There are other ways for women to achieve security ; so is n't it foolish to force marriage upon a daughter because of a mistaken adherence to society 's outworn creed , or to make her life miserable if she refuses ? Still , almost every woman desires marage , and it is normal to assume that a laughter 's best chance for happiness lies there . How then can a mother work toward this goal without offending the girl or discouraging her suitors ? Obviously , not by gunning for a husband . But a lot can be done in other ways . By providing a background that adds to Daughter 's attractiveness . By educating her to develop her natural ad-vantages and her powers of discrimination , in order to make her own choice more wisely . By giving her faith in herself . and by bolstering her morale . If a town provides little social opportunity for Daughter , she should get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , if that is humanly possible . If she wishes to remain at home , that home should be the sort of place to which people like to come . Many women who choose to remain single do so because of discord in their family homes . Girls who have known happy , wholesome , tolerant , amusing homes wish to create similar homes for themselves . FATHERS can help . A friendly , affectionate father will give his daughter a better understanding of all male viewpoints . Young women whose relations with their fathers or brothers are easygoing and congenial never develop the dual personality that characterizes less fortunate girls , who are charming and natural with feminine friends but feel awkward and self-conscious with men . Cultivate a daughter 's charm and teach her to be a gracious hostess . Let her know that her home is always open to her friends , and teach her to be as natural with guests as with her own family . Make her feel the importance of stressing her good points ; but suggest , do not impose , changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her own tastes . her own desires . Give her confidence through developing her inner possibilities ; give her freedom by helping her to face reality . Let her know that her judgment is respected . If she prefers to remain unmarried rather than marry merely to escape social stigma , give her unqualified support . No one , these days , needs to condemn or pity an unmarried girl of any age if she has built for herself , with the aid of her parents , an interesting and fruitful life . Mother can not live Daughter 's life for her . She can only help her find the means to live her own life in peace and security , without a sense of failure . If she succeeds , she will accomplish something much more satisfying and important than finding her daughter a husband . THE END
