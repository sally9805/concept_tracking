The U.S. Weather Bureau has little faith in weather control . Last year the weathermen announced that they had tried seeding clouds with dry ice and found the trick does not work ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . Last week the bureau 's chief , Dr. Francis W. Reichelderfer , told a Manhattan meeting of the American Meteorological Society and the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences that man-made weather is a very unreliable project . The dry ice method may work locally under special conditions , said Reichelderfer , but the physical forces in full-scale weather are too big to be affected by man . <P> This time Dr. Reichelderfer got an argument from an expert : Nobel Prizewinner Irving Langmuir of General Electric Co . The dry ice method does work , Langmuir insisted , if it is done right . <P> Project Cirrus ( a joint cloud study program of the services and G.E. ) has been very successful , said Dr. Langmuir . Thirty-five of its cloud-seeding flights changed super cooled clouds* into ice or snow crystals . Last October , at Albuquerque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They turned into a furious thunderstorm that drenched Albuquerque with heavy rain at a time of year when rain is uncommon . <P> With low-hanging stratus ( i.e. , solid layer ) clouds , Project Cirrus was just as successful . Langmuir told how the planes had drawn Greek letters and " racetrack " patterns in stratus clouds by dropping small amounts of dry ice ( see cut ) . Sometimes the cloud was dissipated so completely that blue sky showed through the gaps . Langmuir believes that dry ice can be used to clear clouds from over airports . <P> One mistake of unskilled rainmakers , Langmuir explained , looking coldly at the Weather Bureau , is that they do n't pick the right kind of cloud . Unless at least part of the cloud is below freezing , the dry ice will not work . Another mistake : using too much dry ice . A few pounds per mile are usually enough . If the plane dumps too much , too many ice particles are formed . They are so light that they do not fall . The overdose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cloud of floating ice crystals . <P> * Clouds whose droplets are of water , but below the freezing point .
