WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 41erect even the flimsiest of shelters in a spot miles from anywhere at all remained a matter of astonished conjecture . As they sat that evening by their own roaring fire with the rising tide swirling against the ledges outside , Philip Marston made up his mind once and for all . He would buy as many acres as he could get of that land which stretched eastward toward the great light beyond Sieur de Monts Point . There were miles of it , desolate and treeless above the sea , great wastes across which one could make paths along the edge of the high shore . Beyond the Point itself the strong tides had swept inland , hollowing out the shore in a vast half-circle , cutting it farther and farther away , hurling in years gone by such masses of rock and driftwood that a massive sea-wall had been built . He remembered how the gulls clustered on this wall , rimmingit with a long line of white and silver . Behind and beyond the wall sand dunes rolled backward to a freshwaterpond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herons stood on still summer days . And beyond the pond , once the marsh grass and soggy pools of black water gave way to stumpage , the woods began , damp at first even in the dryest seasons , mossy underfoot , until the land rose into dark ranks of spruces and pines and at last gave way again to the long , treeless wastes above the sea with their blueberry bushes and alders . Philip Marston framed his plan to its last , finest detail long after his son and Jan had gone to bed in their wallbunks , which smelled of fresh wood . He threw more spruce logs and great , ungainly pieces of driftwood onthe fire until far into the night . Unless he was mistaken , this especial portion of the earth had been peculiarly set apart for him and for those who should come after him . During the years he had known it , the four Octobers when he and Jan had tramped its open reaches on their way to the pond where the ducks would take wing , in the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , he had become aware of its spell , even unable to escape from it when far away . He was still a young man , barely forty . There were many years left to him , and here he could live them as he had seemingly been unable to live the past . With the symmetry and orderliness of his life here through the long summer and autumn and the memories he would take back to the city , he could so cover up the confusion and disappointments of his marriage that in time they would be out of sight and forgotten . There was healing here for unhappiness and failure , faith for disillusionment , place for the pain of self-reproach . Here one would not need to make impossible adjustments to men and manners , or to conceal from others , and even from oneself , the things and the thoughts by which one lived . Here one could safely entrust one 's son to the better instructionof sea and sky and of this bare and sturdy land . Old Numa had been right , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , the sea , and the air , and who cast their spells upon it for evil or for good . The spirits of this place , the genii loci , were benevolentspirits . Of that he felt certain . They must be lonely now for companionship after all these years of tenantless space. 42 WINDSWEPT 8In the morning early they set out to fulfill his quest , sacrificing even those tense , watchful hours in the marsh grass at the pond behind the sea-wall . They sailed the ketch four miles , beyond the point which the great light guarded , and northward into Heron Cove , following from there the rude road which , after a five-mile tramp , brought them to the nearest village and a lawyer 's office . The astonished lawyer warned them that it might take weeks to accomplish their purpose . The very ownership of part of the land which Philip Marston wanted was in question , to say nothing of the uncertain boundaries of the rest . Yet if the owners could be ascertained and found , he did not doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , they were shocked to death by the mere notion of a purchaser . As for himself , he had never thought there was much away out there except ducks , an occasional deer , and , of course , scenery . He had not set foot on the place in years , he said , and he did not know of many who had . But he would get to work at once . October gave place to November as they waited . The good weather still held after a rainy day or two which they enjoyed indoors . Philip Marston wrote his firm that his absence from it was indefinite , and Anton sent a laborious letter in pencil to Jan saying that he was doing fine with the help of Ambroz and others as he needed them . John Marston never once thought of school . A boy by the name of Daniel Perkins brought their mail every afternoon to Heron Cove , and they went inWINDSWEPT 43The Sea Hawk to fetch it . He brought also any news which the lawyer might have for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a designated stone high up on the beach in case they missed him or a suddenstorm might make it inadvisable to man the ketch . They used the stone very seldom , however , as Daniel Perkins ' teacher let him out early from school so that he might be at Heron Cove at four o'clock , and his curiosity made him punctual . He was a lanky , red-haired boy of thirteen with long , bare freckled legs . He felt his importancekeenly. 9John Marston had never , he thought , been so happy as during those long , slow weeks . Contentment here became a veritable excitement . He was glad of the delay in some remote court-house over musty deeds and mortgages and tax-record sheets . It was strange how this new place seemed old and familiar almost from the moment of their setting foot upon it , stranger how , nevertheless , it was somehow always holding something back from their knowledge of it , strangest how it decreed one 's hours and ordered one 's thoughts . The short days succeeded one another , growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes and sumach . The October drone of the crickets died from the air . The rime whitened the ground in early morning and made the rocks , wet from the surf of the receding tide , slippery as he clambered down over them and across the shingly beach to haul in the dory from its44 WINDSWEPTmooring . He longed for snow to enclose the three of them even more completely from a world which he had almost forgotten . But the snow did not come . By ten o'clock the sun was warm , and seven hours of daylight lay before them . A short walk from their cabin among the spruces led them away from the strip of sand , which afforded safe anchoragefor the ketch , and brought them in a quarter of an hour to that high , treeless promontory above the open sea where the land which was to be their own began its uneven slope eastward . This , Philip Marston decided daily with increased pleasure in each identical decision , was to be the site of the house which they would begin to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the path among the spruces , skirting a high pasture , which rose higher as they walked , until they had reached the summit . Behind them lay the sandy anchorage , flanked by its protecting ledges ; on their right , beyond two rocky points of mainlandrose the distant Mt . Desert hills ; before them some treeless , jagged islands caught the surf even on quiet days ; beyond the islands there was nothing but sea and sky and the vast , shimmering space between them . It was here on this vast , dun headland , cut into a great semi-circle by the strong tides seventy feet below , that one best caught the character of the place , here that its fascinationmost held one . The promontory was not , strictly speaking , a cliff , for in spite of the huge boulders at its base , it was not itself formed of rock but rather of tough clay and sand , so tough from the interlacing of grass roots , the pounding of by-gone tides which for centuriesWINDSWEPT 45had been at work upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the open ocean , thatit had taken upon itself the solidity , even the appearance , of stone . There it had remained , permanent and impregnable , its unbroken , almost flat summit extending back for fully a mile before a high wooded hill shut it from whatever of lesser attraction might lie beyond . Upon its right , between it and the nearest point of land westward , the sea extended into the quiet anchorage ; upon its left more land like itself , decreasing gradually in height , sloped eastward , a vast expanse of land , open to the sky , swept by the wind , its high shoreline constantly receiving the pounding of the surf upon the giant rocks below . The place to many might have seemed desolate , bleak and barren enough , sinister , sullen , even foreboding , especially in November . For it was a somber region , even at noon when the sun lay full upon it . The very absence of trees , the swarthy monotony of its mounds and hollows made by the clumps of blueberry and alder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave and solemn simplicity , a naked reality which struck upon the mind as well as upon the sight of the sensitive observer . There was mystery in its very emptiness , and grandeur in its severity . It might have been some ancient highway betweensea and sky in the earliest ages of the world before creation had begun to embellish itself and thus to obscure its simpler glory . The gods might still waken here at dawn and evening . There was room here in these unenclosed , pathless spaces for their long and varied processionalsby day , their recessionals by night . Nothing commonplace could happen here , Philip Mar-46 WINDSWEPTston thought , nothing mediocre or mean . Perhaps that was why men had shunned it as a dwelling-place , having been made vaguely uncomfortable by its nobility and dignity as well as fearful by its solitude . Events could not pass here into the nadir of forgetfulness . Whatever dramas were enacted here upon this stage , against these settings , behind this orchestra of wind and surf , should by right call forth in those who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sadness must be sharpened and refined to understanding and acceptance ; here , Earth was still the ancient life-giver , increasing joy . Here , away from the roar of the world and the confusion of themselves men might grow into heroic mould as in those early ages of the world , their spirits chastened and cured , seeing in these bare and rugged outlines the sure and simple designmade for them in the beginning of things . For this was an old and a wise land , a long uninhabited and forgottenspur of a new world , which elsewhere seemed to grow newer instead of older . Here , Philip Marston thought , one could , if he would , catch something of that wisdom which life in most places and under most circumstancesleaves unfinished , even undiscovered. ioEvery morning while they waited , they grew more at home . The naming of their longed-for property increased their confidence in their ultimate possession of it . Althoughsome days were calm and soundless , and the dark , brooding land seemed asleep , on most the wind was strongWINDSWEPT 47I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suchight that they lay face downward in the grass and bluehurriesto escape its full , relentless force . It seemed the breath of the land , the evidence of its life and power . " We will name this place Windswept , " said Philip Marston one morning as he bent over a pad of white drawing-paper on the uneven ground before him . " Both the land itself and the house shall be called Windswept . " Although his words were oracular , his manner of sayingthem seemed incidental , even casual . It was as though he were communicating to Jan and to John Marston a name which someone else had thought of . " That is the right name , " said Jan . " There could be no other name for here . This is an old land , like my country , and the name is old . I heard the wind last night while you were asleep . It filled our house with sound . At once it made me think of the great wind which was the Holy Ghost of God . You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Marston glanced quickly at Jan before he went on with his drawing . " We will place the house right here , " he said , " right where we are now . Get some stakes , Jan , so we 'll not forgetthe exact spot . A hundred feet from the edge is about right . It will be long and low , like this , with two wings folded back at right angles to the front . These will make a kind of open court at the back where we can have a flower garden , if we want , well out of the wind . The big chimney will go up in this court , like this , an outside chimney of our own stones . We 'll lay some more stones , flat ones , in front for a long , wide terrace . And beyond48 WINDSWEPTin the pasture , here , we 'll build a big barn , low like the house . I think we 'll shingle both and let the wind and weather colour them . It wo n't take long before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of these gulls . We want our house to belong to the place , not to stand out away from it . " 11In the afternoons they went to the pond , tramping the three miles along the edge of the high land above the sea , entering the woods beyond a rocky cove into which the sea swirled and crashed , and coming at last through waist-high bayberry and coarse marsh grass to the pond itself , where they kept a small skiff moored . The ducks were plentiful . They had only to lie for a few minutes among the grass and stumpage , as still as the sheet of dark water , before black flocks of them would rise and fly straight and low toward the sea-wall with a great whirr of wings . The sudden reports of their guns shattered the silence and seemed to echo not only over the pond itself but beyond the sea-wall and out across the open water . John Marston had received in advance of his birthday his fast . shotgun , to take the place of the small rifle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the instruction of his father he was learning to use it with expertness and pride . Occasionally other hunters penetratedtheir solitude , coming from the village eight miles away by the road through the woods or by sea from the settlements farther east ; but for the most part they were alone and undisturbed . One day , after they had beenWINDSWEPT 49to see the lawyer and to stock up with more provisions from the village store , they asked Daniel Perkins ' father to hunt with them . He was the carpenter who had built their cabin in the summer , and Philip Marston wanted to talk with him about their plans for the house to be built in the spring . He came on Saturday through the woods with Dan to Heron Cove to meet them there in The Sea Hawk . Daniel 's father , Caleb Perkins , was a tall , friendly man whom they all liked . He had long , strong legs and tremendousstrength in his hands . Unlike the lawyer he had a feeling for this land which they so much wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was a boy . He had a quick eye for signs in the weather , and he knew the habits of water birds . He was a fine shot , but after he had brought down more ducks than all of them together , he said a bit self-consciously that he did not really like to kill them . " I do it , " he said , " I suppose because I 'm a man and they 're only birds . But , mind you , I do n't take to it . They have their place same as I have mine . " Since the same feeling had been growing in them , too , they liked him for giving it words . He knew something of local history and more of local tradition , and he told them what he knew and had heard about the land for which they were so anxiously waiting . " So far as I know , " he said , " there 's been no one livin ' here for years and years back . Way beyond your cabin there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a boy and had landed on the beach there after raspberries . There must ha ' been a family there once in a5o WINDSWEPTsizable kind of house , but no one in town recalls who they were or when , how they came or why they left . You see there ai n't much here to live on except blueberries and ducks and a ( leer once in a while . The land 's poor , and there 's no near market for fish . The sea 's a risky one off these rocks with the wind blowin ' the way it does three hundred days out o ' the year . But it 's my private notion that . most folks shun tracts of outlyin ' land like this . They do n't feel to home in wild places , that 's the truth of it . They get queer fancies , and things sort of go to their heads . I know lots o ' men who do n't even like to hunt about here except in threes and fours . Ask them why not and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but it 's there all the same . " My father used to tell me when I was just a little shaver about some women who came out here to pick berries once when he was a boy . The berries are always prime here in August , barrels of ' em for the pickin ' . Well , about half a dozen of these women came by the road for a long ( lay of pickin ' . It seems the fog caught ' em unawares , the way these logs sometimes do , and they got plumb lost and could n't find their way . Fogs are nerverackin ' things . I do n't fancy fogs myself . When they did n't come home , some men started out with lanterns after ' cm , but they 'd wandered so far it was mornin ' before they were found . It 's lonesome out here in the dark with the wind blowin ' and the surf crashin ' against the rocks and the danger of these high shores . My father went along as a boy with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of ' em , once they were found . They told wild stories of all the terrible things they'dWINDSWEPT 51heard and seen , nonsense , of course , but it was real to them . And one of them , they say , a young girl she was , never got over it , but went off into a kind of slow decline and died . It 's nonsense , of course , but stories like that get attached to a place and make folks scared of it . I do n't take any stock in ' em myself . I must say I 've found folks a heap sight more scarey to a man than any kind of country . The wilder the place is , the better I like it . " They took Caleb Perkins and Dan home with them that afternoon and kept them for supper and the night . John and Dan stretched out before the fire on their stomachs and listened to their fathers ' voices until they fell asleep there in the warmth and snugness . Jan washed up the dishes and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied with driftwood he had gathered from the shore . It burned with brilliant colours of green and rose and blue . " I never saw so much wood on any shore , " Philip Marstonsaid . " It 's hurled way above the tide line , and there are logs and hunks of it ten feet back in the grass . I ca n't imagine where it all came from or how it got away up there over these high banks . " " You have n't seen a winter storm here yet , " said Caleb Perkins , " and there ai n't many that have . No one stands here lookin ' at ' em who does n't have to . Or a spring tide on a full moon with a high wind blowin ' . These winds and tides out here can work miracles with logs o ' wood . As to where it all comes from , I 've often wondered myself . Folks used to say wreckage from ships , and I suppose there 's still some o ' that left over from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't get many wrecks these days even in the worst storms . I take it some comes from the lumber schooners workin ' along toward Boston and New York . I shipped in one once when I was a boy , and I remember we threw a lot over the side when we found ourselves too heavy in a gale o ' wind . And some just drifts around from one place to another . The sea takes back as well as brings , and there 's a heap o ' shiftin ' about that comes natural . " The French were along these shores in the real old days comin ' from the St. Croix and points east where they 'd made settlements . And even before that , so I 've read , Champlain sailed to Mt . Desert and gave names to a lot o ' these points and islands that keep their French names still , though folks who know say that we do n't pro- nounce ' em right . It 's an old coast , this is . I like to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - posts up and down here to buy fur from the Indians . And once , a lot o ' years back before I was born at all , a farmer about ten miles further east from here dug up a sheet o ' brass with his plough that had some Latin words on it . That 's true as gospel . The schoolmaster could read it out and found it to be the corner-stone of a Catholic Chapel . He said the words told how it was a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary . So we know the French were around here once upon a time . " John Marston and Daniel Perkins wished they had been around here then , too . Before they took their guests back to Heron Cove on Sunday morning , John gave Dan the rifle which he had had for two years and which his new shotgun had displaced in value . He liked Dan , his 52 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 53blue eyes and shock of red hair , his freckled face and shy , friendly ways , and wanted to show him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was his father. ' 12As October wore on and November began , they formed the habit almost unconsciously of walking after supper through the darkness to see how the site of their house felt to them after night had fallen . The path through the spruces had grown so familiar to their feet that they could manage now with a minimum of stumbling ; the pasture afforded no obstacles at all ; and once they were upon the high , windswept promontory , the ground was solid and clear . Sometimes the nights were black with no stars at all . The sky was as though it were not ; and only the sound of the sea below them gave evidence of its presence . Exceptfor the gleaming or flashing of light-houses in the distance , the one thing visible on such nights was the wind itself , streaming in torrents of darkness about and above them . On such nights they were shut away even from space . There were nights of stars in countless thousands . The planets and constellations seemed close to the dark earth Dn which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliance was a band of white , as though it were swept by some mysterious surf on the upper air . On these lights they moved through space as though the headland were the prow of some mighty ship speeding them on54 WINDSWEPTtoward remote , celestial shores , the sound of the sea their steerage-way as they sailed on and on , beating into the wind . There were nights of northern lightslstreaming across the sky like the expanding wings of the seraphim , piercing the clouds with radiance , dimming the stars . With these it was impossible not to see the wind as companion , even as nmaster , the power behind those shooting , soaring paths of flame , clearing the way , thought Philip Marston , for the streets of the New Jerusalem , blazing with topaz and emerald . When the great hunter 's moon rose in early November and the wind moved in shadowy gusts across the clear outlines of the land eastward , they could see the shining white of the swells sweeping shoreward like the manes of gigantic horses bounding over the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofs. 13The last week of November marked an odd return to Indian Summer . The wind died ; and there came a succession of early autumn days , warm and still . A haze hung over the land in the morning , softening its rugged outlines , giving to it the aspect of quiet waiting , undisturbed , unexpectant . The sun at noon was almost hot . Philip Marston had completed his drawings of the house , outside and within . They were now transferred from his large drawing pad to long , professional-looking sheets of blue paper which had been sent from New York . Now only the long-deferred assurance of ownership wasWINDSWEPT 55wanted before he should hand these over to Caleb Perkins and return with Jan and John , who was once again brown and well . An excited Daniel was waiting at Heron Cove on Friday , the 26th of November . He bore news from the lawyer that at last the titles were sufficiently clear and that all arrangements for immediate purchase and transferhad been completed . There remained only the necessarysigning of documents and the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would come in his wagon early the next morning through the wood road to the Cove and transport them all to the village and the lawyer'soffice . The news was less a surprise to them than it was the inevitable consummation of expectation and assurance . As they sailed slowly homeward , adroitly catching all the wind there was , past their own darkening shores , beneath the high , overhanging site of their house , and into the bay toward their sandy anchorage , they realized suddenly how perplexed and mystified they would have felt had the purchase not been possible . They would have been more unconvinced than disappointed . " This land could be no one 's but ours , " said Jan , as he swung the dory alongside . " It has been ours for years . It is only that we have been late to find it . " On Saturday when the papers were at last signed and the money paid , a small amount of money , Philip Marstonthought , for so many hundreds of acres , they took Daniel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle , his father with some necessary tools of his trade , pencils and compasses , measuring-rods and rolls of56 WINDSWEPTwhite paper . Although he would not begin with his men to break ground until the spring , he wanted a day with Philip Marston to talk over plans and receive instructions . On Sunday they would sail the ketch far around the point and the great light to her winter moorings , which they had decided upon , and that night board the train for New York at the station fifteen miles east . Saturday was as lovely a day as the ones preceding it , weather breeders , all , Caleb Perkins said . " When this breaks , " he said , " it 'll break plenty . Mark my words . You 're gettin ' out just in time . " Jan prepared a late lunch for them which they ate on what was to be in the following summer the long terraceof stone before their front door . The sea stretching before them was like some vast sheet of pale gray satin . Only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they detect its motion . " It 's gettin ' ready for trouble , " said Caleb Perkins again . " See the tails of those clouds there , swishin ' around . We call them mares ' tails hereabouts . They 're a bad sign . I 'll give this spell o ' weather one more day . Monday 'll see a change in things , and not so good a change either . They tell me there 's storm warnin 's out already down along . " After they had eaten their lunch , the boys took their guns and started down the long slope toward the distant woods . They had a bet on as to who could get the more rabbits . Dan had a secret plan in his head about making a fur cap for John Marston from his rabbit skins . He was not sure that boys wore such caps in New York , but he would like to do something by himself for this boy fromWINDSWEPT 57the city who had been friendly to him . He knew a trapper who would show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to complete the cap in a jaunty manner by fastening two white scuts on it , one in front , the other in back . Their fathers watched them go along the edge of the high shore above the sea . They were thin , rangy boys , tall for their age . There was an unexpressed bond between their fathers , for Philip Marston had discovered that Daniel 's mother had died the preceding winter . He and his father shifted for themselves in their house in the village . " Your boy 's been awful kind to Dan ' 1 , " Caleb Perkins said , " givin ' him the rifle and all . Seems like Dan ' . ca n't talk about nothin ' else at home , and I 'm sure he 's a braggin ' nuisance at school . " " Dan 's a fine boy , " said Philip Marston in his turn . " John liked giving him the rifle , ' t was his own idea , and he says Dan 's getting to be a good shot with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get settled in here . I hope we 'll see a lot of him and of you , too . " " You will , " Daniel 's father promised . " We do n't see many folks from away , down around here . They 're good for us , give us a kind o ' new slant on things . " He paused and puffed a bit nervously on his pipe . It was not easy for him to say things , but since it was harder for him to write them down on paper , he had decided to tell Philip Marston of his gratitude in the best way he could . " And I 'd like to thank you before you start for home for givin ' me a job like this . I 've never had one of this size in my life . Work 's scarce down here , and folks haven't58 WINDSWEPTmoney to do things beyond repairin ' , shinglin ' , and such like . If I ever do get a house to put up , it 's a mean , spindly thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're set on a roof to cover ' em , and they do n't care much about the looks of a house . I 've always wanted to put up a big , fine one that would look right , before I die  --  just to show myself what I could do if I had the chance . It 's mighty prime of you to trust a plain country carpenter like me to do your job for you when you might ha ' got a city man who 's more up to date and all . I 'd like you to know before you go back that I value what you 've done . " Philip Marston knocked out his pipe on a rock as he rose to his feet . " I know a good man when I see one , " he said quietly . " I do n't like business that 's just business . A man can do a better job if he has his heart in it . I want my house to be built by someone who will have a feeling for my own piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the place . Now let 's get to work . " 14It was nearly three o'clock when the two men with Jan 's help had finished their job . " The stakes were driven , the measuring completed , the blue sheets of paper studied one by one to the minutest detail . The placing of the barn had been agreed upon , and the site of a well discussed , subject to the tappings and prophesying of a dowser , who lived on the outskirts of the village and whom Caleb Perkins would bring to Windswept before the final decision could be safely madeWINDSWEPT 59 " Funny about these dowsin ' men , " he said . " They seem plumb crazy pacin ' around a piece o ' land , across it one way , across it the other , tappin ' away with a bit of ash or willow . Some use ash and some use willow , and what they use , they use , and they wo n't place faith in nothin ' else . Seems as though they have a queer sort o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't often fail , and that 's a fact . I 've never been sure whether dowsin 's a trade or a bit o ' witchcraft left over from the old days , but that there 's a lot to it there 's no gainsayin ' . " I knew a fellow once years back  --  he 's gone now  --  who was the best dowser in all Washington County . The wells he dowsed for are deep down in the earth all over the place , from Eastport to Sullivan , and not one of ' em has failed so far as I know , no matter what sort o ' drought hits us . Once twenty years back I watched him dowse over a field where they was goin ' to dig a well . The land was springy like with surface water on a lot of it , and every man of us thought he was plumb daft when after a lot o ' tappin ' he said he felt his stick jump-like on a sort of a knoll with no sign o ' water anywhere near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he says . Here 's your place . ' You 're crazy , ' they said . You 're plumb out o ' your head . It 'll cost twice as much to dig there , ' they said . All right , ' he says , throwin ' down his stick . Have it your own way , ' he says , but you 'll pay me all the same for your ill luck . ' And off he went down the road with his crazy old stick . " Well , they begun to dig , and ' t was just as he said . The water petered out after a few feet down , and all their work was for nothin ' . So they closed up after they 'd paid6o WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 61a couple o ' men for half a day 's work and started on the knoll just as he said they should . They struck signs o ' water after ten feet and at twenty a fine vein , and there 's no better well hereabouts . " This dowser of ours is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a parcel o ' measley children that are apt to pick up what do n't belong to ' em if they get the chance . He do n't know much of anythin ' else , digs clams and fishes a mite for a livin ' . No one puts any stock in him at all except for his dowsin ' . But I would n't take it on myself to say dig here or dig there on this land without his say so , I vum I would n't . Some men have one sort o ' knowledge , and others another , and some none at all , at least to all appearances . " The afternoon continued warm and soft . The thick swirling clouds , which Caleb Perkins knew were sinister in prophecy , did not obscure the sun , now journeyed lower in the west . There was no sign of the two boys , no sound of their guns . " We might walk clown a bit , " Philip Marston said . " We may not get a day like this tomorrow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to feel my own land beneath my feet once more before I have to leave it . We might go down toward the woods and give the boys a shout or two . It 's time they were back . " The three of them started in long strides across the rough , shaggy land . It had never seemed so still . The fine , feathery lines of the clouds , now tinged with ap- proaching sunset and sweeping across the pale blue No- vember sky , the pale yellow of the late afternoon light , lent to it , with its fading russets and browns , a golden colour like the faintly tarnished gold of old paintings . He had seen those same fawn-coloured browns , Philip Marston thought , in walks across Umbrian hills , without warmth and yet warm , without colour and yet with it , the colour of age and history . The land seemed to drowse there behind the quiet sea with its fragile lace-work of surf upon the russet ledges and along the shingly beach . Some gulls were circling lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver wings on the rocks above the full tide. 15They entered the wood road just beyond the rocky cove where it curved sharply on its way to the pond and the sea-wall . There was a sudden crash through the underbrushon their left , and a deer leapt across the path almost directly before them . A rifle shot burst in the quiet air , and in another moment the deer had bounded away among the sumachs and alders toward the shore . Philip Marston had fallen to the ground with the bullet ( torn his son 's gift to Daniel Perkins in his side . John Marston never clearly remembered all that happenedthen , after he and Dan had sprung into the path from their hiding-place among the trees . He had a confusedmemory of Dan , running back toward the open land , screaming for someone to come from where no one was ; of Caleb Perkins and Jan making a stretcher of some poles with their coats tied to them , and of himself trying to staunch the blood with his shirt which he had pulled off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WINDSWEPT growing twilight and darkness of the woods into the open where there was still light and warmth , and that his fa- ther was asking to be taken back to the headland where their house was to be built . He heard Caleb Perkins call- ing to 1 ) an , who still ran screaming on up the uneven slope toward the headland . And all the time he knew with sickening horror that there was no help to be had , and that the first bitter harvest of this land which they had loved and wanted would be his father 's death . Once they had reached the open land , it was Jan who caught Dan and sent him , still sobbing and screaming , through the overgrown path to Heron Cove where one of the fishermen there could ride Caleb Perkins ' horse to the village and a doctor . But John Marston knew , even as Dan 's sobs came back to them through the still air be- fore the silence fell again behind them , that the doctor would come too late . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about things and by something equally quiet and fateful in the fast-gathering twilight over the land . his knowledge justified itself . They got his father to the headland since he wanted it so much , but at a sacri- fice of blood and strength and of their own better judg- ment . Philip Marston had time up there in the stillness and in the fading light over land and sea to tell them to be kind to I ) an and to say that the house was still to be built . He had time , too , to say that he had got from his land precisely what he had all his life wanted , and that it would give to his son , to Jan and to the others , still in the mists of the future , all that it had given to him and more . If the doctor should not , perhaps , come in time , he said , saying this lightly for the sake of John who was holding his hand , he would like to be buried beyond the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise that it should be done . " I wo n't bother anyone here , except perhaps your dowser , " he said , with a smile for Caleb Perkins . The first stars were coming out as he died . It grew cold suddenly up there in the darkness . They sat for a few minutesin the glow of the lantern , which Jan had brought from the cabin , a small pool of glimmering , uncertain light in a suddenly created world of terrifying certainty . Then they went back over the pasture slope and through the path among the spruces to the cabin , John Marston ahead with the lantern , Jan and Caleb Perkins carrying Philip Marston 's body . When the doctor came three hours later with the others whom he had brought to give what help they could , there was nothing to be done but to say on paper what they all knew too well already. 16John Marston never forgot that night in the cabin among the spruces above the dark , swirling water . Nor did those who came after and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sharply by the difficult truth that not one of them had actually been there ; and yet the reality of it became so much a part of their conscious experience from the beginning that they never really believed that truth , much as it reproved them . Eileen Marston , once she had come to Windswept , found her presence in the cabin on that night the easiest64 WINDSWEPT part to play of all the parts in all the dramas she was for- ever playing . Ann Marston still believes that she was there . Young Philip Marston was all his short life so much there that Jan 's face in that firelight was the last thing he saw as he died in Belleau Wood . Rod even placed the dogs there with him , Giles and Friday and Pippin ; and when he was at last convinced after years of bickering that Julie had as much right to the claim of her presence there as he had of his own , he grudgingly allowed her a place there also . For from out of the bright and ( lark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its story came . Without those moments neither they nor their story would have been . Jan made hot coffee and sandwiches in the lean-to , which served as a kitchen . There was a small , squat stove there with the date 185o on its oven door . They had been saying , through all the weeks that they had cooked upon it , what a merry-looking stove it was . Tonight the small pieces of soft wood with which Jan filled it snapped and crackled as they had always done and made bright rings of light around the black covers . Jan made them eat the sandwiches and drink the scalding coffee . He would not send the doctor and the men , who had come to help , back through the woods to Heron Cove and the village road until they were all warmed and fed . They stood , awk- ward and silent and sorry , about the kitchen , their shad- ows reaching across the ceiling in the light of the swing- ing lamp overhead . When they had gone , Jan built up the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it and big logs of spruce . Then he drew Dan from the far cor- ner of the room where he had been crouching away from them and made him lie down before the fire beside John Marston . John suddenly placed his arm around Dan 's shoulders , and they lay there together , with Jan in his chair on one side of the fire and Dan 's father in his chair on the other side . Jan began to talk then . " Suppose I tell you boys some stories , you , John , and you , Daniel , about myself when I was at your age . Good ? Yes , I will do so . I will tell you first about where I lived when I was at your age , and then I will tell you about how I went to the great city of Praha , which you call Prague . It is a great city of Bohemia , my own country , very old with many palaces and castles , and many hundreds of bells all sounding at once . Well , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at your age , I lived in a little white house with a brown roof of thatch , and lime trees near . You do not know lime trees ? They have many little white flowers in the summer that smell very sweet when they hang on the trees and when they fall into the green grass . They smell like music , like old songs . We were poor when I was at your age and littler , always poor . My mother and father , my sisters and brothers , we all worked in the fields of potatoes and beets and paprika and oats . My brothers they were two , Kaspar and Rudolph , and my sisters were two , Olga and Philomena . It was Philomena I loved best . She was my twin sister . Some day I go back to bring Philomena to this good country . She waits for me to get enough money to go back for her . " Well , as I said , we were always poor . Sometimes we66 WINDSWEPTdid not have enough to eat . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times were very merry and good , we forgot that we were hungry . What did we do , you say , on our good times ? In the summer , when we were not so hungry because there were fruits and berries to gather , we went for walks over the plain toward where we could see the high mountains more close . Often on Sundays we did this , after Mass , for all day . We picked all kinds of flowers , many like you have here , many different . There were daisies and wild roses like you have here and one flower like you do not have . In my country we call it Our Lady 's tears . " It is a red flower with magic in it . For if you gather it and pray for all those who have broken hearts while you do so , they will all be healed of their broken hearts . One flower , one prayer , one broken heart made mended , they used to say in my country . But one day I and my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan , gathered many of the flowers called Our Lady 's tears , too many . Our hands were full , and we forgot to pray for the broken hearts . This is a sin , I said to myself , and I told the priest about it , and how Anton and me did not know of enough broken hearts when we remembered to pray . But the priest said , ' We will pray now for all the broken hearts in Bohemia and for all the broken hearts in all the world . They are very many , ' he said . ' That will make it right , ' he said . That was a wise man , that priest . " Well , on those good summer days we rolled hoops when we had them . The blacksmith , who was a kind man , sometimes gave us the rims of wheels which wereWINDSWEPT 67worn out . We mended them , and they were fine , great hoops to roll . Or we flew many kites , which we made out of paper and pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a fine sight , yes ? to see a kite with a coloured tail up in the air and to hold the string , runningfast over the fields . The priest near us was a great master in making kites , and he had much paper from packages sent to him . My friend Anton , who shines shoes with me in New York ,  --  he and I went with the priest to fly our kites after we had helped him to say Mass at the altar in the church . Sometimes he would take lunch with him  --  enough for us all  --  bread and cheese , and sometimes even meat , and sweet cakes called kolache . Those were the fine days . " In the winter when it was not too cold we built forts of snow . Then we drew lots , for some of us had to be the Germans or the Austrians , which we ( lid not like to be . We had fights then , and the boys who must be the Germansor the Austrians mostly let themselves be beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were our sleds , or on a shovel , or just some days on ourselves . " Jan laughed then , his laugh resounding suddenly in the big , quiet room , with its living and its dead together . He waited for Daniel Perkins and John Marston to smile back at him . Then he said : " Now I will tell you how I once went to Praha , or Prague , as you say . John knows about Prague , but , Dan , you do not , so listen well while I tell you this good story . And , John , you listen well , too , because you must have forgotten a great deal since I told you the last time . Well , 68 WINDSWEPTwhen I was at your age , our house was from Prague twenty miles away , and I had never seen that great city . We had a neighbour , richer than us . His name was Jonas  --  Jonas Jurka was his name  --  and he was , what you say , close with his money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the sun was up , he come to our house and he said , ' One of my sons is sick , and the other son , he is to be married tomorrow and not want to work . Will you and Anton , ' he says , go with me to Prague with a great load of wood for the market , to help me ? ' he says . I ran to Anton 's house . What joy we felt to see the city of Prague which we had not before seen , ever ! " Well , we began to go , Jonas Jurka , Anton , and me , with the cart piled up with wood . Jonas had two oxen that drew the cart . They were great red oxen , and they were named for kings of Bohemia in the old days , one Krok and the other Ottokar . Now Ottokar was a good , gentle ox , but Krok was a bad one . Jonas said the devil lived right inside that ox 's skin . He bellowed and lashed his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy load . Sometimes he stopped and would not go on at all . We had to prick him with the goad and crack a whip above him . " ' I mean to sell that Krok in the market of Prague , ' Jonas said to Anton and Inc . ' I will not tell of his bad tricks , and I will get much money for him , for he looks well and is strong . I will save my money , for I tell you , boys , one good ox is better for a poor man than one good ox and one bad one together . ' That was what Jonas said . So we went on to Prague . " Long before we got there we could see many tallWINDSWEPT 6gtowers shining in the sun and high steeples of the many churches . It was a fine sight to me and Anton . We grew much excited . Our breaths came quick , our eyes shone . When we got nearer , we heard bells , hundreds of bells . It was a feast day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 the towers were ringing , and all the hundreds of people were going to Mass and then to the market . We had never seen so many people , Anton and me , and all in their bright clothes for the feast day . " What a place the market in Prague was ! Flowers and vegetables and geese dead and geese alive , and ducks and chickens in pens , and people buying and people selling . and all calling and talking at once . We boys helped Jonas unload the wood and tie it in bundles to sell . It was good wood and it sold fine . When Jonas had put the money in his leather bag , he said to Anton and me , " Now I will sell that Krok , if the devil will for a time leave his skin . ' " So he took Krok away from the cart and put a paper on his back that said in the Czech language , A good , kind ox to sell cheap . ' And he gave Krok hay to eat so he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peasant woman to look at him . She walked around him and felt his back with her hands . And what did that Krok do but lift his tail quick and splash her with his dirt ! " Jan laughed again here and waited for Dan and John Marston to laugh over the plight of the peasant woman and the vulgar trick that Krok had played upon her . From his corner by the fire Caleb Perkins suddenly added his laugh , which lent Jan courage . " My ! Was that peasant woman mad ? She was **29;8336;TOOLONG . Her face grew redder and redder as the people laughed at her . " See how your stupid ox has spoiled my holiday dress ! ' she cried . You will pay me silver for his dirt , ' she cried . And Jonas had to give her a piece of silver to make her stop her screams . " Then up came a farmer with his little boy . Jonas knew that farmer , that he was rich , and he began to tell him how strong Krok was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Krok heard those lies of Jonas , for all at once he swung his horns about quick and hit the farmer 's boy in the head and tore his face so that the blood came out . Then the farmer yelled at Jonas . " ' You foolish Honza ! ' he cried , which in Czech means , you stupid man , ' you lying mule , you gabbling gander ! You will pay me well for the hole your ox has made in my boy 's face ! ' And Jonas had to pay more silver from his bag . " Then no one would buy Krok , for all had seen that the devil was under his skin , and by and by , when the sun was low , we began to go home once more . What an angry man was Jonas ! Ile swore . bad words at Anton and me . I is said we had brought ill luck to him , but we sat on the back of the empty cart and watched all the towers and steeples of Prague fade away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bad words . " Jonas was so angry that he struck Krok more and more with his leather whip and pricked him with the goad , and suddenly Krok made a great jump and sprang away from Ottokar and the pole that held them together . Then he ran leaping and bellowing across the road and through a field of grain . Another angry man was the farmer who owned that grain . He came running from his barn and he said to Jonas , " ' You will pay me for my grain that your ox has trarnpleddown , or I will go to the law ! ' So Jonas had to pay him , too . And by now Anton and me , we had to hold our faces tight not to laugh . " By now it was night , and the moon was coming up in the sky , big and round . The farmer , who was a kind man after he had Jonas ' money in his own leather bag , let us leave Ottokar and the cart in his farmyard while we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would mend Jonas ' cart for him . There was a little river below the farmer 's house and across another field , and by that river there were gypsies . There are many gypsies in my country , more than here . Well , down we went to the gypsies . They were sitting around a big fire with an iron pot on it full of something that smelled very good to Anton and me , for Jonas gave morning . Jonas swore at the gypsies , who only laughed and said things in their language which we could not know . " By and by Jonas found Krok hid in some trees by the river , but the gypsies would not let him go . They all made a circle around Jonas and laughed at him until his face was red with madness . Then one of them began to speak in Czech , which he could speak all along only he wanted to make Jonas more mad . " ' The ox , ' he said , ' ran away from you and came to72 WINDSWEPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings keepings ? ' he said , just as you boys say when you find things . What comes to us is ours , is it not right , brothers ? ' And all the gypsies laughed loud and screamed that it was right . You will give us coins for our ox , ' the gypsy man said , or we will keels him . We are more than you , and we keep this good ox . ' Then Jonas had to give them coins all around their circle , and they danced about him and laughed in his red face . " But one of the gypsy women was good to Anton and me . She gave us each a big tin cup full of that stew in the iron pot while the men laughed and danced around Jonas . All my life , Daniel and John , I have remembered what was in that tin cup , meat and thick gravy and bits of corn and peppers and mushrooms like what we used to gather in the woods after a rain and dry to cook in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a warm feeling in our stomachs . All my life I have remembered how good was that tin cup of gypsy food . " The sun was rising again when we got back home with Krok and Ottokar . A very , very angry man was that Jonas . Ile would not speak a word to our fathers and mothers and all the others when they ran down the road to give us good-day . And he would not give so much as the smallest coin of silver to Anton and me . But our fathersand mothers , they laughed when Anton and I told them about that wicked Krok . And my father , he said , Well , sometimes the devil , he does good and right things . ' I always remember my father saying that . And that , Danieland John , was the way I saw the great city of Prague . " 17John Marston and Daniel Perkins must have fallen asleep when Jan had finished his stories , or perhaps even before . In the morning they were on the rug by the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was full daylight when they awoke . Jan and Daniel 's father were not in the cabin . Neither was Philip Marston 's body , as John discovered when he had at last summoned courage enough to look toward his father 's bed in the far corner of the room . When he and Dan had hurried out-of-doors to get away from the awful silence of the room , they found that another day was soft and warm , although the clouds were closer to the earth , the sun was less bright , and there were longer , higher swells breaking on the rocks . Once out of the dark path through the spruces and into the pasture , they saw Jan standing on the high pasture land just before it gave place to the stretch of headland above the sea . John Marston always remembered Jan standing there beneath the milk-white sky with the brown land stretchingbefore him and the sea beyond . He was leaning upon his spade before a mound of brown earth . His coat and cap lay on the ground , and as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad shoulders and his short , stocky body , he gave the impression of strength as well as of loneliness . There was something of the very nature of the land itself in his still figure there beneath the whiteningsky . It was some minutes before he saw the boys watching him from the slope below . When he did , he74 WINDSWEPTleft his spade standing in the pile of soil and came down the hill toward them . There was a little knot of men gathered farther down the land eastward . They had come through the woods from IIeron Cove before dawn , bringing lengths of new lumber with them . Caleb Perkins had made Philip Marston'scoffin from the fresh boards , while Jan with others of the men to help him had dug his grave in the hours after dawn . The men went back to breakfast with them . There were six of them , tall , lanky men , fishermen and farmers with brown faces and hard-worked hands . They helped out things immeasurably although they said almost nothing . Two of them helped Jan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under Caleb Perkins ' direction , got things in readiness for them to leave . Then when breakfast was ready , they all sat around the big table and ate so hungrily that it was easier for Daniel and John to eat their breakfast , too . After breakfast was over , two of the men took Dan with them across the beach to the anchorage to help in getting things aboard the ketch . The others followed Caleb Perkins from the cabin , leaving Jan and John Marstontogether . Then Jan went to John 's bed and took from the shelf above it his small black prayer-book which he used at school . John standing by the fire , stared at him , uncomprehending , until Jan said in his slow , quiet way : " It is not easy for you , what I shall say , but it has come , and we must do as your father said . We must not leave him here without a prayer to God . I can not read the wordsWINDSWEPT 75straight and right , and there is no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . You will be glad some day that you did . My own book says it is , what you say , Advent Sunday , the time of the Lord 's coming to this earth . I found the place last night in your book , and the other place where it says The Burial of the Dead . I know you can not read much , but you must read a little . I have marked the places , here and here . " He gave the book to the boy , who stood white and still beside the dead fire , and remained beside him for a moment without speaking . Then he said , " We are sad now , but we shall not always be sad . Some day we shall be joyful on this land that your father wanted we should have . " His words sounded in the still room like the words of ancient prophecy . Then they went out together toward Philip Marston 's grave . Caleb Perkins and the other men were waiting for them there . Everything was ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them , undoing a parcelof brown paper as he did so . There were some scarlet geraniums in the parcel , and he held them out awkwardly to young John Marston . " My wife sent these , " he said . " They ai n't much , but she had n't no others , and she wanted there should be a flower or two . " Then they all stood together by the open grave , and John Marston read the words that Jan had marked in his book . It was the collect for Advent Sunday . In all the years afterward that they read it in the chapel at Windswept , which they were later to build , its prayer for grace to76 WINDSWEPTWINDSWEPTcast away the works of darkness and to put upon us all the armour of light now in the time of this mortal life , they were to see that little group of men standing about John Marston on that vast brown summit of land beneaththat whitening sky . They were to hear his voice sounding clear and strong in the still air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words about the quick and the dead , about rising to the life immortal , about corruption and incorruption , the Resurrection and the Life . The sun came suddenly out , bright and warm , as John Marston finished his reading . It made the red flowers , which Jan had held in his hand , glow above the brown earth . It made the wide waste of sea before them blue ; it sharpened the islands and purpled the distant Mt . Desert hills . Then they all repeated together the Lord 's Prayer , which Caleb Perkins started , and when they had finished , Jan drew John Marston away , down the pasture slope toward the path through the trees to the cabin . Just before they entered the path , they looked suddenly back and saw that the men were still standing there with their hats in their hands . The sun made their shadows long across the high brown land , stretching still and bright upon it . They both always remembered how the men waited quietly there until they should be out of sight. 18Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone back through the woods to Heron Cove and on to the77village . Caleb Perkins and Daniel were to sail with them down the coast to the harbour where The Sea Hawk would be hauled up for the winter . A wind had risen , blowing from the southwest , increasingsteadily minute by minute . It was just the wind they wanted , Caleb Perkins said . Before it swung into the northeast , as it was bound to do before nightfall , they would be secure and safe in the harbour eastward . Once they had left the anchorage bay and rounded the headland , they caught the full force of the wind . The ketch lay over , her sails filled , and she cut the water with a fine speed . Dan held the sheet with Jan beside him to tell him when to let out , when to draw in . Caleb Perkinsleaned against the main hatchway , smoking his pipe , scanning the weather . John Marston went forward and stretched himself along the prow above the sea . The wind blew steadily on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strong and high against the shore and the swells white long before they cut them . Sailing and sorrow , John Marston thought , do not go together . It was for all the world as though they were upon a pleasure trip rather than upon a sad return . He would not look back upon the headland , he thought , as he lay with his face buried in his arms . He would not look at anything at all until they had rounded the point , passed the great light , and were swinging north toward other land . He would not look , he thought , because , if he did , he might be tempted to return to this place where life had ended for him . And that , he thought , he could never do in spite of his father 's wish and Jan 's stupid prophecy . Then the rise and fall of the ketch as78 WINDSWEPTshe took the waves , the wind in the sail above him , the distant roar of the surf against the rocks , merged into a soothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he awoke , they were nearing the point and the great light . The sun had gone , and the sea was steel gray beneath him . Soon they would swing northward , and Windswept would be gone from sight . Ile must look back , he thought . It would not be right to leave his father there without looking back . It would be as though a black curtain had been let fall between yesterday and today , between the morning and the afternoon , between things that had gone and things which were to come . He could not return to school knowing that he had not looked back . If he could make himself look back , only once , for the most fleeting of moments , it might summon his father again from that dark , lonely summit of land where he lay . He rose and stood in the prow , looking first at the great rocks of the point over which the gulls screamed and circled , then back along the high shore , past the cove where the surf crashed , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the in iles of dark , empty land , climbing higher and higher , until at last his eyes saw the promontory , circling back above the sea . THE POSSESSION 1881  --  18831IT WAS ALWAYS a matter of grateful wonder to young Philip Marston and Ann and later to Roderick and even to Julie that the house at Windswept was ever built ; that Jan and John Marston and Caleb Perkins ever triumphedover the bulwarks of opposition in New York and in the old Marston home in Gardiner above the Kennebec . Whenever they returned to it in later years , from school or college , from holidays or sojourns or visits elsewhere , they were always to feel surprise by the simple fact that it was there after its narrow escape from nothingness . Jan , whose life was to span three generations of Marstons like some long , strong bridge upheld by columnsacross a wide river , never allowed them to forget the perils which had beset its building . And together with this tenacious hold upon its past was the almost incrediblesight of the house itself after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open water . It held , moreover , that mystery which the completely familiar often holds and which the strange and unfamiliar often lacks . It was like that wise saying of one of the ancients : it was true because it was impossible . Philip Marston , with the foresight characteristic of him , had , two years before his death , named as guardian of his son until he should come of age his partner , Jamess , 82 WINDSWEPTLassiter . He had done this in the knowledge that James Lassiter was honest , sound , and conservative where business was concerned and one of the kindest of men . He had done it also , of course , with the tacit reservation that James Lassiter 's services would never be required anyway . Persons abounding in the vitality of Philip Marston often possess such forethought ; not liking things at loose ends , they are forever tidying up their personal affairs ; yet at the same time death to them is as remote a possibilityas famine , pestilence , or a World War . Philip Marston'sact had been performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked and admired , partly as a halfhumoroussop to Chance , partly because he was the sort of man who likes to feel that he has not in the least particularneglected his responsibilities . There was doubtless also another reason lurking in the background of his mind which out of a decent loyalty to his family he did not bring boldly out into the light of day . His mother , Ellen Marston , then seventy-five years old , still lived in the family home above the Kennebec . She was a self-possessed old woman with clean-cut , well-entrenclied ideas . She made quick , impregnable decisionsand , although most of them had been made in the past and never altered , Philip Marston had been long aware that she was capable , whenever necessary , of makingnew ones . She disapproved of New York , which she had never seen , despised and feared all foreigners , and contended that the only reputable places in Maine for one to live in were Portland and the historic Anglican towns on the Kennebec . Bangor was an upstart place of crude lumberjacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing whatsoever . While other women of more adventuresome , if less pretentious , familieshad sailed with their husbands to the far corners of the earth , she had with better sense and far better decorumremained at home . She was tenacious of her son , whom she had never known , and jealous of the affection of her only grandson , which she had , as a matter of fact , never possessed . Her grief over Philip Marston 's death had been modified , even inundated , by resentment that she had not been informed of it before he was buried , and by an outraged sense of propriety in that he had been laid away with no rites of the Church in some wild piece of country of which no one whom she knew had even so much as heard . Beyond the necessity of a brief visit twice a year to his grandmother , to which his father always lent the support of his uneasy presence , John Marston was for the greater part of his time quite oblivious to her existence . The visits to Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were hurriedly and gratefullyforgotten until a distasteful foreboding warned him that another was imminent . He hated the big house , which his grandfather had built of bricks painted gray and topped by a mansard roof . It had a porte-cochere , and a coach-house in the rear and , standing upon a hill above the river , it was as much out of place in its present surroundings as was Ellen Marston herself . He hated the formal , dutiful greetings once they had been driven from the station , the interminable breakfasts in the dark dining-room with his grandmother imperturbable behind the coffee-urn , the sense that each of them ( he and84 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 85his father counting as one ) suspected the other , the quick , pointed questions of his grandmother and his father 's evasive replies , the veiled references to his mother , and the sadness which seemed to rest always on his father 's face for all the days that they were there . They never stayed any longer than they had to , although getting away was almost more costly than lin- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come as a distasteful surprise in spite of the fact that his father had carefully and well in advance stated the exact hour of their departure . His grandmother never quite brought herself to say that they could easily stay longer if they really wanted to ; but the truth of it was so obvious to everyone that he sometimes thought it would be a relief if it were brought out into the open , expressed in her clear , cold voice , and candidly admitted by the three of them . There was rarely anything to do in Gardiner except to endure whatever happened and to feel like someone else in one 's own clothes . Whenever he read , his grandmother thought he read too much ; whenever he sat without read- ing , she thought . he was wasting his time ; whenever he sat with his hook while his father and grandmother were talking , she thought he was impolite . She thought and said that his manners were not what she had always in- sisted his father 's should be when he was a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark back stairs , through the kitchen , out the back door , and down the hill behind the house for a walk along the Kennebec . He loved the river flowing wide and deep be- tween high slopes on its way to Merry Meeting Bay where it would join the Androscoggin at the sea . He liked the fresh smell of newly cut lumber , the rasping , peremptory slash of the saws , the wet brown lengths of the logs , tetheredin gigantic geometrical patterns in the water , awaitingthe mills or the decks of broad-beamed schooners , the golden pyramids of pulp-wood catching the sunlight . He liked to watch the agile balancing of the men who walked the logs , turning them with their long cant-hooks , calling to one another in their quick French patois . They often wore red coats or shirts and made splashes of vivid , movingcolour against the brown or green of the hills and the deep blue of the river .

He and Sarah had a silent understanding between them , evident and oddly comforting when she brought his clean clothes to his room or played Chessindia or dominoes with him sometimes in the evening . Sometimes his walks were open and above board , suggested by his father and reluctantly assented to by his grandmother . But on these occasions she warned him against loitering about the mill and lumber yards . No one knew , she said , what he might pick up , in disease or worse , from the awful people who worked in Gardiner nowadays . " It takes every ounce of strength and faith I have , " 86 WINDSWEPTshe was always saying , " not to worry myself to death over the future of this town . And the worst of it is that no one seems to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she said this at breakfast , his father had answered her to his own peril . " I 'm wondering what there is to do about it , " he said quietly . " The country 's changing , New England like the rest , and we may as well get used to it . What would you do ? " His grandmother became so agitated then that she spilled some coffee on her immaculate white fichu which she wore over her lavender morning dress . " Do ? " she cried . " Do ? I 'd send all these ignorant French and Irish back where they came from . We do n't have to have them here , do we ? Buying our decent old homes and ruining our schools ? Setting up their horrid churches on our old streets ? Why does n't the President of this country and the Congress say they ca n't come ? " " I 'm afraid it 's not so simple as that , " said Philip Marston . " Together with the coffee stain ( for Ellen Marston was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her decorum . " It 's perfectly simple , " she said , her words icy and bitter , while young John Marston kept his eyes on his plate . " It 's just that men like you condone it all . And , what 's more , you encourage it , having immigrants in your house to corrupt your son 's mind , taking them in your boat in place of decent people , and setting them up in business as though they belonged here . You never tell me what you do , but  --  I have ways of finding out . I know far moreWINDSWEPT 87than you think I know about the way you and John live in New York , and the things you let him do . " " I do n't think we 'd better talk any more about it , " Philip Marston said . " John and I do n't see it from your point of view . " The inclusion of him in his father 's thoughts , proud as it made John Marston , was a fatal step . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the indefinite postponement of other visits to Gardiner . But now with Philip Marston dead and his own world in confusion , John Marston knew that his grandmother was a power to be reckoned with . The house in Gardiner with its high , clean rooms filled with old , dark furniture , with family portraits , with glass and silver and china from across the seas , and with the echoes of bitter words , usually unspoken but always lingering there , now emerged from the obscurity where he had always before managed to consign it and loomed darkly upon the horizonof his mind . He knew too well his grandmother 's tenacious , ugly sense of duty . Now it could not fail to be directed toward him as the only surviving member of her immediate family . Fears of holidays in Gardiner became terrors so real and depleting that James Lassiter wrote to Ellen Marston at Christmas time refusing to countenance the boy 's departure from New York . Jan stayed with him on West 28th Street through December . They built ship models in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anton joined them now and then . Awkward and fumblingin his speech and ways as Anton was , he was sorry88 WINDSWEPT for John Marston and did what he could . The puzzled housekeeper at last grew used to Jan 's presence at the table in the big dining-room ( upon which John had insisted in spite of Jan 's own protests ) and to his sleeping in the room next John 's . He was clean and quiet , bathing and changing his clothes each night as he came from work . I le said little , but he was there , and it always seemed , the housekeeper thought , as though there were more there than just Jan 's stocky frame and slow , kind ways . On the evenings that James Lassiter came to talk with his ward about the future , Jan was there . He rarely took part in the uneasy conversations , but in an odd way James Lassiter knew that he was behind and through whatever answers he himself managed to draw forth from John . He wanted to dislike Jan but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike , he took refuge in suspicion , but that also vanished before Jan 's direct gaze and John Marston 's confidence . Moreover , he had the memory constantly assailing him of Jan 's service for Marston , Cobb , and Lassiter during the two years fol- lowing his arrival in New York . He had often said to Philip Marston during those years that his partner 's mad insistence upon employing Jan and Anton had more than justified itself . They had both given good measure , but Jan in particular had proved to be the Gibraltar among all the errand boys . After he had reiterated his reasons for disapproving of the house at Windswept , the distance , the loneliness of the place , the impossibility of a young boy 's knowing how to manage a home of his own , the cost of the build- ing and the upkeep and the wisdom of investing money securely against possible hard times , the manifest social advantages to be gained by John Marston 's spending his summers with other boys , his own , for example , Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating to James Lassiter that it was always made in the same words . " John 's father wanted the house should be built , " said Jan . " He is dead . We were there when he died , and we heard what he said . " It was Ellen Marston 's frequent letters to James Lassiterwhich began slowly to over-rule his own well-founded objections to the house at Windswept . They came on Wednesdays and Saturdays throughout December , directed to his firm until she had been informed of the unwelcome news of his guardianship , thereafter addressed personally to him . Ann Marston has these letters today and often reads them . One , dated December 12th , i 88o and written in a strong , bold hand on black-edged , heavilylined paper , speaks eloquently of her great-grand-mother : James Lassiter , Esq. , New York . Dear Sir : Yours of the loth instant has been received and its contentsmost carefully noted . I am relieved to know that my grandson is bearing manfully the tragic death of his father , which has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any word from him since his father 's death , will you kindly direct him to write to his grandmother ? The information that you were two years ago appointed as the boy 's guardian was naturally received by me with some9O WINDSWEPTmeasure of surprise . I had not until then realized so acutely my son 's tacit admission of my age and incompetence . Surely he must have been aware of my deep interest in my one grandson and my sense of duty and responsibility toward him . My son has never entrusted me with any information as to his financial condition . I regret to say that I know less than nothing of his affairs . I assume that he was a man of competence , if not of wealth . Upon his coming of age he received from his father , my late husband , substantial securities , which I trust have not been allowed to diminish in value . I should appreciate at your earliest convenience information relative to these matters . Had I not been stricken with illness , which has without doubt been accentuated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , of course , have come immediately to New York and remained over the Christmas season , which will inevitably be a season of grief and unmitigated sorrow . You will , of course , see that my grandson comes to me here in response to my invitation already forwarded to him but not as yet acknowledged . I shall thank you to tell me also at an early date of the household arrangements now in force at my son 's home . I trust that some elderly woman has been caring for my - sandsonin my own unavoidable absence from him , and especially that he has not been left to the care of servants , of whom at one time my son kept a strange collection . Although you are evidently to be in charge of John 's materialnecessities , I am sure you will not esteem it in any way an intrusion if I take upon myself his moral and spiritual welfare and watch over his education . I am writing to the Reverend Dr. Coit at St. Paul 's School as to these urgent matters . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent , will be despatched at once to school , even though the term draws to a close . Nothing can so assuage grief as theWINDSWEPT 91faithful performance of one 's regular duties . I am sure you are aware of this fact . I assume also that my son 's house will be sold as soon as possible . My grandson will , of course , make his home with me in the town which his forefathers founded and in which so many of his family have grown up . There is one last matter upon which I wish to consult you . Can there be any possible reason for respecting my son 's odd request , made at a time when he was surely not himself , that he should be buried in a distant and isolated tract of land , the purchase of which , as now so tragically proved , was the whim of a moment and a sad mistake ? The members of his family , both men and women , have for generations been buried in the churchyard here next the church which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should not rest among them . May I hear from you , my dear Sir , as promptly as may be concerning these matters so close to my mind and heart ? Yours very truly , Ellen MarstonP.S . John will go from Concord to Boston on the 21St of December , thence on the 5:oo P.M. train to Gardiner . He will be met at the station . I have so informed him , but I fear that he is notoriously careless of details . I shall also so inform his school . A series of letters such as this , together with the total lack of headway made in numberless advisory conversations with his ward , was slowly winning James Lassiter over to the absurd notion of retaining Windswept and building a house there . His tardy decision was finally clinched by a visit from Ellen Marston , who suddenly announced her intention of coming to New York early in January before her grandson 's prolonged holidays92 WINDSWEPTshould be at an end . A veiled allusion in one of James Lassiter 's letters to Philip Marston 's purchase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thrown her into indescribable confusion , and resulted in her immediatedetermination to straighten out minds in New York more confused than her own and to put at once to rout any such intolerable notion . Upon her visit to New York hung the fate of Windswept ; from her subsequent defeat came its possession . Ann and the second Philip Marston never passed through Gardiner on the train on their way to and from Windswept without gazing upon the house high upon the hill above the railway and wondering by just which window their great-grandmother had sat while she read James Lassiter 's letter and sprang to her momentous decision . They could see her at any one of them , quivering with angry fear , which she mistook for righteous indignation . And even now when Ann Marston drives through the high streets of Gardiner , going out of her way only to pass the old house , she plays the same game with her fancy . Now the house is cut into flats for its new occupants , the French Canadians and Irish who work in the mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever assailed by baffling , half-fledged notions of vehement ghosts , which haunt the broad staircase , the white wainscotings ? Are they ever aware of shadowy hatreds and suspicions as , returning from work at night , they pass beneath the porte-cochere to the wide front entrance , cluttered now by the debris of a dozen ill-assorted children ? Nor has she ever slipped down the North River on some ship bound for Europe without gazing upon theWINDSWEPT 93old building , which once housed Marston , Cobb , and Lassiter , and which still holds the room where Windswept grew from a dream and a desire to a reality . When she has seen it crowded there , squat and sooty and undistinguishedamong its cleaner , towering neighbours , she becomes once more a spectator and listener at that extraordinaryconference which took place in James Lassiter 's office on January 4th , 1881. 2When Ellen Marston arrived at the office , accompanied by old Sarah , who was laden with wraps and frightened out of her wits , she found in addition to her grandson and James Lassiter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one big hand some rolls of paper , and a short , almost square younger man , who stood by the window drumming with short , almost square fingers upon the sash . After she had greeted James Lassiter and her grandson , stared at Jan , and assigned a far corner of the room to Sarah , the man in the uncouth clothes was introduced to her as Caleb Perkins . " And who is he ? " she asked in quick suspicion . " He was engaged by Philip to build the house in Maine , " explained James Lassiter . " I sent for him . " " So matters have gone this far , " she said , " without consulting me . There is one Marston house already in Maine , my own . There is no need of another . You are only a child , John . What , may I ask , will you do with a house ? " 94 WINDSWEPT " I shall not always be young , " said John Marston . " And I shall live in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And who , may I ask , will live with you in such a godforsakenplace as that ? " " 1 shall , " said Jan . I t was snowing outside in fine , drifting flakes , and Jan spoke from the window where he had been standing by himself , looking out upon the gray river with its ferryboatsand barges , tugs and steamships . Ellen Marston stared again at him as he turned to look at her . " You will live with him ? " she asked . " And who might you be ? " " He is Jan Pisek , " explained James Lassiter again . " He was a friend of Philip 's . " " Pisek ? " she said with distaste in every letter . " What kind of a name is that ? I have never heard such a name in all my life . " " It is a Bohemian name , " answered Jan . He came forward then and stood nearer her , his wide , gay eyes gazing calmly upon her distraught , angry face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend . Now I am a friend to his son . " Ellen Marston turned from Jan 's quiet gaze to James Lassiter , tapping her foot impatiently against the red carpet as she did so . Incredulity had for the moment swept the anger from her face . " It 's all a monstrous notion , " she said . " It must be stopped at once . My grandson living in the wilderness of eastern Maine , miles from civilization , with a foreignerWINDSWEPT 95whom no one knows . It 's absurd and outrageous . It 's ... " " We all know Jan very well , Mrs. Marston , " interruptedJames Lassiter . " He was , as he says , a friend of your son . He has been in our employment here , and he has sailed with Philip for years . He is quite capable of looking after John . He has known him since John was five . In three or four years your grandson will need no looking after . John is far more dependable , I think , than you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " Ellen Marston said . " Should I not know him better than you or this Pisek man here ? " Her voice rose louder in the big , dim room which the snow was darkening . Jan took a match from his pocket , struck it , and lighted the gas jets on the wall . " I 'm frankly surprised at you , Mr. Lassiter , " went on Ellen Marston , " for so much as considering such a mad scheme . I had thought you a man of more sense . I am the boy 's grandmother and the only living member of his family . In that position I have rights . As his grandmotherI forbid any further tampering with such non-sense . " " I 'm afraid you ca n't forbid it , " said James Lassiter . " It was your son 's expressed wish that the house should be built . He bought the land and paid for it with this end in view . I have a letter from him to this effect written but a few days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of three persons who heard him make it . If you do not choose to believe your grandson and Jan here , Mr. Perkins will tell you . He has brought96 WINDSWEPTPhilip 's own plans which he made himself . He will be glad to show them to you . I asked him to come down to New York for that very purpose . " Ellen Marston stared at the big man sitting uncomfortablyin the chair opposite her own , and as she stared , comprehension slowly took shape in her mind . But there were limits even to her gifts of speech . " Am I right in thinking , " she began , and then stopped , relying upon her face to complete what she dared not ask . " You are quite right , ma'am , " said Caleb Perkins quietly . " My son killed your son . He and I shall have that to remember all our lives . It is not an easy thing to have in one 's mind . I am sorry . We both liked Mr. Marston . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't cure what 's over and done with , " said Ellen Marston . " But we do n't have to add one tragedy to another , do we ? And if a house has to be built , which it has n't , why build it in a wilderness miles from decent people ? It 's that god-forsaken place that killed my son . I tell you once and for all that I wo n't countenance it ! " " If you saw the place , ma'am , I do n't think you 'd ' , eel the way you do , " said Caleb Perkins . " I do n't know a finer place for a young man to live in . " " It 's a beautiful place , " said Jan from the window . " Beauty ! " cried Ellen Marston , her anger mounting . " What do you know about beauty ? There 's beauty enough in a thousand places . This country 's full of beauty  --  there 's more beauty than common sense , there 's the pity ! " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , " she said , " do n't you have any respect for yourWINDSWEPT 97grandmother and what she thinks ? I 'm in charge of you now whatever the law may say . I 'm your moral guardian . You 're only a child . You ca n't disobey me like this . If the rest of these people have n't any sense , you and I have to have it for them . Do n't you have any respect for me at all , I say , and for what I think is best for you ? " Jan always admired John Marston for what he said then , and if James Lassiter still harboured any misgivings concerning Philip Marston 's wish , they vanished at that moment . He rose from his chair , a tall , thin boy in his black clothes , and stood before his grandmother . " I have more respect for my father , " he said . " He is buried there . I want to do as he wished . I should think you would want to do as he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there with us away off here ? Before long I shall be a man with rights of my own . If we do not build the house now , we shall build it then . " His grandmother for the moment set aside the quiet certainty of his last words and leapt to answer his question . " I have not the slightest intention of leaving him there , " she said . " I have already taken steps to bring his body home to Gardiner . My lawyers will see to that . If he had to be buried like a heathen , he does not have to remain so . " " He was not buried like a heathen , " put in Jan from his place by the window . " He was buried as he wanted to be buried . We know , we buried him . " " Will you please , " cried Ellen Marston , " have the goodness to speak when you are spoken to ? My lawyers will write you , Mr. Lassiter , and I beg you to pay decent attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of her only son . " 98 WINDSWEPT " But not the rights of a man himself , " said James Lassiter . " I have the right to say where I wish to be buried , and so have you , and so had Philip . I think I must tell you once and for all that I shall oppose any attempt to remove his body from the place where he wished it to be . " " Ile was not himself , I tell you , " she cried . " I knew my own son , did n't I ? He would never have asked for such an insane thing had he known what he was doing . " " IIe knew quite well what he was doing , " said John Marston then . He was standing by his grandmother 's chair as he spoke , and he seemed to grow taller with every word . " And I 'm sorry to hurt you , grandmother , but I do n't think you knew him very well , even if he was your son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " Ellen Marston grew red in the face then , distracted and ruffled like some angry goose , Jan said afterward , which had been driven against its will into a pen and kept there . " I did not come here , " she cried , " to be insulted by an upstart boy , who knows nothing of what is good for him . Or to be shoved aside by men half my age . And what about money , Mr. Lassiter ? What about throwing : ? way thousands which ought to be saved against this boy 's  --  lime is sufficient money , " said James Lassiter . " You forget , I think , that that is my province . " " And you forget , I think , that I have asked you in every letter to inform me of my son 's financial status . Why should I be kept in ignorance ? " " I shall be glad to inform you when things are in order , " said James Lassiter . " At present you may rest secure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Philip was not a rich man , as the saying goes , but he was well-to-do . There is not the slightest occasion for you to be anxious about money . There was silence then in the big room . No one looked at Ellen Marston . Jan gazed out of the window at the snow , which was blotting out the shipping on the river . James Lassiter fumbled with the heavy silver paper-knife on his desk . Caleb Perkins sat awkwardly in his chair , his big hands folded about his rolls of paper . John Marston tried to keep his long legs from shaking and ( lug his hands into his jacket pockets for the same purpose . From her corner old Sarah snapped and unsnapped the hasp of her mistress 's black bag until she was halted in her nervousnessby an irritated glance from its owner . At last Ellen Marston broke the silence , a new note in her voice . " You are not yourself , John , " she said . " One ca n't expect you to be yourself , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Gardiner before you go back to school where we can talk things over quietly by ourselves . You must know that I want only what is best for you. , , " I shall not come to Gardiner , " announced John Marston . There was no defiance in his voice , only quiet , even courteous , decision . His grandmother rose to her feet then and stared from one to another of them , astonishment battling with anger . " Is insubordination then to be added to insult ? " she cried . " Do you condone this , sir ? " James Lassiter rose to his feet also . " I should not have condoned it an hour ago , " he said , 100 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 101 " but I think now that I shall . I have this boy 's happiness at stake . Ile will not be happy in Gardiner , and he has a home of his own in which to stay as well as my own in which he is always welcome . " Something in his quiet voice menaced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own ? " said Ellen Marston . " Do I understand , then , that you are mad enough to keep the New York house for a fourteen-year-old boy to lose himself in ? He will get over this nonsense in short order unless he is aided and abetted in it , as I have every reason to suspect . As I wrote you , his holidays will be spent with me . " " There are no holidays for some time , " said James Lassiter . " When they are near , it will be time enough to decide about them . As for the house here , we shall keep it for the present . I assure you John will be well looked after . " He drew his watch from his pocket and looked at it . " There is a train for Boston leaving in an hour . I shall be glad to call a carriage for you . It 's quite a drive to the station at this tirne of day , and the storm seems to be gettingrather severe . " Jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassiter 's office . He did remember that Sarah smiled at him timidly as she turned to follow her mistress . Ile remembered suddenly , too , how kind she had been to him during his visits to Gardiner , and it was more for her sake than for his grandmother 's that he opened the door for them to pass into the hall . Jan said that Ellen Marston gathered her wraps about her and stalked from the room without so much as a word of farewell to any of them . She was so angry , he said , thathe looked to see the fire in her eyes come out of her nose in flames like the fire-breathing bulls in the fable. 3True to his resolve , John Marston did not go to Gardinerfor the remainder of that school year . When he next saw his grandmother , his visit was made under circumstancesvastly different from those in New York . His relationwith her during the winter and spring of 1881 was confined on his part to infrequent , stilted notes telling of his progress at school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and example . Windswept was never mentioned between them . Ellen Marston discharged her duty and pampered her injured vanity by writing often and at length to the Reverend Henry Augustus Coit , Headmaster of St. Paul 's , confiding to him her many apprehensions concerning her grandson , whom , verbally at least , she entrusted , even consigned , to the good doctor'svigilance and wisdom . It was to the credit of the zealous , serious headmaster that he did not attach too much importance to the anxietiesand fears , even suspicions , which Ellen Marston at regular intervals poured into his patient ears . As a matter of fact , he was at a loss to understand the old lady 's fears concerning the quiet , rather studious boy who had been placed under his care . He had known Philip Marston , who at seventeen had spent a year at St. Paul 's while the school was in its earliest beginnings , a mere handful of boys added to Dr. Coifs newly established home in Concord in order to make a school . The headmaster's102 WINDSWEPTunfailing memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached him from the same source concerning Philip Marston more than twenty years before . Parents , he often said wisely to himself , when , in his infrequent lighter moments , he allowed himself the freedom of personal annoyance , and not their sons , were the real problems of a headmaster . Philip Marston had sent his son to St. Paul 's because even from his own one year there he had been unable to forget Henry Augustus Coit . Not that he felt affection for the tall , often somber young headmaster in a white cravat and a long black coat . Affection was too trivial and quite too familiar a term to be descriptive of either the source or the result of that permanent , indelible impressionwhich the headmaster of the new school in Concord had stamped upon him . Nor could he have defined the impression itself . When he thought about it afterward in Harvard or upon the high seas , as he often did , it beggaredany attempt at definition . It was not wholly compoundedof fear , although fear , even terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although awe was an ingredient ; nor of mere respect , although that was never absent . It reached for its being far back , beyond and behind the headmaster himself . I t was born of some tremendous affirmation , with the possibility of which mankind had been endowed since its beginning , some faith , which , he vaguely knew , swept those whom it seized upon from the humdrumof existence into new and fervid life . Once possessed by it , one walked in lonely ways , consumed and nourishedalike by the same glowing fire . It had its source far beyond creeds and doctrines , although it necessitated bothWINDSWEPT 103for poor human explanation ; and with both Dr. Coit was generously supplied from his evangelical , Bible-reading ancestors . And yet behind his passion for righteousness , his reliance upon the Word and the presence of God as the one thing necessary for the well-being of man in this world and for the assurance of his better being in the next , was something deeper and greater , some apprehension , mystical perhaps , of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tangled and ineradicable , or so lost and out of sight , in the debris of daily existence . Philip Marston , through his memory of his one year at St. Paul 's , knew that its headmaster had unrelenting hold upon some Reality which no boy could understand and which few men would ever experience , save perhaps in fleeting glimpses , in all their later years . There it was , fiery and zealous , calm and serene , fundamental and unassailable , secure and everlasting . ' lucre it was , behind all his conservatism , his frequent tyranny , his probing irony , his stoicism , his almost fanatical purity , his passion for moral integrity , his persuasions , his exactions , his reserve , his dogmatic discipline , his aggressive insistence on duty . There it was , impossible of explanation , unrecognizedperhaps even by him who possessed it , at one momentbaffling and estranging parents , at the next , reassuring , even hypnotizing them . Between such men and the rest of mankind there is a chasm never crossed , a gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bursts like some gigantic skyrocketblazing across a dark sky before it is again dissolved in darkness . In John Marston 's day Dr. Coit still wore his long black104 WINDSWEPTcoat , which no boy and no master had ever seen him without , still gave his Thursday evening talks in fervent , euphuistic English , still watched games from the edge of the playing-field , always interested , if a bit puzzled , still inscribed on the fly-leaves of Confirmation prayer-books or Greek New Testaments his name and the assurance of his friendship in his fine , formal hand , still exacted , and expected , from his boys their best and from most of them got it , because in failing him they were uneasily conscious of failing some greater demand than his own . In John 's day the headmaster wore a beard , which he stroked in reverie or perplexity and pulled in fury ; and between his fine brows were two deeply cut lines which in some odd way could add immeasurably to his look of pain , bewilderment , or reproach when some boy failed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held even more firmly than other wise men of his day that the ancient languages were the irremovable basis of any educationworth having . But it was Windswept which supplemented , indeed complemented , John Marston 's study of Greek and Latin in 1 ) r. ( ; oit 's bare class-room at St. Paul 's . It was the crashingtides of Windswept which made those barren , unharvestedseas of Ilolner real and necessary to him ; it was the winds there which swept the plains of Troy and filled the sails of the long Greek ships . Between his eyes and the hexameters on the page before him were familiar images , of which Dr. Coit , intent on syntax and prosody as well as poetry , was unaware , images which in the fraction of a second transformed the Aegean Sea into Frenchman'sBay , the Mediterranean into the open AtlanticWINDSWEPT 105tumbling from Petit Manan to Fundy , the brown , sunbakedslopes of Ithaca into the promontory where the house at Windswept stood . For by the time John Marston had left the dull , interminableparasangs of Xenophon for the wine-dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way to completion ; and when , in his last years at St. Paul 's , he was hearing through the lines of the Georgics the hum of Jan 's bees in the clover and buttercups and yellow rattleof the field behind the barn there , the shingled walls of both house and barn were beginning to weather in wind and rain , sun and fog. 4There were no years long or full enough to crowd from John Marston 's memory that summer of 1881 when he helped to raise the four walls and the roof of his own house . His memory always began with the prickling in his legs and the odd emptiness in his stomach when he at last in early June left Concord to meet Jan in New Haven with The Sea Hawk in readiness . In Boston he was joined by Julian Lassiter , James Lassiter 's eldest son , who was undistinguishing himself and his family at Harvard Collegeand whose father , at the end of his wits and his temper , had prescribed a summer at Windswept . Added to the fifteen-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior , there was nagging at John Marston during the long six hours from Boston to New Haven , the disquieting possibility that Julian might not like Windsweptand that , disliking it , he would disrupt the neces-lob WINDSWEPTsary order of their days in this first enthralling summer . There was another notion which had been in his mind ever since the building of the house had been assured , lying there , hopeful and comforting . In a new house , he had thought over and over again , in his room at school , in odd moments on the playground , in his walks by the stream , even in Chapel  --  in a new house one could take care that no harsh and bitter thoughts were lurking about ; in the two houses he had known that had been impossible and quite beyond his control . He should always remember how as a little boy he had seen his mother , tall and lovely in a white gown , standing by the red velvet portieres , which separated the two big parlours of the house in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say goodbye before going to Europe or to some other place which seemed equally far away . Her face was still then , cold , careless , even cruel , not as it was when she bent to say goodnight to him . He remembered , too , the high , bitter voices he had overheard , sometimes at night , , sometimes when he came upon his mother and father unawares ; and he was finable to rid himself of the fancy that the words lingered there in the high rooms to disturband puzzle him at his play . It had been the same in the house at Gardiner . But iii a new house , he had thought , in which one began from the beginning , no such startling , sorry ghosts need be . Not that restlessness and dislike were the same as anger and disdain , cruelty and harshness ; and yet if Julian did not positively like Windswept , even indifference would be hard to bear . These fears tormented him as they sat together on the dirty red plush seats of the swaying coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that Julian accompany them , yet neither had liked to refuse his request , remembering too well the stalwart part which James Lassiter had finally played in the realization of the house at Windswept . Julian was a handsome , well-built boy with a careless , haughty look , which increased John 's discomfort . He tried to remember how Julian at his own age had been decent to him , a small boy , when their fathers had taken them on holiday jaunts together . But it was hard to recall Julian at fifteen in this young man in a light checked suit and gay tie , which , lie told John , his club at Harvard had chosen in order to set its members apart from those less fortunate . John was still wearing his black clothes . He had been fearful of donning any others for his formal and terrifying goodbye to 1 ) r . Coit . They accentuated even more the gulf between hint and Julian , and he was painfully conscious of them . Julian bought a magazine and pop-corn from the news-agent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the intervals of his reading and munching strove to draw from John some definite informationconcerning this place of his unwilling exile . " What 's it like  --  this Windswept place ? " " It 's hard to describe . It 's  --  it 's like itself . " " Oh , come off ! That does n't mean a thing . " " Well , in the first place , it 's big and open without many trees , and the sea runs terribly high . There 's always surf on the stillest days , and there 's usually a wind . " " Cold , I 'll bet . Maine 's always cold . Any decent place to swim ? " lob WINDSWEPT " There 's the anchorage . We could swim there , I 'd think . " " What 's the anchorage ? " " It 's where we keep the ketch , out of the swells . It 's quiet there with sand . " " Well , that sounds a bit more hopeful . What 's the ketch like ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 's good at catching whatever there is when there is n't any . " " Can we sail a lot ? " " Of course , why not ? Only I expect we 'll be busy on the house . Maybe you wo n't want to help , though , and if you do n't , you need n't , you know . " " Oh , I sha n't mind pounding a few nails . At least there wo n't be professors telling you you 're no good . God ! I 'm sick of books and of frowsy old men . The trouble is those old moss-backs do n't know a thing about life . They do n't know anything except their musty old tomes . I supposethey 're better at St. Paul 's handling kids , but at Harvard they do n't know beans about young men . Har- ' varcl 's just a putrid sink with a lot of dead fish floating in it ! " Joint tried his utmost to think of something witty and disparaging to say about I ) r . C:oit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustices at St. Paul 's which he could summon into his confused mind , all the overlong assignments , all the unfair , silly rules , the dull , interminable Sundays when no games were allowed and when one read pious books , if he read anything , the long hours at church . He strove to recall whispered conspiraciesin the hall-ways , those empty threats of last term toWINDSWEPT 109throw wheezy Mr. Packard into the stream in retaliation for his insistence on poems written in Latin , those raw jokes played on dull old Walker , who in reality never got the point of the jokes at all . He longed to convert St. Paul 's into a dark den of plotters , of outraged boys who hated school and books and masters . But , faced with this Harvard omniscience , all the stories he could tell seemed childish enough , and he succeeded only in looking red and feeling woefully inexperienced . It was almost a relief when Julian stormed on . " Well , at least I 'm not being tutored like last summer , saying Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ca n't serve a decent tennis ball and who carries a Vergil in his coat pocket . God ! How I hated those Georgics , queen bees and grafting and all the rest of it ! The Aeneid had some sense to it once you dug it out , but those silly effusions on the rustic life , those happy tillers of the soil ! Excuse me ! But there , I must n't disillusion the young . I suppose you like the stuff yourself ? " John longed to say that he felt precisely the same as Julian , but even if he had tried to do so , his face would have belied him . His embarrassment was increasing every minute almost to the point of illness . " I have n't reached Vergil yet , " he said , " but some of the fellows at school say he 's stiff enough . I  --  I ca n't say I like Cicero much . " " Cicero 's pap to Vergil , food for babes . And anyhow he had some sand . Well , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle ! Tell us some more about Windswept . Miles from everywhere , is n't it ? " 110 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 111 " Yes , but I do n't think you 'll mind , really . There 'll be lots to do . " " What , for instance ? Be specific . I 'm not the man for a wilderness . " " Well , there 'll be the house first . It 'll be fun to see it go up and to  --  to help . And I 'm sure there 'll be swimming . And there 's The Sea Hawk and lots of fishing , and long walks , only maybe you do n't like walking . And Jan means to set our own lobster traps . We can paint the buoys any colour we like so they 'll be our own . And it 's fun to haul them early in the morning . " " Jan 's the Bohunk fellow . What 's he like ? My father said at Christmas time he was like a Maine boulder . He said he was as set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't get in my way . " John welcomed the anger which , mounting in him , put for the moment his embarrassment to rout . " Jan 's splendid , " he said , turning in his seat to gaze for the first time straight at Julian . " And if you kno what 's good for you , you wo n't call him a Bohunk . He 's the best man I know , Jan is . Ile 's proud of coming from Bohemia , and lie 's as good an American as you or I. He was my father 's friend , and he 's my friend . If you do n't like him , there 's just something wrong with you , that 's all . And if you do n't treat him as you 'd treat any  --  any other gentleman , you 'll have me to reckon with , too ! " The sudden surprise in Julian 's face banished its carelessness . Ile stared back at the younger boy beside him , seeing all at once beneath the honest anger the tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit ashamed of himself . The kid had had a hard time , heremembered , losing his father and all . And , after all , you could n't expect a mere school-boy , shut up in a prison , to get the right slant on books and professors . He would best change his line of talk before there was a flood of tears . And besides , he liked the kid for standing up for his friend . He even grew rather red , quite honestly , in his turn . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't mean to be insulting toward Jan . I just do n't know him , that 's all . I 'm sure we 'll make out all right  --  I expect I 'll have a ripping time  --  and I 'll like straddling a roof in overalls for a change. - Honest , I will . You do n't need to worry about me . I 'm not going to throw a monkey wrench into things . And it 's darned nice of you to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that Latin and Greek were given a rest , the matter of Jan straightened out and understood , he could talk more easily about Windswept , how they would live in the cabin while the house was being built , how Caleb Perkins had already bought two cows for them , and how Jan planned to plough up some of the less rocky pasture land in the hollow near the cabin and make more field for grass and hay . By the time the Connecticut had widened its valley to near the blue waters of the Sound , he was able to look upon Julian less as an incumbrance than as a companion. 5He was surprised to find Anton with Jan on The Sea Hawk in New Haven . He had not been prepared for him , but there he was , strong and quick and more than a bit112 WINDSWEPTquiet , hustling about with his usual efficiency , storing away provisions , seeing to the sails , looking at his watch from time to time , studying the wind , talking to no one . When John had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had gone below to change from his black clothes to an old shirt and trousers , Jan followed him . Anton had not wanted to come , Jan said , but he had at last been persuaded to do so . There were things that he and Anton must talk about together , and in New York there had been neither time nor occasion . These things had to do with Anna 's brother Ambroz , whom Jan did not like . Anton was going to marry Anna in September , and he seemed , Jan said with a rather tired shrug of his shoulders and an anxious clasping of his hands together , to be marrying Ambroz , too . " Ambroz is not good for Anton , " Jan said . " But Anton , he is blind . Maybe I can make Anton see about Ambroz while we go . " They got away at dawn under a good wind . By afternoonthey had cleared the many craft of the Sound and were running free , wide of the coast , with filled sails . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with Jan . During the voyage to Windswept it seemed to John that they were always talking . Sitting aft and watching the sails while he and Julian lounged forward , smoking their old black pipes as The Sea Hawk . lay at anchor in some harbour or cove at night , they talked in their own old language , shut away from John and Julian , the strange words sometimes rising above the shifting and easing of the sails , the creaking ofWINDSWEPT 113gear under the wind , sometimes hushed in the stillness of the evening . " Whatever are they saying all this time ? " Julian asked . " I do n't know , " said John Marston . But he did , although he could not have explained to Julian even if he had wished to do so , because the things they were leaving unsaid were so much deeper than anything they were saying . Nor did he himself understand it all fully . Ike was too young for that . And yet as he watched the two of them , crouching there below the filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered evenings in the Narodni Budova , things his father had said , and Jan 's stories of his past . And because of these memories he knew , although he could not put his knowledge into words , that Jan was striving to keep untouched and secure those old realities which he and Anton had known , the burden and the brightness of those old years in an old land . Jan strove harder than Anton because he was able to recognize more worth striving for . He was striving to keep alive in Anton the decencies of poverty and hard work and waiting , the desire to be true to old and simple faiths , the wish to remember in all the temptation to forget . Anton dealt in hours , Jan in centuries ; Anton , with men , Jan , with mankind . In Jan 's mind a man dwelt by himself within himself , in an impregnable stronghold of old loyalties , within which stronghold he was the guardian of old gifts , the suffering and the sacrifice of countless others , long since gone but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 115umphs , fears and hopes . A man was thus the inheritor and the guardian alike of time , its guerdons and its punishments . Within him was the long past , the confusing present , the uncharted future . If this stronghold were stormed and overcome , a man was lost , set adrift , his identity scatteredinto fragments , the infinitesimal glow of life , for the tending of which he alone was responsible , absorbed into darkness . Jan did not begrudge Anton the quick gains that Ambrozhad promised ; he did not resent Ambroz in his place as Anton 's partner . What he feared was the loss of Anton himself , and more for Anton 's sake than for his own . Ambroz was quick , shrewd , and hard . He would bring out these qualities in Anton , probe for them where they lay dark and menacing , lurking beneath the better things  --  the thought of home , its simplicities , its toil , its ingenuousfaith in America and in Anton . Ambroz would make Anton forget . Ambroz had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before when Jan had gone with Philip Marston and John on The Sea Hawk and he had come to help Anton in Jan 's absence . Waiting , watching with his small , sharp eyes like some snake with poison in its fangs and strength in its coils , ready to spring when the moment : came , crawling into the shop through the winter , working with them on busy days , suggesting this and that . Ambroz knew ways of making money quicker . That , he said , would hasten the marriage of Anton and Anna , procuretheir farm for them , start them out on the sure road to prosperity and plenty . Why should they wait , he was always saying ? Why should they hoard their savings inthe bank when he knew men who could take those savings and multiply them many times in even a few weeks ? The ocean was wide , he said , and Anton had his own way to make in the world . After all , he said , America was not the old country . It had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man was stupid and a fool , he learned to use those ways . He was careful not to say these things when Jan was there at his work . But they were there all the same , in his face and in his quick , sly ways . The worst of it was that they were creeping into Anton 's face also , and in the two loyalties now tugging at Jan , his old loyalty to Anton , his new and necessary loyalty to John Marston and to Windswept , Jan was less able to cope with them , push them back out of sight behind the better things in Anton . Once , three years before , Jan had seen Ambroz give the wrong change to a gentleman , who paid for his freshly repaired shoes with a ten dollar bill . There was a dollar short in the change which Ambroz gave the gentleman . Jan called Ambroz 's attention to it sharply and set the matter right , apologizing as he did so . As he turned to go , the man had looked quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been but a careless mistake , at Anton sulky and embarrassed , at Jan confused , angry , and apologetic . " I 've had this happen here once before , " the man said . " You fellows better watch out . This country can get along without people like you . I 'll go elsewhere for my work in the future . " There had been a scene in the shop after he had left and a worse scene between Jan and Anton in their room116 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 117at night . Jan was for turning Ambroz out at once . It meant ruin to keep him there , Jan said , ruin to the shop and more lasting ruin to Anton . But he got nowhere with Anton , sitting there on the edge of their bed , sullen , drawn within himself , defensive , rebellious , studying his watch . Jan knew that Anna was waiting on some street corner and that he was no match against Anton 's honest love for Anna . Anna was good , though simple and unsuspecting . She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought them to New York as children , was dead . Anna had the old country reverence and fear which women there gave to the men they cared for , and she would not dare to suspect Ambroz , to disobey him , or to leave him before she was married , in spite of her love for Anton . Jan had been beaten then even as he was being beaten now as they sped northward in The Sea Hawk . John Marston recognized Jan 's defeat in the slump of his shoulders , the nervous working of his hands , the pain in his eyes . And Jan was not one who would think he was well out of it all when Anton went back to New York and they were working on the house at Windswept . Jan was not made like that . He would cherish all the old memories which he and Anton had shared , keep a bewildered faith in Anton for the sake of the memories . Instead of resentingthe suffering which Anton was causing him , he would love him more , having discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one never truly loves another until he has been made to suffer by that other . Julian improved once he was out of his checked suitand was helping to sail The Sea Hawk . The very fact that Jan and Anton were so much by themselves drew him and John Marston together . Julian shed his Harvard manner with his club tie ; he was immeasurably more desirable in corduroy ; and he even consented to say a good word or two , without too much patronage , for the Odyssey . John 's fears of the possible ghosts of discontent within his new rooms swerved in their source from Julian to Anton . But Anton did not stay long at Windswept . By the time he had spent two nights in the cabin , he asked Caleb Perkins for his horse to ride through the path to Heron Cove and on to catch the train back to New York . He had spent most of his time roaming about the open land , far from the promontory where the house was going up . He avoided Jan and , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pasture slope . No one was sorry when he returned to Ambroz and Anna. 6Of all the good things to which man may be the fortunateheir upon this earth , thought John Marston as he followed Caleb Perkins ' directions that first summer , none is better than to help frame the walls and the roof of his own dwelling place . He had been amazed when , after skirting Mt . Desert and leaving Frenchman 's Bay astern , they had at last swung westward again , to see upon the distant , bare headland the great joists and timbers already standing , fresh and yellow , above the sea . He had been unprepared for the leap inside him at the sight . That118 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT ' 119framework there , growing more distinct with every gust of the good southeast wind , took from him the last fear of returning , put to rout any dread of quickened sorrow . It put to rout , also , the loneliness and desolation of the long stretch of land , so dark and somber when he had left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summer . Indeed , even this gaunt outline of a house scented already to have conquered in its promises any threats which the land might once have seemed to make . Now awakened from its long loneliness , the place itself had become eager and alive , beneficent , filled with human expectations , mellowed and hospitable by the very presence of death within it . Never did a house take form and shape so quickly . John and Julian , tugging with crowbars on the rocky beach belowthe headland to extricate the right stones for the great chimney , prophesied the curl of smoke from their first fire before August should be fully spent . Sitting astride the roof in the hot July sun , they laid the last of the shingles . It was good to sit up there in their drill aprons , drawing the nails from their pockets , driving them with sharp , quick blows of their hammers . No man could ever see more , hear more , or smell more from his roof-tree , John Marston thought . The long stretch of blue water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , even pounding of the surf , silence and sound , sound and silence ; the crying of the gulls ; the thin , clear whistle and rippling notes of the white-throats singing all day long ; the smell of drenched seaweed and of dry , of wild strawberries ripe in the shaggy grass , of bayberry and juniper , of fresh wood , tarred paper , and pots of paint . Some of Caleb Perkins ' men began to raise the barn in August , and always others worked inside the house , laying the broad pine boards of the floor in the great livingroom , which extended across the front , setting the panes of glass , sand-papering to a satiny smoothness the walls of cedar , leaving to weather as they would in the heat and smoke of future fires the great open beams of the ceiling . There was no staircase . Everything was on one level , the two long wings bending backward at right angles to the front , dining-room and kitchen in the east wing with three small bed-rooms beyond , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had consorted well with whatever powers he called upon , for there was a never-ending supply of water already piped to the house . Added to the fun of building was the excitement of new discovery , the daily increase in knowledge of the place itself . In late June and through July the three-mile stretch of land was blue with iris , blossoming so close to the water 's edge that one looked down from the high bank upon spray-swept thousands , forming above on the land itself vivid patches of blue among the blueberry bushes , the alders , and juniper . Julian rather sheepishly drew from his belongings canvas , palette , and paints and made pictures of them among the red beach stones . After all , he said , one might as well handle a paint-brush now and then as well as a hammer . In August the goldenrod began to wave plumes of yellow along the path leading to the woods , and the tall fire-weed lent its brilliance among the tangles of raspberries . In August , too , the blueberries ripened , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff in one 's mouth . With the blueberries120 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 121came the curlews in brown , marauding flocks , crying their shrill , quavering cries , settling on a patch of berries and cleaning it in a few minutes as clean as the picked bones of a fish . In August the highland cranberries ripened , millionsupon millions of tiny round berries like drops of blood . I t was fun to pick them upon the high , rough stretch before the house and to winnow them , a red stream in the wind . When they walked to the sea-wall , as they often did in the late afternoon to straighten the carpentry cramps from arms and legs , they were sure to see blue herons , ospreys circling above their nest in some tall , dead pine , and even an eagle now and then. 7Jan was everywhere that summer . He worked from dawn until dark . It seemed as though he hoped by the frenzied activity of his body to set at rights the confusion in his mind . He ploughed the lower slopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb Perkins ' horse around his neck , his back straining , his feet stumbling over the tough , reluctant clods of earth . He wanted more grass for his cows and for the right yoke of oxen for which they were searching . He wanted more wild flowers for his bees . Ile laid stones for the wall , which was to connect the two wings of the house , and form the garden enclosure , which Philip Marston had planned . He dug clams in the sand of the anchorage beach . He gathered great hunks of driftwood and piled it in a huge , ungainly pile . He cooked the meals for John and Julian and Caleb Perkins , whosemen shifted for themselves over a stove in the tent where they slept . He milked his cows in the small field , tetheringeach and sitting on his stool in the field grass , making the milk stream into his pail in straight white threads . He hewed from blocks of wood their new lobster buoys , planed them smooth , formed the tough , cylindrical stick at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the trap rope . They were stout , splendid buoys . When he had finished a dozen of them , Julian painted them a bright yellow and when they had dried , printed Windsweptupon them in fine , symmetrical letters . Then he cut each letter out with his pocket knife to the depth of a quarter of an inch and with black paint made the inscriptionstand out clear and unmistakable . The lobster buoys , making gay splotches of colour as they floated in the blue or green or gray water off the cove , gave them a sense of proprietorship over the sea as well as over the land . Julian liked Jan . John Marston 's threats on the train to New Haven had no need to be executed . Julian got into the habit , when he was not working on the house , of following Jan about , working at whatever Jan was doing . Jan seemed an odd lodestone for Julian , John thought , as from the peak of the roof he watched Julian helping Jan clear his new field of rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew precisely what had to be done and was doing it , methodically , bit by bit , carefully , exactly . Perhaps it was that Jan gave an odd kind of assurance to those who lacked it in themselves . Once after a long day of particularly heavy work Jan fell asleep almost as soon as they had finished supper . The two boys were stretched out on the floor by the cabin122 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 123fireplace . Jan was in his chair . A thunder storm had come up suddenly with a high wind , which drove the full tide crashing upon the ledges with vicious whirls of spray like a shower of stones . Jan was a graceless figure as he slept , unmindful of the uproar outside . All the ugly , uncouth lines of face and feature , now that thought and purpose were for the momentlost in unconsciousness , came into being . His nose flattened with the widening of his nostrils , his cheeks sagged , his mouth relaxed and opened , the upper lip distortedand grotesque , the lower drooping in a crooked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , resting , one on either thigh , brown and coarse , the humps of the knuckles and the hollows between them making his hands look like ungainly loaves of brown , peasant bread . He had taken off his shoes , and his wide , clumsy feet with the outline of his big , awkward toes were flattened against the floor . He began to snore in horrid , repellent snorts like some flat-headed seal asleep in the sun on a rock above the tide . At his best he was like some symbol of squalid , dumb , thoughtless toil , of the toil which for centuries has earned bread only for more toil . At his worst he was like some satyr , some Caliban , deformed , inhuman , repulsive . John would have laughed at him sitting there , at the sudden and grotesque change which made him all at once everything which he was not . He was surprised and not a little ashamed of himself when Julian said , " Poor devil ! Let 's get him to bed . He 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth more than you and I put together . " 8In mid-August a week of impenetrable fog shut them in , and almost from one another . For against these massed battalions of shadowy hosts , moving in heavy silence from the open sea to beset the land , there was no resistance . Instead , after some singular manner of its own , the land seemed to yield itself willingly to the ghostly embraces of the fog and from their union to bring forth from itself all those dark and sinister aspects which the sun had put to rout . The total absence of the sky , the blotting out of space , made the vague outlines of earth all important simplybecause these outlines were the only things visible . To find oneself nearer the perilous edge of the high shore than one thought , to come suddenly upon an alder bush higher than the surrounding growth , to hear the sea poundingagainst the foot of a boulder when one could barely discern the top upon which one stood  --  these hitherto familiar things quickened one 's heart-beat and lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were consciousand before which each had his own peculiar misgiving . On days of high wind the fog took shapes , gray shapes , green shapes , shapes of murky yellow , scudding above the land , trailing their frayed garments across the dripping juniper and bracken , sweeping on across the pasture slope to join the gray hosts mustered to receive them , slipping into the new house through the frame of one window and out through another . It was for all the world as though the place had become inhabited by ominous , stealthy124 WINDSWEPTphantoms , hidden before , now by fortuitous circumstance abroad to wreak their will . The surrounding , engulfing silence deadened all sound ; iron hammers smote like wooden mallets ; saws lost their sharp and cheerful rasping and cut the damp wood with a subdued , asthmatic wheeze ; the fire in the cabin hissed and spluttered , its smoke coiling up the chimney to join the gray clouds without ; the bells of Jan 's invisible cows in the meadow were muted and dulled ; their occasional mournful bellow from the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day and night from the great light , whose revolving flashes became only sickly glows when at intervals between the rolling banks of fog they were seen at all . From the roof of the house , where the ever-settling dampness had become water , great drops struck the stones of the new terrace with muffled , sullen plops . And always , in the clinging , opaque obscurity , the drumming of the surf reverberated minute by minute , sepulchral and hollow , grave and solemn , the undertones of an unseen ocean moving somewhere in the grayness beyond their sight . " Twilight was indistinguishable from dawn , and darknesscause as no surprise . At night in the dripping tent and damp cabin voices were imperceptibly lowered as though the concealed world without were commanding concealment within . And when at last the retreating ghostly shapes allowed the sun again to appear in a sky which had been almost forgotten , one felt as though one had escaped from the stranglehold of death and knew for the first time the sweetness of returning life . WINDSWEPT 1259John Marston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once his school was over , had sent him on a schooner carrying lumber front Machias to Boston . The captain was a friend of Caleb Perkins , and Dan 's father had thought the boy would fare better in most ways if he were not at Windswept . John could sec that Dan 's father was worried about him . He had been silent and listless , unlike himself all winter , unwilling to play about as he had always done , shrinking from his friends . A summer quite away from home would be good for hint , his father thought , and he was in the best of hands . Although he did not doubt the wisdom of Caleb Perkins ' decision , John kept thinking that Dan would feel immeasurably better about things could he have worked with him and Julian on the house . Dan would have seen as he was seeing every day how the very building of the house had taken from the place all the sadness it had known less than a year before . There was no longer the least shred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fog , and they were soon forgotten . To become acquainted with it now , John thought , would have been better for Dan than to escape from it . Homesicknesswas a soil in which sorrows and self-reproach and confusion flourished . He would have liked to show Dan that the fulfillment of Philip Marston 's wish had banished sorrow , and that it was wrong and dangerous to place upon oneself a reproach which did not belong there . In126 WINDSWEPT the intervals when he was not too busy to forget Dan , he discovered within himself lurking fears for him . With all his anxiety for his son Caleb Perkins took pride in the now established work of his hands . He was like those diligent builders extolled in the Book of Wis- dom , who trust in their labour , who are wise in their work , and who , because of their labour and their sim- plicity , maintain the state of the world . Like them he watched hourly the completion of his design , like them he was satisfied only with perfection , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness , with his hands in the light . He was everywhere at once as the work progressed toward completion , striding from barn to house , from stone wall and chimney to the terrace , supervising , correcting , exacting . He allowed no one of his workmen to do the more delicate finishing of this and that . He alone must crown his own labour . 1 o In late August , when the return to St. Paul 's and to Ilarvard stirred uneasily in the minds of John and Julian , there came a day when one of the workmen , sent to fetch the mail from the village , brought back with him a tele- gram with the news of Ellen Marston 's sudden death . John , standing in the sunny enclosure in his swimming- suit , waiting for Julian to run with him down the pasture slope and through the spruces toward the sandy anchor- age , held the yellow paper in his hands , incredulous , an- noyed . The news at that moment not only announced an unpleasant interruption , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his world corn pletely forgotten . He was frightened as he stood there to realize that he felt nothing at all except inconvenience anc vexation . He grew red and uncomfortable before Julian who strove awkwardly to express sympathy and succeeder in conveying nothing save disappointment that their swirl. must perforce be abandoned . Caleb Perkins took him that evening to the village anc the next day went with him on the train to Gardiner They remained for two nights in the great old house : while he at one moment chafed at the decorous delay o1 the funeral and at the next was swept by dread of the big , echoing rooms with their harsh memories , which sprang upon him from the chairs and tables and even from the plates and cups from which they ate and drank . Worse than the memories and the embarrassment which he felt when his grandmother 's friends called to give hire their condolence , was the deadness inside his body and his mind . He tried to feel grief , and there was none , to summonup regret , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct toward his grandmother in James Lassiter 's office , and there was no sorrow . At intervals during the two days , out of a latent respect for the presence of death in the house , he made himself turn the black knob of the white folding-doors between the two parlours and go into the one where his grandmotherlay in her black coffin . The door always creaked a little , and the noise never failed to startle him into suddenterror . Instead of looking at her lying there , he sat uncomfortably upon the edge of a high-backed chair in a corner of the room , twisting and untwisting his fingers , 128 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 129picking nervously at the scab of a wound he had received while working on the house , staring now and then at a portrait of his grandfather above the white mantelpiece or looking at . a picture of his grandfather 's ship , the Ellen Marston , painted , as the star and crescent of a nearby lighthouse tower and as the mosques and minarets in the distance would suggest , in the Straits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he thought he might have liked him , for he had a look of Philip Mar- stoic about his mouth and eyes . Could his grandfather have loved his grandmother , he wondered , or had he named his ship for her out of custom and a kind of cere- monious gallantry ? Had there been harsh words in this house , too , suspicion and hatred between the long ab- sences welcome to both ? The two days in Gardiner were clear and sharp with the prophecy of autumn . From the windows of his room he could see the masses of goldenrod on the unkempt hill sloping down to the river , the purple and white stars of the asters , the red of one maple branch , turned early from the green of the rest , and brilliant above the blue Kennebec . He longed to run down the hill to the water where the men worked among the logs , but the still face in the back parlour forbade alike such indecorous levity and such shuffling off of family responsibility . Caleb Perkins felt no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay among the mills and lumber-yards , scru- tinizing these products of the Kennebec region to see if they were superior to those of the Penobscot and the St. Croix . In the evening he played long games of dominoes with John in the big , still dining-room before they went upstairs to bed , their shoes echoing in the strange silence of the house . In late morning and throughout the afternoon people called , elderly men and women , come not only to pay their respects to the dead but to take careful note of the living . This last fact was uncomfortably inside John Marstonas he received his guests , ushered by old Sarah into the front parlour , speaking iii low , seemly tones , scrutinizinghim standing nervously by the center table , tall , sun-burned and healthy iii his black clothes . " Would you care to see my grandmother ? " he always asked , as Sarah had told him to do , after the first formalitieshad been accomplished . Since they always did care , he led them into the back parlour and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them beside the coffin , while they gazed with a curiosity , which they honestly mistook for respect , upon the bold , strong features of the dead woman . Death had not shrunken the features of Ellen Marston as it so often does , or placed upon her face either oblivion or peace . One expected her eyes to open , her mouth to speak , her hands to order her household . One knew that she was there against her will , that she was neither submissivenor resigned , but instead beaten and resentful . If he could only have seen less imperiousness on the high forehead and sharp , finely-modelled nose , if only the straight , firm mouth could have suggested acceptance and serenity instead of the power still to command and to hurt , if the white hands folded across the black silk dress could have added helplessness and futility to their stillness , John Marston , in spite of the memory of un-13o WINDSWEPTeasy , fearful hours in that very room , could have felt sadnessand sorrow instead of indifference , embarrassment and fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the funeral on their last day in Gardiner , revealed to his perplexed mind wherein lay the only sadness of his grandmother 's death . She had come to his room to go over with him the names of the persons whom he himself must thank for flowers or other kindnesses . He always remembered her there , old and tired in her black dress and white apron , her face swollen with tears . " I 'm glad you have your house , Master John , " she said . " I wanted you should have it that day in New York , only who was I to speak up ? No one has ever spoke up in this house except to his own hurt , but there have been those who have thought their own thoughts . It was n't your house your grandmother was fighting or your father'sgrave away off down there . It was just being beaten she could n't bear . I do n't think she 'd ever been beaten before that day . I was proud of you that day , Master John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming after her . She 'd have fought even death something awful . Only she had no time . I found her gone when I took her up her cup of tea that she always liked before her breakfast . I 'll always mind how I looked at her and how I says to myself , I-Iere 's one fight you wo n't have to fight , Ellen Marston . Here 's one fight that 's been taken right out of your hands . ' " Young John Marston looked at the old woman . She had rolled the fresh folds of her white apron around herWINDSWEPT 131hands . It would be mussed and crumpled when she once let it go , he thought . Sarah must be nearly as old as his grandmother , perhaps even older . He knew that she had helped to care for his father when he was a little boy . Iie had been worried over her short future until his grandmother'slawyer had told him that she had been well provided for in Ellen Marston 's will . Now as he watched her extricate one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her eyes in order to dry the tears , which the story of his grandmother 's death had seemingly evoked , his incredulity got the better of his embarrassment . " Why do you cry so , Sarah ? " he asked . " Were you really fond of my grandmother ? " The old woman stared back at him , amazement in her face . She did not answer him for so long that he grew frightened . Perhaps he should not have asked the question , he thought . Perhaps it was wrong for the young thus to intrude upon the years and experience of the old . " How could you think I 'd be fond of her ? " she said at last , her voice dropping to a hoarse , angry whisper . " And I weigh my words , for there 's death in this house , and it 's bad luck , as all know , to speak ill of the dead before they 're carried out . Only I speak out because I 've had no chance to speak out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get at me . I 've lived here forty years with never a word to brace my heart , if you know what I mean . But I stayed on just so she could n't beat me the way she 's beaten everyone else , the old captain , and your father , and you when you was little , and all the others who have come and gone . She might have beaten me on132 WINDSWEPTthe outside , but she never beat me inside . I kept my own thoughts where she could n't get at them . ' T was a game I played all these years with all the coming and the going , in the kitchen and the stable , but with me always here . You see , I had no folks , and so all I had was to play a game-like with her . " And if you ask me why I cry so , I 'll tell you the truth , come what may . I 'm crying because there 's nothing about her and all my years that 's worth crying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry about after all these forty years . But there ai n't . And so I 'm crying because there ai n't a thing I can find to cry about . It 's a great grief , Master John , when there 's no grief worth grievingfor . " That afternoon when they followed Ellen Marston 's body down the hill , Sarah still sobbed in the corner of the carriage . As they drove slowly on above the blue river in the wine-like air , John Marston suddenly understood anew what the old servant had meant , the sharpness of grief over the absence of grief , the poignancy of sorrow because there is no sorrow , the tragedy of being dumb to suffering when one longs to suffer and can not . Just before they entered the church , they passed some French Canadians loitering in curiosity on the sidewalks . The men removed their hats and caps as the hearse and carriages passed , after the custom of their old country , retained in their new . John Marston and Sarah were at that moment asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been incensed by their presumption or gratified by their subservience . WINDSWEPT 133 11Jan stayed at ' Windswept that first winter after the house had been built and , thereafter , for all winters . He had not told John Marston of any such intention , nor , indeed , had he nurtured any such plan in his own mind . The three of them sailed back reluctantly enough in September , leaving Caleb Perkins to complete any finishingtouches that were needed . But whatever yet remained to be done was not visible as they skirted the great point and swung westward . For there on the distant headland under the early autumn sky stood their house , its chimneyrising straight and clear , the sun gleaming on its window-panes ,  --  ready and waiting for many returns . Jan saw Anton and Anna married the day after he reached New York . They were married in the Church of Saints Cyril and Method on East 4th Street . Ambroz acted as best man to Anton , standing with him in the chancel in a new blue suit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his breast pocket . Jan stood by himself in the front pew of the church while the priest read from his black book the Latin words which made Anton and Anna husband and wife . There were no other guests at the wedding . Anton and Anna made their vows in English instead of in the Czech language , which Anna did not understand . She would have liked to be married by the Polish priest , but Anton , with unusual firmness , had held out for the church which he and Jan had attendedever since they had come to New York . Jan felt134 WINDSWEPTgrateful to Anton for this decision . He would have felt odd and out of place in the Polish church . After the wedding was over , Ambroz , Anton , and Anna shook hands with Jan standing there in the front pew . They had found a flat near the shop where the three of them would live . After they had taken Anna to her new home , Anton and Ambroz would return to work . They had enlarged the shop during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat cleaning and blocking . Anna , who had worked in a straw factory , knew about hats , and , once she had things running in the flat , she would help them part of every day . There was good money in blocking hats , Ambroz said , and a woman lent a nice tone to a shop . They did not tell Jan about this as they shook hands with him after the wedding . Anton had already told him . Nor did they for a moment suggest that they did not expect Jan to be sitting in the shop on his stool in the far corner , cutting the tough leather for new soles , run ping the machine , for which he and Anton in their early days had with fear and hope laid down so many dirty bills . As a matter of fact , they did expect him there . They needed him for various reasons . One of these reasons was that he , like Anna , lent to the shop an atmosphere which Anton and Alnbroz needed . Jan stayed most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Now and then some tired people came and went , lighting a candle or two , dropping their pennieswith a clink in the iron box for candle money , whir , pering their rosaries before one altar or another , clutteringabout as they went from station to station of the cross . WINDSWEPT 135In the late afternoon Jan went back to the room which he and Anton had shared for ten years and gathered togetherhis things . It did not take him overlong . When he had given the surprised woman , who owned the house where they had lived , what she thought was fair and right , he went to the railroad station and sat among his belongings until at midnight a train left for Boston . By evening of that long day he was sixteen miles from Windswept , and Caleb Perkins , who had received a laboured telegram of his intentions , was waiting for him in his wagon . He did not find the winter long or lonely . After the last work on the house and barn was done and his cows assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a decent road out of the path that led to Heron Cove . There were fishermen at the Cove glad of a job when the fish were not running well and now that summer peddling among the coast settlements was over . They were good , strong men , and they worked well . But no one worked so well as Jan there in the flaming October woods . He used every hour of the shortening days , cutting down trees , clearing out underbrush , removingstones , hauling gravel with the work-horse and blue dump-cart , which Caleb Perkins found for him . Next to building one 's house there was no greater satisfaction to be had than to construct one 's road to it . He lived alone in the cabin once Caleb Perkins had returned to his work in the village and to Daniel , who was again at school . Before he set out for the new road in the morning and after he had left it in the late after-136 WINDSWEPTnoon , he had plenty to do : his daily inspection of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , his food , his water , his clothes , his bed , his fire . He was a good housekeeper . He kept his place at the table in the kitchen carefully set , his saucer and plate upside down on the clean , bare table , his cup upside down on the saucer . Ile spread his dish towels on a spruce bough to whiten and dry . On the shelves above his wall-bed he placed his possessions : his wooden crucifix , which Father Urban had carved himself ; his Missal and prayer-books ; a picture of the old castle at Prague in the snow ; photographs of Philip Marston and of John . On the highest shelf , half hidden from sight , he placed a tin box carefully locked , the key of which he carried in the breast pocket of his vest , transferring it whenever he changed his clothes and , for added safety , securing it with a safety-pin to the liningof the pocket . The box was filled with dry , brown soil from his father 's field . When Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed beside him in his grave . It had been given him by his father when he had left Bohemia , after an old peasant notion that a man should never be completely separated from his native soil , howeverfar he might wander . Every Sunday morning Jan washed himself in the kitchen and put on clean clothes . Then he took his crucifixfrom the shelf at the foot of his bed and placed it on the table in the cabin living-room . He stood or knelt before it as he read the Mass from his book , reading aloud the Latin words as Father Urban had taught him to do , standing for the Gospel , genuflecting in the rightWINDSWEPT 137places , making the sign of the cross . This was not what he would have wished , but it was the best he could manageunder the circumstances . He kept a quick eye to the weather , to which he daily grew more wise . He hoped that the deep snow would not fall until Christmas had passed , although he was ready for it with a stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If deep snow came , he might think it wise to dissuadeJohn and Julian from coming for their holidays , and he quailed before the exercise of that wisdom . For the boys , once learning of his return , had sent hilarious , eager letters of their proposed plan to join him in spite of snow and cold . Every Saturday afternoon in October he left work early and rode his horse to the village after his provisions . He liked coming home in the clear twilight , riding through the carpet of bright , fallen leaves , startling a deer now and then , hearing the drumming of the partridges and the high crying of the hawks , watching , as he came in the dusk through the last of the trees , for the companionableflash of the great light , seeing the long stretch of land lie in sharpened shadow under the round hunters ' moon . But as November drew on with its brief days , his isolationfrom the world of men and affairs became almost a passion with him . He ceased his weekly visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bake his own bread , to procure his own meat from woods and sea . He welcomed these renewed simplicities of his life as a child , the dependence upon the earth itself and upon himself as a part of it . He felt both young and old at138 WINDSWEPTonce , young in the vigour of his body , old in the sense that he was among ageless , primeval things  --  the winds that tore over the headland at night , extinguishing his lantern as he groped his way in the darkness to the barn where his creatures stood , the pounding of the surf , the empty vastness of the ocean , the stars in the night sky . Even his thoughts were primitive , having to do with the necessities of life , the battle for existence , the preparation for the winter . The line of dark trees to the north where the woods began , the expanse of the sea to the south , shut him away from the life among men lived beyondthose horizons . When he sat by his fire at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father returning from his work in the fields , content to rest before his door until he should go to the heavy , unconscioussleep of those who toil . Whenever he passed Philip Marston 's grave on the way to and from his work , he felt gratitude that in a new land he was thus receiving again and retaining the blessings and realities of an old . Sometimeshe felt like the first man to receive life and inhabit the earth ; sometimes he felt like the last man alive , his part to complete in dignity and in solitude the brief cycle of existence . He wondered now and then why he did not continue to visualize the future , which the big house on the headlandheld within itself . He had been constantly thinking of it in New York and during the summer . He wondered , too , whence had fled his fears for Anton , where the heavinessabout his heart had gone . He still worried about Anton in his mind , but the dull pain , which he had felt in the dim church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad station , had left his body . Surely these lurked still behind some curtain , now hiding one part of him from another , some curtain which would rise again and claim his time and strength . These were not dead , and yet for the moment they had not the life of the bread which he broke in his hands at his table or of the water which he poured over his bare neck and shoulders before he slept . When in mid-December a two-days ' blizzard , driving from the northeast , buried his new road beneath five feet of snow and enclosed his cabin almost to the eaves , he was surprised and a bit reproving of himself to discover that he welcomed rather than resented the wisdom of a solitary Christmas . Once the storm was over and Windswept was a vast , white , pathless waste behind and above a restless purple sea , he bound on his snowshoes and swung through the cold , up the high land , across its featureless summit , and on between the snow-laden trees of his obliterated road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send his carefully worded letter to John at Concord . He was honest enough in his fears , and he owed responsibility to John . But as he slung himself along over the hummocks and domes of the snow , halfblindedby the winter sun , he was monstrously content . He and his animals could dig themselves into this new , cold soil , they warmed by their own breath in the snug barn , he , beside his fire . Caleb Perkins took him on his sledge part way back through the half-broken road to Heron Cove . When he left him four miles from home , his snowshoes strapped to his feet , the shadows of the trees were already dark-4o WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 141and long across the snow . It was queer , Caleb Perkins thought , how ( me felt no fear for him as he turned into the patl-.111 ( 1 was almost immediately lost among the trees . Ile was Ills some hibernating creature , who , looking for one rest less hour upon the daylight , goes back to its cave for t I-e long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hummocks of snow , wedged by the wind beneath the overhanging edge of the high shore , were sending swift streams of water to join the full spring tides. 12It was James Lassiter 's wife , Mary , who generously took upon herself the furnishing of the rooms at Windswept . It was she who had the idea of the big dining-room table , which Caleb Perkins , with the future in mind , made out of great lengths of smooth pine , the chairs to - Hatch ; the wooden bedsteads and chests of drawers , painted a pale gray to tone with any colour which the sea outside the windows was destined to put on . She came to Windswept early that second summer when John Marstonbegan his life as owner of a house and land , and after two weeks of study and imagination returned to New York to shop , with John and Julian at her elbow , for the few things which Caleb Perkins ' saw , plane , and skill could not manage . At first she had thought John Marston needlessly stubbornabout what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was at Christmas time when John had visited Julianfor the holidays forbidden them at Windswept by the snow . Standing by the fire in the Lassiter parlour after dinner , John had told his guardian politely but firmly his wishes concerning the things in the house on West 28th Street and the things in the house at Gardiner . With the exception of a portrait of his father painted as a boy of sixteen , which had hung in his room in New York , and that of his grandfather from the back parlour of the house in Gardiner , he wanted to keep nothing at all , he said . He would like all the other things sold with the houses themselves . Mary Lassiter had stared at him standing there . She had remembered him as a shy , small boy , brought sometimes with his father for Sunday evening supper , and she was as unprepared for his quiet authority as for his added height . He had left the parlour for his own room after he had made his declaration . She could not know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustering his courage . " He 's a queer boy , " she said , when John had gone upstairs . " Has n't he any feeling at all about family pos-sessions ? " " It 's possible he has too much feeling about them , " said James Lassiter . " At all events I sha n't press him . " " Leave him alone , " said Julian . " It 's his house . Leavehim alone , I say . I know him better than either of you . " " Maybe there 's a dark secret behind it , " said EileenLassiter , who at fourteen was dressed for her first party . " I think it 's interesting . " " Do n't be a dramatic nincompoop ! " warned her brother . " You 're too grown up for your years . And if142 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 143you say a word to him about it , I 'll not dance with you once during the holidays . Mark my words now . " But alter Mary Lassiter had seen the house at Windswept , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , whatever its source . This was clearly no house for antimacassars , marble-topped tables , what ' tots , portieres , and black walnut chamber-sets , or even for heirlooms , regardless of their age and association . The house itself would have repudiated them all , been uncomfortable in their possession . I t was Mary Lassiter , too , together with Caleb Perkins ' knowledge of the surrounding countryside , who had been responsible for the installation of Mrs. Haskell as the housekeeper at Windswept . Mrs. Haskell came that secondsummer to preside over the culinary destinies of the household . She remained for ten summers , until , after John Marston 's marriage in 1891 and her own momentousdecision to enter upon a new and more daring vocation , Jan brought Philomena from the old country to take her place . The verb , however , is inaccurate . No one could be found capable of taking Mrs. Haskell 's place , at Windswept or elsewhere . Mary Lassiter always said that she had purchased Mrs. Haskell at the awful price of her own comfort forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live for even a brief fortnight under the same roof with Mrs. Haskell and ever again be even relatively satisfied with herself as a human being . She had driven many rough miles with Caleb Perkins from Cherryfield to Sullivan in search of Mrs. Haskell before , after a full week of calling at this back door and that , they had brought her home rejoicing . " I 've thought of these yellow chintz curtains for the living-room , Mrs. Haskell . They 're cheerful , I think . Lace or muslin do n't seem to go with this sort of house . " " I 've never heard of ' em myself in a parlour . But it 's no odds to me long as they 'll wash . " " And I did n't buy many table-cloths . The table 's so large and long , in the first place , and not the right shape for the usual cloths . Maybe you saw the mats Jan wove last winter from the dried grasses . I thought it might please him if you should use those on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much washing . " " It 'll be as you say , but I 'm used to washin ' , an ' nothin ' looks neater to me than a clean white table-cloth with a bit o ' starch to make it lay smooth . " " But the boys are careless . They 'll make spots . " " My boys did n't . An ' washin 's nothin ' to me . I 'm here to work . Settin ' still 's the only way Satan 'll ever get the upper hands o ' me ! " " I got coloured spreads for the beds . The boys seemed to fancy them . They 're something new , and people are using them for summer homes , I find . " " They 'll wash , I spose ? " " Oh , I 'm sure they will . The salesman said they were very practical . And I got plain blue china for every day . " " Well , blue 's neat enough , but it 'll show nicks more'n white or flowered . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind somethin ' awful . I ca n't abide things that ai n't whole or what they ought to be , if you know what I mean . " Mary Lassiter knew precisely what Mrs. Haskell meant . In the two weeks she remained at Windswept , waiting for144 WINDSWEPTthe furnishings to come from New York , she never once saw Mrs. IIaskell deviate from her straight , but not too narrow path . Once the things were placed in the rooms , she knew they would remain unalterably there in spite of Mrs. Ilaskell 's secret predilections , which would al , ways be in bondage to her recognition of authority and to her hatred of change . Mrs. I laskell did not like houses or people with too much give to them . She got used to what she had to get used to , and thereafter she stayed used to it . After the things had been placed to everyone 's satisfaction , except her own , she surveyed each room to its minutest detail . There it was , she said to herself , for better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as she was in charge. 13Mrs . Haskell had been born in 183o on her father 's ship off Cape Horn in what she was pleased to call , whenever she could be induced to talk about it , a master gale o ' wind . The scene of her birth had been one of intolerableconfusion : the mizzen mast had crashed and gone over the side ; the careening decks were littered with riggingand wreckage ; even her mother 's bed was drenched with salt water . Only a brief acquaintance with Mrs. Haskell would inevitably suggest , to those familiar with her past , that she had been spared in order to spend her life in atoning for her untidy , topsy-turvy entrance into this world . She hated confusion and disarray of all kinds both in herself and in her surroundings ; she adored with equal passion the straightening out of all manner of dis-WINDSWEPT 145order ; and behind her furious battles with the scant dust and dirt of Windswept lay that moral integrity common to Maine coast women of her day and generation and by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untidy mind ; careless dishwashing resulted in , or might well spring from , carelessor even loose behaviour outside one 's kitchen as well as within it . To skimp one 's work which was clearly set out for one to do was as dishonest as to cheat one 's neighbour , indeed was a dark prophecy of t hat very act . Mrs. Haskell was of necessity a religious woman . Withoutthe knowledge that God Himself had created an orderly world , life would have held no meaning for her . Just as she found it well-nigh impossible to visualize an earth without form and void , so she would have found equally distasteful the chimerical notion of atones hurling themselves out of confusion into order with no supervision . She liked to read in her Bible the story of the neat parceling out by God of His daily jobs for one full week , of those mornings and evenings of each particular day , none of which encroached seriously on any other . That short week , in which the world was so systematically framed with no loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her life , in her mother 's house , in her own , and now in this new , and , therefore , clean house at Windswept . On Mondays she washed , on Tuesdays she ironed , on Wednesdays she baked , on Thursdays she cleaned , on Fridays she churned and mended , on Saturdaysshe caught up with herself and made ready for Sunday . She could not understand how certain women whom she knew , and suspected , could shift their days146 WINDSWEPTabout at will and thus distort and imperil the order of their weeks . If it rained on Monday , she washed notwithstanding , taking now great comfort in the assurance that the strong winds could not fail to dry her clothes sufficientlytor rolling up against the Tuesday ironing . Mrs. Haskell 's road to Damascus was the path through the juniper and blueberries to her clothesline ; her heavenly vision , the perennial shine on her pots and pans hanging front their rail along the wall , and she was not disobedient to it . Captain Nathan Haskell , Mrs. Haskell 's husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three sons to rear . The eldest was himself at sea , master of a steamship of the Savannah Line and living when ashore in that city . Mrs. Haskell had never seen his wife , who as a Southernershe secretly feared was slow at things and what she termed as moderate . Her two younger sons had gone West and taken up farms in Iowa . Since they had married there girls originally from Maine families , she felt safer about them . And yet her weekly letters to the three of them seemed to suffice . She was now in no position to receive visits from them , since her own home was closed , and she could never have borne even the fleeting notion of being an uneasy guest in their unfamiliar households . To rural New England women of the last century this aversion to readjustment constituted one of their most typical and signal characteristics . In this they have been unlike many women reared elsewhere . Nor has this indigenousand intrinsic quality completely vanished today . It still accounts for elderly women living by choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neigh-WINDSWEPT 147bours , or working , still contentedly , in the homes of strangers , so long as they can have their way with things . Deep within them is the terror of dependence , the reluctance to see things ( lone differently , the fear of disappointment in the changed ways and thoughts of those whom they have reared . Loneliness , in comparison to disillusionment and to the necessity for coming to terms with ways foreign to their natures , is as nothing . They must live where they can preserve the order of their days and end their lives without bewilderment or misgiving where they began to live . Mrs. Haskell hoped that the lives of her sons were as much as possible like her own , and shrank from knowing that they were because of the unspoken , unadum it ted dread that they , perhaps , were not . When she thought of her past as she often did without rancour or regret , she was given to remembering her mother more than even her husband or the childhood of her children . She had loved her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , a composition which is often the ground-work and sometimes the entirety of loyalty between certain fine-minded persons of the same family . Her mother had had a hard life , largely spent at sea and often away even from her children . In her day women of Maine seafaring families were not so likely to accompany their husbands on foreign voyages as they not infrequently did twenty or thirty years later . Nor had she been the sort of woman to whom strange lands were more of an adventure than a privation . She preferred the yellowboards of her kitchen floor to any one of the excitementsof a quarter deck , the most menial tasks of her148 WINDSWEPT house to the long , monotonous hours of freedom aboard ship . When at forty she came home for the ten years re , maining to her , she spent the three hundred and sixty-five days of ca ( It , not in remembering London and Calcutta and Bombay , but in letting them slip completely from her mind while she rose early in the morning and saw to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of her mother 's death , which she accomplished , as she had always feared she would never be permitted to accomplish , in her own bed at home . She had been with her mother at the end , a girl of eighteen , herself about to be married . The sick woman had been unconscious for hours , slipping quietly away with apparently no sense of the past or the present and with no care for the future . But Mrs. Haskell always liked to remember how , just before her mother left a life , which through so many of its years had been inevita- bly not what she had wished it to be , she opened her eyes and , pointing to a picture which hung on the wall oppo- site her bed , said in the clearest of voices : " My clear , it 's crooked . Straighten it for me . " Although Mrs. Ilaskell was by no means an imagina- live woman in the full sense of the word , she was able to sec what lay beyond and behind her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of order with any of her belongings in disorder or out of line would have been to her not only insufferable but sinful . When Mrs. Haskell sat in the afternoon in her immacu- late kitchen , her sewing in her lap , she herself freshly " cleaned up " and ready for whatever might happen , she liked occasionally to recall her mother 's death , and to feel a neat pleasure in the knowledge that all her own belong , ings also , within her and without , as well as all those of others to whom she was responsible , were , in so far as she could manage , in seemliness and order . She loved her afternoons at Windswept . She had never been one to whom " folks " were necessary . After she had scrubbed her face and hands at the kitchen sink and redone her hair , securing it in a neat coil at the back of her head so that no lock could straggle from its rightful position , she changed her morning calico for her afternoongingham , her checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the two hours which she allotted for that purpose . Sometimes she sat in her rocking-chair by the window that faced the sea , knitting or mending , looking now and then in approbation about her spotless kitchen and at the broad face of the clock , which ticked away the orderly , inevitable minutes by which she lived . She never sat in her bed-room ( luring the ( lay . Bed-rooms in her code of behaviour were made for sleep and bore no relation whatsoever to the activities of morning or of afternoon . On fair days in the berrying season she often put on her white sunbonnet and went afield . She loved berrying . Nothing elated her more than to bring home a clean crock piled high with wild strawberries , meticulously hulled as they were picked , or a basket laden with blueberriesor cranberries with never a straw , a leaf , or an unripe berry among them . She was often given to saying that one could measure up a person accurately by looking at the berries she had picked . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out of sight or sound of it , 150 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT151and the wide land at Windswept was never lonely to her . She was not a mothering woman in spite of her three sons , whom she had reared in the fear of God and of shiftlessness ; and she never outwardly betrayed either sympathy or affection for the boy whose singular householdshe managed and whose clothes and well-being she had an eye to . Although she possessed to a strong degree the Maine coast wariness toward " foreigners , " she liked and respected Jan , largely because his methodical ways were her own , and because he never forgot to wipe his feet on the door-mat before he brought his pails of milk into her kitchen . John Marston , from the beginning of Mrs. Haskell 's kindly despotism , grew to look upon the east wing of his house as a place secure from any manner of disaster . He liked to come into the kitchen on a hot July afternoon for the cold water , sweetened with molasses and sharpened with ginger , which she prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked , as he read before his living-room fire on a windy , early autumn evening , to hear the ticking of her kitchen clock and to know that she was knitting busily beneath her lamp on socks for him . Ile liked the pot of oxalis swinging from a bracket before her kitchen window , the smell of fresh bread risingon the back of her stove , the strong , even strokes of the pump as she filled the tea-kettle at supper time . He liked to hear her singing at her work , Jesus , Lover of My Soul or Shall We Gather at the River ? When he rammed the prong of a pitch-fork into his hand , he knew comfortably that she was there with the iodine bottle and sound advice . When he brought his friends homewith him from St. Paul 's and Harvard , he liked the knowledge that they would be stuffed with good food and that there would be no objection to the number of them thronging about the house . He liked the hollyhockswhich Mrs. Haskell dug up from her own front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone wall and the back of the house . Jan liked them , too . They made him think of home . And when , late on autumn afternoons , just before he returned to school or college , he and Jan drove over the now completed road and came from the dark trees into the last glow of light , they both liked the clean , gleaming window-panes of Mrs. Haskell 's kitchen and the curl of fresh smoke , just visible , of the fire which she had lighted against their return . He was careful to warn his friends not to encroach against any of Mrs. Haskell 's bulwarks . If they could manage to hang up their clothes night and morning , to put their shoes in their closets , it would help matters considerably . And on no account were they to give her any money upon their departure . They might thank her if they wished , but if the expression of their gratitude elicited no response , they must not , therefore , conclude that it had not been received with thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's early years there , was not always so wise . " Here 's five dollars , Mrs. Haskell . My friend , Dick Foster , asked me to give it to you . " " What for ? Did I lend it to him ? I do n't recollect it . " " Of course not . It 's just that he wanted to thank you for all the things you did for him while he was here . " 152 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 153 " What things ? " " Why , cooking for him and doing his room and mendinghis coat for him . " " Well , it 's my job , ai n't it , to cook what 's eaten in this house au ' to mend what 's torn ? I earn what I earn an ' there 's an end to it . " " I 'm sure he meant it kindly enough , Mrs. Haskell . " " I 'm not sayin ' but what he did . But his money ai n't mine . Give it back to him for them that earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without earnin ' it . I 'm not one of ' em , that 's all . And while we 're talkin ' man to man , Mr. Julian , I may say I do n't like that young man over much . " " Now , come off , Mrs. Haskell . He 's a fine chap . What have you got against him ? " " I 'm not one to stick my nose in other folks ' business , but since you brought the subject up like , he meeches round in a way I do n't like . He do n't seem to have no drive to him , no git up an ' git . He slouches between the shoulders , an ' he never picks up his leavin 's . He do n't put himself out for folks , do n't have no respect for ' em , if you know what I mean . I do n't think he 's much good to you , Mr. Julian . " " Oh , come now , Mrs. Haskell . He 's my room-mate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ' That 's likely , an ' I 'm glad of it . There 's folks that hitch together an ' folks that do n't . He do n't hitch with me , that 's all .

" " Well . since you brought the subject up like , which Ishould n't ha ' done if you had n't , I 'll speak my mind about it , open and above board . He did n't put himself out none to make Mr. Perkins an ' Dan'l comfortable inside ' em when they was here to supper . Mr. Perkins do n't need to mind , but Dan'l 's different . Dan'l was squirmin ' about inside himself the whole evenin ' . I felt sorry for him , an ' Mr. John and Jan did , too . You do n't gain nor give nothin ' by takin ' no account of other folks . " " Oh , well , John 's a bit hipped about Daniel Perkins , and Jan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dick does n't know about things . He meant nothing at all . " " Well , you ca n't go about this world meanin ' nothin ' . As I see it , you 've got to mean sornetliin ' , an ' the sooner , the better . If you do n't mean somethin ' , but just go about meanin ' nothin ' , it 's hard for other folks to get the right slant on you . I 've said my say . Take it or leave it . " 14John Marston always said that he owed his wife to Mrs. Haskell , indirectly if not directly . For after Mary Lassiter , her work at Windswept completed , had returned to New York , Mrs. Haskell still remained uncomfortably but firmly in her mind ; and when she saw with re-opened eyes her daughter Eileen 's room , she determined to turn her over for a season to Mrs. Haskell . The unsuspecting Eileen was thereupon dispatched to Windswept instead of to the Lassiter summer home at Tarrytown on the Hudson . " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassiter had said , " to send her off away up there with just the154 WINDSWEPTboys and Jan and that woman in the kitchen ? What about Miss Thompson going along ? " " Nonsense , " said Mary Lassiter . " She 's gotten around Miss Thompson all winter . Just go upstairs and take one look at her room . I 'm sick of living by the silly opinions of my friends . It 'll be good for Julian to look after his sister for a change . Besides , they 're all only children anyway . And , believe me , my dear , you do n't know that woman in the kitchen ! " Eileen Lassiter and Mrs. Haskell got on famously after the first weeks of complete insurrection . " Where 's my red shawl , Mrs. Haskell ? " " Where it belongs , I spose . " " I left it on my bed this morning , and I ca n't find it anywhere . " " It do n't belong on your bed . It 's in your lower drawer . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , ' t is .

Whatever is it ? " " It 's brown paper soaked in good , clean ammonia . That gets ' em . An ' you 're to wrap your shawl in it after you wear it . " " What a fuss over an old shawl !

When you get ' em cleaned , sweep the dirt off my porch . ( ) r better still , clean ' em in the bushes where the wind 'll take the dust . " " Why ca n't Jan clean them ? " " Because they ai n't his shoes an ' it ai n't his job . If you ai n't ever cleaned your own shoes before , now 's as good a time as any to begin . An ' while we 're on this subject , there 's an iron scraper outside the back door . It ai n't put there to look at . " Mrs. Haskell had bed-rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barring actual illness , one should feel toward good food set before one on a clean plate . She had no patience with what she termed flighty and finicky notions about this preference and that . To pamper a healthy appetite by mere notional obstinacy , had never been condoned in her house , and she had no intention of allowing this new inmate of the household to dictate her larder or her oven . " Is it lobster stew again today , Mrs. Haskell ? " " Yes , ' t is . What 's the matter with it ? " " Nothing , of course , really . Only I do n't just fancy it . " 156 WINDSWEPT " It do n't make you sick , does it ? " " No , of course not , nothing makes me sick . Only I like other things better . Lamb , for instance . " " Lamb 's too high .

When I see your plate good an ' cleaned up once , I 'll be ready to listen to your likin 's . " " Do n't you like some things better than others , Mrs. Haskell ? " " No , I ca n't say as how I do . I do n't claim I have n't got my leanin 's same as most folks , but I was brought up to eat what was set before me , thank the good Lord ' t was set , and ask no questions .

I 'll get the irons nice an ' hot an ' start you off right , but it 's high time you learned to press for yourself . " After half a summer of such bickerings , with the odds weighted against her , Eileen Lassiter 's defenses fell . She was clearly no match for Mrs. Haskell . And once sheWINDSWEPT 157had succumbed , life at Windswept was immeasurably smoother for all concerned . Moreover , Eileen really liked Mrs. Haskell . She tacitly respected her for sticking to her " views , " however irritating they sometimes were ; and although she would never have confided in Mrs. Haskell certain of the fears and bewilderments of sixteen , the things that were secretly troubling her seemed alwaysironed out or , at least for the time being , put to rout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Marston and Ann were cleaning their plates and searching after the bottoms of their bowls at the same pine table , they always thought that to finish what was set before them was to haskell it . " Haskell your plate , Philip , " his mother always said . " You ca n't see the new puppies in the barn until you do . " " Ann , you have n't haskelled your milk yet . I 'm waiting . So natural a part of their vocabulary did this verb become , so free from humour or from any reference in their minds to a single personality , whom they had never known , that young Philip Marston , at St. Paul 's like his father and grandfather , used it on paper to his later discomfiture . " I 'm a bit puzzled over some of your words in this essay , Marston . Haskell , for instance . There 's no such word that I can find . You say here , When we had haskelledthe boat . ' I 'm not a sailor . Is it perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Philip grew red with embarrassment . " No , sir , I 'm afraid not . I 'm afraid it 's just a word in158 WINDSWEPTour family . I did n't think . I 'm sorry . You see , sir , it means , well , it means to tidy up . Haskell means to clean something , to clean up anything at all . " 15Daniel Perkins did not grow in grace , or in graciousnessas Ile grew older . In Mrs. Haskell 's homely phrase he continued to squirm about in his insides whenever he came to Windswept . He did not come often , and it took hours of urging from John Marston to get him there at all for any length of time . He adored John Marston , following him about at his heels like some thin , rangy red setter ; but he disliked John 's friends who came and went , partly because they were John 's friends , partly because they represented to him another world , a world which , though a part of John Marston also , never seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . In those few weeks , scattered throughout the summer , there could not have been a better companion than Dan . Alone with John , except for infrequent lapses , he broke down his defenses , forgot his stubborn , almost sullen pride , cast aside his ungraciousness and the crude manners , which , to John 's discomfort , he always seemed to keep in reserve , ready to assume them when he had been induced to come to Windswept while others were there also . Added to his honest liking of Dan , John Marston felt a sense of responsibility toward him . He knew that far beneathDan 's taciturn , resentful ways lay a deeper , almost morbid resentment of himself . He understood that not allWINDSWEPT 159the new security of Windswept , the contentment there , the knowledge that out of sadness and tragedy had come strength and confidence , the flower of safety from the nettleof danger , could completely dislodge that resentment , that sense of guilt , from where it lay , dark and sinister , in Dan 's mind , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to take oil ease . Sometimes in nights of high wind or on days of fog John 's fear for Dan had an element . of foreboding in it . Sometimes he thought it might be better for Dan if he did not come to Windswept at all . And yet he felt even more strongly the confidence that with pat ience and understanding , and , above all , with time as his ally , he could at length make things straight and right once more with Dan . In this hope Jan and Mrs. Haskell with their commonsense and wisdom lent him their support . Mrs. Haskell understood Dan . Beginning with the close of her first summer at Windswept she had decided to go to the village to keep house for Dan and his father . She would vastly have preferred a return to her own home ; but she was not one to nurture such a preference when she saw a need placed fairly and squarely in her path . Dan was a different boy once Mrs. Haskell had straightened out his father 's home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt the same confidence of which Eileen Lassiter had become aware in the kitchen at Windswept . When he came home from school on winterafternoons , Mrs. Haskell was there with supper in warm , comfortable preparation . There was nothing between him and Mrs. Haskell which was hidden , as there had come to be between him and his father. 16o WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 161 Sometimes during the first two winters Dan spent some days with Jan in the cabin . Windswept buried in snow with all its evidences of the past covered and blotted out was a safer place than Windswept in the summer . Jan , like Mrs. Haskell , seemed able to manage Dan , mostly because , like her , he kept nothing in his own mind which could leap to touch something in Dan 's . Mrs. Haskell and Jan had the advantage over John Marston in that they had known fears sooner than he had known them . One more fear , added to those with which their lives had so generously provided them and which they had learned to handle , did not assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly assuming . By not fussing over Dan they did well by him . But with the coming of summer Dan took a strange , dark journey backward into a place which no one of them could reach . Mrs. Haskell saw him slipping back there when a letter from John in late spring announced the date of his coming home . Dan grew moody and rest- less then . He left home after supper , rowing his boat down the small tide river and out beyond the village har- bour toward the open sea , or roaming by himself through the woods . IIe grew sullen about doing his chores , be- came silent or rude at the table . Not all Mrs. Haskell 's matter-of-fact cheerfulness could quiet his father 's anxiety concerning him . " He 's at a bad age , Mr. Perkins , " Mrs. Haskell would say . " I know . I 've had sons . The old tarnation gets ' em around sixteen . ' Tis n't just what you think ' t is . A good part of it 's plain natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own sheet . He 's got to trim his own boat , if you know what I mean . We ca n't do nothin ' but set where we be , with his knowin ' all the time that we be where we 're settin ' . " Before Dan had gone the whole way back into the dark room in his mind , John always begged him to come for a week to Windswept . Jolun thought that once he had him there to himself he could stop Dan 's journey back , start him out on another safer road . But with all his hopes and plans he never quite managed to do it . Things went well at first . " There was the winter to talk about , what each had done , the weather at Windswept , how Jan had made out . There were the old places to revisit , new things to see : the cove , the sea-wall , the pond , the new calves in the barn , Jan 's first sheep , his bees , the diving float he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dan was a prime companion during these days . But once they were over and the last half of the week lowered menacingly before them , it was not so easy . For beyond the week itself stretched other weeks which , John knew , tormented Dan with imaginings of what took place at Windswept when he refused to be present . If he could only once be induced to stay on and to see for himself that nothing at all took place which could hurt him in any way , these specters would lose their shapes , dissolve into healthful nothingness . " I wish you 'd stay on , Dan , for another week longer . Your father says you can as well as not . We 're going to build a skiff to fool around in up the anchorage bay here . You 'd be a great help at that . We thought maybe you 'd do the drawings for her , measure her up decent for us . " " Who 's we ? Julian , I spose. " 162 WINDSWEPT " Well , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine fellow , you 'd like him , and he wants to know you . " Dan looked away with quick suspicion . They were skipping stones across the calm water of the anchorage , Dan curving his long , thin shoulders , his bare right leg bent behind him , his right elbow crooked to make the under baud throw which never failed to skip the stones as John could never skip them . " What 's he want to know me for ? " " Why , because I 've told him lots of things about you . " " What things ? " " Why  --  why just the things you do tell about the friends you like . " " Oh . " " Wo n't you stay on ? Please do , Dan . " " No , I ca n't . I do n't like it here when there 's other folks around . I do n't take to them , and they do n't take to me . So what 's the point ? " " Julian wants you , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can keep it . I do n't want none o ' his gifts . I do n't like him . " " Why not , Dan ? He likes you . " " Do n't tell me that lie . " " It 's not a lie . Why do n't you like Julian ? " " He 's stuck on himself . I do n't like forrard fellows like that . " " That 's not fair , Dan . Really , it is n't . You 're hard on Julian . He 's not a bit stuck up , really . I thought so myself at first , but now I know I was all wrong . Julian 's all right , really . He likes you heaps , and he wants to be friends . " WINDSWEPT 163 " I do n't need no friends . " " That 's foolish . Everyone needs friends . " " I do n't , leastwise not your high-toned kind . I 'll make out by myself . " " Eileen will be sorry , too . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she 's always stickin ' around lately . " " Do n't you like Eileen either ? " " She ai n't so bad , p'raps . But she has n't no use for a country fellow like me . " " Yes , she has . She thinks you 're fine . She said so just last winter . " " D'ye see her in the winter , too , same as iii the sum-mer ? " " Sometimes . When I go to New York , I do , and she said that very thing to me . " " Well , she wo n't think so if I stay on . I ca n't make out when there 's company . I like bein ' with you and Jan . Seems like there 's always high-toned folks hangin ' round . I do n't take to ' em , that 's all . " " I 'm not high-toned . " " No , you ai n't with me . I 'll have to say that for you . But how 'm I to know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to meet these reproaches of Dan 's , especially since he knew that Dan himself was ashamed once he had made them . After the first few days of a visit from Dan , John always felt as though he were skating on thin ice with him , hearing warning cracks , sheering away from danger spots . He was forever trying to avoid a break in the ice , knowing that Dan , even more164 WINDSWEPTthan he , was bound to pay for it inside himself . When the break came and they floundered about together , John tried desperately to get them both back to safety . Afterwards Dan always tried on his part to make up for it in some shy way that cost him as much as the break had done . That was the two-fold trouble , John thought , Dan paying at both ends. " 1 lere 's somethin ' for you . " " What is it , Dan ? " " It 's that old French coin my father found in that wreckage at the cove when I was little . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't . Thanks just as much . " " Why not ? It do n't mean nothin ' to me . " " Yes , it does . You showed it to me when we first came here . " " Well , what of it ?

Have it your own way if you 're so high an ' mighty . Catch me tryin ' to give you somethin ' again ! " ' ' Oh , I did n't mean it that way , Dan . It 's  --  it 's awfully generous of you .

I 'll carry it for good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had acquiredwith the inches he put on year by year . It was the kind of laugh that made one uncomfortable because ofWINDSWEPT 165all the things within it that made it what it was . It had sneers in it , recklessness and scorn , and , if one listened carefully , there was pain behind it . When Dan laughed as he was laughing now , all the old wounds , which one thought were at last healed , opened again . " I 've brought you a heap of good luck , ai n't I now ? " he said. 1 ( iWhen John Marston in later years tried to discover to his own satisfaction the day and the hour when he first fell in love with Eileen Lassiter , he always failed . There had been no such tidy , easily located revelation . Ile finally came to the conclusion that he had been i-1 love with her from the beginning and that , contrary to the way such knowledge usually manifests itself , he had known it all along with no need of that lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been from the start none of that obstruction which disapproval of behaviour often builds between associationand companionship . No one in his senses could have approved of Eileen 's conduct during her early weeks at Windswept . She was stubborn , irritating , given to fits of noisy temper , overbearing , recalcitrant , impertinent . John Marston saw all these things with his eyes , heard them with his ears , was momentarily confused and embarrassed by them in some upper chamber of his mind ; yet five minutes later he was completely untouched by them . He could rescue Mrs. Haskell from some hot argumentin her kitchen , and utterly forget the embarrassingWINDSWEPT 167ognizing in Eileen Lassiter those qualities recognized by others of the household and from outward reproach of her . For when they were together , even at sixteen during that second summer , he was always forgetting those whirlwindsof domestic confusion , those lapses in seemly behaviour , those occasional outbursts of belligerency , which were upsetting all but himself . Once well beyond Mrs. Haskell 's kitchen , he was always surprised to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry tears , now dried on Eileen 's face . Had he remembered , he might have reproved her with good reason and with excellent effect , but he never did . And as the whirlwinds lessened , he might have shared the relief of Jan and Mrs. Haskell and Julian , had he ever been more than outwardly consciousthat relief was welcome and necessary . From the beginning he had always felt completely securewith Eileen , not with that sense of homely , physical security with which Mrs. Haskell provided him , not even with the mental and emotional safety which he felt with Jan , but with a kind of subconscious , almost psychical , security which baffled definition . When , once out of Mrs. Haskell 's range of vision , Eileen bound her skirts and longer petticoats about her waist with the length of tape which she had hidden in her pocket for the purpose , and ran down the long pasture slope , he felt as he ran with her that he was racing not with her but with the wind itself . When she lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among a healthy litter of four others , he felt no impulse to comfort her , because the understanding of her pain was so much bigger than the pain itself that mere comfort would have been extraneous , out-of-place , 166 WINDSWEPToccasion for the rescue when he and Eileen had started to walk to the sea-wall . This miracle of transformation from acute embarrassmentto complete oblivion never failed to surprise him whenever he stopped to think about it as , indeed , he rarely did . For lie was a boy who hated upheavals of all kinds , was troubled by violent arguments at school and later at college , disliked to see anyone at all discomfited or hurt . As he grew older he became almost ashamed at the seeminglack within himself of convictions , of all those points of view and principles which loomed so large in the thoughts and talk of his friends . He could never seem to whip himself into an attitude in which the things which so concerned them , questions of politics , of religion and ethics , the theory of this thinker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as they clearly ought to count . He worried about himself as he was growing up , sometimesfelt positive alarm lest he should fail to take upon himself this burden of men and affairs , which all intelligentmen everywhere were clearly destined to take in an imperfect world . And yet he worried more over the validityof a singular perception , which grew yearly within hint and from which he never managed entirely to free himself : the perception , which was itself a conviction , that all arguments and theories , however frenziedly adheredto , were but fragmentary , unstable realities compared to those unspoken conversations of the mind and spirit which a man could hold only with himself . Perhaps it was this perception , only imperfectly realizedin his early years at Windswept , but even then vaguely tantalizing him , which kept him both from rec-168 WINDSWEPTand unwelcorne .

The fireplace at Windswept must have been built with a mysterious view to Eileen herself , he often thought , even although at the time of its framing she had hardly been known and her presence there not even remotely envisaged . Unlike any other fireplace which he had seen , the hearth had been built a foot and a half below the level of the living-room floor and surrounded on its three sides by a shelf of stone , completing the floor itself . On the great rung at one side which held the fire-irons , Jan had hung the rush mats he had woven from the dried marsh grasses .

From here he could watch Eileen , the waving of her slippered feet , the swaying back and forth of her back as she clasped her brown hands about her knees and rocked herself to and fro , the firelight in shadow on her face . He became fascinated as he watched her , not by her dark gray eyesWINDSWEPT 169below her black brows , not by the usually untidy fair hair , which had a way of escaping from the band of ribbon worn about her head , but by the life which in some odd way burned and blazed within her . Even after long years , when she still waved her slippered feet , although her hair was tidier and her hands less brown , he always thought she was the most alive thing he knew . If one could only catch that life there , he thought , one could know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek no longer . It was doubtless this perception of the life within her which made John Marston at the outset of things obliviousto lesser matters , her untidiness , her quick bursts of fury , her sudden tears of sympathy or of pain . For her prodigal vitality ignited his own lesser measure , quickeninghim both to his surroundings and to himself . Because of this quickening there was from the beginning a spiritualaffinity , which made possible between them those very unspoken conversations usually held only by us with ourselves . His mind spoke with hers ; his desires met hers , unexpressed ; his fears registered not only themselves but her own. 17This last was true particularly in the matter of Dan . From her first uneasy summer at Windswept Eileen had understood Dan . Her swift , arrow-like discernment had pierced through his churlishness and suspicion to the fear and the pain which gave them the semblance of reality . By the same intuition she knew them for what they were , 170 WINDSWEPT WINDSWEPT 171seemings only , and because she could not bear to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan the confidencewhich , in curing the pain , would correct its ungraciousexpression . Impatient by nature , she was never impatient with Dan , and although he was rarely spoken of between her and John Marston , she knew that they worked together with the same understanding and the same purpose . Whenever Dan had weathered a day or two without a sullen withdrawal into himself , she and John shared the same sense of triumph , mingled with the same dread . " Do n't let him slip back , " John Marston could hear her mind saying to his own . " We 've got him this far . Do n't let 's let him go . " Dan 's manner with her was different from that which he assumed when he was with John and Julian or even by himself with John . Once she had overcome his initial diffidence and suspicion , he became co-operative , even friendly . his speech invariably changed in her presence . He clipped his words less , became more careful of his grammar , lapsed less into his coast vernacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this matter of speech was clearly embarrassing to him , yet he rarely failed her . She had a way of deferring to him , of setting his knowledgeand experience above those of John or of Julian . " There 's a bird 's nest over by the sea-wall , Dan . John and Julian think they know what it is , but they do n't any more than I do . You 'll know . " " I wish you 'd take me out in the boat , Dan . I 'm not getting anywhere with my rowing . John and Julian have n't a bit of patience . " " I 've lost that drawing , Dan , that you made of the house . Could n't you make me another ? I want it for my room in New York . " Sometimes in her room at night she evolved situations by means of which Dan might be brought farther along his road toward confidence and assurance , made up conversationsin which she would say this and that and to which Dan might be subtly led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not wholly altruistic in her designs , liking to sec herself as the author of his destiny , yet at the same time genuine in her eager interest and pity . Four years younger than Julian she was years his senior in her skillful avoidance of awkward predicamentsin which Dan was likely to be the loser through Julian 's carelessness or stupidity . Whenever she could manage it , in Dan 's infrequent visits during her first summerat Windswept , she saw to it that Dan and ; Julian were seldom brought together. 18During the third summer at Windswept , when Dan was sixteen , John Marston 's anxiety for him took a new turn . That summer Dan had stayed on after his initial week was up , induced , John well knew , by Eileen 's presencethere rather than by his own . Eileen had prevailed even over the threatened advent of Julian early in July . So long as no others of John 's friends were coming , Dan quite clearly preferred to weather Julian than to be deprived of Eileen . John feared lest another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all too likely to be the price of Eileen 's labours in Dan 's behalf . This slow release of three years ' agony and self-reproach , this building up of confidence and self-respect , would never be content merely with itself . I n place of one pain there was bound to be another . As June gave place to July and the coming of Julian , John saw the pain waiting to make itself known to Dan , disguised now as hope , now as care for Eileen lest she walk too far or row too long or get out too much beyond her depth while they were swimming at the anchorage . I lc saw it in Dan 's new care for his appearance , his better hair-cut , his more careful speech . Dan had grown into a good-looking boy . His freckles had merged into a becomingtan , his red hair , now that it was brushed properly , had an attraction of its own , his blue eyes had lost their sullen heaviness , his mouth now rarely looked contemptuousand scornful . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new road to be able to meet and conquer that new pain waiting for him , all unsuspected , concealed by Eileen 's friendliness and understanding . Whenever the familiar smouldering look came now into i ) an 's eyes , John knew that it sprang , not from the old fear , but from jealousy of him . Dan now could cope with Julian better than with John . This in itself was a new pain , a forerunner of greater suffering . When the others came and Dan had gone home , John would be there with Eileen . John had the winter to his advantage with letters to and from New York , which Dan would never dare to write . John belonged to Eileen 's world as Dan could never belong save in these few intoxicatingWINDSWEPT 173days which frightened him with their new comfort and happiness . John would have talked with Eileen about this new , terrifying aspect of I ) an had he not been sure that she was aware of it as well as he . Moreover , there was after all nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness to Eileen John had to grant that she sought no favours from Dan . She was merely herself , kind and friendly because she was sorry for him , less flattered by his admiration than pleased by her power over hint to be ( once what she had set out to make him become . Not that flattery was entirelyabsent from the picture , John a ( liI it 1 ( 11 . ' I'o persons like Eileen flattery would always be an element in all that she did , even the awkward , fumbling , ill-expressed flatteryof Dan . Mrs. Haskell was not so sparing in her words as John . " I do n't like the way things are blowin ' around here , Miss Eileen . " " What things ? " " Do n't put on that innocent look . You know as well as I do . I do n't like the way you take with Danl . It ai n't good for him . " " What way do I take ? I 'm just kind to him , that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' round when one 's just hein ' kind . He 's gettin ' to set too much store by you and your ways . " " Nonsense , Mrs. Haskell . He just likes me , that 's all . " " That ai n't all . If it was , I would n't be talkin ' . You 'll get him to broodin ' the way he used to do . Broodin 's broodin ' no matter what it 's about . One sort 's bad 's ' tother. " 174 WINDSWEPT " You 're always fussing at me , Mrs. Haskell . Dan 's been lots nicer sin ( c he 's come to see that I think he 's a fine boy . You c ; u n't say he has n't . " " I 'm not tryin ' to say nothin ' . What I 'm sayin ' , I 'm sayin ' . S'pose he has been nicer ? That 's for now . There 's a fur rice cotnin ' . ' That 's what 's pesterin ' me . He 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll set an ' brood . I know . I 've seen hint . Broodin ' ai n't good for Danl . You ai n't his kind , an ' he 'll have to find out that you ai n't . " Eileen was halted in her argument by the simple fact that Mrs. Haskell spoke the truth . She was too quick not to have seen that truth earlier , too kind not to have been vaguely troubled by it . " Well , suppose you 're right . What can I do about it now ? " " You could n't go off home , could you ? " " No , I could n't . The very idea ! That 's  --  that 's fantastic , Mrs. Haskell . " " Maybe ' t is , maybe ' tai n't . But you do n't need to say Dan this an ' Dan that the way you do . You do n't need to keep askin ' him to show you things an ' take you places , or to run round like a wild thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . You mark my words ! " " I 'm just trying to make him see he 's just like the oth- ers . I  --  I 'm sorry for him , really I am , Mrs. Haskell . I would n't do any harm to him for anything . " " I ai n't a-questionin ' your motives nor your meanin ' . You 're a lot nicer girl'n you was last summer , I 'll say that for you . You may turn into somethin ' likely after all . What 's pesterin ' me 's what 's comin ' ? I 'm just warnin ' you to mend your ways . " After her conversation with Mrs. Haskell , Eileen honestlytried to mend her ways , sitting for dull hours in her room on the pretext of letters to write , sewing on a hated traycloth for her mother . But her absence from their doingsonly brought a new suspicion into Dan 's mind to torture him in place of the old from which he had suffered . " Why did n't you conic sailin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were sitting by the fireplace the evening before Julian 's arrival . Jan had called John to help him with one of the cows who was sick , and Eileen and Dan were by themselves . " I could n't , really , Dan . I  --  I was n't feeling awfully well . " " That 's just an excuse . Do n't tell mne . You elidn t want to come . " " Yes , I did , really . " " Why did n't you then ? " " I told you . I did n't feel well . " " Well , you ate your dinner all right an ' your supper , too , an ' you helped John bring the cows in . That do n't look like bein ' sick to me . " He rose from his seat by the fire and began fumbling with the pieces of a puzzle spread out on the table . Eileen , embarrassed as she watched him , saw that his big , awkwardhands were trembling . She thought of ways of escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You need n't lie to me . John took me out in the boat so I need n't be in your way . Besides he do n't like me bein ' along of you . " " Oh , Dan , what nonsense ! Do n't be so silly ! " " I 'm not silly . I ' 1n not blind either . I have n't been so welcome round here the last few days . What have I done to make you so stand-offish all of a sudden ? " " Dan , please . Do n't spoil things like that . " " It 's you that 's spoilin ' ' em , not me . Why do n't you tell me what I 've clone ? " " You have n't done a thing , of course . It 's just that I 've had things to do inside . " " Seems queer you have n't had ' em to do before . Seems queer you got so offish all of a sudden . " He sat down again by the fireplace , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stone shelf with his hands . Eileen had the horrible thought that he was striving to keep from crying . Not knowing what to do , she rose from her seat and put her hand upon his shoulder . He drew away from her abruptly . " You do n't need to be so nice all of a sudden , " he said , his voice breaking in spite of him . " I can get along without any of your pretendin ' . It 's John you like better'n me . He 's got better ways than I got . I 'm not high-toned like you an ' him . Why do n't you say you 're sick o ' me an ' my hang in ' round ? You do n't have to worry none about me . I can get along without any o ' you . I 'll be clearin ' out soon , I will . " It was John who mercifully put an end to this conversation . IIe came through the door just as Eileen was at the end of her resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Dan 's face as he made room for John by the fire . " Clover 's not going to calve tonight after all , I guess , " John said . " Jan thinks now she 'll go till tomorrow . He ' : putting her back in the field . " He stopped suddenly , looking from one to the other The expression on Dan 's face , which he had not noticed on entering , had changed to one of acute embarrassment and disapproval . John all at once realized that he had forsakenpropriety for excitcmcnt . After all , one did not speak of such things in the presen e of girls . His sense of companionship with Eileen , so conscious that it was unconscious , had for the moment banished from his mind the realization that she was a girl and , therefore , unaccustomed to frankness on such matters . 1 ie grew embarrassed in his turn and felt relieved when 1 ) an took his disapprovalout-of-doors . He felt more relieved that Eileen showed no confusion whatever . As a matter ol fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about. lgJan would have been more aware of the suffering lying in wait for Dan had he not , during that summer of 1883 , had matters of his own to cause him pain . In May after his long , quiet winter at Windswept he had received a letter from Anna Karel . He had left his new potato field early one afternoon to drive into the village to post a letter to John . He had been feeling particularly good as he drove over his road , noting how the gravel he had spread upon it had absorbed the spring mud , seeing the frail white blossoms of the wild pear foaming among the dark firs and spruces , feeling the warmth of the sun upon his neck , 178 WINDSWEPTlistening to the song-sparrows and the hermit thrushes . " This morning , " he had written to John , " I swept January and February clean out of the house . " It sounded good , he thought , as he drove along , looked good on the white page in its black letters . There were ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would smile at the way he had said that . It would stay in John 's mind much longer than if he had merely said , " I swept the house this morning . " Ile was surprised when the postmaster handed him a letter . This day was Thursday . There would be no letter coin John . John 's fortnightly letters always came on Tuesdays , written on Sundays when there were no games or studying allowed and when , therefore , John had less to do . Julian never wrote letters , nor , to Jan 's sorrow , did Anton . This letter was in a crumpled envelope , addressed in an awkward , unfamiliar writing , which sprawled unevenlyacross the square bit of dirty paper . It looked , Jan thought , as he stood there fingering it , as though it had been carried about in someone 's hands for a long tune before it had been posted . When he had opened and read Anna Karel 's letter , Jan stood for so long in the corner of the post-office that the postmaster asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " said Jan then , coming to himself . " No , thank you . " Then he got into his wagon and drove home with the letter in his pocket . Every now and then as he drove along , he reached his hand into his pocket to be sure the letter was there , that he had not dreamed it all . The letterWINDSWEPT 179was always still there . He did not read it again until he had driven his cows in from the pasture , milked them , cared for his oxen and horses , set his barn to rights . He would have his supper later , he thought , when he had once got things straight in his mind . Making sure once more that the letter was actually there in his pocket , he walked in the spring twilight up the pasture slope to the house . He would feel less lonely there , he thought . Perhaps he would even open the big front door facing the sea . With the door open he might be able to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to him . Perhaps he might even hear Mrs. Haskell bustling about in the kitchen . But the loneliness increased once he had opened the door and sat down upon the step . In all his confusion and grief he was surprised . He was never lonely . Ile had not been lonely since that night nearly two years before when he had sat among his belongings in the railroad station , waiting for the midnight train . When he turned and looked into the house , the loneliness increased again . Now it was a leaden weight within him . There was a ball of red wool on the table near the fireplace , left over from the scarf Eileen had knit for him the summer before . He had scolded her , he remembered , for running in his first standing crop of new , good hay , and she had knit the scarf for him as a proof of penitence . He had found the red ball in a corner of the room that morning when he had swept out January and February . Since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls of wool always belonged , he closed the door again and sat looking out upon the sea.
