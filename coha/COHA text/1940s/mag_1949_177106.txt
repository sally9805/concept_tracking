INISHFALLEN , FARE THEE WELL ( 396 pp. ) - Sean O'Casey-Macmillan ( $4.75 ) . <P> " A slum dramatist , a guttersnipe who could jingle a few words together . " That was how Playwright Sean O'Casey ( The Plough and the Stars , Juno and the Paycock ) summarized what much of the Irish press said of him and his works . Absolutely correct , agrees O'Casey-and proud of it . He promises to spend his whole life wearing " the tattered badge of his proletarian tribe . . . soiled with the diseased sweat of the tenements . " <P> Inishfallen , Fare Thee Well , the fourth volume of his third-person autobiography , * is essentially an arrangement of O'Casey 's counter-compliments to the Irish reviewers , clerics and laymen who refused to take him on those terms . <P> Of Black &; Tans . The free-for-alls of O'Casey 's Volume IV are set in the years when Eire was finally obtaining her independence . Black &; Tans roar through Dublin in armored cars , Irish rebels fight them off shoulder to shoulder-and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air is full of flying shillelaghs , ecclesiastical croziers , broken staves of office , and splintering scepters . But olive branches are missing from the scene and O'Casey , parodying Yeats , chants sarcastically : <P> A terrible beauty is borneo . . . <P> In the dawn of a wonderful morneo . <P> Through all the hullabaloo moves O'Casey himself , an ex-laborer who burns with a hot , proletarian fire . He is poor as a church mouse and still , at 35 , such " innocent gaum " ( dumbbell ) that when he gets a check for one of his first plays he does n't know how to go about cashing it . But he is sustained by wonderful dreams and illusions in which he sees Ireland peopled by " golden boys " who wander through lanes " canopied by the sly innocence of the woodbine 's dangling stems , " while adoring lasses stroke " the faded , maybe bloodstained , cloth " of heir uniforms with " shy , white fingers . " He dreams of poets who move through life like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spite and pettiness . <P> The innocent gaum O'Casey woke up with a bump to find that most people were clay after all . When his proletarian plays were staged by Dublin 's Abbey Theater , many critics hissed maliciously and poets looked nervously the other way . Even pioneers , O'Casey discovered , fear public opinion ; even democrats get a kick out of wearing striped pants and top hats ; even noble esthetes enjoy walking with one foot in the gutter . Sean was shocked to find that stately , plump Oliver St. John Gogarty surreptitiously read whodunits ; that refined Lady Gregory reveled in Peg o ' My Heart ; that the great Yeats himself ( an admirer of Zane Grey ) was prepared to acclaim O'Casey as " the Irish Dostoevsky " - though O'Casey says he happened to know that Yeats had barely looked into Dostoevsky . Appalled by such duplicity and filled with hatred of the new Eire 's clerical atmosphere , O'Casey packed up and went to England , where his pure heart is still parked .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
