" You are a horridly ill-mannered , thoroughly selfish , slothfully inclined person . . . smugly superior and insufferably condescending . . . . By your own account you come near . . . being a rotter . " <P> A woman had rashly written a letter to the Washington Post 's corrosive " Mary Haworth " ( real name : Elizabeth Young ) , complaining about having to wash her baby 's diapers . That was how Columnist Haworth let her have it . Post readers ate it up . <P> Disillusioned , Eh ? When a woman wrote a letter telling how she had roped a husband by cajolery and bold pursuit , and now found herself " disillusioned " and " unhappy , " Mary Haworth sizzled : " All things considered , it is quite amazing that your husband has stayed with you this long . " <P> A wife who asked how to get her husband " more interested in other women , so I will feel free to have men friends " was told : " Get yourself a psychiatrist right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote that his daughter was dating and embracing other men while her husband was over seas , Mary Haworth said : " Your daughter 's performance , I 'm sorry to say , is that of a girl who is going to the dogs-at high speed . " <P> A Navy wife wrote : " My husband . . . wants a child . I do not . ... I do n't want to drag around alone during those miserable nine months . . . . Am I just a selfish female ? " Mary called the writer " harebrained , " said : " My immediate reaction . . . is a blend of nausea and dismay . " <P> Last week a woman asked Columnist Haworth for advice on how to keep her errant husband home . Among other things , she was told : " Your husband 's encroaching predilection for ganging up with a stag party to loaf his nights away in cocktail lounges , buying drinks for bevies of uniformed women ... is spendthrift carousing . " <P> Stinkers Are Stinkers . Slender , well-tailored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doling out reprimands , advice and praise to the Post 's sentimental readers for more than nine years . Mostly because she is not averse to calling a stinker a stinker , her " Mary Haworth 's Mail " is one of the most widely read columns in the Washington area . Lord Lothian , late British ambassador to the U.S. , once told Post Publisher Eugene Meyer that after the front-page news and the editorials he always turned to Mary Haworth . <P> Mary Haworth has savvy , writes wrathfully and well ; her column answers serious questions ( not all about sex problems ) painstakingly , often falling back on dictionary definitions of misused words : " love " - " tender and passionate affection . " <P> Screens for Secrecy . Columnist Haworth , now in her 30s , reported for the Wilmington News-Journal in her native Ohio , then solicited ads for the Ohio State-Journal at Columbus . In 1930 she quit , married , went to Washington to live . She joined the Post in 1933 , when her second child was still a baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She later got a divorce ( in her column she calls divorce " social surgery " and " a desperate remedy for . . . sick relationship " ) .
