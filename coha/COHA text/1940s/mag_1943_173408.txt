The four-minute mile is possible . So reported Dr. Alfred W. Francis , research chemist and amateur trackman , in Science . Using a plot of average speed in meters per second against the logarithm of the distance , he drew a graph of 17 record marks , from 200 meters to 10 miles . The point for one mile was well below Arne Andersson 's present record : 4:02.6 . Dr. Francis , whose own record for the mile is 4:38 , figures it can be run in 3:58.7.
