At Christmastime 1939 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Pius XII : " . . . It would give me great satisfaction to send to you my personal representative in order that our parallel endeavors for peace and the alleviation of suffering may be assisted .

Maclean : " We were assured that Mr. Taylor 's service as ambassador to the Pope might terminate at an early date , but would certainly terminate with the signing of the peace treaties .
