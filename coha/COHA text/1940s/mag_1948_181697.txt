A pair of oldtime baseballers , headliners of another day , stepped back into harness last week . <P> In Phoenix , Ariz. , 54-year-old Walter ( " Dutch " ) Reuther , great southpaw pitcher of the 1920s , marched out to the mound . His assignment : to make a pitcher out of the New York Giants ' young Clint Hartung , who could put plenty of speed on a ball but not a wrinkle of a curve . Just a year ago in spring training , Hartung ( then an outfielder ) was hailed as the most promising rookie of the year ; but when it became apparent early in the season that he could n't catch a fly-ball , Hartung was converted into a pitcher . He was n't very good at that either , winning only nine games for the Giants . Teacher Reuther , who used to befuddle batters with three or four different kinds of curves , hoped to show Clint Hartung a trick or two . <P> In Vero Beach , Fla. , veteran George Sisler , 54 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture a new first-baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers . He had a talented and versatile athlete to work on : hard-hitting , fleet-footed Pistol Pete Reiser . After two weeks of private lessons , Teacher Sisler expects to have Outfielder Reiser ( who seemed to be forever crashing into the concrete outfield wall at Ebbets Field ) ready to replace Jackie Robinson at first base for the Dodgers . <P> Jackie Robinson , who arrived at the Dodgers ' training camp at Ciudad Trujillo three days late and 15 lbs . overweight , will probably be switched to his old job at second base , now that Ed ( " Walking Man " ) Stanky has been traded to the Braves .
