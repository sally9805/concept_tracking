German newspapers barked last week that the Russians saddled dogs with dynamite and sicked them on German tanks . The Germans growled that they found 27,000 demolition-trained dogs in kennels near Pavlograd ; altogether the Russians were supposed to have trained 100,000 dogs by burdening them with sandbags and teaching them to run in front of tanks . " But not a single Panzer was destroyed by the dogs , " yipped the Germans . <P> &gt; The Russians did use dogs to good advantage in World War I. Espionage Officer Captain Andreas Peeka thought up the idea , which is described in H. R. Berndorff 's Espionage : <P> " Before his departure from enemy territory the spy was to acquire a dog . . . . The spy was provided with very thin paper and a small aluminum tube . The paper he covered with sketches and statistics ; he rolled it up and slipped it into the tube , and the tube was inserted in the dog 's rectum . . . . The trick was detected only through a grotesque accident . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the road with his dog . The dog ran to the edge of the ditch , whining piteously , and apparently anxious to relieve itself . The peddler , however , would not let him stop , but dragged him along by his leash . The sentry , who was a great lover of animals , felt angry ; he ordered the peddler to let the dog do what it wanted . The poor animal , which was evidently in difficulties , finally got rid of a silvery metal tube . Since the sentry had never heard that dogs were accustomed to excrete such articles , he was struck with amazement . "
