too in passing and in the lavatory emptied the grounds and rinsed the pot and cup and filled the kettle and set it and the pot the cup and saucer back on the shelf and returned to the chair and sat down again after really no absence at all , still in plenty of time to watch the table and all its familiar untidy clutter all fading toward one anonymity of night as the sunlight died : thinking rememberinghow his uncle had said that all man had was time , all that stood between him and the death he feared and abhorred was time yet he spent half of it inventing ways of getting the other half past : and suddenly he remembered from nowhere what it was that had been naggingat his attention : Edmonds was not at home nor even in Mississippi ; he was in a hospital in New Orleans being operated on for gallstones , the heavy chair making a rumbling clatter on the wooden floor almost as loud as a wagon on a wooden bridge as the rose and then stood beside the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of his breathing : because he was free : and then he moved : because his mother would know what time baseball games finished even if she could n't have heard the yelling from across the edge of town and she would know that even he could use up only so much of twilight getting home , locking the door behind him then down the stairs again , the Square filled with dusk now and the first lights coming on in the drugstore ( they had never been off in the barbershop and the poolhall since the bootblack and the porter unlocked the doors and swept out the hair and cigarette stubs at six oclock this morning ) and the mercantile ones too so that the rest of the county except Beat Four would have somewhere to wait until word could come in from Fraser 's store that all was okeydoke again and they could unparkp31the trucks and cars and wagons and mules from the back streets and alleys and go home and go to bed : turning the corner this time and now the jail , looming , lightless except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ordinary nights the nigger crapshooters and whiskey-peddlers and razor-throwers would be yellingdown to their girls and women on the street below and where Lucas would have been these three hours now ( very likely banging on the steel door for somebody to bring him his supper or perhaps having already had it and now merely to complain about its quality since without doubt he would consider that his right too along with the rest of his lodging and keep ) except that people seemed to hold that the one sole end of the entire establishmentof public office was to elect one man like Sheriff f lampton big enough or at least with sense and character enough to run the county and then fill the rest of the jobs with cousins and inlaws who had failed to make a living at everything else they ever tried .

'  |p32'Yes  , ' he said . ' They 're going to make a nigger out of him once in his life anyway . ' ' Charles ! ' his mother said .  --  eating rapidly , eating quite a lot and talking rapidly and quite a lot too about the ballgame and waiting to get hungry any minute any second now until suddenly he knew that even the last bite had been too much , still chewing at it to get it down to where it would swallow , already getting up .

I do nt want  --  ' and then at last one wail one cry to the supreme : his father himself : out of that nightraddled dragonregion of fears and terrors in which women  --  mothers anyway  --  seemed from choice almost to dwell : ' Charlie  --  ' until his uncle put his napkin down and rose too and said : ' Then here 's your chance to wean him . I want him to do an errand for me anyway : ' and out : on the front galleryin the dark cool and after a while his uncle said : ' Well ? Go on . ' ' Ai nt you coming ? ' he said .

That 's all he 's going to need . ' They 'll lend him a shovel out there . ' Yes  --  if there 's anything to bury . They have gasoline even in Beat Four . ' ' I thought old Skipworth was going to take care of that . ' Sure . But that 's Beat Four . They 'll do what Skipworth tells them as long as he 's got the nigger . But he 's going to turn him over to Hampton . That 's when it 'll happen . Hope Hampton might be sheriff in Yoknapatawpha County but he 's just another man in Beat Four . ' No .

Hope Hampton 's going to be a hard man to take a prisoner away from too . ' A nigger murderer ? Who in this county or state either is going to help him protect a nigger that shoots white men in the back ? ' Or the South either . ' ' Yes . Or the South either . ' He had heard it all before : outside again now : only his uncle might decide to come to town before time to go for the noon mail at the postofficeand if his uncle did n't see him then he really could tell his mother he did n't know where he was and of course he thought first of the empty office but if he wentp41there that 's exactly where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had forgot to give Highboy the extra feed this morning too but it was too late now and besides he was going to carry feed with him anyway  --  he knew exactly what he was going to do : the sheriff had left town about nine oclock ; the constable'shouse was fifteen miles away on a gravel road not too good but the sheriff should certainly go there and be back with Lucas by noon even if he stopped to make a few votes while there ; long before that time he would go home and saddle Highboy and tie a sack of feed behind the saddle and turn him in a straight line in the opposite direction from eraser 's store and ride in that one undeviable direction for twelve hours which would be about midnight tonight and feed Highboy and rest him until daylight or even longer if he decided to and then ride the twelve hours back which would be eighteenactually or maybe even twenty-four or even thirtysixbut at least all over finished done , no more fury and outrage to have to lie in bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned the corner and went along the opposite side of the street and under the shed in front of the closed blacksmith shop , the heavy double wooden doors not locked with a hasp or latch but with a padlocked chain passed through an augerhole in each one so that the slack of the chain created an insag almost like an alcove ; standing in it nobody could have seen him from either up the street or down it nor even passing along it ( which would not be his mother anyway today ) unless they stopped to look and now the bells began ringing in mellow unhurried discordant strophe and antistrophe from steeple to pigeonswirled steeple across the town , streets and Square one sudden decorous flow of men in their dark suits and women in silks and parasols and girls and young men two and two , flowing and decorous beneath that mellow uproar into that musical clamor : gone , Square and street empty again though still the bells rang on for a while yet , skydwellers , groundless denizens of the topless air too high too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasteless stroke from the subterrene shudder of organs and the cool frantic monotone of the settled pigeons . Two years ago his uncle had told him that there was nothing wrong with cursing ; on the contrary it was not only useful but substituteless but like everything else valuable it was precious only because the supply was limited and if you wasted it on nothing on its urgent need you might find yourself bankrupt so he said What the hell am I doing here then answered himself the obviousanswer : not to see Lucas , he had seen Lucas but so that Lucas could see him again if he so wished , to look back at him not just from the edge of mere uniquelessdeath but from the gasoline-roar of apotheosis . Becausehe was free . Lucas was no longer his responsibility , he was no longer Lucas ' keeper ; Lucas himself had dischargedhim . Then suddenly the empty street was full of men . Yet there were not many of them , not two dozen , some suddenlyand quietly from nowhere . Yet they seemed to fill it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody could pass them , pass through it , use it as a street but that nobody would dare , would even approachnear enough to essay the gambit as people stay well away from a sign saying High Voltage or Explosive . He knew , recognised them all ; some of them he had even seen and listened to in the barbershop twop43hours ago  --  the young men or men under forty , bachelors , the homeless who had the Saturday and Sunday baths in the barbershop  --  truckdrivers and garagehands , the oiler from the cotton gin , a sodajerker from the drugstoreand the ones who could be seen all week long in or around the poolhall who did nothing at all that anyoneknew , who owned automobiles and spent money nobody really knew exactly how they earned on weekendsin Memphis or New Orleans brothels  --  the men who his uncle said were in every little Southern town , who never really led mobs nor even instigated them but were always the nucleus of them because of their mass availability . Then he saw the car ; he recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter stopping to wonder how , himself moving out of his concealingdoorway into the street and then across it to the edge of the crowd which made no sound but just stood there blocking the sidewalk beside the jail fence and overflowing into the street while the car came up not fast but quite deliberately , almost decorously as a car should move on Sunday morning , and drew in to the curb in front of the jail and stopped . A deputy was driving it . He made no move to get out . Then the rear door opened and the sheriff emerged  --  a big , a tremendous man with no fat and little hard pale eyes in a cold almost bland pleasant face who without even glancing at them turned and held the door open . Then Lucas got out , slowly and stiffly , exactly like a man who has spent the night chained to a bedpost , fumbling a little and bumping or at least raking his head against the top of the door so that as he emerged his crushed hat tumbled from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the first time he had ever seen Lucas without the hat on and in the same second he realised that with the possible exception of Edmonds they there in the street watching him were probably the only white people in the county who had ever seen him uncovered : watching as , still bent over as he had emerged from the car , Lucas began to reach stiffly for the hat . But already in one vast yet astonishingly supple stoop the sheriff had picked it up and handed it back to Lucas who still bent over seemed to fumble at the hat too . Yet almost at once the hat was creased back into its old shape and now Lucas was standing up , erect except for his head , his face as he brushed the hat back and forth against the sleeve of his forearm rapid and light and deft as you stroke a razor . Then his head , his face went back and up too and in a motion not quite sweeping he set the hat back on his head at the old angle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung it up , and erect now in the black suit crumpled too from whatever night he had spent ( there was a long grimed smear down one entire side from shoulder to ankle as if he had been lying on an unswept floor a long time in one position without being able to change it ) Lucas looked at them for the first time and he thought Now . He will see me now and then he thought He saw me . And that 's all and then he thought He has n't seen anybody because the face was not even looking at them but just toward them , arrogant and calm and with no more defiance in it than fear : detached , impersonal , almost musing , intractable and composed , the eyes blinking a little in the sunlight even after the sound , an indraw of breath went up from somewhere in the crowd and a single voice said : Knock it off again , Hope . Take his head too this time . '  |p45You  boys get out of here , ' the sheriff said . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas : All right . Come on . ' And that was all , the face for another moment looking not at them but just toward them , the sheriff already walking toward the jail door when Lucas turned at last to follow him and by hurrying a little he could even get Highboy saddled and be out of the lot before his mother began to send Aleck Sander to look for him to come and eat dinner . Then he saw Lucas stop and turn and he was wrong because Lucas even knew where he was in the crowd before he turned , looking straight at him before he got turned around even , speaking to him : You , young man , ' Lucas said . Tell your uncle I wants to see him : ' then turned again and walked on after the sheriff , still a little stiffly in the smeared black suit , the hat arrogant and pale in the sunlight , the voice in the crowd saying : Lawyer hell . He wont even need an undertaker when them Gowries get through with him tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped now and was looking back at them , saying in his mild cold bland heatless voice : I told you folks once to get out of here . I ai nt going to tell you again . '  |p46So  IF HE HAD GONE straight home from the barbershop this morning and saddled Highboy when he first thought of it he would be ten hours away by now , probably fifty miles . There were no bells now . What people on the street now would have been going to the less formal more intimate evening prayer-meeting , walking decorously across the shadow-bitten darkness from streetlamp to streetlamp ; so in keeping with the Sabbath 's still suspensionthat he and his uncle would have been passing them steadily , recognising them yards ahead without knowingor even pausing to speculate on when or how or why they had done so  --  not by silhouette nor even the voice needed : the presence , the aura perhaps ; perhaps merely the juxtaposition : this living entity at this point at this moment on this day , as is all you need to recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life  --  stepping off the concrete onto the bordering grass to pass them , speaking ( his uncle ) to them by name , perhapsexchanging a phrase , a sentence then on , onto the concrete again . But tonight the street was empty . The very houses themselves looked close and watchful and tense as though the people who lived in them , who on this soft May night ( those who had not gone to church ) would havep47been sitting on the dark galleries for a little while after supper in rocking chairs or porchswings , talking quietly among themselves or perhaps talking from gallery to gallery when the houses were close enough . But tonight they passed only one man and he was not walking but standing just inside the front gate to a small neat shoeboxof a house built last year between two other houses already close enough together to hear one another 's toilets flush ( his uncle had explained that : ' When you were born and raised and lived all your life where you cant hear anything but owls at night and roosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearestneighbor chopping wood two miles away , you like to live where you can hear and smell people on either side of you every time they flush a drain or open a can of salmon or of soup . ' ) , himself darker than shadow and certainly stiller  --  a countryman who had moved to town a year ago and now owned a small shabby side street grocery whose customers were mostly Negroes , whom they had not even seen until they were almost on him though he had already recognised them or at least his uncle some distance away and was waiting for them , alreadyspeaking to his uncle before they came abreast of him : ' Little early , ai nt you , Lawyer ? Them Beat Four folks have got to milk and then chop wood to cook breakfast tomorrow with before they can eat supper and get in to town . ' ' Maybe they 'll decide to stay at home on a Sunday night , ' his uncle said pleasantly , passing on : whereupon the man said almost exactly what the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying once how little of vocabulary man really needed to get comfortably and even efficiently through his life , how not only in the individual but within his whole type and race and kind a few simple cliches served his few simple passions and needs and lusts ) : Sho now . It ai nt their fault it 's Sunday . That sonofabitchought to thought of that before he taken to killing white men on a Saturday afternoon . ' Then he called after them as they went on , raising his voice : ' My wife ai nt feeling good tonight , and besides I do nt want to stand around up there just looking at the front of that jail . But tell um to holler if they need help . ' ' I expect they know already they can depend on you , Mr Lilley , ' his uncle said . They went on . You see ? ' his uncle said . He has nothing against what he calls niggers . If you ask him , he will probably tell you he likes them even better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are probably constantly beating him out of a few cents here and there in his store and probably even picking up things  --  packages of chewing gum or bluing or a banana or a can of sardines or a pair of shoelacesor a bottle of hair-straightener  --  under their coats and aprons and he knows it ; he probably even gives them things free of charge  --  the bones and spoiled meat out of his butcher 's icebox and spoiled candy and lard. , All herequires is that they act like niggers . Which is exactly what Lucas is doing : blew his top and murdered a white man  --  which Mr Lilley is probably convinced all Negroeswant to do  --  and naw the white people will take him out and burn him , all regular and in order and themselves acting exactly as he is convinced Lucas would wish them to act : like white folks ; both of them observingimplicitly the rules : . the nigger acting like a niggerand the white folks acting like white folks and no realp49hard feelings on either side ( since Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ; in fact Mr Lilley would probably be one of the first to contribute cash money toward Lucas ' funeral and the support of his widow and children if he had them . Which proves again how nu man can cause more grief than that one clinging blindly to the vices of his ancestors . ' Now they could see the Square , empty too  --  the amphitheatriclightless stores , the slender white pencil of the Confederate monument against the mass of the courthouselooming in columned upsoar to the dim quadruple face of the clock lighted each by a single faint bulb with a quality as intransigeant against those four fixed mechanicalshouts of adjuration and warning as the glow of a firefly . Then the jail and at that moment , with a flash and glare and wheel of lights and a roar of engine at once puny against the vast night and the empty town yet insolent too , a car rushed from nowhere and circled the Square ; a voice , a young man 's voice squalled from it  --  no words , not even a shout : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on around the Square , completing the circle back to nowhere and died away . They turned in at the jail . It was of brick , square , proportioned , with four brick columns in shallow basrelief across the front and even a brick cornice under the eaves because it was old , built in a time when people took time to build even jails with grace and care and he remembered how his uncle had said once that not courthouses nor even churches but jails were the true records of a county 's , a community 's history , since not only the cryptic forgotten initials and words and even phrases cries of defiance and indictment scratched into the walls but the very bricks and stones themselves held , not in solution but in suspension , intact and biding and potent and indestructible , the agonies and shames and griefs with which hearts long since unmarkedand unremembered dust had strained and perhapsburst . Which was certainly true of this one because it and one of the churches were the oldest buildings in the town , the courthouse and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubble by Federal occupationforces after a battle in 1864 . Because scratched into one of the panes of the fanlight beside the door was a young girl 's single name , written by her own hand into the glass with a diamond in that same year and sometimestwo or three times a year he would go up onto the gallery to look at it , it cryptic now in reverse , not for a sense of the past but to realise again the eternality , the deathlessness and changelessness of youth  --  the name of one of the daughters of the jailer of that time ( and his uncle who had for everything an explanation not in facts but long since beyond dry statistics into something far more moving because it was truth : which moved the heart and had nothing whatever to do with what mere provable information said , had told him this too : how this part of Mississippi was new then , as a town a settlementa community less than fifty years old , and all the men who had come into it less long ago almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure it , doing the base jobs along with the splendid ones not for pay or politics but to shape a land for their posterity , so that a man could be the jailer then or the innkeeper or farrier or vegetable peddler yet still be what the lawyer and planter and doctor and parson called a gentleman ) who stood at that window that afternoon and watched the battered remnant of a Confederate brigade retreatp51through the town , meeting suddenly across that space the eyes of the ragged unshaven lieutenant who led one of the broken companies , scratching into the glass not his name also , not only because a young girl of that time would never have done that but because she did n't know his name then , let alone that six months later he would be her husband . In fact it still looked like a residence with its balustradedwooden gallery stretching across the front of the lower floor . But above that the brick wall was windowless except for the single tall crossbarred rectangle and he thought again of the Sunday nights which seemed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from suppertimeuntil the jailer turned the lights out and yelled up the stairs for them to shut up , the dark limber hands would lie in the grimed interstices while the mellow untroubled repentless voices would shout down to the women in the aprons of cooks or nurses and the girls in their flash cheap clothes from the mail order houses or the other young men who had not been caught yet or had been caught and freed yesterday , gathered along the street . But not tonight and even the room behind it was dark though it was not yet eight oclock and he could see , imagine them not huddled perhaps but certainly all together , within elbow 's touch whether they were actuallytouching or not and certainly quiet , not laughing tonight nor talking either , sitting in the dark and watching the top of the stairs because this would not be the first time when to mobs of white men not only all black cats were gray but they did n't always bother to count them either . And the front door was open , standing wide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer although the ground floor was the jailer 's living quarters , and tilted in a chair against the back wall so that he faced the door in full sight of the street , was a man who was not the jailer nor even one of the sheriff 's deputies either . Because he had recognised him too : Will Legate , who lived on a small farm two miles from town and was one of the best woodsmen , the finest shot and the best deer-hunter in the county , sitting in the tilted chair holding the colored comic section of today 's Memphis paper , with leaning against the wall beside him not the hand-worn rifle with which he had killed more deer ( and even running rabbits with it ) than even he remembered but a double barrelled shotgun , who apparently without even lowering or moving the paper had already seen and recognised them even before they turned in at the gate and was now watching them steadily as they came up the walk and mounted the steps and crossed the gallery and entered : at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  a snuffy untidy potbellied man with a harried concerned outraged face , wearing a heavy pistol holstered onto a cartridge belt around his waist which looked as uncomfortable and out of place as a silk hat or a fifth-century iron slavecollar , who shut the door behind him , already crying at his uncle : ' He wont even shut and lock the front door ! Just settingthere with that durn funny paper waiting for anybodythat wants to to walk right in ! ' ' I 'm doing what Mr Hampton told me to , ' Legate said in his pleasant equable voice . Does Hampton think that funny paper 's going to stop them folks from Beat Four ? ' the jailer cried . I do n't think he 's worrying about Beat Four yet , '  |p53Legate  said still pleasantly and equably . This here 's just for local consumption now . ' His uncle glanced at Legate . It seems to have worked . We saw the car  --  or one of them  --  make one trip around the Square as we came up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once or twice , ' Legate said . Maybe three times . I really ai nt paid much mind . ' And I hope to hell it keeps on working , ' the jailer said . Because you sure ai nt going to stop anybody with just that one britch-loader . ' Sure , ' Legate said . I do n't expect to stop them . If enough folks get their minds made up and keep them made up , ai nt anything likely to stop them from what they think they want to do . But then , I got you and that pistol to help me . ' ' Me ? ' the jailer cried . ' Me get in the way of them Gowries and Ingrums for seventy-five dollars a month ? just for one nigger ? And if you ai nt a fool , you wont neither . ' ' Oh I got to , ' Legate said in his easy pleasant voice . I got to resist . Mr Hampton 's paying me five dollars for it . ' Then to his uncle : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ' his uncle said . If it 's all right with Mr Tubbs . ' The jailer stared at his uncle , irate and harried . So you got to get mixed up in it too . You ca n't let well enough alone neither . ' He turned abruptly . Come on : ' and led the way through the door beside which Legate 's ( hair was tilted , into the back hall where the stairway rose to the upper floor , snapping on the light switch at the foot of the stairs and began to mount them , his uncle then he following while he watched the hunch and sag of the holster at the jailer 's hip . Suddenly thep54jailer seemed about to stop ; even his uncle thought so , stopping too but the jailer went on , speaking over his shoulder : Do nt mind me . I 'm going to do the best I can ; I taken an oath of office too . ' His voice rose a little , still calm , just louder : But do nt think nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a wife and two children ; what good am I going to be to them if I get myself killed protecting a goddamn stinking nigger ? ' His voice rose again ; it was not calm now : And how am I going to live with myself if I let a passel of nogood sonabitches take a prisoner away from me ? ' Now he stopped and turned on the step above them , higher than both , his face once more harried and frantic , his voice frantic and outraged : Better for everybody if them folks had took him as soon as they laid hands on him yesterday But they did n't , ' his uncle said . I do nt think they will . And if they do , it wont really matter . They either will or they wont and if they do nt it will be all right and if they do we will do the best we can , you and Mr Ramptonand Legate and the rest of us , what we have to do , what we can do . So we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ' the jailer said . Then he turned and went on , unsnapping his keyring from his belt under the pistol belt , to the heavy oak door which closed off the top of the stairs ( It was one solid handhewn piece over two inches thick , locked with a heavy modern padlock in a handwrought iron bar through two iron slots which like the heavy risette-shaped hinges were handwrought too , hammered out over a hundred years ago in the blacksmith shop across the street where he had stood yesterday ; one day last summer a stranger , a city man , an architect who reminded him somehow of his uncle , hat/less and tieless , in tennis shoes and a pair of worn flannel trousers and what was left of a case of champagne in a convertible-top car which must have cost three thousand dollars , driving not through town but into it , not hurtinganyone but just driving the car up onto the pavement and across it through a plate glass window , quite drunk , quite cheerful , with less than fifty cents in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a check folder whose stubs showed a balance in a New York bank of over six thousand dollars , who insisted on being put in jail even though the marshal and the owner of the window both were just trying to persuade him to go to the hotel and sleep it off so he could write a check for the window and the wall : until the marshal finally put him in jail where he went to sleep at once like a baby and the garage sent for the car and the next morning the jailer telephoned the marshal at five oclock to come and get the man out because he had waked the whole householdup talking from his cell across to the niggers in the bullpen . So the marshal came and made him leave and then he wanted to go out with the street gang to work and they would n't let him do that and his car was ready too but he still would n't leave , at the hotel that night and two nights later his uncle even brought him to supper , where he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna and he and his mother listening too though his father had excused himself : and still there two days after that , still trying from his uncle and the mayor and the board of aldermen and at last the board of supervisors themselves to buy the whole door or if they would n't sell that , at least the bar and slots and the hinges. ) and unlocked it and swung it back . But already they had passed out of the world of man ,  |p56men  : people who worked and had homes and raised families and tried to make a little more money than they perhaps deserved by fair means of course or at least by legal , to spend a little on fun and still save something against old age . Because even as the oak door swung back there seemed to rush out and down at him the stale breath of all human degradation and shame  --  a smell of creosote and excrement and stale vomit and incorrigibilityand defiance and repudiation like something palpable against the thrust and lift of their bodies as they mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the main room , the bullpen , cut off from the rest of the room by a wall of wire mesh like a chicken run or a dog-kennel , inside which in tiered bunks against the farther wall lay five Negroes , motionless , their eyes closed but no sound of snoring , no sound of any sort , lying there immobile orderly and composed under the dusty glare of the single shadeless bulb as if they had been embalmed , the jailer stopping again , his own hands gripped into the mesh while he glared at the motionless shapes . Look at them , ' the jailer said in that voice too loud , too thin , just under hysteria : Peaceful as lambs but ai nt a damned one of them asleep . And I do nt blame them , with a mob of white men boiling in here at midnight with pistols and cans of gasoline .  --  Come on , ' he said and turned and went on . Just beyond there was a door in the mesh , not padlocked but just hooked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog-kennel or a corn crib but the jailer passed it . You put him in the cell , did you ? ' his uncle said . Hampton 's orders , ' the jailer said over his shoulder . ' I do nt know what the next white man that figgers hep57cant rest good until he kills somebody is going to think about it . I taken all the blankets off the cot though . ' ' Maybe because he wont be here long enough to have to go to sleep ? ' his uncle said . ' Ha ha , ' the jailer said in that strained high harsh voice without mirth : ' Ha ha ha ha : ' and following behind his uncle he thought how of all human pursuits murder has the most deadly need of privacy ; how man will go to almost any lengths to preserve the solitude in which he evacuates or makes love but he will go to any length for that in which he takes life , even to homicide , yet by no act can he more completely and irrevocably destroy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-in lock as large as a woman 's handbag which the jailer unlocked with another key on the ring and then turned , the sound of his feet almost as rapid as running back down the corridor until the sound of the oak door at the head of the stairs cut them off , and beyond it the cell lighted by another single dim dusty flyspecked bulb behind a wire screen cupped to the ceiling , not much larger than a broom closet and in fact just wide enough for the double bunk against the wall , from both beds of which not just the blankets but the mattresses too had been stripped , he and his uncle entering and still all he saw yet was the first thing he had seen : the hat and the black coat hanging neatly from a nail in the wall : and he would remember afterward how he thought in a gasp , a surge of relief : They 've already got him . He 's gone . It 's too late . It 's already over now . Because he did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : a carefulspread of newspaper covering neatly the naked springs of the lower cot and another section as carefully placed on the upper one so it would shield his eyes from thep58light and Lucas himself lying on the spread papers , asleep , on his back , his head pillowed on one of his shoes and his hands folded on his breast , quite peacefully or as peacefully as old people sleep , his mouth open and breathing in faint shallow jerky gasps ; and he stood in zn almost unbearable surge not merely of outrage but of rage , looking down at the face which for the first time , defenceless at last for a moment , revealed its age , and the lax . gnarled old man 's hands which only yesterday had sent a bullet into the back of another human being , lying still and peaceful on the bosom of the old-fashioned collarless boiled white shirt closed at the neck with the oxidising brass button shaped like an arrow and almost as large as the head of a small snake , thinking : He 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stiff neck and his gold watch-chain and refusing to mean mister to anybody even when he says it . Only a nigger could kill a man , let alone shoot him in the back , and then sleep like a baby as soon as he found something flat enough to lie down on ; still looking at him when without moving otherwise Lucas closed his mouth and his eyelids opened , the eyes staring up for another second , then still without the head moving at all the eyeballs turned until Lucas was looking straight at his uncle but still not moving : just lying there looking at him . Well , old man , ' his uncle said . You played hell at last . ' Then Lucas moved . He sat up stiffly and swung his legs stiffly over the edge of the cot , picking one of them up by the knee between his hands and swinging it around as you open or close a sagging gate , groaning , grunting not just frankly and unabashed and aloud but comfortably , as the old grunt and groan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to bep59no longer even an ache and which if they were ever actually cured of it , they would be bereft and lost ; he listening and watching still in that rage and now amazementtoo at the murderer not merely in the shadow of the gallows but of a lynch-mob , not only taking time to groan over a stiffness in his back but doing it as if he had all the long rest of a natural life in which to be checked each time he moved by the old familiar catch . ' Looks like it , ' Lucas said . ' That 's why I sent for you . What you going to do with me ? ' ' Me ? ' his uncle said . ' Nothing . My name ai nt Gowrie . It ai nt even Beat Four . ' Moving stiffly again Lucas bent and peered about his feet , then he reached under the cot and drew out the other shoe and sat up again and began to turn creakily and stiffly to look behind him when his uncle reached and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Lucas did n't put them on . Instead he sat again , immobile , his hands on his knees , blinking . Then with one hand he made a gesture which completely dismissed Gowries , mob , vengeance , holocaust and all . ' I 'll worry about that when they walks in here , ' he said , ' I mean the law . Ai nt you the county lawyer ? ' ' Oh , ' his uncle said . ' It 's the District Attorney that 'll hang you or send you to Parchman  --  not me . ' Lucas was still blinking , not rapidly : just steadily . He watched him . And suddenly he realised that Lucas was not looking at his uncle at all and apparently had not been for three or four seconds . ' I see , ' Lucas said . ' Then you can take my case . ' ' Fake your case ? Defend you before the judge ? ' ' I 'm gonter pay you , ' Lucas said . ' You do nt need toworry. '  |p60'I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' his uncle said . Again Lucas made the gesture with one of the dark gnarled hands . Let 's forgit the trial . We ai nt come to it yet . ' And now he saw that Lucas was watching his uncle , his head lowered so that he was watching his uncle upwardfrom beneath through the grizzled tufts of his eyebrows  --  alook shrewd secret and intent . Then Lucas said : I wants to hire somebody  --  ' and stopped . And watching him , he thought remembered an old lady , dead now , a spinster , a neighbor who wore a dyed transformationand had always on a pantry shelf a big bowl of homemadeteacakes for all the children on the street , who one summer ( he could n't have been over seven or eight then ) taught all of them to play Five Hundred : sitting at the card table on her screened side gallery on hot summer mornings and she would wet her fingers and take a card from her hand and lay it on the table , her hand not still poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next player revealed exposed by some movement or gestureof triumph or exultation or maybe by just simple increased hard breathing his intention to trump or overplayit , whereupon she would say quickly : Wait . I picked up the wrong one ' and take up the card and put it back into her hand and play another one . That was exactly what Lucas had done . He had sat still before but now he was absolutely immobile . He did n't even seem to be breathing . Hire somebody ? ' his uncle said . You 've got a lawyer . I had already taken your case before I came in here . I 'm going to tell you what to do as soon as you have told me what happened . '  |p61'No  , ' Lucas said . ' I wants to hire somebody . It do nt have to be a lawyer . ' Now it was his uncle who stared at Lucas . ' To do what ? ' He watched them . Now it was no childhood 's game of stakeless Five Hundred . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you or ai nt you going to take the job ? ' Lucas said . ' So you ai nt going to tell me what you want me to do until after I have agreed to do it , ' his uncle said . ' All right , ' his uncle said . ' Now I 'm going to tell you what to do . Just exactly what happened out there yesterday ? ' ' So you do nt want the job , ' Lucas said . ' You ai nt said yes or no yet . ' ' No ! ' his uncle said , harsh , too loud , catching himself but already speaking again before he had brought his voice back down to a sort of furious explicit calm : ' Becauseyou ai nt got any job to offer anybody . You 're in jail , depending on the grace of God to keep those damned Gowries from dragging you out of here and hanging you to the first lamp post they come to . Why they ever let you get to town in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' What I needs is --  " ' Nemmine that ! ' his uncle said . ' Tell the Gowries to never mind it when they bust in here tonight . Tell Beat Four to just forget it ' He stopped ; again with aneffort you could almost see he brought his voice back to that furious patience . He drew a deep breath and expelledit . ' Now . Tell me exactly what happened yes-terday . ' For another moment Lucas did n't answer , sitting on the bunk , his hands on his knees , intractable and corn- posed , no longer looking at his uncle , working his mouth faintly as if he were tasting something . He said : ' They was two folks , partners in a sawmill . Leastways they was buying the lumber as the sawmill cut it --  " ' Who were they ? ' his uncle said . ' Vinson Gowrie was one of urn . ' His uncle stared at Lucas for a long moment . But his voice was quite calm now . ' Lucas , ' he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said mister to white people and said it like you meant it , you might not be sitting here now ? ' ' So I 'm to commence now , ' Lucas said . ' I can start off by saying mister to the folks that drags me out of here and builds a fire under me . ' ' Nothing 's going to happen to you  --  until you go before the judge , ' his uncle said . ' Do nt you know that even Beat Four do nt take liberties with Mr Hampton  --  at least not here in town ? ' ' Shurf Hampton 's home in bed now . ' ' But Mr Will Legate 's sitting down stairs with a shot-gun . ' ' I ai nt ' quainted with no Will Legate . ' ' The deer-hunter ? The man that can hit a running rabbit with a thirty-thirty rifle ? ' ' Hah , ' Lucas said . ' Them Gowries ai nt deer . They might be cattymounts and panthers but they ai nt deer . ' ' All right , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'll feel better . Now . Go on . Vinson Gowrie and another man were buying lumber together . What other man ? ' ' Vinson Gowrie 's the only one that 's public yet . ' ' And he got public by being shot in broad daylight in the back , ' his uncle said . ' Well , that 's one way to do it .  --  All right , ' his uncle said . ' Who was the other man ? '  |p63Lucas  did n't answer . He did n't move ; he might not even have heard , sitting peaceful and inattentive , not even really waiting : just sitting there while his uncle watched him . Then his uncle said : All right . What were they doing with it ? ' ' They was yarding it up as the mill cut it , gonter sell it all at once when the sawing was finished . Only the other man was hauling it away at night , coming in late after dark with a truck and picking up a load and haulingit over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket . ' How do you know ? ' I seen um . Watched urn . ' Nor did he doubt this for a moment because he remembered Ephraim , Paralee 's father before he died , an old man , a widower who would pass most of the day dozing and waking in a rocking ( hair on Paralee 's gallery in summer and in front of the fire in winter and at night would walk the roads , not going anywhere , just moving , at times five and six miles from town before he would return at dawn to doze and wake all day in the chair again . All right , ' his uncle said . Then what ? ' That 's all , ' Lucas said . He was just stealing a load of lumber every night or so . ' His uncle stared at Lucas for perhaps ten seconds . He said in a voice of calm , almost hushed amazement : So you took your pistol and went to straighten it out . You , a nigger , took a pistol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you expect ? What else did you expect ? ' ' Nemmine expecting , ' Lucas said . ' I wantsYou went to the store , ' his uncle said , only you happened to find Vinson Gowrie first and followed him into the woods and told him his partner was robbing him and naturally he cursed you and called you a liar whether it was true or not , naturally he would have to do that ; maybe he even knocked you down and walked on and you shot him in the back --  " Never nobody knocked me down , ' Lucas said . ' So much the worse , ' his uncle said . ' So much the worse for you . It 's not even self-defense . You just shot him in the back . And then you stood there over him with the fired pistol in your pocket and let the white folks come up and grab you . And if it had n't been for that little shrunk-up rheumatic constable who had no business being there in the first place and in the second place had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner every time he delivered a subpoena or served a warrant , having guts enough to hold off that whole damn Beat Four for eighteen hours until Hope Hampton saw fit or remembered or got around to bringing you in to jail holding off that whole countryside that you nor all the friends you could drum up in a hundred years'I ai nt got friends , ' Lucas said with stern and inflexible pride , and then something else though his uncle was already talking : You 're damned right you have n't . And if you ever had that pistol shot would have blown them to kingdom come too What ? ' his uncle said . What did you say ? ' ' I said I pays my own way , ' Lucas said . I see , ' his uncle said . You do nt use friends ; you pay cash . Yes . I see . Now you listen to me . You 'll go before the grand jury tomorrow . They 'll indict you . Then if you like I 'll have Mr Hampton move you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court convenes next month . Then you 'll plead guilty ; I 'll persuade thep65District Attorney to let you do that because you 're an old man and you never were in trouble before ; I mean as far as the judge and the District Attorney will know since they do nt live within fifty miles of Yoknapatawpha County . Then they wont hang you ; they 'll send you to the penitentiary ; you probably wont live long enough to be paroled but at least the Gowries cant get to you there . Do you want me to stay in here with you tonight ? ' ' I reckon not , ' Lucas said . ' They kept me up all last night and I 'm gonter try to get some sleep . If you stay here you 'll talk till morning . ' ' Right , ' his uncle said harshly , then to him : ' Come on : ' already moving toward the door . Then his uncle stopped . Is there anything you want ? ' ' You might send me some tobacco , ' Lucas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke it . ' ' Tomorrow , ' his uncle said . ' I do nt want to keep you awake tonight : ' and went on , he following , his uncle letting him pass first through the door so that he stepped aside in his turn and stood looking back into the cell while his uncle came through the door and drew it after him , the heavy steel plunger crashing into its steel groove with a thick oily sound of irrefutable finality like that ultimate cosmolined doom itself when as his uncle said man 's machines had at last effaced and obliterated him from the earth and , purposeless now to themselves with nothing left to destroy , closed the last carborundumgrooveddoor upon their own progenitorless apotheosis behind one clockless lock responsive only to the last stroke of eternity , his uncle going on , his feet ringing and echoing down the corridor and then the sharp rattle of his knuckles on the oak door while he and Lucas still looked at one another through the steel bars , Lucas standing too now in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in his face so that he thought for a second that Lucas had spoken aloud . But he had n't , he was making no sound : just looking at him with that mute patient urgency until the jailer 's feet thumped nearer and nearer on the stairs and the slotted bar on the door rasped back . And the jailer locked the bar again and they passed Legate still with his funny paper in the tilted chair beside the shotgun facing the open door , then outside , down the walk to the gate and the street , following through the gate where his uncle had already turned toward home : stopping , thinking a nigger a murderer who shoots white people in the back and ai nt even sorry . He said : ' I imagine I 'll find Skeets McGowan loafing somewhere on the Square . He 's got a key to the drugstore . I 'll take Lucas some tobacco tonight . ' His uncle stopped . It can wait till morning , ' his uncle said . Yes , ' he said , feeling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if his uncle said no , not even waiting really , just standing there . All right , ' his uncle said . Do nt be too long . ' So he could have moved then . But still he did n't . I thought you said nothing would happen tonight . ' I still do nt think it will , ' his uncle said . But you cant tell . People like the Gowries do nt attach a great deal of importance to death or dying . But they do put a lot of stock in the dead and how they died  --  particularly their own . If you get the tobacco , let Tubbs carry it up to him and you come on home . ' So he did n't have to say even yes this time , his uncle turning first then he turned and walked toward thep67Square , walking on until the sound of his uncle 's feet had ceased , then standing until his uncle 's black silhouettehad changed to the white gleam of his linen suit and then that faded beyond the last arclight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he recognised the sheriff 's car this morning that would be eight hours and almost forty miles , turning then and walking back toward the gate with Legate 's eyes watching him , already recognising him across the top of the funny paper even before he reached the gate and if he just went straight on now he could follow the lane behind the hedge and across into the lot and saddle Highboy and go out by the pasture gate and turn his back on Jefferson and niggermurderers and all and let Highboy go as fast as he wanted to go and as far as he wanted to go even when be had blown himself at last and agreed to walk , just so his tail was still turned to Jefferson and nigger murderers : through the gate and up the walk and across the gallery and again the jailer came quickly through the door at the right , his expression already giving way to t he one of harried outrage . ' Again , ' the jailer said . ' Do nt you never get enough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Let it wait till morning , ' the jailer said . ' Let him get it now , ' Legate said in his equable drawl. ' l f he leaves it there till morning it might get trompled on . ' So the jailer turned ; again they mounted the stairs , again the jailer unlocked the bar across the oak door . ' Never mind the other one , ' he said . ' I can attend to it through the bars : ' and did n't wait , the door closed behind him , he heard the bar slide back into the slot but still all he had to do was just to rap on it , hearing the jailer 's feet going away back down the stairs but evenp68then all he had to do was just to yell loud and bang on the floor and Legate anyway would hear him , thinking Maybe he will remind me of that goddamn plate of collardsand sidemeat or maybe he 'll even tell me I 'm all he 's got , all that 's left and that will be enough walkingfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still standing in the middle of the cell beneath the light , watching the door when he came up to it and stopped and said in a voice as harsh as his uncle 's had ever been : All right . What do you want me to do ? ' Go out there and look at him , ' Lucas said . Go out where and look at who ? ' he said . But he understoodall right . It seemed to him that he had known all the time what it would be ; he thought with a kind of relief So that 's all it is even while his automatic voice was screeching with outraged disbelief : Me ? Me ? ' It was like something you have dreaded and feared and dodged for years until it seemed like all your life , then despite everythingit happened to you and all it was was just pain , all it did was hurt and so it was all over , all finished , all right . ' I ' 11 pay you , ' Lucas said . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazed incredulous outrage : Me go out there and dig up that grave ? ' He was n't even thinking anymore So this is what that plate of meat and greens is going to cost me . Because he had already passed that long ago when that something  --  whatever it was  --  had held him here five minutes ago looking back across the vast , the almost insuperable chasm between him and the old Negro murdererand saw , heard Lucas saying something to him not because he was himself , Charles Mallison junior , nor because he had eaten the plate of greens and warmed himself at the fire , but because he alone of all the whitep69people Lucas would have a chance to speak to between now and the moment when he might be dragged out of the cell and down the steps at the end of a rope , would hear the mute unhoping urgency of the eyes . He said : ' Come here . ' Lucas did so , approaching , taking hold of two of the bars as a child stands inside a fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw his own hands holding to two of the bars , the two pairs of hands , the black ones and the white ones , grasping the bars while they faced one another above them . ' All right , ' he said . ' Why ? ' ' Go and look at him , ' Lucas said . ' If it 's too late when you get back , I 'll sign you a paper now saying I owes you whatever you think it 's worth . ' But still he was n't listening ; he knew it : only to himself : ' I 'm to go seventeen miles out there in the dark --  " ' Nine , ' Lucas said . ' The Gowries buries at Caledonia Chapel . You takes the first right hand up into the hills just beyond the Nine-Mile branch bridge . You can be there in a half hour in your uncle 's automobile . ' I 'm to risk having the Gowries catch me diggingup that grave . I aim to know why . I do nt even know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol is a fawty-one Colt , ' Lucas said . Which it would be ; the only thing he had n't actually known was the calibre  --  that weapon workable and efficient and well cared for yet as archaic peculiar and unique as the gold toothpick , which had probably ( without doubt ) been old Carothers McCaslin 's pride a half century ago . ' All right , ' he said . ' Then what ? ' ' He was n't shot with no fawty-one Colt . ' ' What was he shot with ? ' But Lucas did n't answer that , standing there on hisp70side of the steel door , his hands light-clasped and motionlessaround the two bars , immobile save for the faint movement of his breathing . Nor had he expected Lucas to and he knew that Lucas would never answer that , say any more , any further to any white man , and he knew why , as he knew why Lucas had waited to tell him , a child , about the pistol when he would have told neither his uncle nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave and look at the body ; he was surprised that Lucas had come as near as he had to telling his uncle about it and he realised , appreciated again that quality in his uncle which brought people to tell him things they would tell nobody else , even tempting Negroes to tell him what their nature forbade them telling white men : remembering old Ephraim and his mother 's ring that summer five years ago  --  a cheap thing with an imitation stone ; two of them in fact , identical , which his mother and her room-mate at Sweetbriar Virginia had saved their allowances and bought and exchanged to wear until death as young girls will , and the room-mate grown and living in California with a daughter of her own at Sweetbriarnow and she and his mother had not seen one another in years and possibly never would again yet his mother still kept the ring : then one day it disappeared ; he remembered how he would wake late at night and see lights burning downstairs and he would know she was still searching for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home-made rocking chair on Paralee 's front gallery until one day Ephraim told him that for half a dollar he would find the ring and he gave Ephraim the half dollar and that afternoon he left for a week at a Scout camp and returned and found his mother in the kitchen where she had spread newspapers on the tablep71and emptied the stone crock she and Paralee kept the cornmeal in onto it and she and Paralee were combing through the meal with forks and for the first time in a week he remembered the ring and went back to Paralee 's house and there was Ephriam sitting in the chair on the gallery and Ephraim said , Hit 's under the hawg-trough at your pa 's farm : ' nor did Ephriam need to tell him how then because he had already remembered by then : Mrs Downs : an old white woman who lived alone in a small filthy shoebox of a house that smelled like a foxden on the edge of town in a settlement of Negro houses , in and out of which Negroes came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night : who ( this not from Paralee who seemed always to not know or at least to have no time at the moment to talk about it , but from Aleck Sander ) did n't merely tell fortunes and cure hexes but found things : which was where the half dollar had gone and he believed at once and so implicitly that the ring was now found that he dismissed that phase at once and forever and it was only the thing 's secondary and corollary which moved his interest , saying to Ephraim : ' You 've known all this week where it was and you did n't even tell them ? ' and Ephraim looked at him a while , rocking steadily and placidly and sucking at his cold ashfilled pipe with each rock like the sound of a small asthmatic cylinder : ' I mought have told your maw . But she would need help . So I waited for you . Young folks and womens , they ai nt cluttered . They can listen . But a middle-year man like your paw and your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're too busy with facks . In fact , you mought bear this in yo mind ; someday you mought need it . If you ever needs to get anything done outside the common run , do nt waste yo time on the men- folks ; get the womens and children to working at it . ' And he remembered his father 's not rage so much as outrage , his almost furious repudiation , his transferrence of the whole thing into a realm of assailed embattled moral principle , and even his uncle who until now had had no more trouble than he believing things that all other grown people doubted for the sole reason that they were unreasonable , while his mother went serenely and stubbornlyabout her preparations to go out to the farm which she had n't visited in over a year and even his father had n't seen it since months before the ring was missing and even his uncle refused to drive the car so his father hired a man from the garage and he and his mother went out to the farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the hogs were fed , the ring . Only this was no obscure valueless little ring exchanged twenty years ago between two young girls but the death by shameful violence of a man who would die not because the was a murderer but because his skin was black . Yet this was all Lucas was going to tell him and he knew it was all ; he thought in a kind of raging fury : Believe ? Believe what ? because Lucas was not even asking him to believe anything ; he was not even asking a favor , making no last desperate plea to his humanity and pity but was even going to pay him provided the price was not too high , to go alone seventeen miles ( no , nine : he remembered at least that he had heard that now ) in the dark and risk being caught violatingthe grave of a member of a clan of men already at the pitch to commit the absolute of furious and bloody outrage , without even telling him why . Yet he tried it again , as he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he knew what answer he would get :  |p73What  gun was he shot with , Lucas ? ' and got exactly what even Lucas knew he had expected : ' I 'm gonter pay you , ' Lucas said . Name yo price at anything in reason and I will pay it . ' He drew a long breath and expelled it while they faced each other through the bars , the bleared old man 's eyes watching him , inscrutable and secret . They were not even urgent now and he thought peacefully He 's not only beat me , he never for one second had any doubt of it . He said : All right . Just for me to look at him would n't do any good , even if I could tell about the bullet . So you see what that means . I 've got to dig him up , get him out of that hole before the Gowries catch me , and in to town where Mr Hampton can send to Memphis for an expert that can tell about bullets . ' He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars inside the cell and not even looking at him anymore . He drew a long breath again . But the main thing is to get him up out of the ground where somebody can look at him before the ' Ile looked at Lucas . I 'll have to get out there and dig him up and get back to town before midnight or one oclock and maybe even midnight will be too late . I do nt see how I can do it . I cant do it . ' I 'll try to wait , ' Lucas said.  |p74THERE  WAS A WEATHERED battered second-hand-looking pickup truck parked at the curb in front of the house when he reached home . It was now well past eight oclock ; it was a good deal more than a possibility that there remainedless than four hours for his uncle to go to the sheriff 's house and convince him and then find a J.P . or whoever they would have to find and wake and then convince too to open the grave ( in lieu of permission from the Gowries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save a nigger from being burned over a bonfire , the President of the United States himself let alone a country sheriff would never get ) and then go out to Caledonia church and dig up the body and get back to town with it in time . Yet this of all nights would be one when a farmer whose stray cow or mule or hog had been impoundedby a neighbor who insisted on collecting a dollar pound fee before he would release it , must come in to see his uncle , to sit for an hour in his uncle 's study saying yes or no or I reckon not while his uncle talked about crops or politics , one of which his uncle knew nothing about and the other the farmer did n't , until the man would get around to telling what he came for . But he could n't stand on ceremony now . He had been walking pretty fast since he left the jail but he was trottingnow , catacorner across the lawn , onto the galleryp75and across it into the hall past the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp with the Memphis paper 's Sunday crossword puzzle page and his mother under the other one with the new Book-ofthe-Monthbook , and on back to what his mother used to try to call Gavin 's study but which Paralee and Aleck Sander had long since renamed the office so that everyone now called it that . The door was closed ; he could hear the murmur of the man 's voice beyond it during the second in which without even stopping he rapped twice and at the same time opened the door and entered , already saying : Good evening , sir . Excuse me . Uncle Gavin --  " Because the voice was his uncle 's ; seated opposite his uncle beyond the desk , instead of a man with a shaved sunburned neck in neat tieless Sunday shirt and pants , was a woman in a plain cotton print dress and one of the round faintly dusty-looking black hats set squarely on the top of her head such as his grandmother had used to wear and then he recognised her even before he saw the watch  --  small gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fiat bosom almost like and in almost exactly the same position as the heart sewn on the breast of the canvas fencing vest  --  because since his grandmother'sdeath no other woman in his acquaintance wore or even owned one and in fact he should have recognised the pickup truck : Miss Habersham , whose name was now the oldest which remained in the county . There had been three once : Doctor Habersharn and a tavern keeper named Holston and a Huguenot younger son named Grenier who had ridden horseback into the county beforeits boundaries had ever been surveyed and located and named , when Jefferson was a Chickasaw trading post with a Chickasaw word to designate it out of the trackless wilderness of canebrake and forest of that time but all gone now , vanished except the one even from the county 's spoken recollection : Holston merely the name of the hotel on the Square and few in the county to know or care where the word came from , and the last of the blood of Louis Grenier the elegante , the dilettante , the Paris-educated architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his time as a planter and painter ( and more amateur as a raiser of food and cotton than with canvas and brush ) now warmed the bones of an equable cheerful middleaged man with the mind and face of a child who lived in a half-shed half-den he built himself of discarded boards and pieces of flattened stovepipeand tin cans on the bank of the river twenty miles away , who did n't know his age and could n't write even the Lonnie Grinnup which he now called himself and did n't even know that the land he squatted on was the last lost scrap of the thousands of acres which his ancestor had been master of and only Miss Habersham remained : a kinless spinster of seventy living in the columned colonial house on the edge of town which had not been painted since her father died and had neither water nor electricity in it , with two Negro servants ( and here again something nagged for an instant at his mind his attention but already in the same second gone , not even dismissed : just gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the wife ) did the cooking while Miss Habersham and the man raised chickens and vegetables and peddled them about town from the pickup truck . Until two years ago they had used a plump aged white horse ( it was said to be twenty years old when he first remembered it , with a skin beneath the burnished white hairs as clean and pink as a1p77baby 's ) and a buggy . Then they had a good season or something and Miss Habersham bought the pickup truck second hand and every morning winter and summer they would be seen about the streets from house to house , Miss Habersham at the wheel in cotton stockings and the round black hat which she had been wearing for at least forty years and the clean print dresses which you could see in the Sears Roebuck catalogues for two dollars and ninety-eight cents with the neat small gold watch pinned to the flat unmammary front and the shoes and the gloves which his mother said were made to her measure in a New York shop and cost thirty and forty dollars a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the Negro man trotted his vast belly in and out of the houses with a basket of bright greens or eggs in one hand and the plucked naked carcass of a chicken in the other ;  --  recognised , remembered , even ( his attention ) nagged at and already dismissed because there was n't time , saying rapidly : Good evening , Miss Habersham . Excuse me . I 've got to speak to Uncle Gavin : ' then again to his uncle : Uncle Gavin --  " So is Miss Habersham , ' his uncle said quick and immediate , in a tone a voice which in ordinary times he would have recognised at once ; at an ordinary time he might even have comprehended the implication of what his uncle had said . But not now . He did n't actually hear it . He was n't listening . In fact he really did n't have time to talk himself , saying rapid yet calm too , merely urgent and even that only to his uncle because he had already forgotten Miss Habersham , even her presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only then stopped not because he had finished , he had n't even begun yet , but because for the first time he was hearing his uncle who had n't even paused , sitting half sideways in the chair , one arm thrown over the back and the other hand hold . ing the burning cob pipe on the table in front of him , still speaking in that voice like the idle flicking of a small limber switch : So you took it up to him yourself . Or maybe you did n't even bother with tobacco . And he told you a tale . I hope it was a good one . ' And that was all . He could go now , in fact should . For that matter he should never have stopped on his way through the hall or even come into the house at all but on around it where he could have called Aleck Sander on his way to the stable ; Lucas had told him that thirty minutes ago in the jail when even he had come almost to the point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end known better than to try to tell his uncle or any other white man . Yet still he did n't move . He had forgotten Miss Habersham . He had dismissedher ; he had said Excuse me ' and so evanished her not only from the room but the moment too as the magician with one word or gesture disappears the palm tree or the rabbit or the bowl of roses and only they remained , the three of them : he at the door and still holding it , half in the room which he had never actually entered and should n't have come even that far and half already back out of it in the hall where he should never have wasted time passing to begin with , and his uncle half sprawled behind the table littered with papers too and another of the German beermugs filled with paper spills and probably a dozen of the corncob pipes in various stages of char , and half a mile away the old kinless friendlessopinionated arrogant hardheaded intractable inde/pendent ( insolent too ) Negro man alone in the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one-armed Nub Gowrie 's in the hall below saying , Git out of the way , Will Legate . We 've come for that nigger , ' while outside the quiet lamplit room the vast millrace of time roared not toward midnight but dragging midnight with it , not to hurl midnight into wreckage but to hurl the wreckage of midnight down upon them in one poised skyblotting yawn : and he knew now that the irrevocable moment was not when he said All right ' to Lucas through the steel door of the cell but when he would step back into the hall and close this one behind him . So he tried again , still calm , not even rapid now , not even urgent : just specious explicit and reasonable : Suppose it was n't his pistol that killed him . ' ' Of course , ' his uncle said . That 's exactly what I would claim myself if I were Lucas  --  or any other Negro murdererfor that matter or any ignorant white murderer either for the matter of that . He probably even told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? a rabbit , or maybe a tin can or a mark on a tree just to see if it really was loaded , really would go off . But let that pass . Grant it for the moment : then what ? What do you suggest ? No ; what did Lucas tell you to do ? ' And he even answered that : Could n't Mr Hampton dig him up and see ? ' On what grounds ? Lucas was caught within two minutes after the shot , standing over the body with a recently-firedpistol in his pocket . He never denied having fired it ; in fact he refused to make any statement at all , even to me , his lawyer  --  the lawyer he himself sent for . And how risk it ? I 'd just as soon go out there and shootp8oanother one of his sons as to tell Nub Gowrie I wanted to dig his boy 's body up out of the ground it had been consecrated and prayed into . And if I went that far , I 'd heap rather tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its teeth than to tell him the reason was to save a nigger from being lynched . ' But suppose ' he said . Listen to me , ' his uncle said with a sort of weary yet indomitable patience : Try to listen . Lucas is locked behind a proof steel door . He 's got the best protection Hampton or anybody else in this county can possibly give him . As Will Legate said , there are enough people in this county to pass him and Tubbs and even that door if they really want to . But I do nt believe there are that many people in this county who really want to hang Lucas to a telephone pole and set fire to him with gas-oline . ' And now too . But he still tried . But just suppose he said again and now he heard for the third time almost exactly what he had heard twice in twelve hours , and he marvelled again at the paucity , the really almost standardisedmeagreness not of individual vocabularies but of Vocabulary itself , by means of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concrete warrens in comparative amity : even his uncle too : Suppose it then . Lucas should have thought of that before he shot a white man in the back . ' And it was only later that he would realise his uncle was speaking to Miss Habersham too now ; at the moment he was neither rediscovering her presence in the room nor even discoveringit ; he did not even remember that she had already long since ceased to exist , turning , closing the door upon the significantless speciosity of his uncle'sp81voice : ' I 've told him what to do . If anything was going to happen , they would have done it out there , at home , in their own back yard ; they would never have let Mr Hampton get to town with him . In fact , I still do nt understand why they did . But whether it was luck or mismanagementor old Mr Gowrie is failing with age , the result is good ; he 's all right now and I 'm going to persuade him to plead guilty to manslaughter ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He 'll go to the penitentiary and perhaps in a few years if he lives  --  ' and closed the door , who had heard it all before and would no more , out of the room which he had never completely entered anyway and should n't have stopped at all , releasing the knob for the first time since he had put his hand on it and thinking with the frantic niggling patience of a man in a burning house trying to gather up a broken string of beads : Now I 'll have to walk all the way back to the jail to ask Lucas where it is : realising how Lucas probability doubts and everything else to the contrary he actually had expected his uncle and the sheriff would take charge and make the expedition , not because he thought they would believe him but simply because he simply could not conceive of himself and Aleck Sander being left with it : until he remembered that Lucas had already taken care of that too , foreseenthat too ; remembering not with relief but rather with a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his capacity how Lucas had not only told him what he wanted but exactly where it was and even how to get there and only then as afterthought asked him if he would :  --  hearing the crackle of the paper on his father 's lap beyond the library door and smelling the cigar burning in the ashtray at his hand and then he saw the blue wisp of its smoke float slowly out the open door as his father must have picked it up in some synonymous hiatus or throe and puffed it once : and ( remembering ) even by what means to get out there and back and he thought of himself opening the door again and saying to his uncle : Forget Lucas . Just lend me your car and then walking into the library and saying to his father who would have their car keys in his pocket until he would remember when he undressed to leave them where his mother could find them tomorrow : Let me have the keys , Pop . I want to run out to the country and dig up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the house ( not Miss Habersham ; he never thought of her again . He just remembered a motor vehiclesitting empty and apparently unwatched on the street not fifty yards away ) ; the key might be , probably was , still in the switch and the Gowrie who caught him robbing his son 's or brother 's or cousin 's grave might as well catch a car-thief too . Because ( quitting abandoning emerging from scatteringwith one sweep that confetti-swirl of raging facetiae ) he realised that he had never doubted getting out there and even getting the body up . He could see himself reaching the church , the graveyard without effort nor even any great elapse of time ; he could see himself singlehanded even having the body up and out still with no effort , no pant and strain of muscles and lungs nor laceration of the shrinking sensibilities . It was only then that the whole wrecked and tumbling midnight which peer and pant though he would he could n't see past and beyond , would come crashing down on him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second 's fraction while he closed the office door ) he flung himself bodily withp83one heave into a kind of deadly reasonableness of enragedcalculation , a calm sagacious and desperate rationalitynot of pros and cons because there were no pros : the reason he was going out there was that somebody had to and nobody else would and the reason somebody had to was that not even Sheriff Hampton ( vide Will Legate and the shotgun stationed in the lower hall of the jail like on a lighted stage where anybody approaching would have to see him or them before they even reached the gate ) were completely convinced that the Gowries and their kin and friends would not try to take Lucas out of the jail tonight and so if they were all in town tonight trying to lynch Lucas there would n't be anybody hangingaround out there to catch him digging up the grave and if that was a concrete fact then its obverse would be concrete too : if they were not in town after Lucas tonightthen any one of the fifty or a hundred men and boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pine lumbertrading might stumble on him and Aleck Sander : and that too , that again : he must go on a horse for the same reason : that nobody else would except a sixteen-year-old boy who owned nothing to go on but a horse and he must even choose here : either to go alone on the horse in half the time and spend three times the time getting the body up alone because alone he would not only have to do all the digging but the watching and listening too , or take Aleck Sander with him ( he and Aleck Sander had travelled that way before on Highboy for even more than ten miles  --  a big rawboned gelding who had taken five bars even under a hundred and seventy-five pounds and a good slow canter even with two up and a long jolting driving trot as fast as the canter except that not even Aleck Sander could stand it very long behind the saddle and then a shuffling nameless halfrun halfwalk which he could hold for miles under both of them , Aleck Sander behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse holding to the off stirrup for the next one ) and so get the body up in a third of the time at the risk of having Aleck Sander keeping Lucas company when the Gowries came with the gasoline : and suddenly he found himself escaped back into the confetti exactly as you put off having to step finally into the cold water , thinking seeing hearing himself trying to explain that to Lucas too : We have to use the horse . We cant help it : and Lucas : You could have axed him for the car : and he : He would have refused . Do nt you understand ? He would n't only have refused , he would have locked me up where I could n't even have walked out there , let alone had a horse : and Lucas : All right , all right . I ai nt criticising you . After all , it ai nt you them Gowries is fixing to set afire :  --  moving down the hall to the back door : and he was wrong ; not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars nor when he had stepped back into the hall and closed the office door behind him , but here was the irrevocablemoment after which there would be no return ; he could stop here and never pass it , let the wreckage of midnight crash harmless and impotent against these walls because they were strong , they would endure ; they were home , taller than wreckage , stronger than fear ;  --  not even stopping , not even curious to ask himself if perhaps he dared not stop , letting the screen door quietly to behind him and down the steps into the vast furious vortex of the soft May night and walking fast now across1p85the yard toward the dark cabin where Paralee and Aleck Sander were no more asleep than all the other Negroes within a mile of town would sleep tonight , not even in bed but sitting quietly in the dark behind the closed doors and shuttered windows waiting for what sound what murmur of fury and death to breathe the spring dark : and stopped and whistled the signal he and Aleck Sander had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting off the seconds until the moment should come to repeat it , thinking how if he were Aleck Sander he would n't come out of the house to anybody 's whistle tonight either when suddenly with no sound and certainly no light behind to reveal him by Aleck Sander stood out from the shadows , walking , already quite near in the moonless dark , a little taller than he though there was only a few months ' difference between them : and came up , not even looking at him but past , over his head , toward the Square as if looking could make a lofting trajectory like a baseball , over the trees and the streets and the houses , to drop seeing into the Square  --  not the homes in the shady yards and the peaceful meals and the resting and the sleep which were the end and the reward , but the Square : the edifices created and ordained for trade and government and judgmentand incarceration where strove and battled the passions of men for which the rest and the little death of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So they ai nt come for old Lucas yet , ' Aleck Sander said . ' Is that what your people think about it too ? ' he said . ' And so would you , ' Aleck Sander said . ' It 's the ones like Lucas makes trouble for everybody . '  |p86Then  maybe you better go to the office and sit with Uncle Gavin instead of coming with me . ' Going where with you ? ' Aleck Sander said . And he told him , harsh and bald , in four words : Dig up Vinson Gowrie . ' Aleck Sander did n't move , still looking past and over his head toward the Square . Lucas said it was n't his gun that killed him . ' Still not moving Aleck Sander began to laugh , not loud and with no mirth : just laughing ; he said exactly what his uncle had said hardly a minute ago : So would I , ' Aleck Sander said . He said : Me ? Go out there and dig that dead white man up ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there until he comes ? ' Lucas is going to pay you , ' he said . He told me that even before he told me what it was . ' Aleck Sander laughed , without mirth or scorn or anything else : with no more in the sound of it than there is anything in the sound of breathing but just breathing . I ai nt rich , ' he said . ' I do nt need money . ' At least you 'll saddle Highboy while I hunt for a flashlight , wont you ? ' he said . You 're not too proud about Lucas to do that , are you ? ' Certainly , ' Aleck Sander said , turning . And get the pick and shovel . And the long tie-rope . I 'll need that too . ' Certainly , ' Aleck Sander said . He paused , half turned . How you going to tote a pick and shovel both on Highboywhen he do nt even like to see a riding switch in your hand ? ' I do nt know , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house and at first he thought it was his uncle coming rapidly around the house from the front , not because he believed that his uncle mightp87have suspected and anticipated what he was about because he did not , his uncle had dismissed that too immediatelyand thoroughly not only from conception but from possibility too , but because he no longer rememberedanyone else available for it to have been and even after he saw it was a woman he assumed it was his mother , even after he should have recognised the hat , right up to the instant when Miss Habersham called his name and his first impulse was to step quickly and quietly around the corner of the garage , from where he could reach the lot fence still unseen and climb it and go on to the stable and so go out the pasture gate without passing the house again at all , flashlight or not but it was already too late : calling his name : Charles : ' in that tense urgent whisper then came rapidly up and stopped facing him , speaking in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and now he knew what it was that had nudged at his attention back in his uncle 's office when he had recognised her and then in the next second flashed away : old Molly , Lucas ' wife , who had been the daughter of one of old Doctor Habersham 's , Miss Habersham 's grandfather 's , slaves , she and Miss Habersham the same age , born in the same week and both suckled at Molly 's mother 's breast and grown up together almost inextricably like sisters , like twins , sleeping in the same room , the white girl in the bed , the Negro girl on a cot at the foot of it almost until Molly and Lucas married , and Miss Habersham had stood up in the Negro church as godmother to Molly 's first child . He said it was n't his pistol , ' he said . So he did n't do it , ' she said , rapid still and with somethingeven more than urgency in her voice now . I do nt know , ' he said.  |p88Nonsense  , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I do nt know , ' he said . You must know . You saw him  --  talked to him --  " ' I do nt know , ' he said . He said it calmly , quietly , with a kind of incredulous astonishment as though he had only now realised what he had promised , intended : ' I just do nt know . I still do nt know . I 'm just going out there ' He stopped , his voice died . There was aninstant a second in which he even remembered he should have been wishing he could recall it , the last unfinished sentence . Though it was probably already too late and she had already done herself what little finishing the sentence needed and at any moment now she would cry , protest , ejaculate and bring the whole house down on him . Then in the same second he stopped remembering it . She said : Of course : ' immediate murmurous and calm ; he thought for another half of a second that she had n't understood at all and then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them facing each other indistinguishable in the darkness across the tense and rapid murmur : and then he heard his own voice speaking in the same tone and pitch , the two of them not conspiratorial exactly but rather like two people who have irrevocably accepted a gambit they are not at all certain they can cope with : only that they will resist it : ' We do nt even know it was n't his pistol . He just said it was n't . ' Yes . ' He did n't say whose it was nor whether or not he fired it . He did n't even tell you he did n't fire it . He just said it was n't his pistol . ' Yes . ' And your uncle told you there in his study that that'sp89just exactly what he would say , all he could say . ' He did n't answer that . It was n't a question . Nor did she give him time . ' All right , ' she said . ' Now what ? To find out if it was n't his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go out there and what ? ' He told her , as badly as he had told Aleck Sander , explicit and succinct : Look at him : ' not even pausing to think how here he should certainly have anticipated at least a gasp . ' Go out there and dig him up and bring him to town where somebody that knows bullet holes can look at the bullet hole in him -- 'Yes , ' Miss Habersham said . ' Of course . Naturally he would n't tell your uncle . He 's a Negro and your uncle 's a man : ' and now Miss Habersham in her turn repeating and paraphrasing and he thought how it was not really a paucity a meagreness of vocabulary , it was in the first place because the deliberate violent blotting out obliterationof a human life was itself so simple and so final that the verbiage which surrounded it enclosed it insulated it intact into the chronicle of man had of necessity to be simple and uncomplex too , repetitive , almost monotonouseven ; and in the second place , vaster than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , not even fact and so there was not needed a great deal of diversification and originality to express it because truth was universal , it had to be universal to be truth and so there did n't need to be a great deal of it just to keep running something no bigger than one earth and so anybody could know truth ; all they had to do was just to pause , just to stop , just to wait : ' Lucas knew it would take a child  --  or an old woman like me : someone not concerned with probability , with evidence . Men like your uncle and Mr Hampton havep90had to be men too long , busy too long . Yes ? ' she said . Bring him in to town where someone who knows can look at the bullet hole . And suppose they look at it and find out it was Lucas ' pistol ? ' And he did n't answer that at all , nor had she waited again , saying , already turning : We 'll need a pick and shovel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She stopped ; she said almost patiently : It 's fifteen miles out there Ten , ' he said. a grave is six feet deep . It 's after eight now andyou may have only until midnight to get back to town intime ' and something else but he did n't even hear it . He was n't even listening . He had said this himself to Lucas only fifteen minutes ago but it was only now that he understood what he himself had said . It was only after hearing someone else say it that he comprehended not the enormity of his intention but the simple inert unwieldyimpossible physical vastness of what he faced ; he said quietly , with hopeless indomitable amazement : We cant possibly do it . ' No , ' Miss Habersham said . Well ? ' Ma'am ? ' he said . What did you say ? ' I said you have n't even got a car . ' We were going on the horse . ' Now she said , We ? ' Me and Aleck Sander . ' Then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shovel . They 'll begin to wonder in the house why they have n't heard my truck start . ' She moved again . Yessum , ' he said . Drive on down the lane to the pasturegate . We 'll meet you there . '  |p91He  did n't wait either . He heard the truck start as he climbed the lot fence ; presently he could see Highboy 's blaze in the black yawn of the stable hallway ; Aleck Sander jerked the buckled girth-strap home through the keeper as he came up . He unsnapped the tie-rope from the bit-ring before he remembered and snapped it back and untied the other end from the wall-ring and looped it and the reins up over Highboy 's head and led him out of the hallway and got up . Here , ' Aleck Sander said reaching up the pick and shovel but Highboy had already begun to dance even before he could have seen them as he always did even at a hedge switch and he set him back hard and steadied him as Aleck Sander said Stand still ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing up the pick and shovel and he steadied them across the saddle-bow and managed to hold Highboy back on his heels for another second , long enough to free his foot from the near stirrup for Aleck Sander to get his foot into it , Highboy moving then in a long almost buck-jump as Aleck Sander swung up behind and still trying to run until he steadied him again with one hand , the pick and shovel jouncing on the saddle , and turned him across the pasture toward the gate . Hand me them damn shovels and picks , ' Aleck Sander said . Did you get the flashlight ? ' What do you care ? ' he said . Aleck Sander reached his spare hand around him and took the pick and shovel ; again for a second Highboy could actually see them but this time he had both hands free for the snaffle and the curb too . You ai nt going anywhere to need a flashlight . You just said so . ' They had almost reached the gate . He could see the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; that is , he could believe he saw it because he knew it was there . But Aleck Sander actually saw it : who seemed able to see in the dark almost like an animal . Carrying the pick and shovel , Aleck Sander had no free hand , nevertheless he had one with which he reached suddenly again and caught the reins outside his own hands and jerked Highboy almost back to a squat and said in a hissing whisper : What 's that ? ' It 's Miss Eunice Habersham 's truck , ' he said . She 's going with us . Turn him loose , confound it ! ' wrenching the reins from Aleck Sander , who released them quickly enough now , saying , She 's gonter take the truck : ' and not even dropping the pick and shovel but flinging them clattering and clanging against the gate and slipping down himself and just in time because now Highboy stood erect on his hind feet until he struck him hard between the ears with the looped tie-rope . Open the gate , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleck Sander said . ' Unsaddleand bridle him here . We 'll put um up when we get back . ' Which was what Miss Habersham said ; through the gate now and Highboy still sidling and beating his hooves while Aleck Sander put the pick and shovel into the back of the truck as though he expected Aleck Sander to throw them at him this time , and Miss Habersham 's voice from the dark cab of the truck : He sounds like a good horse . Has he got a four-footed gait too ? ' Yessum , ' he said . Nome , ' he said . I ' 11 take the horse too . The nearest house is a mile from the church but somebody might still hear a car . We 'll leave the truck atp93the bottom of the hill when we cross the branch . ' Then he answered that too before she had time to say it : We 'll need the horse to bring him back down to the truck . ' Heh , ' Aleck Sander said . It was n't laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon that horse is going to tote what you dug up when he do nt even want to tote what you going to do the digging with ? ' But he had already thought of that too , remembering his grandfathertelling of the old days when deer and bear and wild turkey could be hunted in Yoknapatawpha County within twelve miles of Jefferson , of the hunters : Major de Spain who had been his grandfather 's cousin and old General Cornpson and Uncle Ike McCaslin , Carothers Edmonds ' great-uncle , still alive at ninety , and Boon Hogganbeck whose mother 's mother had been a Chickasawwoman and the Negro Sam Fathers whose father had been a Chickasaw chief , and Major de Spain 's one-eyed hunting mule Alice who was n't afraid even of the smell of bear and he thought how if you really were the sum of your ancestry it was too bad the ancestors who had evoluted him into a secret resurrector of country graveyardshad n't thought to equip him with a descendant of that unspookable one-eyed mule to transport his subjectson . I do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time we get back to the truck , ' Miss Habersham said . Can Aleck Sander drive ? ' Yessum , ' Aleck Sander said . Highboy was still edgy ; held down he would merely have lathered himself to no end so since it was cool tonightfor the first mile he actually kept in sight of the truck 's tail-light . Then he slowed , the light fled diminishingon and vanished beyond a curve and he settled High- boy into the shambling halfrun halfwalk which no show judge would ever pass but which covered ground ; nine miles of it to be covered and he thought with a kind of ghastly amusement that at last he would have time to think , thinking how it was too late to think now , not one of the three of them dared think now , if they had done but one thing tonight it was at least to put all thought **26;2945;TOOLONG forever behind them ; five miles from town and he would cross ( probably Miss Habershamand Aleck Sander in the truck already had ) the invisible surveyor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious , the fabulous almost and certainly least of all did any of them dare think now , thinking how it was never difficult for an outlander to do two things at once which Beat Four would n't like since Beat Four already in advance did n't like most of the things which people from town ( and from most of the rest of the county too for that matter ) did : but that it remained for them , a white youth of sixteen and a Negro one of the same and an old white spinster of seventy to elect and do at the same time the two things out of all man 's vast reservoir of invention and capability that Beat Four would repudiate and retaliate on most violently : to violatethe grave of one of its progeny in order to save a nigger murderer from its vengeance . But at least they would have some warning ( not speculatingon who the warning could help since they who would be warned were already six and seven miles from the jail and still moving away from it as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming in tonight he should begin to pass them soon ( or they pass him )  --  the battered mud-stained cars , the empty trucks for hauling cattle and lumber , and the saddled horsesp95and mules . Yet so far he had passed nothing whatever since he left town ; the road lay pale and empty before and behind him too ; the lightless houses and cabins squatted or loomed beside it , the dark land stretched away into the darkness strong with the smell of plowed earth and now and then the heavy scent of flowering orchards lying across the road for him to ride through like stagnant skeins of smoke so maybe they were making better time than even he had hoped and before he could stop it he had thought Maybe we can , maybe we will after all ;  --  before he could leap and spring and smother and blot it from thinking not because he could n't really believethey possibly could and not because you do nt dare think whole even to yourself the entirety of a dear hope or wish let alone a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into words even only to himself was like the struck match which does n't dispel the dark but only exposes its terror  --  one weak flash and glare revealing for a second the empty road 's the dark and empty land 's irrevocable immitigable negation . Because  --  almost there now ; Aleck Sander and Miss Habersham had already arrived probably a good thirty minutes ago and he took a second to hope Aleck Sander had had forethought enough to drive the truck off the road where anybody passing would not see it , then in the same second he knew that of course Aleck Sander had done that and it was not Aleck Sander he had ever doubted but himself for even for one second doubting Aleck Sander  --  he had not seen one Negro since leaving town , with whom at this hour on Sunday night in May the road should have been constant as beads almost  --  the men and young women and girls and even a few old men and women and even children before it got too late , but mostly the men the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shearing earth the lurch and heave of plows behind straining and surging mules then at noon Saturday had washed and shaved and put on the clean Sunday shirts and pants and all Saturdaynight had walked the dusty roads and all day Sunday and all Sunday night would still walk them until barely time to reach home and change back into the overalls and the brogans and catch and gear up the mules and forty-eight hours even bedless save for the brief time there was a woman in it be back in the field again the plow 's point set into the new furrow when Monday 's sun rose : but not now , not tonight : where in town except for Paralee and Aleck Sander he had seen none either for twenty-four hours but he had expected that , they were acting exactly as Negroes and whites both would have expected Negroes to act at such a time ; they were still there , they had not fled , you just did n't see them  --  a sense a feeling of their constant presence and nearness : black men and women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not crouching cringing shrinking , not in anger and not quite in fear : just waiting , biding since theirs was an armament which the white man could not match nor  --  if he but knew it  --  even cope with : patience ; just keeping out of sight and out of the way ,  --  but not here , no sense feeling here of a massed adjacence , a dark human presence bidingand unseen ; this land was a desert and a witness , this empty road its postulate ( it would be some time yet beforehe would realise how far he had come : a provincial Mississippian , a child who when the sun set this same day had appeared to be -- and even himself believed , providedhe had thought about it at all  --  still a swaddledp97unwitting infant in the long tradition of his native land  --  or for that matter a witless foetus itself struggling  --  if the was aware that there had been any throes  --  blind and insentient and not even yet awaked in the simple painlessconvulsion of emergence ) of the deliberate turning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very economy of the land itself was founded , not in heat or anger nor even regret but in one irremediable invincibleinflexible repudiation , upon not a racial outrage but a human shame . Now he was there ; Highboy tightened and even began to drive a little , even after nine miles , smelling water and now he could see distinguish the bridge or at least the gap of lighter darkness where the road spanned the impenetrable blackness of the willows banding the branch and then Aleck Sander stood out from the bridge rail ; Highboy snorted at him then he recognised him too , without surprise , not even remembering how he had wondered once if Aleck Sander would have forethought to hide the truck , not even remembering that he had expected no less , not stopping , checking Highboy back to a walk across the bridge then giving him his head to turn from the road beyond the bridge and drop in stiff fore-legged jolts down toward the water invisible for a moment longer then he too could see the reflected wimplingwhere it caught the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and back , almost unseating him . ' He smell quicksand , ' Aleck Sander said . Let him wait till he gets home , anyway . I 'd rather be doing something else than what I am too . ' But he took Highboy a little further down the bank where he might get down to the water but again he only feinted at it so he pulled away and back onto the road and freed the stirrup for Aleck Sander , Highboy again already in motion when Aleck Sander swung up . Here , ' Aleck Sander said but he had already swung Highboy off the gravel and into the narrow dirt road turning sharp toward the black loom of the ridge and beginning almost at once its long slant up into the hills though even before it began to rise the strong constant smell of pines was coming down on them with no wind behind it yet firm and hard as a hand almost , palpable against the moving body as water would have been . The slant steepened under the horse and even carrying double he essayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope , gathering and surging out until he checked him sharply back and even then he had to hold him hard-wristed in a strong lurching uneven walk until the first level of the plateau flattened and even as Aleck Sander said Here ' again Miss Habershamstood out of the obscurity at the roadside carrying the pick and shovel . Aleck Sander slid down as Highboy stopped . He followed . Stay on , ' Miss Habersham said . I 've got the tools and the flashlight . ' It 's a half mile yet , ' he said . ' Up hill . This ai nt a sidesaddlebut maybe you could sit sideways . Where 's the truck ? ' he said to Aleck Sander . Behind them bushes , ' Aleck Sander said . ' We ai nt holding a parade . Leastways I ai nt . ' No no , ' Miss Habersham said . I can walk . ' We 'll save time , ' he said . It must be after ten now . He 's gentle . That was just when Aleck Sander threw the pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She handed the tools to Aleck Sander and approached the horse.  |p99'I  'm sorry it ai nt he said . Pah , ' she said and took the reins from him and before he could even brace his hand for her foot she put it in the stirrup and went up as light and fast as either he or Aleck Sander could have done , onto the horse astride so that he had just time to avert his face , feeling her looking down in the darkness at his turned head . Pah , ' she said again . I 'm seventy years old . Besides , we 'll worry about my skirt after we are done with this : '  --  moving Highboy herself before he had hardly time to take hold of the bit , back into the road when Aleck Sander said : Hush . ' They stopped , immobile in the long constant invisible flow of pine . Mule coming down the hill , ' Aleck Sander said . He began to turn the horse at once . I do nt hear anything , ' Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said , turning Highboy back off the road : Aleck Sander 's sure . ' And standing at Highboy 's head among the trees and undergrowth , his other hand lying on the horse 's nostrils in case he decided to nicker at the other animal , he heard it too  --  the horse or mule coming steadily down the road from the crest . It was unshod probably ; actually the only sound he really heard was the creak of leather and he wondered ( without doubting for one second that he had ) how Aleck Sander had heard it at all the two minutes and more it had taken the animal to reach them . Then he could see it or that is where it was passing them  --  a blob , a movement , a darker shadow than shadow against the pale dirt of the road , going on down the hill , the soft steady shuffle and screak of leather dying away , then gone . But they waited a moment more.  |p100What  was that he was toting on the saddle in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even see whether it was a man on it or not , ' he said . I could n't see anything , ' Miss Habersham said . He led the horse back into the road . Suppose ' she said . Aleck Sander will hear it in time , ' he said . So once more Highboy surged strong and steady at the steepening pitch , he carrying the shovel and clutching the leather under Miss Habersham 's thin hard calf on one side and Aleck Sander with the pick on the other , mounting , really moving quite fast through the strong heady vivid living smell of the pines which did something to the lungs , the breathing as ( he imagined : he had never tasted it . He could have  --  the sip from the communion cup did n't count because it was not only a sip but sour consecratedand sharp : the deathless blood of our Lord not to be tasted , moving not downward toward the stomach but upward and outward into the Allknowledge between good and evil and the choice and the repudiation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had never wanted to. ) wine did to the stomach . They were quite high now , the ridged land opening and tumbling away invisible in the dark yet with the sense , the sensation of height and space ; by day he could have seen them , ridge on pine-dense ridge rollingaway to the east and the north in similitude of the actual mountains in Carolina and before that in Scotland where his ancestors had come from but he had n't seen yet , his breath coming a little short now and he could not only hear but feel too the hard short blasts from Highboy 's lungs as he was actually trying to run at this slope too even . carrying a rider and dragging two , Missp101Habersham steadying him , holding him down until they came out onto the true crest and Aleck Sander said once more ' Here ' and Miss Habersham turned the horse out of the road because he could still see nothing until they were off the road and only then he distinguished the clearing not because it was a clearing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canted a little where the earth had sunk , the narrow slab of a marble headstone . And he could hardly see the church ( weathered , unpainted , of wood and not much larger than a single room ) at all even when he led Highboy around behind it and tied the reins to a sapling and unsnapped the tie-rope from the bit and went back to where Miss Habersham and Aleck Sander were waiting . ' It 'll be the only fresh one , ' he said . ' Lucas said there has n't been a burying here since last winter . ' ' Yes , ' Miss Habersham said . ' The flowers too . Aleck Sander 's already found it . ' But to make sure ( he thought quietly , he did n't know to whom : I 'm going to make a heap more mistakes but do nt let this be one of them. ) he hooded the flashlight in his wadded handkerchief so that one thin rapid pencil touched for a second the raw mound with its meagre scattering of wreaths and bouquetsand even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , long enough to read the engraved name : Amanda Workitt wife of N .. B. Forrest Gowrie r878 1926 then snapped it off and again the darknesscame in and the strong scent of the pines and they stood for a moment beside the raw mound , doing nothing at all . ' I hate this , ' Miss Habersham said . ' You ai nt the one , ' Aleck Sander said . ' It 's just a half a mile back to the truck . Down hill too . '  |p102She  moved ; she was first . Move the flowers , ' she said . Carefully . Can you see ? ' ' Yessum , ' Aleck Sander said . ' Ai nt many . Looks like they throwed them at it too . ' But we wont , ' Miss Habersham said . Move them carefully . ' And it must be nearing eleven now ; they would not possibly have time ; Aleck Sander was right : the thing to do was to go back to the truck and drive away , back to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even to have time to think for having to keep on driving , steering , keeping the truck going in order to keep on moving , never to come back ; but then they had never had time , they had known that before they ever left Jefferson and he thought for an instant how if Aleck Sander really had meant it when he said he would not come and if he would have come alone in that case and then ( quickly ) he would n't think about that at all , Aleck Sander using the shovel for the first shift while he used the pick though the dirt was still so loose they did n't really need the pick ( and if it had n't been still loose they could n't have done it at all even by daylight ) ; two shovels would have done and faster too but it was too late for that now until suddenly Aleck Sander handed him the shovel and climbed out of the hole and vanished and ( not even using the flashlight ) with that same sense beyondsight and hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch was quicksand and which had discovered the horse or the mule coming down the hill a good minute before either he or Miss Habershamcould begin to hear it , returned with a short light board so that both of them had shovels now and he could hear the chuck ! and then the faint swish as Aleck Sander thrust the board into the dirt and then flung thep103load up and outward , expelling his breath , saying ' Hall ! ' each time  --  a sound furious raging and restrained , going faster and faster until the ejaculation was almost as rapid as the beat of someone running : Hall ! . . . Hah ! ... Hah ! ' so that he said over his shoulder : Take it easy . We 're doing all right : ' straightened his own back for a moment to mop his sweating face and seeing as always Miss Habersham in motionless silhouette on the sky above him in the straight cotton dress and the round hat on the exact top of her head such as few people had seen in fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a halfway rifled grave : more than halfwaybecause spading again he heard the sudden thud of wood on wood , then Aleck Sander said sharply : Go on . Get out of here and gim me room : ' and flung the board up and out and took , jerked the shovel from his hands and he climbed out of the pit and even as he stooped groping Miss Habersham handed him the coiled tie-rope . ' The flashlight too , ' he said and she handed him that and he stood too while the strong hard immobile flow of the pines bleached the sweat from his body until his wet shirt felt cold on his flesh and invisible below him in the pit the shovel rasped and scraped on wood , and stooping and hooding the light again he flashed it downwardupon the unpainted lid of the pine box and switched it off . All right , ' he said . That 's enough . Get out : ' and Aleck Sander with the last shovel of dirt released the shovel too , flinging the whole thing arcing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one motion , and carrying the rope and the light he dropped into the pit and only then remembered he would need a hammer ,  | crowbar  --  something to open the lid with and the only thing of that nature would be what Miss Habersham might happen to have in the truck a half-mile away and the walk back uphill , stooping to feel , examine the catch or whatever it was to be forced when he discovered that the lid was not fastened at all : so that straddling it , balancing himself on one foot he managed to open the lid up and back and prop it with one elbow while he shook the rope out and found the end and snapped on the flashlight and pointed it down and then said , Wait . ' He said , Wait . ' He was still saying Wait ' when he finally heard Miss Habersham speaking in a hissing whisper : Charles Charles . ' This ai nt Vinson Gowrie , ' he said . This man 's name is Montgomery . He 's some kind of a shoestring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FILL THE HOLE back up of course and besides he had the horse . But even then it was a good while until daylight when he left Highboy with Aleck Sander at the pasture gate and tried remembered to tiptoe into the house but at once his mother her hair loose and in her nightdress wailed from right beside the front door : Where have you been ? ' then followed him to his uncle 's door and then while his uncle was putting some clothes on : You ? Digging up a grave ? ' and he with a sort of weary indefatigable patience , just about worn out himself now from riding and digging then turning around and undigging and then riding again , somehow managing to stay that one jump ahead of what he had really never hoped to beat anyway : Aleck Sander and Miss Habersham helped : ' which if anything seemed to be worse though she was still not loud : just amazed and inexpugnable until his uncle came out fully dressed even to his necktie but not shaved and said , Now Maggie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back to the front door and this time she said  --  and he thought again how you could never really beat them because of their fluidity which was not just a capacity for mobility but a willingness to abandon with the substanceless promptitude of wind or air itself notp106only position but principle too ; you did n't have to marshalyour forces because you already had them : superior artillery , weight , right justice and precedent and usage and everything else and made your attack and cleared the field , swept all before you  --  or so you thought until you discovered that the enemy had not retreated at all but had already abandoned the field and had not merely abandoned the field but had usurped your very battlecry in the process ; you believed you had captured a citadel and instead found you had merely entered an untenable position and then found the unimpaired and even unmarkedbattle set up again in your unprotected and unsuspectingrear  --  she said : But he 's got to sleep ! He has n't even been to bed ! ' so that he actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Come on . What 's the matter with you ? Do nt you know she 's tougher than you and me both just as old Habershamwas tougher than you and Aleck Sander put totogether ; you might have gone out there without her to drag you by the hand but Aleck Sander would n't and I 'm still not so sure you would when you came right down to it . ' So he moved on too beside his uncle toward where Miss Habersham sat in the truck behind his uncle 's parked car ( it had been in the garage at nine oclock last night ; later when he had time he would remember to ask his uncle just where his mother had sent him to look for him ) . I take that back , ' his uncle said . ' Forget it . Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings and old ladies ' he paraphrased . Quite true , as a lot of truth often is , only a man just do nt like to have it flung in his teeth at three oclock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of course you cant ; shep107has already long since seen to that . Just remember that they can stand anything , accept any fact ( it 's only men who burk at facts ) provided they do nt have to face it ; can assimilate it with their heads turned away and one hand extended behind them as the politician accepts the bribe . Look at her : who will spend a long contented happy life never abating one jot of her refusal to forgive you for being able to button your own pants . ' And still a good while until daylight when his uncle stopped the car at the sheriff 's gate and led the way up the short walk and onto the rented gallery . ( Since he could n't succeed himself , although now in his third term the elapsed time covering Sheriff Hampton 's tenure was actually almost twice as long as the twelve years of his service . He was a countryman , a farmer and son of farmers when he was first elected and now owned himself the farm and house where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town during his term of office then returning to the farm which was his actual home at each expiration , to live there until he could run for  --  and be elected  --  sheriff again . ) I hope he 's not a heavy sleeper , ' Miss Habersham said . ' He ai nt asleep , ' his uncle said . He 's cooking break-fast . ' Cooking breakfast ? ' Miss Habersham said : and then he knew that , for all her flat back and the hat which had never shifted from the exact top of her head as though she kept it balanced there not by any pins but simply by the rigid unflagging poise of her neck as Negro women carry a whole family wash , she was about worn out with strain and lack of sleep too . He 's a country man , ' his uncle said . Any food he eats after daylight in the morning is dinner . Mrs. Hampton'sp108in Memphis with their daughter waiting for the baby and the only woman who 'll cook a man 's breakfast at half-past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to do it . She comes at a decent hour about eight oclock and washes the dishes . ' His uncle did n't knock . He started to open the door then stopped and looked back past both of them to where Aleck Sander stood at the bottom of the front steps . And do nt you think you 're going to get out of it just because your mama do nt vote , ' he told Aleck Sander . You come on too . ' Then his uncle opened the door and at once they smelled the coffee and the frying hogmeat , walking on linoleum toward a faint light at the rear of the hall then across a linoleum-floored diningroom in rented Grand Rapids mission into the kitchen , into the hard cheerful blast of a woodstove where the sheriff stood over a sputteringskillet in his undershirt and pants and socks , his braces dangling and his hair mussed and tousled with sleep like that of a ten-year-old boy , a battercake turner in one hand and a cuptowel in the other . The sheriff had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and he watched the little hard pale eyes flick from his uncle to Miss Habersham to himself and then to Aleck Sander and even then it was not the eyes which widened so much for that second but rather the little hard black pupils which had tightened in that one flick to pinpoints . But the sheriff said nothing yet , just looking at his uncle now and now even the little hard pupils seemed to expand again as when an expulsion of breath untightens the chest and while the three of them stood quietly and steadily watching the sheriff his uncle told it , rapid and condensed and succinct , from the moment in the jail last night when his uncle had realised that1p109Lucas had started to tell  --  or rather ask  --  him something , to the one when he had entered his uncle 's room ten minutes ago and waked him up , and stopped and again they watched the little hard eyes go flick . flick . slick . across their three faces then back to his uncle again , staring at his uncle for almost a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : You would n't come here at four oclock in the morning with a tale like that if it was n't so . ' You ai nt listening just to two sixteen-year-old children , ' his uncle said . ' I remind you that Miss Habersham was there . ' You do nt have to , ' the sheriff said . I have n't forgot it . I do nt think I ever will . ' Then the sheriff turned . A gigantic man and in the fifties too , you would n't think he could move fast and he did n't really seem to yet he had taken another skillet from a nail in the wall behind the stove and was already turning toward the table ( where for the first time he noticed , saw the side of smoked meat ) before he seemed to have moved at all , picking up a butcher knife from beside the meat before his uncle could even begin to speak : Have we got time for that ? You 've got to drive sixty miles to Harrisburg to the District Attorney ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you for witnesses to try and persuade him to originate a petition for the exhumation of Vinson Gowrie 's body The sheriff wiped the handle of the knife rapidly with the cuptowel . I thought you told me Vinson Gowrie ai nt in that grave . ' ' Officially he is , ' his uncle said . By the county records he is . And if you , living right here and knowing Miss Habersham and me all your political life , had to ask mep110twice , what do you think Jim Halladay is going to do ? Then you 've got to drive sixty miles back here with your witnesses and the petition and get Judge Maycox to issue an order The sheriff dropped the cuptowel onto the table . Have I ? ' he said mildly , almost inattentively : so that his uncle stopped perfectly still watching him as the sheriff turned from the table , the knife in his hand . Oh , ' his uncle said . I 've thought of something else too , ' the sheriff said . I 'm surprised you ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the sheriff . Then Aleck Sander  --  he was behind them all , not yet quite through the diningroomdoor into the kitchen  --  said in a voice as mild and impersonal as though he were reading off a slogan catchphraseadvertising some object he did n't own and never expected to want : It mought not a been a mule . It mought have been a horse . ' Maybe you 've thought of it now , ' the sheriff said . Oh , ' his uncle said . He said : Yes . ' But Miss Habershamwas already talking . She had given Aleck Sander one quick hard look but now she was looking at the sheriff again as quick and as hard . ' So do I , ' she said . And I think we deserve better than secrecy . ' I do too , Miss Eunice , ' the sheriff said . Except that the one that needs considering right now ai nt in this room . ' Oh , ' Miss Habersham said . She said Yes ' too .

She said : Cant he telephone to Harrisburg and have the District Attorney telephone back to Judge Maycox ? ' That 's what he doing now , ' Aleck Sander said . ' Tele-phoning . ' Maybe you 'd better go to the hall where you can overhear good what he 's saying , ' his uncle told Aleck Sander . Then his uncle looked at Miss Habersham again ; he too watched her slicing rapid slice after slice of the bacon as fast and even almost as a machine could have done it . Mr Hampton says we wont need any papers . We can attend to it ourselves without bothering Judge Maycox Miss Habersham released the knife . She did n't lay it down , she just opened her hand and in the same motion picked up the cuptowel and was wiping her hands as she turned from the table , crossing the kitchen toward112 INTRUDER IN TIDE DUSTp112them faster , a good deal faster than even the sheriff had moved . Then what are we wasting time here for ? ' she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' His uncle stepped quickly in front of her . We cant do anything in the dark , ' he said . We must wait for daylight . ' ' We did n't , ' Miss Habersham said . Then she stopped ; it was either that or walk over his uncle though his uncle did n't touch her , just standing between her and the door until she had to stop at least for the second for his uncle to get out of the way : and he looked at her too , straight , thin , almost shapeless in the straight cotton dress beneath the round exactitude of the hat and he thought She 's too old for this and then corrected it : No a woman a lady should n't have to do this and then remembered last night when he had left the office and walked across the back yard and whistled for Aleck Sander and he knew he had believed  --  and he still believed it  --  that he would have gone alone even if Aleck Sander had stuck to his refusal but it was only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he knew he was going to go through with it and he remembered again what old Ephraim had told him after they found the ring under the hog trough : If you got something outside  --  the common run that 's got to be done and cant wait , do nt waste your time on the menfolks ; they works on what your uncle calls the rules and the cases . Get the womens and the children at it ; they works on the circum- , stances . Then the hall door opened . He heard the sheriff cross the diningroom to the kitchen door . But the sheriff did n't enter the kitchen , stopping in the door , standing in it even after Miss Habersham said in a harsh , almost savage voice :  |p113Well  ? ' and he had n't put on his shoes nor even picked up the dangling galluses and he did n't seem to have heard Miss Habersham at all : just standing looming bulging in the door looking at Miss Habersham  --  not at the hat , not at her eyes nor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a string of letters in Russian or Chinese which someone you believed had just told you spelled your name , saying at last in a musing baffled voice : No : ' then turning his head to look at him and saying , It ai nt you neither : ' then turning his head further until he was looking at Aleck Sander while Aleck Sander slid his eyes up at the sheriff then slid them away again then slid them up again . You , ' the sheriff said . You 're the one . You went out there in the dark and helped dig up a dead man . Not only that , a dead white man that the rest of the white folks claimed another nigger had murdered . Why ? Was it because Miss Habersham made you ? ' Never nobody made me , ' Aleck Sander said . I did n't even know I was going . I had done already told Chick I did n't aim to . Only when we got to the truck everybodyseemed to just take it for granted I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knowed it I was n't . ' Mr Hampton , ' Miss Habersham said . Now the sheriff looked at her . He even heard her now . Have n't you finished slicing that meat yet ? ' he said . Give me the knife then . ' He took her by the arm , turningher back to the table . flint you done enough rushingand stewing around tonight to last you a while ? It 'll be daylight in fifteen minutes and folks do nt start lynchingsin daylight . They might finish one by daylight if they had a little trouble or bad luck and got behind with it . But they do nt start them by daylight because then they would have to see one another 's faces . How many can eat more than two eggs ? ' They left Aleck Sander with his breakfast at the kitchen table and carried theirs into the diningroom , he and his uncle and Miss Habersham carrying the platter of fried eggs and meat and the pan of biscuits baked last night and warmed again in the oven until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstrainedgrounds and the water had been boiling together until the sheriff had thought to remove the pot from the hot part of the stove ; four of them although the sheriff had set five places and they had barely sat down when the sheriff raised his head listening though he himself heard nothing , then rose and went into the dark hall and toward the rear of the house and then he heard the sound of the back door and presently the sheriff came back with Will Legate though minus the shotgun , and he turned his head enough to look out the window behind him and sure enough it was daylight . The sheriff served the plates while his uncle and Legate passed theirs and the sheriff 's cup to Miss Habershamat the coffeepot . Then at once he seemed to have been hearing for a long time the sheriff from a great distance saying ... boy . . . boy . . . ' then Wake hint up , Gavin . Let him eat his breakfast before he goes to sleep : ' and he jerked , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the same cup and he began to eat , chewing and even swallowing , risingand falling as though to the motion of the chewing along the deep soft bottomless mire of sleep , into thenp115out of the voices buzzing of old finished things no longer concern of his : the sheriff 's : Do you know Jake Montgomery , from over in CrossmanCounty ? Been in and out of town here for the last six months or so ? ' then Legate 's : Sure . A kind of jackleg timber buyer now . Used to run a place he called a restaurant just across the Tennesseeline out of Memphis , though I never heard of nobody trying to buy nothing that had to be chewed in it , until a man went and got killed in it one night twothreeyears ago . They never did know just how much Jake did or did n't have to do with it but the Tennessee police run him back across the Mississippi line just on principle . Since then I reckon he 's been laying around his pa 's farm over beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgot about that other business and he can set up again in another place on a highwaywith a hole under the floor big enough to hide a case of whiskey in . ' What was he doing around here ? ' the sheriff said : then Legate : Buying timber , ai nt he ? Ai nt him and Vinson Gowrie ' Then Legate said with the barest inflection , Was ? ' and then with no inflection at all : What is he doing ? ' and he this time , his own voice indifferent along the soft deep edge of sleep , too indifferent to bother if it were aloud or not : He ai nt doing anything now . ' But it was better afterward , out of the stale warm house again into the air , the morning , the sun in one soft high level golden wash in the highest tips of the trees , gilding the motionless obese uprush of the town water tank in spiderlegged elongate against the blue ,  |p116the  four of them in his uncle 's car once more while the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to a bright orange-and-yellow necktie , saying to his uncle : You run Miss Eunice home so she can get some sleep . I 'll pick you up at your house in say an hour --  " Miss Habersham in the front seat with his uncle said Pah . ' That was all . She did n't curse . She did n't need to . It was far more definite and final than just cursing . She leaned forward to look past his uncle at the sheriff . Get in your car and go to the jail or wherever you 'll go to get somebody to do the digging this time . We had to fill it up again because we knew you would n't believe it even yet unless you saw it there yourself . Go on , ' she said . We 'll meet you out there . Go on , ' she said . But the sheriff did n't move . He could hear him breathing , vast subterrene and deliberate , like sighing almost . Of course I do nt know about you , ' the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens to feed and nurse and water and a vegetable farm hardly five acres big to run , might not have nothing to do all day . But these boys anyway have got to go to school . Leastways I never heard about any rule in the School Board to give holidays for digging up corpses . ' And that even stopped her . But she did n't sit back yet . She still leaned forward where she could look past his uncle at the sheriff and he thought again She 's too old for this , to have to do this : only if she had n't then he and Aleck Sander , what she and his uncle and the sheriff all three and his mother and father and Paralee too would have called children , would have had to do it  --  not would have done it but would have had to do it to preserve not even justice and decency but innocence : and he thought of man who apparently had top117kill man not for motive or reason but simply for the sake the need the compulsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward so that he could still stand up among man as a rational creature : whoever had had to kill Vinson Gowrie had then to dig him up dead and slay another to put in his vacated grave so that whoever had to kill him could rest ; and Vinson Gowrie 's kin and neighbors who would have to kill Lucas or someone or anyone , it would not really matter who , so that they could lie down and breathe quiet and even grieve quiet and so rest . The sheriff 's voice was mild , almost gentle even : You go home . You and these boys have done fine . Likely you saved a life . Now you go home and let us attend to the rest of it . That wont be any place for a lady out there . ' But Miss Habersham was just stopped , nor even that for long : It was n't for a man either last night . ' Wait , Hope , ' his uncle said . Then his uncle turned to Miss Habersham . Your job 's in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? ' Now Miss Habersham watched his uncle . But she still had n't sat back in the seat , giving no ground to anyone yet ; watching , it was as though she had not at all exchanged one opponent for another but without pause or falter had accepted them both , asking no quarter , crying no odds . Will Legate 's a farmer , ' his uncle said . Besides being up all night . He 's got to go home and see to his own business for a little while . ' Has n't Mr Hampton got other deputies ? ' Miss Habershamsaid . What are they for ? ' They 're just men with guns , ' his uncle said . Legate himself told Chick and me last night that if enough men made up their minds and kept them made up , they would pass him and Mr Tubbs both in time . But if a woman , a lady , a white lady ' His uncle stopped ,  |p118ceased  ; they stared at each other ; watching them he thought again of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was last night , of course ; it seemed like years now ) ; again except for the fact that his uncle and Miss Habersham were actually looking into each other 's physicaleyes instead of bending each upon the other that absolute concentration of all the senses in the sum of which mere clumsy fallible perception weighed little more than the ability to read Sanskrit would , he might have been watching the last two stayers in a poker-pot. ... just to sit there , in sight , where the first one that passes can have the word spread long before Beat Four can even get the truck cranked up to start to town while we go out there and finish it for good , for ever Miss Habersham leaned slowly back until her back came against the seat . She said : ' So I 'm to sit there on that staircase with my skirts spread or maybe better with my back against the balustrade and one foot propped against the wall of Mrs Tubbs ' kitchen while you men who never had time yesterday to ask that old nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy , a child ' His uncle said nothing . The sheriff leanedabove the window breathing vast subterranean sighs , not breathing hard but just as a big man seems to have to breathe . Miss Habersham said : Drive me home first . I 've got some mending to do . I ai nt going to sit there all morningdoing nothing so that Mrs Tubbs will think she has to talk to me . Drive me home first . I realised an hour ago what a rush and hurry you and Mr Hampton are in but you can spare the time for that . Aleck Sander can bring my truck to the jail on his way to school and leave it in front of the gate . ' Yessum , ' his uncle said.  |p119SO  THEY DROVE Miss Habersham home , out to the edge of town and through the shaggy untended cedar grove to the paintless columned portico where she got out and went into the house and apparently on through it without even stopping because at once they could hear her somewhere in the back yelling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother and Lucas ' brother-in-law  --  in her strong voice strained and a little high from sleeplessness and fatigue , then she came out again carrying a big cardboard box full of what looked like unironed laundry and long limp webs and ropes of stockings and got back into the car and they drove back to the Square through the fresh quiet morning streets : the old big decaying wooden houses of Jefferson 's longagofoundation set like Miss Habersham 's deep in shaggy untended lawns of old trees and rootbound scented and flowering shrubs whose very names most people under fifty no longer knew and which even when children lived in them seemed still to be spellbound by the shades of women , old women still spinsters and widows waiting even seventy-five years later for the slow telegraph to bring them news of Tennessee and Virginia and Pennsylvaniabattles , which no longer even faced the street but peered at it over the day-after-tomorrow shoulders of the neat small new one-storey houses designed in Floridap120and California set with matching garages in their neat plots of clipped grass and tedious flowerbeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what twenty-five years ago had been considered a little small for one decent front lawn , where the prosperous young married couples lived with two children each and ( as soon as they could afford it ) an automobile each and the memberships in the country club/and the bridge clubs and the junior rotary and chamber of commerce and the patented electricgadgets for cooking and freezing and cleaning and the neat trim colored maids in frilled caps to run them and talk to one another over the telephone from house to house while the wives in sandals and pants and painted toenails puffed lipstick-stained cigarettes over shopping bags in the chain groceries and drugstores . Or would have been and should have been ; Sunday and they might have passed , accepted a day with no one to plug and unplug the humming sweepers and turn the buttons on the stoves as a day off a vacation or maybe an occasion like a baptising or a picnic or a big funeral but this was Monday , a new day and a new week , rest and the need to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and husband and father for store or office or to stand around the Western Union desk where the hourly cotton reports came in ; breakfast must be forward and the pandemoniac bustle of exodus yet still no Negro had they seen  --  the young ones with straightened hair and makeup in the bright trig tomorrow'sclothes from the mailorder houses who would not even put on the Harper 's Bazaar caps and aprons until they were inside the white kitchens and the older ones in the ankle-length homemade calico and gingham who wore the long plain homemade aprons all the time sop121that they were no longer a symbol but a garment , not even the men who should have been mowing the lawns and clipping the hedges ; not even ( crossing the Square now ) the street department crews who should have been flushing the pavement with hoses and sweeping up the discarded Sunday papers and empty cigarette packs ; across the Square and on to the jail where his uncle got out too and went up the walk with Miss Habersham and up the steps and through the still-open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still propped against the wall and he heaved himself bodily again out of the long soft timeless rushing black of sleep to find as usual that no time had passed , his uncle still putting his hat back on and turning to come back down the walk to the car . Then they stopped at home , Aleck Sander already out of the car and gone around the side of the house and vanished and he said , ' No . ' Yes , ' his uncle said . You 've got to go to school . Or better still , to bed and to sleep .  --  Yes , ' his uncle said suddenly : and Aleck Sander too . He must stay at home today too . Because this must n't be talked about , not one word about it until we have finished it . You understand that . ' But he was n't listening , he and his uncle were not even talking about the same thing , not even when he said ' No ' again and his uncle out of the car and already turningtoward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him for a good long moment and then said , ' We are going at this a little hindpart-before , ai nt we ? I 'm the one who should be asking you if I can go . ' Becausehe was thinking about his mother , not just remem/bered about her because he had done that as soon as they crossed the Square five minutes ago and the simplest thing would have been to get out of his uncle 's car there and go and get in the sheriff 's car and simply stay in it until they were ready to go back out to the church and he had probably thought about it at the time and would even have done it probably if he had n't been so worn out and anticlimaxed and dull for sleep and he knew he could n't cope with her this time even if he had been completelyfresh ; the very fact that he had already done it twice in eleven hours , once by secrecy and once by sheer surprise and rapidity of movement and of mass , but doomed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle 's naive and childlike rationalising about school and bed when faced with that fluid and implacableattack , when once more his uncle read his mind , standing beside the car and looking down at him for another moment with compassion and no hope even though he was a bachelor of fifty thirty-five years free of woman 's dominion , his uncle too knowing remembering how she would use the excuses of his education and his physical exhaustion only less quicker than she would have discarded them ; who would listen no more to rationalreasons for his staying at home than for  --  civic duty or simple justice or humanity or to save a life or even the peace of his own immortal soul  --  his going . His uncle said : All right . Come on . I 'll talk to her . ' He moved , getting out ; he said suddenly and quietly , in amazement not at despair of hope but at how much hopelessness you could really stand : You 're just my uncle . ' I 'm worse than that , ' his uncle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle read his mind again : ' All right . I 'll try to talk to Paralee too . The same condition obtains there ; motherhood does n't seem to have any pigment in its skin . ' And his uncle too was probably thinking how you not only could n't beat them , you could n't even find the battlefield in time to admit defeat before they had moved it again ; he remembered , it was two years ago now , he had finally made the high school football team or that is he had won or been chosen for one of the positions to make an out-of-town trip because the regular player had been injured in practice or fallen behind in his grades or maybe his mother either would n't let him go , something , he had forgotten exactly what because he had been too busy all that Thursday and Friday racking his brains in vain to think how to tell his mother he was going to Mottstown to play on the regular team , right up to the last minute when he had to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his father happened to be present ( though he really had n't calculated it that way  --  not that he would n't have if he had n't been too worried and perplexed with a blending of anger and shame and shame at being angry and ashamed ( ( crying at her at one point : Is it the team 's fault that I 'm the only child you 've got ? ' ) ) to think of it ) and left that Fridayafternoon with the team feeling as he imagined a soldier might feel wrenching out of his mother 's restrainingarms to go fight a battle for some shameful cause ; she would grieve for him of course if he fell and she would even look on his face again if he did n't but there would be always ineradicable between them the ancient green and perennial adumbration : so that all that Friday night trying to go to sleep in a strange bed and all thep124next forenoon too waiting for the game to start he thought better for the team if he had not come since he probably had too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the first whistle blew and on and afterwarduntil bottom-most beneath the piled mass of both teams , the ball clutched to his chest and his mouth and nostrils both full of the splashed dried whitewash markingthe goal line he heard and recognised above all the others that one voice shrill triumphant and bloodthirsty and picked up at last and the wind thumped back into him he saw her foremost in the crowd not sitting in the grandstand but among the ones trotting and even runningup and down the sideline following each play , then in the car that evening on the way back to Jefferson , himself in the front seat beside the hired driver and his mother and three of the other players in the back and her voice as proud and serene and pitiless as his own could have been : Does your arm still hurt ?

Go back and finish your breakfast . Paralee is n't feeling well this morning and she does n't want to be all day getting dinner ready : ' then to him  --  the fond constant familiar face which he had known all his lifep125and therefore could neither have described it so that a stranger could recognise it nor recognise it himself from anyone 's description but only brisk calm and even a little inattentive now , the wail a wail only because of the ancient used habit of its verbiage : You have n't washed your face : ' nor even pausing to see if he followed , on up the stairs and into the bathroom , even turning on the tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towel open and waiting , the familiar face wearingthe familiar expression of amazement and protest and anxiety and invincible repudiation which it had worn all his life each time he had done anything removing him one more step from infancy , from childhood : when his uncle had given him the Shetland pony someone had taught to take eighteen- and twenty-four-inch jumps and when his father had given him the first actual powdershootinggun and the afternoon when the groom deliveredHighboy in the truck and he got up for the first time and Highboy stood on his hind legs and her scream and the groom 's calm voice saying , Hit him hard over the head when he does that . You do nt want him falling over backward on you ' but the muscles merely falling into the old expression through inattention and long usage as her voice had merely chosen by inattention and usage the long-worn verbiage of wailing because there was something else in it now  --  the same thing which had been there in the car that afternoon when she said , Your arm does n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other afternoon when his father came home and found him jumping Highboy over the concrete watertrough in the lot , his mother leaning on the fence watching and his father 's fury of relief and anger and his mother 's calm , voice this time : Why not ?

You cant go ! ' then even dull for sleep realising the fatuous naivete of anyone using cant to her on any subjectand so playing his last desperate card : ' If you go , then I wont ! You hear me ?

Do nt you ever again ' Because you would n't have believed him either , ' his uncle said coming in from the hall . ' You would n't have listened either . It took an old woman and two children for that , to believe truth for no other reason than that it was truth , told by an old man in a fix deserving pity and belief , to someone capable of the pity even when none of them really believed him . Which you did n't at first , ' his uncle said to him . ' When did you really begin to believe him ? When you opened the coffin , was n't it ? I want to know , you see . Maybe I 'm not too old to learn either . When was it ? ' ' I do nt know , ' he said . Because he did n't know . It seemed to him that he had known all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never really believed Lucas . Then it seemed to him that it had never happened at all , heaving himself once more with no movement up out of the long deep slough of sleep but at least to somep127elapse of time now , he had gained that much anyway , maybe enough to be safe on for a while like the tablets night truck drivers took not as big hardly as a shirt buttonyet in which were concentrated enough wakefulness to reach the next town because his mother was in the room now brisk and calm , setting the cup of coffee down in front of him in a way that if Paralee had done it she would have said that Paralee had slopped it at him : which , the coffee , was why neither his father nor his uncle had even looked at her , his father on the contrary exclaiming , Coffee ? What the devil is this ? I thought the agreementwas when you finally consented for Gavin to buy that horse that he would neither ask for nor even accept a spoonful of coffee until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even listening , with the same hand and in the same manner half shoving and half popping the cream pitcher then the sugar bowl into his reach and already turning back toward the kitchen , her voice not really hurried and impatient : just brisk : Drink it now . We 're already late : ' and now they looked at her for the first time : dressed , even to her hat , with in the crook of her other arm the straw basket out of which she had darned his and his father 's and his uncle 's socks and stockings ever since he could remember , though his uncle at first saw only the hat and for a moment seemed to join him in the same horrified surprise he had felt in the bathroom . Maggie ! ' his uncle said . You cant ! Charley ' I do nt intend to , ' his mother said , not even stopping . This time you men will have to do the digging . I 'm going to the jail : ' already in the kitchen now and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let Miss Haber/sham sit there by herself with the whole county gawking at her . As soon as I help Paralee plan dinner we'll --  but not dying fading : ceasing , quitting : since she had dismissed them though his father still tried once more : He 's got to go to school . ' But even his uncle did n't listen . You can drive Miss Eunice 's truck , cant you ? ' his uncle said . There wont be a Negro school today for Aleck Sander to be going to so he can leave it at the jail . And even if there was I doubt if Paralee 's going to let him cross the front yard inside the next week . ' Then his uncle seemed even to have heard his father or at least decided to answer him . Nor any white school either for that matter if this boy had n't listened to Lucas , which I would n't , and to Miss Habersham , which I did n't . Well ? ' his uncle said . Can you stay awake that long ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . ' Yes sir , ' he said . So he drank the coffee which the soap and water and hard toweling had unfogged him enough to know he did n't like and did n't want but not enough for him to choose what simple thing to do about it : that is not drink it : tasting sipping then adding more sugar to it until each  --  coffee and sugar  --  ceased to be either and became a sickish quinine sweet amalgam of the worst of both until his uncle said , ' Dammit , stop that , ' and got up and went to the kitchen and returned with a saucepan of heated milk and a soup bowl and dumped the coffee into the bowl and poured the hot milk into it and said , Go on . Forget about it . Just drink it . ' So he did , from the bowl in both hands like water from a gourd , hardly tasting it and still his father flung a little back in his chair looking at him and talking , asking him just how scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleck Sander only his vanity would n't allow him to show it before a darky and to tell the truth now , neither of them would have touched the grave in the dark even enough to lift the flowers off of it if Miss Habersham had n't driven them at it : his uncle interrupting : Aleck Sander even told you then that the grave had already been disturbed by someone in a hurry , did n't he ? ' Yes sir , ' he said and his uncle said : Do you know what I 'm thinking now ? ' No sir , ' he said . I 'm being glad Aleck Sander could n't completely penetrate darkness and call out the name of the man who came down the hill carrying something in front of him on the mule . ' And he remembered that : the three of them all thinking it but not one of them saying it : just standing invisible to one another above the pit 's invisible inky yawn .

They did , the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it came up though it seemed forever in the thin starlightfilled with the constant sound of the windless pines like one vast abateless hum not of amazement but of attention , watching , curiosity ; amoral , detached , not involvedand missing nothing .

You and Aleck Sander --  " We 'll all go , ' Miss Habersham said . So they gatheredup the tools and the rope ( nor did they use the flashlightagain ) and Aleck Sander said Wait ' and found by touchp130the board he had used for a shovel and carried that until he could push it back under the church and he untied Highboy and held the stirrup but Miss Habersham said , No .

I do nt know anything else to do . ' Maybe we all ought to walk in the middle , ' he said , loud , too loud , twice louder than he had intended or even thought ; it should carry for miles especially over a whole countryside already hopelessly waked and alerted by the sleepless sibilant what Paralee probably and old Ephraim certainly and Lucas too would call miration ' of the pines .

'  |p131'How  can you keep on standing in front of us if we do nt stay together ? ' he said . And this time she did n't even say This is all I can think of to do but just stood there so that Aleck Sander walked past her and on into the bushes and started the truck and backed it out and swung it to point down the hill , the engine running but no lights yet and she said , ' Tie the reins up and let him go .

' We will come back and get him as soon as we have seen your uncle and Mr Hampton --  " ' Then we can all watch him ride down the road with maybe a horse or the mule in front of him too , ' Aleck Sander said . He raced the engine then let it idle again . ' Come on , get in . He 's either here watching us or he ai nt and if he ai nt we 're all right and if he is he 's done waited too late now when he let us get back to the truck . ' ' Then you ride right behind the truck , ' she said . ' We 'll go slow ' Nome , ' Aleck Sander said ; he leaned out . ' Get started ; we 're going to have to wait for you anyway when we get to town . ' So  --  he needed no urging  --  he let Highboy down the hill , only holding his head up ; the truck 's lights came on and it moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the highroad Highboy was already trying to run but he checked him back and up onto the highroad , the lights of the truck fanning up and out as it came down onto the flat then he slacked the curb , Highboy beginning to run , clashing the snaffle as always , thinking as always that one more champing regurg would get it forwardenough to get his teeth on it , running now when the truck lights swung up onto the highroad too , his feet in eight hollow beats on the bridge and he leaned into the dark hard wind and let him go , the truck lights not even in sight during the full half-mile until he slowed him into the long reaching hard road-gait and almost a mile then before the truck overtook and then passed and the ruby tail-lamp drew on and away and then was gone but at least lie was out of the pines , free of that looming down-watching sibilance uncaring and missing nothing saying to the whole circumambience : Look . Look : but then they were still saying it somewhere and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four , Gowries and Ingrums and Workitts and Frasers and all to have heard it by this time so he would n't think about that and so he stopped thinking about it now , all in the same flash in which he had remembered it , swallowing the last swallow from the bowl and setting it down as his father more or less plunged up from the table , clatteringhis chairlegs back across the floor , saying : Maybe I better go to work . Somebody 'll have to earn a little bread around here while the rest of you are playingcops and robbers : ' and went out and apparently the coffee had done something to what he called his thinkingprocesses or anyway the processes of what people called thinking because now he knew the why for his father too  --  the rage which was relief after the event which had to express itself some way and chose anger not because he would have forbidden him to go but because he had had no chance to , the pseudo-scornful humorous impugnment of his and Aleck Sander 's couragewhich blinked not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did at Miss Habersham 's will ,  --  in fact the whole heavyhanded aspersion of the whole thing by re/ducing it to the terms of a kind of kindergarten witchhunt : which was probably merely the masculine form of refusing also to believe that he was what his uncle called big enough to button his pants and so he dismissed his father , hearing his mother about to emerge from the kitchen and pushing his chair back and getting up himself when suddenly he was thinking how coffee was already a good deal more than he had known but nobody had warned him that it produced illusions like cocaine or opium : seeing watching his father 's noise and uproar flick and vanish away like blown smoke or mist , not merely revealing but exposing the man who had begot him looking back at him from beyond the bridgelessabyss of that begetting not with just pride but with envy too ; it was his uncle 's abnegant and rhetorical selflaceratingwhich was the phony one and his father was gnawing the true bitter irremediable bone of all which was dismatchment with time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself sixteen and gallop a horse ten miles in the dark to save an old nigger 's insolent and friendless neck . But at least he was awake . The coffee had accomplished that anyway . He still needed to doze only now he could n't ; the desire to sleep was there but it was wakefulnessnow he would have to combat and abate . It was after eight now ; one of the county schoolbusses passed as he prepared to drive Miss Habersham 's truck away from the curb and the street would be full of children too fresh for Monday morning with books and paper bags of recess-time lunches and behind the schoolbus was a string of cars and trucks stained with country mud and dust so constant and unbroken that his uncle and his mother would already have reached the jail before he ever managed to cut into it because Monday was stock-auction day at the sales barns behind the Square and he could see them , the empty cars and trucks rank on dense rank along the courthouse curb like shoats at a feed-trough and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Square and along the alley to the sales barns to chew tobacco and unlighted cigars from pen to pen amid the ammonia-reek of manure and liniment and the bawling of calves and the stamp and sneeze of horses and mules and the secondhand wagons and plow gear and guns and harness and watches and only the women ( what few of them that is since stock-sale day unlike Saturday was a man 's time ) remained about the Square and the stores so that the Square itself would be empty except for the parked cars and trucks until the men would come back for an hour at noon to meet them at the cafes and restaurants . Whereupon this time he jerked himself , no reflex now , not even out of sleep but illusion , who had carried hypnosisright out of the house with him even into the bright strong sun of day , even driving the pickup truck which before last night he would not even have recognisedyet which since last night had become as inexpugnablea part of his memory and experience and breathing as hiss of shovelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine box would ever be , through a mirage-vacuum in which not simply last night had not happened but there had been no Saturday either , remembering now as if he had only this moment seen it that there had been no children in the schoolbus but only grown people and in the stream of cars and trucks following it and now following him where he had finally cut in , a few ofp135which even on stock-auction Monday ( on Saturday half of the flat open beds would have been jammed and packed with them , men women and children in the cheap meagre finery in which they came to town ) should have carried Negroes , there had not been one dark face . Nor one school-bound child on the street although he had heard without listening enough of his uncle at the telephone to know that the superintendent had called whether to have school today or not and his uncle had told him yes , and in sight of the Square now he could see already three more of the yellow busses supposed and intended to bring the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays and holidays into pay-passenger transport and then the Square itself , the parked cars and trucks as alwaysas should be but the Square itself anything but empty : no exodus of men toward the stock pens nor women into the stores so that as he drove the pickup into the curb behind his uncle 's car he could see already where visible and sense where not a moil and mass of movement , one dense pulse and hum filling the Square as when the crowd overflows the carnival midway or the football field , flowing into the street and already massed along the side opposite to the jail until the head of it had already passed the blacksmith 's where he had stood yesterday trying to be invisible as if they were waiting for a parade to pass ( and almost in the middle of the street so that the still unbroken stream of cars and trucks had to detour around them a clump of a dozen or so more like the group in a reviewing stand in whose center in its turn he recognized the badged official cap of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in front of the schoolhouse holding up traffic for childrenp136to cross the street and he did not have to remember that the marshal 's name was Ingrum , a Beat Four Ingrum come to town as the apostate sons of Beat Four occasionallydid to marry a town girl and become barbers and bailiffs and nightwatchmen as petty Germanic princelingswould come down out of their Brandenburg hills to marry the heiresses to European thrones )  --  the men and the women and not one child , the weathered countryfaces and sunburned necks and backs of hands , the clean faded tieless earthcolored shirts and pants and print cotton dresses thronging the Square and the street as though the stores themselves were closed and locked , not even staring yet at the blank front of the jail and the single barred window which had been empty and silent too for going on forty-eight hours now but just gathering , condensing , not expectant nor in anticipation nor even attentive yet but merely in that preliminary settling down like the before-curtain in a theatre : and he thought that was it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned upside down : and suddenly he realised that he had been completely wrong ; it was not Saturday which had never happened but only last night which to them had not happened yet , that not only they did n't know about last night but there was nobody , not even Hampton , who could have told them because they would have refused to believe him ; whereupon something like a skim or a veil like that which crosses a chicken 's eye and which he had not even known was there went flick ! from his own and he saw them for the first time  --  the same weathered still almost inattentive faces and the same faded clean cotton shirts and pants and dresses but no crowd now waiting for the curtain to rise on a stage 's illusion but rather the one in thep137courtroom waiting for the sheriff 's officer to cry Oyez Oyez Oyez This honorable court ; not even impatient because the moment had not even come yet to sit in judgment not on Lucas Beauchamp , they had already condemned him but on Beat Four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even retribution exacted but to see that Beat Four should not fail its white man 's high estate . So that he had stopped the truck was out and had already started to run when he stopped himself : somethingof dignity something of pride remembering last night when he had instigated and in a way led and anywayaccompanied the stroke which not one of the responsibleelders but had failed even to recognise its value , let alone its need , and something of caution too remembering how his uncle had said almost nothing was enough to put a mob in motion so perhaps even a child running toward the jail would have been enough : then he remembered again the faces myriad yet curiously identical in their lack of individual identity , their completerelinquishment of individual identity into one We not even impatient , not even hurryable , almost gala in its complete obliviousness of its own menace , not to be stampeded by a hundred running children : and then in the same flash the obverse : not to be halted or deflected by a hundred times a hundred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still only an intention and then its physical imponderability when it entered accomplishment he now recognised the enormityof what he had blindly meddled with and that his first instinctive impulse  --  to run home and fling saddle and bridle on the horse and ride as the crow flies into the last stagger of exhaustion and then sleep and then return after it was all over  --  had been the right one ( who now simply because he happened not to be an orphan had not even that escape ) because it seemed to him now that he was responsible for having brought into the light and glare of day something shocking and shameful out of the whole white foundation of the county which he himself must partake of too since he too was bred of it , which otherwise might have flared and blazed merely out of Beat Four and then vanished back into its darkness or at least invisibility with the fading embers of Lucas ' crucifixion . But it was too late now , he could n't even repudiate , relinquish , run : the jail door still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the chair Legate had sat in , the cardboard box on the floor at her feet and a garment of some sort across her lap ; she was still wearing the hat and he could see the steady motion of her hand and elbow and it seemed to him he could even see the flash and flick of the needle in her hand though he knew the could not at this distance ; but his uncle was in the way so he had to move further along the walk but at that moment his uncle turned and came out the door and recrossed the veranda and then he could see her too in the second chair beside Miss Habersham ; a car drew up to the curb behind him and stopped and now without haste she chose a sock from the basket and slipped the darningegg into it ; she even had the needle already threaded stuck in the front of her dress and now he could distinguish the flash and glint of it and maybe that was because he knew so well the motion , the narrowfamiliar suppleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least no man could have disputedhim that it was his sock.  |p139'Who  's that ? ' the sheriff said behind him . He turned . The sheriff sat behind the wheel of his car , his neck and shoulders bowed and hunched so he could peer out below the top of the window-frame . The engine was still running and he saw in the back of the car the handles of two shovels and the pick too which they would not need and on the back seat quiet and motionless save for the steady glint and blink of their eyewhites , two Negroes in blue jumpers and the soiled black-ringed convict pants which the street gangs wore . ' Who would it be ? ' his uncle said behind him too but he did n't turn this time nor did he even listen further because three men came suddenly out of the street and stopped beside the car and as he watched five or six more came up and in another moment the whole crowd would begin to flow across the street ; already a passing car had braked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first to keep from running over them and then for its occupants to lean out looking at the sheriff 's car where the first man to reach it had already stooped to peer into it , his brown farmer 's hands grasping the edge of the open window , his brown weathered face thrust into the car curious divinant and abashless while behind him his massed duplicates in their felt hats and sweatstainedpanamas listened . ' What you up to , Hope ? ' the man said . ' Do nt you know the Grand Jury 'll get you , wasting county money this way ? Ai nt you heard about that new lynch law the Yankees passed ? the folks that lynches the nigger is supposedto dig the grave ? ' ' Maybe he 's taking them shovels out there for Nub Gowrie and them boys of his to practice with , ' the second said.  | Then it 's a good thing Hope 's taking shovel hands too , ' the third said . ' If he 's depending on anybody named Gowrie to dig a hole or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll sure need them . ' Or maybe they ai nt shovel hands , ' the fourth said . Maybe it 's them the Gowries are going to practice on . ' Yet even though one guffawed they were not laughing , more than a dozen now crowded around the car to take one quick allcomprehensive glance into the back of it where the two Negroes sat immobile as carved wood ' staring straight ahead at nothing and no movement even of breathing other than an infinitesimal widening and closing of the whites around their eyeballs , then looking at the sheriff again with almost exactly the expression he had seen on the faces waiting for the spinning tapes behind a slot machine 's glass to stop . I reckon that 'll do , ' the sheriff said . He thrust his head and one vast arm out the window and with the arm pushed the nearest ones back and away from the car as effortlessly as he would have opened a curtain , raising his voice but not much : Willy . ' The marshal came up ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the high sheriff 's got on his mind this morning . ' Why do nt you get these folks out of the street so them cars can get to town ? ' the sheriff said . Maybe they want to stand around and look at the jail too . ' You bet , ' the marshal said . He turned , shoving his hands at the nearest ones , not touching them , as if he were putting into motion a herd of cattle . Now boys , ' he said . They did n't move , looking past the marshal still at the sheriff , not at all defiant , not really daring anyone : just tolerant , goodhumored. debonair almost.  |p141'Why  , Sheriff , ' a voice said , then another : ' It 's a free street , ai nt it , Sheriff ? You town folks wont mind us just standing on it long as we spend our money with you , will you ? ' ' But not to block off the other folks trying to get to town to spend a little , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of the street , Willy . ' ' Come on , boys , ' the marshal said . ' There 's other folks besides you wants to get up where they can watch them bricks . ' They moved then but still without haste , the marshal herding them back across the street like a woman driving a flock of hens across a pen , she to control merely the direction not the speed and not too much of that , the fowls moving ahead of her flapping apron not recalcitrant , just unpredictable , fearless of her and not yet even alarmed ; the halted car and the ones behind it moved too , slowly , dragging at creeping pace their loads of craned faces ; he could hear the marshal shouting at the drivers : ' Get on . Get on . There 's cars behind you The sheriff was looking at his uncle again . ' Where 's the other one ? ' ' The other what ? ' his uncle said . ' The other detective . The one that can see in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You want him too ? ' ' No , ' the sheriff said . ' I just missed him . I was just surprised to find one human in this county with taste and judgment enough to stay at home today . You ready ? Let 's get started . ' ' Right , ' his uncle said . The sheriff was notorious as a driver who used up a car a year as a heavy-handed sweeper wears out brooms : not by speed but by simple friction ; now the car actually shot away from the curb and almost before he could watch it , was gone . His unclep142went to theirs and opened the door . Jump in , ' his uncle said . Then he said it ; at least this much was simple : I 'm not going . ' His uncle paused and now he saw watching him the quizzical saturnine face , the quizzical eyes which given a little time did n't miss much ; had in fact as long as he had known them never missed anything until last night . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course a lady but this other female is yours . ' Look at them , ' he said , not moving , barely moving his lips even . Across the street . On the Square too and nobodybut Willy Ingrum and that damn cap Did n't you hear them talking to Hampton ? ' his uncle said . ' I heard them , ' he said . They were not even laughing at their own jokes . They were laughing at him . ' They were not even taunting him , ' his uncle said . They were not even jeering at him . They were just watching him . Watching him and Beat Four , to see what would happen . These people just came to town to see what either or both of them are going to do . ' ' No , ' he said . More than that . ' All right , ' his uncle said , quite soberly too now . Granted . Then what ? ' Suppose ' But his uncle interrupted : Suppose Beat Four comes in and picks up your mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard where they 'll be out of the way ? Lucas ai nt in that cell . He 's in Mr Hampton 's house , probably sitting in the kitchen right now eating his breakfast . What did you think Will Legate was doing coming in by the back door within fifteen minutes of when we gotp143there and told Mr Hampton ? Aleck Sander even heard him telephoning . ' Then what 's Mr Hampton in such a hurry for ? ' he said : and his uncle 's voice was quite sober now : but just sober , that was all : Because the best way to stop having to suppose or deny either is for us to get out there and do what we have to do and get back here . Jump in the car . '  |p144THEY  NEVER SAW the sheriff 's car again until they reached the church . Nor for him was the reason sleep who in spite of the coffee might have expected that and in fact had . Up to the moment when at the wheel of the pickup he had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people lining the opposite side of the street in front of the jail he had expected that as soon as he and his uncle were on the road back to the church , coffee or no coffee he would not even be once more fightingsleep but on the contrary would relinquish and accept it and so in the nine miles of gravel and the one of climbing dirt regain at least a half-hour of the eight he had lost last night and  --  it seemed to him now  --  the three or four times that many he had spent trying to quit thinking about Lucas Beauchamp the night before . And when they reached town a little before three this morning nobody could have persuaded him that by this time , almost nine oclock , he would not have made back at least five and a half hours of sleep even if not the full six , remembering how he  --  and without doubt Miss Habersham and Aleck Sander too  --  had believed that as soon as they and his uncle entered the sheriff 's house that would be all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sheriff 's broad competent ordained palm as you drop your hat on the hall table in passing , the1p145whole night 's nightmare of doubt and indecision and sleeplessness and strain and fatigue and shock and amazementand ( he admitted it ) some of fear too . But it had n't happened and he knew now that he had never really expected it to ; the idea had ever entered their heads only because they had been worn out , spent not so much from sleeplessness and fatigue and strain as exhausted by shock and amazement and anticlimax ; he had not even needed the massed faces watching the blank brick front of the jail nor the ones which had crossed the street and even blocked it while they crowded around the sheriff 's car , to read and then dismiss its interior with that one mutual concordant glance comprehensive abashless trustlessand undeniable as the busy parent pauses for an instant to check over and anticipate the intentions of a loved though not too reliable child . If he needed anythinghe certainly had that  --  the faces the voices not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without pity  --  poised under the first relaxation of succumbence like a pin in the mattress so he was as wide awake as his uncle even who had slept all night or at least most of it , free of town now and going fast now , passing within the first mile the last of the cars and trucks and then no more of them because all who would come to town today would by this time be inside that last rapidly contracting mile  --  the whole white part of the county taking advantage of the good weather and the good allweather roads which were their roads because their taxes and votes and the votes of their kin and connectionswho could bring pressure on the congressmen who had the giving away of the funds had built them , to get quickly into the town which was theirs too since it existed only by their sufferance and support to contain their jail and their courthouse , to crowd and jam and block its streets too if they saw fit : patient biding and unpitying , neither to be hurried nor checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer too ; theirs the affronter and the principle affronted : the white man and the bereavement of his vacancy , theirs the right not just to mere justice but vengeance too to allot or withhold . They were going quite fast now , faster than he could ever remember his uncle driving , out the long road where he had ridden last night on the horse but in daylightnow , morning 's bland ineffable May ; now he could see the white bursts of dogwood in the hedgerows markingthe old section-line surveys or standing like nuns in the cloistral patches and bands of greening woods and the pink and white of peach and pear and the pinkwhite of the first apple trees in the orchards which last night he had only smelled : and always beyond and around them the enduring land  --  the fields geometric with furrows where corn had been planted when the first doves began to call in late March and April , and cotton when the first whippoorwills cried at night around the beginning of May a week ago : but empty , vacant of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke rose because breakfast was long over by now and no dinner to be cooked where none would be home to eat it , the paintless Negro cabins where on Monday morning in the dust of the grassless treeless yards halfnaked children should have been crawling and scrabbling after broken cultivator wheels and wornout automobile tires and empty snuff-bottles and tin cans and in the back yards smoke-blackened iron pots should have been bubbling over wood fires beside the sagging fences of vegetable1p147patches and chickenruns which by nightfall would be gaudy with drying overalls and aprons and towels and unionsuits : but not this morning , not now ; the wheels and the giant-doughnuts of chewed rubber and the bottles and cans lying scattered and deserted in the dust since that moment Saturday afternoon when the first voice shouted from inside the house , and in the back yards the pots sitting empty and cold among last Monday'sashes among the empty clotheslines and as the car flashed past the blank and vacant doors he would catch one faint gleam of fire on hearth and no more see but only sense among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all , the empty fields themselves in each of which on this day at this hour on the second Monday in May there should have been fixed in monotonous repetitionthe land 's living symbol  --  a formal group of ritual almost mystic significance identical and monotonous as milestones tying the county-seat to the county 's ultimate rim as milestones would : the beast at the same time vacant of progress , ponderable immovable and immobile like groups of wrestling statuary set against the land 's immensity  --  until suddenly ( they were eight miles from town ; already the blue-green lift of the hills was in sight ) he said with an incredulous an almost shocked amazementwho except for Paralee and Aleck Sander and Lucas had not seen one in going on forty-eight hours : There 's a nigger . ' Yes , ' his uncle said . Today is the ninth of May . This county 's got half of a hundred and forty-two thousand acres to plant yet . Somebody 's got to stay home and work : '  --  the car rushing boring up so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating them he and the Negro behind the plow looked eye to eye into each other 's face before the Negro looked away  --  the face black and gleamed with sweat and passionate with effort , tense concentrated and composed , the car flashing past and on while he leaned first out the open window to look back then turned in the seat to see back through the rear window , watching them still in their rapid unblurred diminishment  --  the man and the mule and the wooden plow which coupled them furious and solitary , fixed and without progress in the earth , leaning terrifically against nothing . They could see the hills now ; they were almost there  --  the long lift of the first pine ridge standing across half the horizon and beyond it a sense a feel of others , the mass of them seeming not so much to stand rush abruptlyup out of the plateau as to hang suspended over it as his uncle had told him the Scottish highlands did except for this sharpness and color ; that was two years ago , maybe three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who chose by preference to live on them on little patches which would n't make eight bushels of corn or fifty pounds , of lint cotton an acre even if they were not too steep for a mule to pull a plow across ( but then they do nt want to make the cotton anyway , only the corn and not too much of that because it really does n't take a great deal of corn to run a still as big as one man and his sons want to fool with ) are people named Gowrie and McCallum and Fraser and Ingrum that used to be Ingrahamand Workitt that used to be Urquhart only the one that brought it to America and then Mississippi could n't spell it either , who love brawling and fear God and believe in Hell ' and it was as though his uncle had1P149read his mind , holding the speedometer needle at fiftyfiveinto the last mile of gravel ( already the road was beginning to slant down toward the willow-and-cypress bottom of the Nine-Mile branch ) speaking , that is volunteeringto speak for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workitt and Ingram . And in the valleys along the rivers , the broad rich easy land where a man can raise something he can sell openly in daylight , the people named Littlejohn and Greenleaf and Armstead and Millingham and Bookwright and stopped , the car dropping on down the slope , increasingspeed by its own weight ; now he could see the bridge where Aleck Sander had waited for him in the dark and below which Highboy had smelled quicksand . We turn off just beyond it , ' he said . I know , ' his uncle said .  --  And the ones named Sambo , they live in both , they elect both because they can stand either because they can stand anything . ' The edge was quite near now , the white railing of the entrance yawned rushing at them .

But the people named Sambo survived the one and who knows ? the ma even endure the other .  --  And who knows Then a gleam of sand , a flash and glint of water ; the white rail streamed past in one roar and rush and rattle of planking and they were across .

Though that little at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the motionless uprush of the main ridge and the strong constant resinous downflow of the pines where the dogwood looked indeed like nuns now in thep151long green corridors , up and onto the last crest , the plateau and now he seemed to see his whole native land , his home  --  the dirt , the earth which had bred his bones and those of his fathers for six generations and was still shaping him into not just a man but a specific man , not with just a man 's passions and aspirations and beliefs but the specific passions and hopes and convictions and ways of thinking and acting of a specific kind and even race : and even more : even among a kind and race specificand unique ( according to the lights of most , certainlyof all of them who had thronged into town this morning to stand across the street from the jail and crowd up around the sheriff 's car , damned unique ) since it had also integrated into him whatever it was that had compelledhim to stop and listen to a damned highnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been about to get if not about what he deserved at least exactly what he had spent the sixty-odd years of his life asking for  --  unfolding beneath him like a map in one slow soundless explosion : to the east ridge on green ridge tumbling away toward Alabama and to the west and south the checkered fields and the woods flowing on into the blue and gauzed horizon beyond which lay at last like a cloud the long wall of the levee and the great River itself flowing not merely from the north but out of the North circumscribing and outland  --  the umbilicus of America joining the soil which was his home to the parent which three generations ago it had failed in blood to repudiate ; by turning his head he could see the faint stain of smoke which was town ten miles away and merely by looking ahead he could see the long reach of rich bottom land marked off into the big holdings , the plantations ( one of which was Edmonds ' where the pres- ent Edmonds and Lucas both had been born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ( though even in his grandfather 's memory steamboats had navigated it ) and then the dense line of river jungle itself : and beyond that stretching away east and north and west not merely to where the ultimate headlands frowned back to back upon the waste of the two oceans and the long barrier of Canada but to the uttermost rim of earth itself , the North : not north but North , outland and circumscribing and not even a geographical place but an emotional idea , a condition of which he had fed from his mother 's milk to be ever and constant on the alert not at all to fear and not actually anymore to hate but just  --  a little wearily sometimes and sometimes even with tongue in cheek  --  to defy : who had brought from infancy with him a childhood 's picture which on the threshold of manhood had found no reason or means to alter and which he had no reason to believe in his old age would alter either : a curving semicircular wall not high ( anyone who really wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already would ) from the top of which with the whole vast scope of their own rich teemingnever-ravaged land of glittering undefiled cities and unburned towns and unwasted farms so long-secured and opulent you would think there was no room left for curiosity , there looked down upon him and his countless row on row of faces which resembled his face and spoke the same language he spoke and at times even answered to the same names he bore yet between whom and him and his there was no longer any real kinship and soon there would not even be any contact since the very mutualwords they used would no longer have the same significance and soon after that even this would be goneP153because they would be too far asunder even to hear one another : only the massed uncountable faces looking down at him and his in fading amazement and outrage and frustration and most curious of all , gullibility : a volitionless , almost helpless capacity and eagerness to believe anything about the South not even provided it be derogatorybut merely bizarre enough and strange enough : whereupon once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again without surprise he saw his thinking not be interrupted but merely swap one saddle for another : It 's because we alone in the United States ( I 'm not speaking of Sambo right now ; I 'll get to him in a minute ) are a homogeneous people . I mean the only one of any size . The New Englander is too of course back inland from the coastal spew of Europe which this country quarantined unrootable into the rootless ephemeral cities with factory and foundry and municipal paychecks as tight and close as any police could have done it , but there are no longer enough of him just as there are not of the Swiss who are not a people so much as a neat clean small quite solvent business . So we are not really resistingwhat the outland calls ( and we too ) progress and enlightenment . We are defending not actually our politicsor beliefs or even our way of life , but simply our homogeneity from a federal government to which in simple desperation the rest of this country has had to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to continue to afford the United States . And of course we will continue to defend it . We ( I mean all of us : Beat Four will be unable to sleep at night until it has cancelled Lucas Beauchamp ( ( or someoneelse ) ) against Vinson Gowrie in the same color of ink , and Beat One and Two and Three and Five who on heatless principle intend to see that Beat Four makes that cancellation ) do nt know why it is valuable . We do nt need to know . Only a few of us know that only from homogeneity comes anything of a people or for a people of durable and lasting value  --  the literature , the art , the science , that minimum of government and police which is the meaning of freedom and liberty , and perhaps most valuable of all a national character worth anything in a crisis  --  that crisis we shall face someday when we meet an enemy with as many men as we have and as much materialas we have and  --  who knows ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast . ' That 's why we mkt resist the North : not just to pre : serve ourselves nor even the two of us as one to remain one nation because that will be the inescapable byproductof what we will reserve : which is the very thing that three generations ago we lost a bloody war in our own back yards so that it remain intact : the postulate that Sambo is a human being living in a free country and hence must be free . That 's what we are really defending : the privilege of setting him free ourselves : which we will have to do for the reason that nobody else can since going on a century ago now the North tried it and have been admitting for . seventy-five years now that they failed . So it will have to be us . Soon now this sort of thing wont even threaten anymore . It should n't now . It should never have . Yet it did last Saturday and it probably will again , perhaps once more , perhaps twice more . But then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be there of course but then the whole chronicle of man 's immortality is in the suffering he has endured , his struggle toward the stars in the stepping-stones of hisP155expiations .

' - ... a .  --   --  . end his children to the same school anywhere the white man 's children go and travel anywhere the white man travels as the whiteman does it . But it wont be next Tuesday . Yet people in the North believe it can be compelled even into next Monday by the simple ratification by votes of a printed paragraph : who have forgotten that although a long quarter-century ago Tucas Beauchamp 's freedom was made an article inour constitutionchamp 's master was not merely beaten to his knees but trampled for ten years on his face in the dust to make him swallow it , yet only three short generations later they are faced once more with the necessity of passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas Beauchamp , Sambo , he 's a homogeneousman too , except that part of him which is trying to escape - not even into the best of the white race but into the second best  --  the cheap shoddy honest musicthe cheap flash baseless overvalued money , the glittering. - . edifice of publicity foundationed on nothing like a cardhouseover an abyss and all the noisy muddle of politicalactivity which used to be our minor national industry and is now our national amateur pastime  --  all the spuriousuproar produced by men deliberately fostering and then getting rich on our national passion for the mediocre : who will even accept the best provided it is debased and befouled before being fed to us : who are the only people on earth who brag publicly of being second-rate , - i.e. , lowbrows . I do nt mean that Sambo . I mean the rest of him who has a better homogeneity than we have andP156proved it by finding himself roots into the land where he had actually to displace white men to put them down : because he had patience even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was nothing to see at the end of it , not even just the will but the desire to endure because he loved the old few simple things which no one wanted to take from him : not an automobile nor flash clothes nor his picture in the paper but a little of music ( his own ) , a hearth , not his child but any child , a God a heaven which a man may avail himself a little of at any time without having to wait to die , a little earth for his own sweat to fall on among his own green shoots and plants . We  --  he and us  --  should confederate : swap him the rest of the economic and political and cultural privilegeswhich are his right , for the reversion of his capacity to wait and endure and survive . Then we would prevail ; together we would dominate the United States ; we would present a front not only impregnable but not even to be threatened by a mass of people who no longer have anything in common save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of national character which they hide from one another behind a loud lipservice to a flag . ' Now they were there and not too long behind the sheriff . For though the car was already drawn off the road into the grove in front of the church , the sheriff was still standing beside it and one of the Negroes was just passing the pick backward out of the car to the other prisoner who stood holding both the shovels . His uncle drew in beside it and stopped and now in daylight he could see the church , for the first time actually who had lived within ten miles of it all his life and must have passed it , seen it at least half that many times . Yet he could not rememberP157ever having actually looked at it before  --  a plank steeplelessbox no longer than some of the one-room cabins hill people lived in , paintless too yet ( curiously ) not shabby and not even in neglect or disrepair because he could see where sections of raw new lumber and scraps and fragmentsof synthetic roofing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a savage almost insolent promptitude , not squatting nor crouching nor even sitting but standing among the trunks of the high strong constant shaggy pines , solitary but not forlorn , intractable and independent , asking nothing of any , makingcompromise with none and he remembered the tall slender spires which said Peace and the squatter utilitarian belfries which said Repent and he remembered one which even said Beware but this one said simply : Burn : and he and his uncle got out ; the sheriff and the two Negroes carrying the tools were already inside the fence and he and his uncle followed , through the sagging gate in the low wire enclosure massed with honeysuckle and small odorless pink and white climbing roses and he saw the graveyard too for the first time , who had not only violated a grave in it but exploded one crime by exposing another  --  a fenced square of earth less large than garden plots he had seen and which by September would probably be choked and almost impenetrable and wellnigh invisible with sagegrass and ragweed and beggarlice , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random into a ledger or toothpicks in a loaf and canted , always slightly as if they had taken their own frozen perpendicularfrom the limber unresting never-quite-vertical pines , shingle-thin slabs of cheap gray granite of the same weathered color as the paintless church as if they had been hacked out of its flank with axes ( and carved mottoless with simple names and dates as though there had been nothing even their mourners remembered of them than that they had lived and they had died ) and it had been neither decay nor time which had compelled back into the violated walls the raw new patching of unplaned paintless lumber but the simple exigencies of mortality and the doom of flesh . He and his uncle threaded on among them to where the sheriff and the two Negroes already stood above the fresh raw mound which likewise he who had violated it now actually saw for the first time . But they had n't begun to dig yet . Instead the sheriff had even turned , looking back at him until he and his uncle came up and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the sheriff was speaking to him in the mild heavy voice : I reckon you and Miss Eunice and your secretary were mighty careful not to let anybody catch you at this business last night , were n't you ? ' His uncle answered : This is hardly the thing you 'd want an audience at , is it ? ' But the sheriff was still looking at him . Then why did n't they put the flowers back ? ' Then he saw them too  --  the artificial wreath , the tediousintricate contrivance of wire and thread and varnishedleaves and embalmed blooms which someone had brought or sent out from the florist in town , and the three bunches of wilted garden and field flowers tied with cotton string , all of which Aleck Sander had said last night looked as if they had , been thrown at or onto the grave and which he remembered Aleck Sander and himself moving aside out of the way and which he knew they had put back after they filled the hole back up he could remember Miss Habersham telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the un-need or at least the waste of time ; perhaps he could even remember Miss Habersham herself helping to put them back : or then perhaps he did n't remember them being put back at all but merely thought he did because they obviously had n't been , lying now tossed and inextricable to one side and apparently either he or Aleck Sander had trodden on the wreath though it did n't really matter now , which was what his uncle was just saying : Never mind now . Let 's get started . Even when we finish here and are on the way back to town we will still be only started . ' All right , boys , ' the sheriff said to the Negroes . Jump to it . Let 's get out of here ' and there was no sound , he heard nothing to warn him , he just looked up and around as his uncle and the sheriff did and saw , coming not down the road but around from behind the church as though from among the high windy pines themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded blue shirt whose empty left sleeve was folded neatly back and pinned cuff to shoulder with a safetypin , on a small trim claybank mare showing too much eye-white and followed by two younger men riding double on a big saddleless black mule with a rope-burn on its neck and followed in their turn ( and keeping carefully clear of the mule 's heels ) by two gaunt Trigg foxhounds , coming at a rapid trot across the grove to the gate where the man stopped the mare and swung himself lightly and rapidly down with his one hand and dropped the reins across the mare 's neck and came with that light wiry almost springy rapidity through the gate and up to them  --  a short lean old man with eyes as pale as the sheriff 's andP160a red weathered face out of which jutted a nose like the hooked beak of an eagle , already speaking in a high thin strong uncracked voice : What 's going on around here , Shurf ? ' ' I 'm going to open this grave , Mr Gowrie , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , immediate , with no change whatever in the voice : not disputative , nothing : just a statement : Not that grave . ' Yes , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . ' I 'm going to open it . ' Without haste or fumbling , almost deliberate in fact , the old man with his one hand unbuttoned two buttons on the front of his shirt and thrust the hand inside , hunching his hip slightly around to meet the hand and drew from inside the shirt a heavy nickel-plated pistol and still with no haste but no pause either thrust the pistol into his left armpit , clamping it butt-forward against his body by the stub of the arm while his one hand buttoned the shirt , then took the pistol once more into the single hand not pointing it at anything , just holding it . But long before this he had seen the sheriff already moving , moving with really incredible speed not toward the old man but around the end of the grave , already in motion even before the two Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to run full tilt into the sheriff as into a cliff , even seeming to bounce back alittlebefore the sheriff grasped them one in each hand as if they were children and then in the next instant seemed to be holding them both in one hand like two rag dolls , turning his body so that he was between them and the little wiry old man with the pistol , saying in that mild even lethargic voice : P161Stop it . Do nt you know the worst thing that could happen to a nigger would be dodging loose in a pair of , convict pants around out here today ? ' ' That 's right , boys , ' the old man said in his high inflectionlessvoice . ' I ai nt going to hurt you . I 'm talking to the Shurf here . Not my boy 's grave , Shurf . ' Send them back to the car , ' his uncle murmured rapidly . But the sheriff did n't answer , still looking at the old man . Your boy ai nt in that grave , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of all the things the old man might have said  --  the surprise , the disbelief , the outrage perhaps , even the thinking aloud : How do you come to know my boy ai nt there ?  --  the rationalising by reflective in which he might have paraphrased the sheriff speaking to his uncle six hours ago : You would n't be telling me this if you did n't know it was so ; watching , even following the old man as he cut straight across all this and he thought suddenly with amazement : Why , he 's grieving : thinking how he had seen grief twice now in two years where he had not expected it or anyway anticipated it , where in a sense a heart capable of breakinghad no business being : once in an old nigger who had just happened to outlive his old nigger wife and now in a violent foulmouthed godless old man who had happened to lose one of the six lazy idle violent more or less lawless a good deal more than just more or less worthless sons , one one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the last desperate resortof getting murdered out of it : hearing the high flat voice again immediate and strong and without interval , inflectionless , almost conversational : ' Why , I just hope you do nt tell me the name of the fellow that proved my boy ai nt there , Shurf . I just hopeP162you wont mention that : '  --  little hard pale eyes staring at little hard pale eyes , the sheriff 's voice mild still , inscrutablenow : ' No , Mr Gowrie . It ai nt empty : ' and later , afterward , he realised that this was when he believed he knew not perhaps why Lucas had ever reached town alive because the reason for that was obvious : there happened to be no Gowrie present at the moment but the dead one : but at least how the old man and two of his sons happened to ride out of the woods behind the church almost as ' soon as he and the sheriff and his uncle reached the grave , and certainly why almost forty-eight hours afterwardLucas was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff said . The old man turned , immediate , not hurriedly and even quickly but just easily as if his spare small fleshless frame offered neither resistance to the air nor weight to the motive muscles , and shouted toward the fence where the two younger men still sat the mule identical as two clothing store dummies and as immobile , not even havingbegun yet to descend until the old man shouted : Here , boys . ' Never mind , ' the sheriff said . We 'll do it . ' He turned to the two Negroes . All right . Get your shovels --  " I told you , ' his uncle murmured rapidly again . Send them back to the car . ' That 's right , Lawyer  --  Lawyer Stevens , ai nt it ? ' the old man said . Get ' em away from here . This here 's our business . We 'll attend to it . ' It 's my business now , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . The old man raised the pistol , steadily and without haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb curling up and over the hammer cocking it so that itp163came already cocked level or not quite , not quite pointingat anything somewhere about the height of the empty belt-loops on the sheriff 's trousers . ' Get them out of here , Shurf , ' the old man said . ' All right , ' the sheriff said without moving . ' You boys go back to the car . ' ' Further than that , ' the old man said . ' Send ' em back to town . ' ' They 're prisoners , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . ' I cant do that . ' He did n't move . ' Go back and get in the car , ' he told them . They moved then , walking not back toward the gate but directly away across the enclosure , walking quite fast , lifting their feet and knees in the filthy barred trousers quite high , walking quite fast by the time they reached the opposite fence and half steppinghalf hopping over it and only then changing directionback toward the two cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never be any nearer the two white men on the mule than when they had left the grave : and he looked at them now sitting the mule identical as two clothes pins on a line , the identical faces even weathered exactly alike , surly quick-tempered and calm , until the old man shouted again : ' All right , boys : ' and they got down as one , at the same time even like a trained vaudeville team and again as one stepped with the same left leg over the fence , completelyignoring the gate : the Gowrie twins , identical even to the clothing and shoes except that one wore a khaki shirt and the other a sleeveless jersey ; about thirty , a head taller than their father and with their father 's pale eyes and the nose too except that it was not the beak of an eagle but rather that of a hawk , coming up with no word , no glance even for any of them from the bleak composed humorless faces until the old man pointed with the pistol ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two shovels and said in his high voice which sounded almost cheerful even : Grab ' em , boys . They belong to the county ; if we bust one it ai nt anybody 's business but the Grand Jury 's : '  --  the twins , facing each other now at opposite ends of the mound and working again in that complete almost choreographic unison : the next two youngest before the dead one , Vinson ; fourth and fifth of the six sons :  --  Forrest , the oldest who had not only wrenched himself free of his fiery tyrant of a father but had even got marriedand for twenty years now had been manager of a delta cotton plantation above Vicksburg ; then Crawford , the second one who had been drafted on the second day of November 1918 and on the night of the tenth ( with a bad luck in guessing which , his uncle said , should not happen to any man  --  a point of view in which in fact his federal captors themselves seemed to concur since his term in the Leavenworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for almost eighteen months in a series of caves and tunnels in the hills within fifteen miles of the federal courthouse in Jefferson until he was captured at last after something very like a pitched battle ( though luckily for him nobody was seriously hurt ) duringwhich he made good his cave for thirty-odd hours armed with ( and , his uncle said , a certain consistency and fitness here : a deserter from the United States army defending his freedom from the United States governmentwith a piece of armament captured from the enemy whom he had refused to fight ) an automatic pistol which one of the McCallum boys had taken from a captured German officer and traded shortly after he got home forP165a brace of Gowrie foxhounds , and served his year and came home and the town next heard of him in Memphis where it was said he was ( 1 ) running liquor up from New Orleans , ( 2 ) acting as a special employer-bonded company officer during a strike , but anyway coming back to his father 's home suddenly where nobody saw much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to hear of him as having more or less settled down , dealing in a little timber and cattle and even working a little land ; and Bryan , the third one who was the actual force , power , cohering element , whatever you might call it , in or behind the family farm which fed them all ; then the twins , Vardaman and Bilbo who spent their nights squattingin front of smoldering logs and stumps while the hounds ran foxes and their days sleeping flat on the naked planks of the front gallery until dark came and time to cast the hounds again ; and the last one , Vinson , who even as a child had shown an aptitude for trading and for money so that now , though dead at only twentyeight , he was not only said to own several small parcels of farmland about the county but was the first Gowrie who could sign his name to a check and have any bank honor it ;  --  the twins , kneedeep then waistdeep , workingwith a grim and sullen speed , robotlike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring at the same instant on the plank box and even then seeming to communicate by no physical means as birds or animals do : no sound no gesture : simply one of them released his shovel in a continuation of the same stroke which flung the dirt and then himself flowed effortless up out of the pit and stood among the rest of them while his brother cleaned off what remained of dirt from the top of the coffin , then tossed his shovel up and out with-P166out even looking and  --  as he himself had done last night  --  kicked the last of the earth away from the edge of the lid and stood on one leg and grasped the lid and heaved it up and over and away until all of them standing along the rim of the grave could look down past him into the box . It was empty . There was nothing in it at all until a thin trickle of dirt flowed down into it with a whisperingpattering sound . P167AND HE WOULD REMEMBER IT : the five of them standing at the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another limber flowing motion like his twin 's the second Gowrie came up out of the grave and stooped and with an air of rapt displeased even faintly outraged concern began to brush and thump the clay particles from the lower legs of his trousers , the first twin moving as the second stooped , going straight to him with a blind unhurriedundeviable homing quality about him like the other of a piece of machinery , the other spindle say of a lathe , travelling on the same ineluctable shaft to its socket , and stooped too and began to brush and strike the dirt from the back of his brother 's trousers ; and this time almost a spadeful of dirt slid down across the out-slanted lid and rattled down into the empty box , almost loud enough or with mass and weight enough to produce a small hollow echo . Now he 's got two of them , ' his uncle said . Yes , ' the sheriff said . Where ? ' Durn two of them , ' old Gowrie said . Where 's my boy , Shurf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . And you were smart to bring them hounds . Put your pistol up and let your boys catch them dogs and hold them till we get straightened out here . ' P168'Never you mind the pistol nor the dogs neither , ' old Gowrie said . ' They 'll trail and they 'll ketch anything that ever run or walked either . But my boy and that Jake Montgomery  --  if it was Jake Montgomery whoever it was found laying in my son 's coffin  --  never walked away from here to leave no trail . ' The sheriff said , Hush now , Mr Gowrie . ' The old man glared back up at the sheriff . He was not trembling , not eager , baffled , amazed , not anything . Watching him he thought of one of the cold lightblue tearshaped apparentlyheatless flames which balance themselves on even less than tiptoe over gasjets . ' All right , ' the old man said . I 'm hushed . And now you get started . You 're the one that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to my breakfast table at six oclock this morning to meet you here . Now you get started . ' That 's what we 're going to do , ' the sheriff said . We 're going to find out right now where to start .

You got a mule or maybe it 's a horse , anyway something that can walk and tote a double load , and a dead man across your saddle . And you ai nt got much time ; that is , you ai nt got all of time . Of course it 's around eleven oclock , when most folks is in bed , and a Sunday night too when folks have got to get up early tomorrow to start a new week in the middle of cotton-planting time , and there ai nt any moon and even if folks might still be moving around you 're in a lonely part of the country where the chances all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead man with a bullet hole in his back and even at eleven oclock day 's going to come sooner or later .

Into the earth again . And not far , since as you said daylightcomes sooner or later even when it 's still just eleven oclock . Especially when he still had time to come back and do it all over again , alone , by himself , no hand but his on the shovel .  --  And think of that too : the need , the terrible need , not just to have it all to do again but to have to do it again for the reason he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , all anyone could have asked or expected him to do or even dreamed that he would have to do ; was as safe as he could hope to be  --  and then to be drawn back by a sound , a noise or perhaps he blundered by sheer chance on the parked truck or perhaps it was just his luck , his good fortune , whatever god or djinn or genie looks after murderers for a little while , keeps him secure and safe until the other fates have had time to spin and knot the rope ,  --  anyway to have to crawl , tie the mule or horse or whatever it was to a tree and crawl on his belly back up here to lie ( who knows ? perhaps just behind the fence yonder ) and watch a meddling old woman and two children who should have been two hours ago in bed ten miles away , wreck the whole careful edifice of his furious labor , undo the work not merely of his life but of his death too . . .

So if you ever really had any idea of coming out here alone to dig this grave up , do nt even tell me --  " Let that be now , ' the sheriff said . ' All right . Somewherein the ground . And what sort of ground ? What dirt digs easiest and fastest for a man in a hurry and by himself even if he has a shovel ? What sort of dirt could you hope to hide a body in quick even if you never had nothing but a pocket knife ?

' Then to him : Show us exactly where Except that Aleck Sander said it might not have been a mule , ' he said . All right , ' the sheriff said . ' Horse then . Show us exactly where ... He would remember it : watching the old man clap the pistol again butt-forward into his armpit and clamp it there with the stump of the arm while the one hand unbuttoned the shirt then took the pistol from the armpitand thrust it back inside the shirt then buttoned the shirt again then turned even faster quicker than the two sons half his age , already in front of everybody when he hopped back over the fence and went to the mare and caught reins and pommel all in one hand , already swingingup : then the two cars dropping in second speed against gravity back down the steep pitch until he said Here ' where the pickup 's tracks slewed off the road into the bushes then back into the road again and hisP171uncle stopped : and he watched the fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road into the woods on the opposite side already falling away down toward the branch , then the two hounds flowing up the bank behind him and then the mule with the two identical wooden faced sons on it : then he and his uncle were out of the car the sheriff 's car bumper to bumper behind them , hearing the mare crashing on down toward the branch and then the old man 's high flat voice shouting at the hounds : Hi ! Hi ! Hum on boy ! At him , Ring ! ' and then his uncle : Handcuff them through the steering wheel : ' and then the sheriff : ' No . We 'll need the shovels : ' and he had climbed the bank too , listening off and downward toward the crashingand the shouts , then his uncle and the sheriff and the two Negroes carrying the shovels were beside him . Althoughthe branch crossed almost at right angles the highway just beyond where the dirt road forked away , it was almost a quarter-mile from where they now stood or walked rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dogs and the crashing of the mare and the mule too in the dense thicket below , the sheriff did n't go that way , bearing instead off along the hill almost parallel with the road for several minutes and only beginning to slant away from it when they came out into the sawgrass and laurel and willow-choked flat between the hill and the branch : and on across that , the sheriff in front until he stopped still looking down then turned his head and looked back at him , watching him as he and his uncle came up . P172'Your secretary was right the first time , ' the sheriff said . ' It was a mule . ' Not a black one with a rope-burn , ' his uncle said . ' Surely not that . Not even a murderer is that crassly and arrogantly extrovert . ' ' Yes , ' the sheriff said . ' That 's why they 're dangerous , why we must destroy them or lock them up : ' and looking down he saw them too : the narrow delicate almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual size , mashed pressed deep , too deep for any one mule no matter how heavy carrying just one man , into the damp muck , the tracks filled with water and even as he watched a minute aquatic beast of some sort shot across one of them leaving a tiny threadlike spurt of dissolvingmud ; and standing in the trail , now that they had found it they could see the actual path itself through the crushed shoulder-high growth in suspension held like a furrow across a field or the frozen wake of a boat , crossing the marsh arrow-straight until it vanished into the jungle which bordered the branch . They followed it , walking in it , treading the two sets of prints not going and returning but both going in the same direction , now and then the print of the same hoof superposed on its previous one , the sheriff still in the lead talking again , speaking aloud but without looking back as though  --  he thought at first  --  to no one : ' He would n't come back this way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back straight up the hill that time , woods or not and dark or not . That was when he heard whatever it was he heard . ' Then he knew who the sheriff was talking to : ' Maybe your secretary was whistlingup there or something . Being in a graveyard that time of night . '  |p173Then  they stood on the bank of the branch itself  --  a broad ditch a channel through which during the winter and spring rains a torrent rushed but where now there flowed a thin current scarcely an inch deep and never much over a yard wide from pool to pool along the blanched sand  --  and even as his uncle said , Surely the fool ' the sheriff ten yards or so further along thebank said : Here it is : ' and they went to him and then he saw where the mule had stood tied to a sapling and then the prints where the man himself had thrashed on along the bank , his prints also deeper than any man no matter how heavy should have made and he thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency in the black dark and the briers and the dizzy irrevocable fleeing on seconds , carrying a burden man was not intended to carry : then he was hearing a snapping and thrashing of underbrush still further along the bank and then the mare and then old Gowrie shouted and then another crash which would be the mule coming up and then simple pandemonium : the old man shouting and cursing and the yelping of the hounds and the thudding sound a man 's shoe makes against a dog 's ribs : but they could n't hurry anymore , thrashing and crashing their own way through the tearing clinging briers and vines until they could look down into the ditch and the low mound of fresh shaled earth into which the two hounds had been digging and old Gowrie still kicking at them and cursing , and then they were all down in the ditch except the two Negroes . Hold up , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . That ai nt Vinson . ' But the old man did n't seem to hear him . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed even to have forgot why he was kicking the dogs : that he had merely set out to drive them back from the mound , still hobbling and hopping after them on one leg and the other poised and cocked to kick even after they had retreated from the mound and were merely trying to dodge past him and get out of the ditch into safety , still kicking at them and cursing after the sheriff caught him by his one arm and held him . Look at the dirt , ' the sheriff said . Cant you see ? He hardly took time to bury it . This was the second one , when he was in the hurry , when it was almost daylight and he had to get it hidden ? ' and they could all see now  --  the low hummock of fresh dirt lying close under the bank and in the bank above it the savage ragged marks of the shovel as if he had hacked at the bank with the edge of the blade like swinging an axe ( and again : thinking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable inertia of the earth itself ) until enough of it shaled off and down to hide what he had to hide . This time they did n't need even the shovels . The body was barely covered ; the dogs had already exposed it and he realised now the true magnitude of the urgency and desperation : the frantic and desperate bankrupt in time who had not even enough of it left to hide the evidence of his desperation and the reason for his urgency ; it had been after two oclock when he and Aleck Sander , even two of them working with furious speed , had got the grave filled back up again : so that by the time the murderer , not only alone but who had already moved six feet of dirt and then put it back once since the sun set yesterday , had the second body out and the grave filled for the second time it must have been daylight , laterP175than daylight perhaps , the sun itself watching him while he rode for the second time down the hill and across to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body beneath the bank 's overhang then hacked furiously from it just enough dirt to hide the body temporarily from sight with something of that frantic desperation of the wife flinging her peignoir over the lover 's forgotten glove :  --  lying ( the body ) face down and only the back of the crushed skull visible until the old man stooped and with his one hand jerked it stiffly over onto its back . ' Yep , ' old Gowrie said in the high brisk carrying voice : ' It 's that Montgomery , damned if it ai nt : ' and rose lean and fast as a tripped watch-spring yelling shouting at the hounds again : ' Hi boys ! Find Vinson ! ' and then his uncle shouting too to make himself heard : ' Wait , Mr Gowrie . Wait : ' then to the sheriff : ' He was a fool then just because he did n't have time , not because he is a fool . I just do nt believe it twice ' lookingaround , his eyes darting . Then he stopped them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicksand ? ' ' What ? ' one of the twins said . ' The quicksand , ' his uncle said . ' The quicksand bed in the branch here . Where is it ? ' ' Quicksand ? ' old Gowrie said . ' Sonabitch , Lawyer . Put a man in quicksand ? my boy in quicksand ? ' ' Shut up , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . Then to the twin : ' Well ? Where ? ' But he answered first . He had been intending to for a second or so . Now he did : ' It 's by the bridge : ' then  --  he did n't know why : and then that did n't matter either  --  ' It was n't Aleck Sander that time . It was Highboy. '  |p176Under  the highway bridge , ' the twin corrected . ' Where it 's been all the time . ' ' Oh , ' the sheriff said . ' Which one was Highboy ? ' And he was about to answer that : then suddenly the old man seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running before any of them moved and even before he himself moved , running for several strides against the purchaseless sand while they watched him , before he turned and with that same catlike agility he mounted the mare with , clawed himself one-handed up the steep bank and was thrashing and crashing on out of sight before anybody else except the two Negroes who had never quitted it were even up the bank . ' Jump , ' the sheriff said to the twins : ' Catch him . ' But they did n't . They thrashed and crashed on after him , one of the twins in front then the rest of them and the two Negroes pell mell through the briers and brush , on back along the branch and out of the jungle into the cleared right-of-way below the road at the bridge ; he saw the sliding hoof-marks where Highboy had come almost down to the water and then refused , the stream the water crowded over against the opposite concrete revetment flowing in a narrow band whose nearer edge faded withoutdemarcation into an expanse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so much milk ; he stepped sprang over a long willow pole lying above the bank-edge and coated for three or four feet up its length with a thin patina of dried sand like when you thrust a stick into a bucket ' or vat of paint and even as the sheriff shouted to the twin in front ' Grab him , you ! ' he saw the old man jump feet first off the bank and with no splash no disturbance of any sort continue right on not through the bland surface but past it as if he hadp177jumped not into anything but past the edge of a cliff or a window-sill and then stopping half-disappeared as suddenlywith no shock or jolt : just fixed and immobile as if his legs had been cut off at the loins by one swing of a scythe , leaving his trunk sitting upright on the bland depthless milklike sand . ' All right , boys ! ' old Gowrie cried , brisk and carrying : ' Here he is . I 'm standing on him . ' And one twin got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle girth from the mare and using the shovels like axes the Negroes hacked willow branches while the rest of them dragged up other brush and poles and whatever else they could reach or find or free and now both twins and the two Negroes , their empty shoes sitting on the bank , were down in the sand too and steadily there came down from the hills the ceaseless strong murmur of the pines but no other sound yet although he strained his ears listening in both directionsalong the road , not for the dignity of death because death has no dignity but at least for the decorum of it : some little at least of that decorum which should be every man 's helpless right until the carrion he leaves can be hidden from the ridicule and the shame , the body coming out now feet first , gallowsed up and out of the inscrutable suck to the heave of the crude tackle then free of the sand with a faint smacking plop like the sound of lips perhaps in sleep and in the bland surface nothing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a faint secret fading smile , and then on the bank now while they stood about and over it and he was listening harder than ever now with something of the murderer 's own frantic urgency both ways along the road though there was still nothing : only hearing recognising his own voice apparently long after everyone else had , watching the old man coated to the waist with the same thin patina of sand like the pole , looking down at the body , his face wrenched and his upper lip wrenched upward from the lifeless porcelain glare and the pink bloodless gums of his false teeth : ' Oh gee , Uncle Gavin , oh gee , Uncle Gavin , let 's get him away from the road , at least let 's get him back into the woods Steady , ' his uncle said . They 've all passed now . They 're all in town now : ' and still watching as the old man stooped and began to brush clumsily with his one hand at the sand clogged into the eyes and nostrils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been shaped so supple and quick to violence : to the buttons on the shirt and the butt and hammer of the pistol : then the hand went back and began to fumble at the hip pocket but already his uncle had produced a handkerchief and extended it but that was too late too as kneeling now the old man jerked out the tail of his shirt and bending to bring it  --  close , wiped the or at the dead face with it then bending tried to blow the wet sand from it as though he had forgotten the sand was still damp . Then the old man stood up again and said in the high flat carrying voice in which there was still no real inflection at all : Well , Shurf ? ' It was n't Lucas Beauchamp , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . Jake Montgomery was at Vinson 's funeral yesterday . And while Vinson was being buried Lucas Beauchampwas locked up in my jail in town . ' ' I ai nt talking about Jake Montgomery , Shurf , ' old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff said . Because it was n't Lucas Beauchamp 's old forty-one Colt that killed Vinson either . ' And watching he thought No ! No ! Do nt say it ! Do nt ask ! and for a while he believed the old man would not as he stood facing the sheriff but not looking at him now because his wrinkled eyelids had come down hiding his eyes but only in the way they do when somebody looks down at something at his feet so you could n't really say whether the old man had closed them or was just looking down at what lay on the ground between him and the sheriff . But he was wrong ; the eyelids went up again and again the old man 's hard pale eyes were looking at the sheriff ; again his voice to nine hundred men out of nine hundred and one would have sounded just cheerful : What was it killed Vinson , Shurf ? ' A German Luger automatic , Mr Gowrie , ' the sheriff said . Like the one Buddy McCallum brought home from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox hounds . ' And he thought how this was where the eyelids might even should have closed again but again he was wrong : only until the old man himself turned , quick and wiry , already in motion , already speaking peremptory and loud , not brookless of opposition or argument , simply incapable of conceiving either : All right , sons . Let 's load our boy on the mule and take him home . '  |p180AND  TWO OCLOCK that afternoon in his uncle 's car just behind the truck ( it was another pickup ; they  --  the sheriff  --  had commandeered it , with a slatted cattle frame on the bed which one of the Gowrie twins had known would be standing in the deserted yard of the house two miles away which had the telephone too  --  and he remembered how he wondered what the truck was doing there , how they had got to town themselves who had left it  --  and the Gowrie had turned the switch on with a table fork which by the Gowrie 's direction he had found in the unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gowrie was driving it ) blinkingrapidly and steadily not against glare so much as something hot and gritty inside his eyelids like a dust of ground glass ( which certainly could and even should have been dust after twenty-odd miles of sand and gravel roads in one morning except that no simple dust refused as this did to moisten at all with blinking ) it seemed to him that he saw crowding the opposite side of the street facing the jail not just the county , not just Beat One and Two and Three and Five in their faded tieless khaki and denim and print cotton but the town too  --  not only the faces he had seen getting out of the Beat Four dusty cars in front of the barbershop and the poolhall Saturday afternoon and then in the barbershop Sunday morningP181and again here in the street Sunday noon when the sheriffdrove up with Lucas , but the others who except for the doctors and lawyers and ministers were not just the town but the Town : merchants and cotton-buyers and automobile dealers and the younger men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanics in the garages and filling stations on the way back to work from lunch  --  who without even waiting for the sheriff 's car to get close enough to be recognised had already turned and begun to flow back toward the Square like the turn of a tide , already in motion when the sheriff'scar reached the jail , already pouring back into the Square and converging in that one direction across it when first the sheriff then the truck then his uncle turned into the alley beyond the jail leading to the loadingramp at the undertaker 's back door where the coronerwas waiting for them : so that moving not only parallel with them beyond the intervening block but already in advance , it would even reach the undertaker 's first ; and then suddenly and before he could even turn in the seat to look back he knew that it had even boiled into the alley behind them and in a moment a second now it would roar down on them , overtake and snatch them up in order : his uncle 's car then the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and fling them at last in one inextricable aborted now-worthlessjumble onto the ramp at the coroner 's feet ; still not moving yet it seemed to him that he was already leaning out the window or maybe actually clinging to the fleeing runningboard yelling back at them in a kind of unbearableunbelieving outrage : You fools , do nt you see you are too late , that you 'll have to start all over again now to find a new reason ? ' P182then turning in the seat and looking back through the rear window for a second or maybe two he actually saw it  --  not faces but a face , not a mass nor even a mosaic of them but a Face : not even ravening nor uninsatiate but just in motion , insensate , vacant of thought or even passion : an Expression significantless and without past like the one which materialises suddenly after seconds or even minutes of painful even frantic staring from the innocentjuxtaposition of trees and clouds and landscape in the soap-advertisement puzzle-picture or on the severed head in the news photo of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evocative of horror : just neckless slack-muscled and asleep , hanging suspended face to face with him just beyond the glass of the back window yet in the same instant rushing and monstrous down at him so that he actually started back and had even begun to think In a second more it will when flick ! it was gone , not only the Face but the faces , the alley itself empty behind them : nobody and nothing in it at all and in the street beyond the vacant mouth less than a dozen people now standing looking up the alley after them who even as he looked turned also and began to move back toward the Square . He hesitated only an instant . They 've all gone around to the front he thought rapid and quite calm , having a little trouble ( he noticed that the car was stopped now ) getting his hand onto the door handle , remarking the sheriff 's car and the truck both stopped too at the loading ramp where four or five men were lifting a stretcher up to the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice behind him : Now we 're going home and put you to bed before your mother has a doctor in to give us both a squirt withP183a needle : ' then finding the handle and out of the car , stumbling a little but only once , then his heels although he was not running at all pounding too hard on the concrete , his leg-muscles cramped from the car or perhaps even charley-horsed from thrashing up and down branch bottoms not to mention a night spent digging and undigginggraves but at least the jarring was clearing his head somewhat or maybe it was the wind of motion doing it ; anyway if he was going to have delusions at least he would have a clear brain to look at them with : - up the walkway between the undertaker 's and the buildingnext to it though already too late of course , the Face in one last rush and surge long since by now already across the Square and the pavement , in one last crash against then right on through the plate glass window trampling to Hinders the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby stunted palm in its maroon earthenwarepot and exploding to tatters the sunfaded purple curtain which was the last frail barrier shielding what was left of Jake Montgomery had of what was left of his share of human dignity . Then out of the walkway onto the sidewalk , the Square , and stopped dead still for what seemed to him the first time since he and his uncle left the supper table and walked out of the house a week or a month or a year ago or whenever it had been that last Sunday night was . Because this time he did n't even need the flick . They were there of course nose-pressed to the glass but there were not even enough of them to block the pavementlet alone compound a Face ; less than a dozen here too and some most of them were even boys who should have been in school at this hour  --  not one country faceP184nor even one true man because even the other four or five were the man-sized neither men nor boys who were always there when old epileptic Uncle Hogeye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Willy Ingrum finally managed to shoot through the leg or loins what some woman had telephoned him was a mad-dog : and standing at the entrance to the walkway while his uncle came pounding up it behind him , blinkingpainfully his painful moistureless eyelids he watched why : the Square not empty yet because there were too many of them but getting empty , the khaki and denim and the printed cotton streaming into it and across it toward the parked cars and trucks , clotting and crowding at the doors while one by one they crawled and climbed into the seats and beds and cabs ; already starters were whining and engines catching and racing and idling and gears scraping and grinding while the passengers still hurried toward them and now not one but five or six at once backed away from the curb and turned and straightenedout with people still running toward them and scrambling aboard and then he could no longer have kept count of them even if he had ever tried , standing beside his uncle watching them condense into four streams into the four main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already going fast even before they were out of the Square , the faces for one last moment more looking not back but out , not at anything , just out just once and that not for long and then no more , vanishingrapidly in profile and seeming already to be travellingmuch faster than the vehicle which bore them , already by their faces out of town long before they had passed from view : and twice more even from the car ; his mother standing suddenly not touching him , comeP185obviously through the walkway too from the jail right past where they were probably still hoicking Montgomeryout of the truck but then his uncle had told him they could stand anything provided they still retained always the right to refuse to admit it was visible , saying to his uncle : Where 's the car ? ' then not even waiting to be answered , turning back into the walkway ahead of them , walking slender and erect and rigid with her back lookingand her heels clicking and popping on the concrete as they did at home when he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better walk pretty light for a while , back past the ramp where only the sheriff 's empty car and the empty truck stood now and on to the alley where she was already holding open the door of the car when he and his uncle got there and saw them again crossing the mouth of the alley like across a stage  --  the cars and trucks , the faces in invincible profile not amazed not aghast but in a sort of irrevocable repudiation , shooting across the alley-mouth so constant and unbrokenand so many of them it was like the high school senior class or maybe an itinerant one-night travelling troupe giving the Battle of San Juan Hill and you not only did n't hear you did n't even need to not listen to the muted confused backstage undersounds to the same as see the marching or charging troops as soon as they reached the wings break into a frantic stumbling run swapping coats and caps and fake bandages as they doubled back behind the rippling cheesecloth painted with battle and courage and death to fall in on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll take Miss Habersham home first , ' he said . Get in , ' his mother said and one turn to the left intoPI86the street behind the jail and he could still hear them and another turn to the left into the next cross street and there they were again fleeing across that proscenium too unbroken and breakless , the faces rigid in profile above the long tearing sound of cement and rubber and it had taken him two or three minutes in the pickup this morning to find a chance just to get into it and go the same way it was going ; it would take his uncle five or ten to find a hole to get through it and go back to the jail . Go on , ' his mother said . Make them let you in : ' and he knew they were not going by the jail at all ; he said : Miss Habersham How do I do it ? ' his uncle said . Just shut both eyes and mash hard with my right foot ? ' and perhaps did ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward home which was all right , he had never worried about getting into it but getting out of it again before that frantic pell mell not of flight then if any liked that better so just call it evacuation swept them on into nightfall to spew them at last hours and miles away high and dry and battered and with the wind knocked out of them somewhere along the county 's ultimate scarce-mapped perimeter to walk back in the dark : saying again : Miss Habersham --  " She has her truck , ' his uncle said . Do nt you remember ? '  --  whohad been doing nothing else steadily for five minutes now , even trying three times to say it : Miss Habersham in the truck and her house not half a mile away and all holding her back was she could n't possibly get to it , the house on one side and the truck on the other of that unpierceable barrier of rushing bumperlockedcars and trucks and so almost as interdict to anP187old maiden lady in a second-hand vegetable-peddler 's pickup as if it were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine running and the gears meshed and her foot on the accelerator independent solitary and forlorn erect and slight beneath the exact archaic even moribund hat waiting and watching and wanting only but nothing but to get through it so she could put the darned clothes away and feed the chickens and eat supperand get some rest too after going on thirty-six hours which to seventy must have been worse than a hundred to sixteen , watching and waiting that dizzying profiled blur for a while even a good while but not forever not too long because she was a practical woman who had n't taken long last night to decide that the way to get a dead body up out of a grave was to go out to the grave and dig it up and not long now to decide that the way to get around an obstruction especially with the sun already tumbling down the west was to go around it , the truck in motion now running along parallel with the obstructionand in its direction , forlorn and solitary still yet independent still too and only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving a little faster than she was used and liked to , faster in fact than she had ever driven before and even then not keeping abreast of it but only beside it because it was going quite fast now : one endless profiled whizz : and now she would know that when the gap came perhaps she would not have the skill or strength or speed or quickness of eye or maybe even the simple nerve : herself going faster and faster and so intent trying to not miss the gap with one eye and watch where she was going with the other that she would n't realise until afterward that she had made the turn going not south but east now and not just herP188house diminishing rapidly and squarely behind her but Jefferson too because they or it was not moving in just one direction out of town but in all of them on all the main roads leading away from the jail and the undertaker'sand Lucas Beauchamp and what was left of VinsonGowrie and Montgomery like the frantic scattering of waterbugs on a stagnant pond when you drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate than ever now with all distance fleeing between her and home and another night coming on , nerving herself for any gap or crevice now , the battered pickup barely skimming the ground beside that impenetrable profiled blur drawing creeping closer and closer beside it when the inevitable happened : some failure of eye or tremor of hand or an ins iluntary flick of the eyelid on alertness 's straining glare or maybe simple topography : a stone or clod in the path as inaccessible to indictment as God but anyway too close and then too late , the truck snatched up and into the torrent of ballbearing rubber and refinanced pressed steel and hurled pell mell on still gripping the useless steering wheel and pressing the gelded accelerator solitary and forlorn across the long peaceful creep of late afternoon , into the mauve windless dome of dusk , faster and faster now toward one last crescendo just this side of the county line where they would burst scattering into every crossroad and lane like rabbits or rats nearing at last their individual burrows , the truck slowing and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spewed it because she was safe now , in Grossman County and she could turn south again now along the edge of Yoknapatawpha turning on the lights now going as fast as she dared along the fringing unmarkedcountry roads ; full night now and in MottP189County now she could even turn west at last watching her chance to turn north and make her dash , nine and ten oclock along the markless roads fringing the imaginaryline beyond which the distant frantic headlights flashed and darted plunging into their burrows and dens ; Okatoba County soon and midnight and surely she could turn north then back into Yoknapatawpha , wan and spent solitary and indomitable among the crickets and treefrogs and lightningbugs and owls and whippoorwills and the hounds rushing bellowing out from under the sleeping houses and even at last a man in his nightshirt and unlaced shoes , carrying a lantern : Where you trying to go , lady ? I 'm trying to get to Jefferson . Jefferson 's behind you , lady . I know . I had to detour around an arrogant insufferableold nigger who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man : when suddenly he discovered that he was going to laugh , discovering it almost in time , not quite in time to prevent it but in time to begin to stop it pretty quick , really more surprised than anything else , until his mother said harshly : Blow the horn . Blow them out of the way ' and he discovered that it was not laughing at all or anyway not just laughing , that is the sound it was making was about the same as laughing but there was more of it and it felt harder , seemed to be having more trouble getting out and the harder it felt and sounded the less and less he could seem to remember what he must have been laughing at and his face was suddenly wet not with a flow but a kind of burst and spring of water ; anyway there he was , a hulking lump the second largest of the three of them , more bigger than his mother than his uncle was than he , going on seventeen years old and almost a man yet because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but feel a woman 's shoulder against his and her narrow hand on his knee sitting there like a spanked child before he had even had warning enough to begin to stop it . ' They ran , ' he said . ' Pull out , damn you , ' his mother said . ' Go around them : ' which his uncle did , on the wrong side of the street and going almost as fast as he had driven this morning on the way to the church trying to keep in sight of the sheriff and it was n't because his mother had rationalised that since all of them were already in town trying their best to get out of it there would n't be anybody to be coming toward the Square on that side of the street so it was simply just having one in the car with you even if she was n't driving it , that 's all you needed to do : remembering them once before in a car and his uncle driving and his uncle said then , ' All right , how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accelerator ? ' and his mother said , ' How many collisions did you ever see with women driving both of them ? ' and his uncle said , ' All right , touche , maybe it 's because one of them 's car is still in the shop where a man ran into it yesterday : ' then he could no longer see them but only hear the long tearing without beginning or end and leaving no scar of tires and pavement in friction like the sound of raw silk and luckily the house was on the same wrong side of the street too and carrying the sound into the yard with him too and now he could do something about the laughing by taking a moment to put his hand on whatever it was that seemed to have got him started and bringing it out  |p191into  the light where even he could see it was n't that funny ; about ten thousand miles of being funny enough to set his mother swearing ; he said : They ran ' and at once knew that was wrong , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at himself , walking fast across the yard until he stopped and not jerked just pulled his arm away and said , Look , I 'm not crippled . I 'm just tired . I 'm going up to my room and lie down a while : ' and then to his uncle : I 'll be all right then . Come up and call me in about fifteen minutes : ' then stopped and turned again again to his uncle : ' I ' 11 be ready in fifteen minutes : ' and went on this time carrying it into the house with him and even in his room too he could still hear it even through the drawn shades and the red jumping behind his eyelids until he started up onto one elbow under his mother 's hand too again to his uncle just beyond the footboard : Fifteen minutes . You wont go without me ? You prom-ise ? ' Sure , ' his uncle said . I wont go without you .

For every Southern boy fourteen years old , not once but whenever he wants it , there is the instant when it 's still not yet two oclock on that July afternoon in 1863 , the brigades are in position behind the rail fence , the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreetto give the word and it 's all in the balance , it has n't happened yet , it has n't even begun yet , it not only has n't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin againstP195that position and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstead and Wilcoxlook grave yet it 's going to begin , we all know that , we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment does n't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time . Maybe this time with all this much to lose and all this much to gain : Pennsylvania , Maryland , the world , the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble , the cast made two years ago ; or to anyone who ever sailed even a skiff under a quilt sail , the moment in 1492 when somebody thought This is it : the absolute edge of no return , to turn back now and make home or sail irrevocably on and either find land or plunge over the world 's roaring rim . A small voice , a sound sensitive lady poet of the time of my youth said the scattered tea goes with the leaves and every day a sunset dies : a poet 's extravagance which as quite often mirrors truth but upside down and backward since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of it is glass too : because if they only did , instead of which yesterday 's sunset and yesterday 's tea both are inextricable from the scattered indestructible uninfusable grounds blown through the endless corridors of tomorrow , into the shoes we will have to walk in and even the sheets we will have ( or try ) to sleep between : because you escape nothing , you flee nothing ; the pursuer is what is doing the running and tomorrow night is nothing but one long sleepless wrestle with yesterday 's omissions and regrets . ' ) : who had pretermittednot even a death nor even a death to Lucas but merely Lucas , Lucas in ten thousand Sambo-avatars to scurry unheeding and not even aware through thatI orifice like mice through the slot of a guillotine until at the One unheeding moment the unheeding unwitting uncaring chopper falls ; tomorrow or at least tomorrow or at most tomorrow and perhaps this time to intervene where angels fear no white and black children sixteen and an old white spinster long on the way to eighty ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep from having to send up to him by the drugstore porter a can of tobacco not at all to say they were sorry but so they would n't have to say out loud that they were wrong : and spurned the cliff away in one long plunge up and up slowing into it already hearing it , only the most faintly oscillant now hearing it listening to it , not movingyet nor even opening his eyes as he lay for a moment longer listening to it , then opened them and then his uncle stood silhouetted against the light beyond the footboard in that utter that complete that absolute silence now with nothing in it now but the breathing of darkness and the tree-frogs and bugs : no fleeing nor repudiationnor for this moment more even urgency anywhere in the room or outside it either above or below or before or behind the tiny myriad beast-sounds and the vast systole and diastole of summer night . It 's gone , ' he said . Yes , ' his uncle said . They 're probably all in bed asleep by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dark to chop wood for tomorrow 's breakfast too . ' Which made once though still he did n't move . They ran , ' he said . No , ' his uncle said . It was more than that . ' ' They ran , ' he said . They reached the point wherep197there was nothing left for them to do but admit that they were wrong . So they ran home . ' ' At least they were moving , ' his uncle said : which made twice : who had n't even needed the first cue since not only the urgency the need the necessity to move again or rather not really to have stopped moving at all at that moment four or five or six hours or whatever it had been ago when he really believed he was going to lie down for only fifteen minutes ( and which incidentally knew fifteen minutes whether lie apparently did or not ) had n't come back , it had never been anywhere to come back from because it was still there , had been there all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bizarre phantasmagoriae whose ragtag and bobends still befogged him , with or among which he had wasted nearer fifteen hours than fifteen minutes , it was still there or at least his unfinished part in it which was not even a minuscule but rather a minutecule of his uncle 's and the sheriff 's in the unfinishability of Lucas Beauchamp and Crawford Gowrie since as far as they knew before he lost track this morning neither of them knew what they were going to do next even before Hampton had disposed of what little of evidence they had by giving it back to old one-armed pistol Gowrie where even two children and an old woman could n't get it back this time ; the need not to finish anything but just to keep moving not even to remain where they were but just desperately to keep up with it like having to run on a treadmill not because you wanted to be where the treadmill was but simply not to be flung pell mell still running frantically backward off the whole stage out of sight , and not waiting static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explode him up into motion but rather already in endless motion like the treadmill 's endless band less than an inch 's fraction above the ultimate point of his nose and chest where the first full breath would bring him into its snatching orbit , himself lying beneath it like a hobo trapped between the rails under a speeding train , safe only so long as he did not move . So he moved ; he said ' Time : ' swinging his legs over : ' What time is it ? I said fifteen minutes . You prom-ised -- 'It 's only nine-thirty , ' his uncle said . ' Plenty of time for a shower and your supper too . They wont leave before we get there . ' ' They ? ' he said : up onto his bare feet ( he had not undressedexcept his shoes and sox ) already reaching for his slippers . ' You 've been back to town . Before we get there ? We 're not going with them ? ' ' No , ' his uncle said . ' It 'll take both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to meet us at the office . So move along now ; she 's probably already waiting for us . ' ' Yes , ' he said . But he was already unfastening his shirt and his belt and trousers too with the other hand , all ready to step in one motion out of both . And this time it was laughing . It was all right . You could n't even hear it . ' So that was why , ' he said . ' So their women would n't have to chop wood in the dark with half-awake children holding lanterns . ' ' No , ' his uncle said . ' They were not running from Lucas . They had forgotten about him ' That 's exactly what I 'm saying , ' he said . ' They did n't even wait to send him a can of tobacco and say It 's all right , old man , everybody makes mistakes and we wont hold this one against you . ' P199Was that what you wanted ? ' his uncle said . The can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it would n't . Which is one reason why Lucas will ultimatelyget his can of tobacco ; they will insist on it , they will have to . He will receive installments on it for the rest of his life in this country whether he wants them or not and not just Lucas but Lucas : Sambo since what sets a man writhing sleepless in bed at night is not havinginjured his fellow so much as having been wrong ; the mere injury ( if he can not justify it with what he calls logic ) he can efface by destroying the victim and the witnessesbut the mistake is his and that is one of his cats which he always prefers to choke to death with butter . So Lucas will get his tobacco . He wont want it of course and he 'll try to resist it . But he 'll get it and so we shall watch right here in Yoknapatawpha County the ancient oriental relationship between the savior and the life he saved turned upside down : Lucas Beauchamp once the slave of any white man within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant over the whole county 's white conscience . And they  --  Beat One and Two and Three and Five  --  knew that too so why take time now to send him a ten-cent can of tobacco when they have got to spend the balance of their lives doing it ? So they had dismissed him for the time . They were not running from him , they were running from Crawford Gowrie ; they simply repudiated not even in horror but in absoluteunanimity a shall-not and should-not which without any warning whatever turned into a must-not . Thou shalt not kill you see  --  no accusative , heatless : a simple moral precept ; we have accepted it in the distant anonymityof our forefathers , had it so long , cherished it , fed it , kept the sound of it alive and the very words them-P200selves unchanged , handled it so long that all the corners are now worn smoothly off ; we can sleep right in the bed with it ; we have even distilled our own antidotes for it as the foresighted housewife keeps a solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratpoison ; as familiar as grandpa 's face , as unrecognisable as grandpa'sface beneath the turban of an Indian prince , as abstractas grandpa 's flatulence at the family supper-table ; even when it breaks down and the spilled blood stands sharp and glaring in our faces we still have the precept , still intact , still true : we shall not kill and maybe next time we even wont . But thou shall not kill thy mother 's child . It came right down into the street that time to walk in broad daylight at your elbow , did n't it ? ' ' So for a lot of Gowries and Workitts to burn Lucas Beauchamp to death with gasoline for something he did n't even do is one thing but for a Gowrie to murder his brother is another . ' ' Yes , ' his uncle said . ' You cant say that , ' he said . ' Yes , ' his uncle said . ' Thou shalt not kill in precept and even when you do , precept still remains unblemished and scarless : Thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont . But Gowrie must not kill Gowrie 's brother : no maybe about it , no next time to maybe not Gowrie kill Gowrie because there must be no first time . And not just for Gowrie but for all : Stevens and Mallison and Edmonds and McCaslin too ; if we are not to hold to the belief that that point not just shall not but must not and can not come at which Gowrie or Ingrum or Stevens or Mallison may shed Gowrie or Ingrum or Stevens or Mallison blood , how hope ever to reach that one where Thou shalt not kill at all , whereP201Lucas Beauchamp 's life will be secure not despite the fact that he is Lucas Beauchamp but because he is ? ' ' So they ran to keep from having to lynch Crawford Gowrie , ' he said . ' They would n't have lynched Crawford Gowrie , ' his uncle said . ' There were too many of them . Do nt you remember , they packed the street in front of the jail and the Square too all morning while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back without bothering him at all ? ' ' They were waiting for Beat Four to come in and do it . ' Which is exactly what I am saying  --  granted for the moment that that 's true . That part of Beat Four composedof Gowries and Workitts and the four or five others who would n't have given a Gowrie or Workitt either a chew of tobacco and who would have come along just to see the blood , is small enough to produce a mob . But not all of them together because there is a simple numerical point at which a mob cancels and abolishes itself , maybe because it has finally got too big for darkness , the cave it was spawned in is no longer big enough to conceal it from light and so at last whether it will or no it has to look at itself , or maybe because the amount of blood in one human body is no longer enough , as one peanut might titillate one elephant but not two or ten . Or maybe it 's because man having passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption , metabolism , then having got too large even for mass becomes man again conceptible of pity and justice and conscience even if only in the recollection of his long painful aspiration toward them , toward that something anyway of one serene universal light . ' P202'So man is always right , ' he said . No , ' his uncle said . ' He tries to be if they who use him for their own power and aggrandisement let him alone . Pity and justice and conscience too  --  that belief in morethan the divinity of individual man ( which we in Americahave debased into a national religion of the en raps in which man owes no duty to his soul because he hasbeen absolved of soul to owed -- to and instead is static heir at birth to an inevictible quit-claimaradio and an old-age pension ) but in the divinity of his continuity as Man ; think how easy it would have been for them to attend to Crawford Gowrie : no mob moving fast in darkness watching constantly over its shoulder but one indivisible public opinion : that peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really know the peanut had even actually been there since the main reason for a mob is that the individual red hand which actually snapped the thread may vanish forever into one inviolable confraternityof namelessness : where in this case that one would have had no more reason to lie awake at night afterward than a paid hangman . They did n't want to destroy CrawfordGowrie . They repudiated him . If they had lynched him they would have taken only his life . What they really did was worse : then deprived him to the full extent of their capacity of his citizenship in man . ' He did n't move yet . You 're a lawyer . ' Then he said , They were not running from Crawford Gowrie or Lucas Beauchamp either . They were running from themselves . They ran home to hide their heads under the bedclothes from their own shame . ' Exactly correct , ' his uncle said . Have n't I been saying that all the time ? There were too many of them . ThisP203time there were enough from shame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mob 's : which ( the mob ) be- cause of its smallness and what it believed was its secret- ness and tightness and what it knew to be its absolute lack of trust in one another , would have chosen the quick and simple alternative of abolishing knowledge of the shame by destroying the witness to it . So as you like to put t t hey ran . ' Leaving you and Mr Hampton to clean up the vomit , which even dogs do nt do . Though of course Mr Hamptonis a paid dog and I reckon you might be called one too .  --  Because do nt forget Jefferson either , ' he said . They were clearing off out of sight pretty fast too . Of course some of them could n't because it was still only the middle of the afternoon so they could n't shut up the stores and run home too yet ; there still might be a chance to sell each other a nickel 's worth of something . ' I said Stevens and Mallison too , ' his uncle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton either . Becausesomebody had to finish it , somebody with a strong enough stomach to mop a floor . The sheriff to catch ( or try to or hope to or whatever it is you are going to do ) the murderer and a lawyer to defend the lynchers . ' Nobody lynched anybody to be defended from it , ' his uncle said . All right , ' he said . Excuse them then . ' Nor that either , ' his uncle said . I 'm defending Lucas Beauchamp.g 'm defending Sambolfrom the North and East and West  --  the outlanders who will fling him decadesback not merely into injustice but into grief and agony and violence too by forcing on us laws based on the idea that man 's injustice to man can be abolished overnight by police . Sambo will suffer it of course ; there are not enough of him yet to do anything else . And he will endure it , absorb it and survive because he is Sambo and has that capacity ; he will even beat us there because he has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back decades and what he survives to may not be worth having because by that time divided we may have lost America . ' But you 're still excus'ng it . ' No , ' his uncle said . only say that the injustice is ours , the South 's . We must expiate and abolish it ourselves , alone and without help nor even ( with thanks ) adviceDWe owe that to Lucas whether he wants it or not ( and this Lucas anyway wont ) not because of his past since a man or a race either if he 's any good can survive his past without even needing to escape from it and not because of the high quite often only too rhetoricalrhetoric of humanity but for the simple indubitable practical reason of his future : that capacity to survive and absorb and endure and still be steadfast . ' All right , ' he said again . You 're still a lawyer and they still ran . Maybe they intended for Lucas to clean it up since he came from a race of floor-moppers . Lucas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then for his money and they even elected you to a salary too . Did they think to tell you how to do it ? what to use for bait to get Crawford Gowrie tocome in and say All right , boys , I pass . Deal them again . - Or were they too busy being  --  being ... His uncle said quietly : Righteous ? ' - Now he completely stopped . But only for a second . He said , They ran , ' calm and completely final , not even contemptuous , flicking the shirt floating away behindP205him and at the same moment dropping the trousers and stepping barefoot out of them in nothing now but shorts . Besides , it 's all right . I dreamed through all that ; I dreamed through them too , dreamed them away too ; let them stay in bed or milking their cows before dark or chopping wood before dark or after or by lanterns or not lanterns either . Because they were not the dream ; I just passed them to get to the dream --  ' talking quitefast now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be too late : ' It was something . . . somebody .. . something about how maybe this was too much to expect of us , too much for people just sixteen or going on eighty or ninety or whatever she is to have to bear , and then right off I was answering what you told me , you remember , about the English boys not much older than me leading troops and flying scout aeroplanes in France in 1918 ? how you said that by 1918 all British officers seemed to be either subalterns of seventeen or one-eyed or one-armed or one-legged colonels of twenty-three ? '  --  checking then or trying to because he had got the warning at last quite sharp not as if he had heard suddenly in advance the words he was going to say but as if he had discovered suddenly not what he had already said but where it was going , what the ones he had already spoken were going to compel him to say in order bring them to a stop : but too late of course like mashing suddenlyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brake rod had snapped : only there was something else too --  I was trying . . . . ' and he stopped them at last feeling the hot hard blood burn all the way up his neck into his face and nowhere even to look not because he was standing there almost naked to begin with but because no clothes
