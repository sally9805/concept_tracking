Last week snow clogged Balkan mountain passes and the skies over Britain were stormy . But over the coast of Europe the R. A. F. pounded the invasion ports as it never had before ( see p. 30 ) , and in Africa British arms put Italy to a historic disgrace . The tempo of diplomacy also quickened . Europe 's statesmen played long-range power politics to pitch newer battlefronts on grounds of their own choosing . <P> Adolf Hitler 's chosen battleground is the British Isles . Both his Propaganda Minister , wry little Paul Joseph Goebbels , and his Deputy Party Leader , hairy Rudolph Hess , warned Britain last week that the blow was coming soon . Dr. Goebbels ' foreboding was particularly ominous . All enemies of the Fuhrer are given a last warning , said he : " Bruning , Schuschnigg , Benes , Beck , Daladier and Reynaud all received that warning . Mr. Churchill belongs to that category . . . and Germany only grants him a last respite before the sentence is executed . " <P> There was little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a preliminary to a planned invasion . But there was also little doubt that Hitler would go through with the invasion only if , after the Schrecklichkeit , he believed it had a 90% chance of success . And so Hitler was busy last week on other fronts , both to stabilize them for the attack on Britain and to prepare new battlegrounds if that fails . <P> On the French front he suddenly backed down on his demands for use of the naval base at Bizerte and for reinstatement of Pierre Laval ( see p. 24 ) . This made for temporary stability behind his front against the British Isles . <P> On the Balkan front Adolf Hitler gave a neat illustration of his Mephistophelean trick of making politicians so indebted to him for their power that he can count on their absolute loyalty . Bulgaria 's Minister of Agriculture Ivan Bagrianoff was , until last week , in a very strong position . He was popular with the peasants , who form 82% of Bulgaria 's population . He was popular with King Boris , who last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request . And he was popular with Hitler , whose outstanding protagonist in Bulgaria he was . Last week , most probably at Hitler 's request , Minister Bagrianoff presented a demand to King Boris that German troops be given the freedom of Bulgaria . The King refused and Bagrianoff resigned . Next day Boris decorated him with the Cross of St. Alexander , which is usually given to politicians who have permanently retired . <P> But about that time Bulgaria 's railroads began canceling passenger and freight schedules , clearing the way for troop movements . The Bulgarian Minister to Germany , Parvan Draganoff , hurried to Sofia on one of the few trains still running . What he had in his brief case may have been a demand , not only for the passage of German troops through Bulgaria , but also for Ivan Bagrianoff 's reinstatement in the Cabinet . If Bagrianoff becomes Premier or Foreign Minister of Bulgaria , Bagrianoff and Bulgaria will be Hitler 's . <P> Hitler can use Bulgaria as a springboard to attack either Greece or the Near East , where he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain by next autumn .
