txt THE PRICE BREAK on farm staples spurs grain storage legislation . Look for a big push in Congress to sprinkle the midwest with thousands of governmentsponsored bins for storing future crops . Hearings on proposals for such a program will start tomorrow before the potent Senate Agriculture Committee . Farm legislators have a twofold plan . First they will drive hard for quick action on an " emergency ? storage law to give shelter to 1949 crops . Then attention will be turned to a long-term scheme to house vast quantities of key crops under a projected " stockpiling " program . It 's on lack of storage that the pricepropping program is bumping into trouble . To get official price-support loans , commodities must be properly stored . Last year an estimated half-billion bushels of grain were without storage for long periods . Prospects are that some 300 million to 500 million bushels wo n't get cover in 1949 if wheat and corn crops are as large at expected . The long-tcrm " stockpiling " plans are expansive . Officials talk of eventually keeping on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat , and .3 million to 5 million bales of cotton . ? ? * COMMODITY BARTER deals are eyed as outlets for raNelling farm surpluses .

Excess crops would be exchanged , it is hoped . : or strategic commodities wanted by the government under its stockpiling of materials essential in a military emergency . Legislators soon will consider a bill to Allow the Commodity Credit Corp . thus to get rid of corn , wheat , cotton and other Items it acquires under the domestic price support program Big question mark : Will the C.C.C . be empowered to dispose of surpluses at barter values below the price they cost the government ? If not , foreigners are likely to back away from the bartering . CHEAPER DRINKS are n't promised by the tumble th grain prieee . The cost of rye and corn , which make rye whisky and bourbon , are actually small factors in the price of a bottle of spirits . Distillers explain- it tie v:Ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5. galt5ns of whisky . ' Thus a 50-cents-a-bushel ? drop in the price of corn means a cut of possibly 10 cents a gallon . or about two cents a bottle . on whisky making costs The cost breakdown on a bottle of whisky retailing at 53.75 in New York goes like this : Federal and state taxes account for 52.27 . The other $1.48 covers everything else ? grain , cooperage , packaging , transportation . advertising and distribution . Of the $1 48 only about 6 to 8 cents goes for grain . The tax bite on the nation 's drinking budget has swollen a lot since pre-war days . The present 32.27 tax total in the F3.15-priced bottle in New York compares with a 1941 tax of only 96 cents . ? ? ? BUSY liENS laid a mountainous 4.5 billion eggs last month .

The grapefruit total is expected to be 48 million boxes , compared with 61 million last season . ? ? ? JUTE COMPETITION scares ' cotton belt congressmen . The House Agriculture Committee recently heard a representative of a New York firm testify it plans to open a promotion campaign to boost . domestic use of burlap ( made of jute ) bags . Result : Legislators talk of possible import duties on jute to protect ailing cotton . Most recent statistics place 1947 imports of the bagging staple at 40,492 tons , some 15% above pre-war 1939 ? ? ? COCOA PRICES continue to crumble as consumer manufacturers balk at buying . For few commodities has the deflation been so swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks . The current collapse follows a steep decline c ? . ? er recent months . At the 1947 peak cocoa sold in New York for 53 cents a pound . By the middle of last November It had droppe. to 40 cents . Yesterday 's price was 19v ? cents . Behind the break has been sagging consumption plus a pick-up in cocoa production prospects With the public resisting high confection prices . U. S. cocoa processors have been buying skimpily for months : and the U. S. consumes half the world 's cocoa . The big producers are west Africa and Brazil . In recent weeks the estimate on this season 's west African output has been lifted 5% . The Brazilian crop looks 12% better than In early January . Food men think cocoa 's price may not be through sliding . Compared to most other commodities , it 's still high . The current 19q cents a pound is four times the 1939 average of less than five cents a pound .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
