One day in 1937 , a woman with an enormous cancer of the cheek walked into the office of Dr. Emanuel Louis Stammer of Queens , N.Y . The woman said she had been given many X-ray and radium treatments at Queens General Hospital ; none of them seemed to do any good . <P> Dr. Stammer remembered a " cancer salve " that another patient had given him . He said he had been informed that it contained zinc sulfate , galanga ( a Chinese spice ) , bloodroot and ordinary lanolin . Dr. Stammer , no cancer specialist , had not analyzed the salve . He did not know what effect it would have , but he tried it out on himself to make sure it was harmless .

But last week the Regents filed notice of intention to appeal to a higher court . Dr. Stammer 's salve , said the Regents ' consulting scientists , was known to be entirely ineffectual ( if it really contained the ingredients he thought it did ) . The cure , they claimed , was either : 1 ) a delayed reaction from the patient 's early X-ray and radium treatments , or 2 ) a spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
