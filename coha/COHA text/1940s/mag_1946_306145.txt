Pro hockey had become more violently rowdy than ever . There was a rash of sprains , broken bones , and bashed heads , and player tempers showed no signs of cooling . <P> At midseason , three steamed-up teams were virtually tied for the National Hockey League lead , with a fourth within easy swatting distance .

Potent Detroit flattened the Boston Bruins , but lost capable Syd Howe ( possible fractured rib ) in the business of winning . <P> Just how the Chicago Black Hawks stayed with the pace nobody knew . But it was no secret that their tiny team had worked wonders with speed and power plays . The Chicagoans , though dominating the scoring race , had been mauled physically more than any other club .

But the Bruins had their own invalid problems with hotheaded Milt Schmidt ( groin injury ) and shrewd Bill Cowley ( broken hand ) . <P> Paradoxically , the only teams up to full strength were the Rangers and the Maple Leafs , both hopelessly bogged in the league cellar . But they could offer home-town fans plenty of real blood &; thunder on the artificial ice-and the rabid fans ate it up .
