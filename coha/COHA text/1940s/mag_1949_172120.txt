( See Cover ) <P> The President of the U.S. this week asked Congress for $1,130,000,000 to help arm America 's European allies . Said Lieut . General Albert Wedemeyer , U.S. Army Director of Plans &; Operations : " This is one of the critical moments of our history . I mean that . " <P> " We Prefer Death . " The Military Assistance Program ( M.A.P. ) faced a far harder fight and a closer vote than the North Atlantic Treaty ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Opponents of the arms plan say that it will cost too much , and that it might provoke Soviet Russia to attack . The plan 's advocates reply that a Communist victory in Europe would be far more expensive for the U.S. , and that Soviet Russia is provoked to aggressive acts by the weakness , not by the strength , of the non-Communist world . <P> The Atlantic pact would be meaningless unless the European allies were able to defend themselves when attacked . They had the will to do this , and the manpower ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the weapons soon enough . U.S. refusal to provide them would have a shattering effect on Western Europe 's morale . <P> Western Europe 's nations know that the U.S. would come to their aid if the Russians attacked ; they also know that , unless they have arms at least to delay the <P> Russians , U.S. aid could not arrive before they were defeated . The U.S. would then again have to liberate the Continent . After another war and Russian rule , not much would be left to liberate . Said a Belgian staff colonel : " We are not interested in being liberated after an occupation . Rather than this we prefer death . " <P> " Girl Not Like Drink . " Western Europeans last week relaxed on the beaches , went fishing or drank beer in the warm evenings . But amid this summer somnolence , people anxiously waited to see how the great debate in Washington would go . The man who perhaps waited most anxiously of all was a beak-nosed French general , eight times wounded and 41 times decorated , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Lattre de Tassigny is commander in chief -theoretically-of West Europe 's land forces , and the man to whom the most crucial task would fall if the Russians attacked tomorrow . He is also the most striking member of a strange military organism known as Uniforce , which for nine months has quietly tried to plan the defense of Western Europe . The progress &; problems of Uniforce throw a light on the issue before the U.S. Congress . <P> The seat of Uniforce is Fontainebleau , the carved and corniced residence of French kings . Sky-blue R.A.F. uniforms stand guard side by side with French khaki . British and French are making honest efforts to understand each other . The Scottish reel , introduced by highlanders stationed at Fontainebleau , has been taken up enthusiastically by French and Belgian soldiers ; Scotsmen , though , are still shocked to hear their reeling allies cry " Hola ! " instead of " Och ! " A correspondent last week overheard the following conversation outside a guardroom between an R.A.F. corporal and a French private : <P> Britain : A quelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> Britain : Quand partay voo ? <P> France : Bouge pas , moi . <P> Britain : Non , I mean ce soir , quand voo partay.
