txt In a reply to the radio acceptance speech of former Justice Lloyd Church , Democratic nominee for Controller , Mayor La Guardia declared yesterday that the principal issue of the , campaign was whether the voters of New York City wanted an orderly handling of city finances or a return to the confusion and ineptitude of former Tammany administrations . Talking to reporters before leaving La Guardia Field for Washington by airplane , the Mayor denied Mr. Church 's charge that his administration was responsible for continued high real estate assessments and defended Controller Joseph D. , candidate with the Mayor for re-election , whom Mr. Church had characterized as " only an echo " of the Mayor . " Now we have example Number 2 of complete ignorance of city affairs . " the Mayor said , referring to his comment on the radio speech of District Attorney William O'Dwyer , Democratic Mayoralty nominee a week ago , when he said Mr. O'Dwyer had received incorrect figures on municipal expenditures . " Lulu Lloyd , the lollipop boy for Tammy Hall , speaks out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut in Assessments " Well , they ( the assessments ) are several billion dollars less than they were when I took office . We have reduced total assessments since 1934 by several billion dollars . We will itemize this in the course of the campaign . " I thank him ( Mr. Church ) for bringing the courts into this subject , for we will be able to show how the courts jump assessments when the city buys . " Now Lulu Lloyd says that the present Controller , , and the Mayor vote alike on the Board of Estimate . That is correct , because we are guided only by the best interests of the city . Yes , indeed , and what a scandal it all was . Controller Craig had to take orders from Boss Murphy and John Hylan had to take orders from Boss McCooey , and , when the two bosses could not agree on spoils , their two men could not vote alike . " Controller Berry had to take orders from Brooklyn and Jimmy Walker made no bones - about going along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talking to each other for several years . " Now what Mr. Church says is most significant . The campaign has n't even started yet and aRparently there is already a difference between Parlay Christy Sullivan and Grabby Kelly of Brooklyn . Church apparently already is giving notice that the city could expect a return to the disorder , confusion , ineptitude and splf-ishness of a typical Tammany Board of // HIGH ASSESSMENT DENIED BY MAYOR // Estimate . That is exactly the issue . " Controller knows finance and the Mayor knows the city , and the result is visible all over New York City . We are very proud of our constructive accomplishments , possible only when Mayor and the Controller are not required to take orders from political bosses . " Comment by Lloyd Church In commenting on Mayor La Guardia 's remarks Mr. Church said : " The Mayor on his departure for another trip out of town resorted to the calling of names and the rattling of dead men 's bones instead of answering the charges I made in my acceptance speech . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore boasted that he can outdemagogue any demagogue , but demagoguery and evasion will not fool the voter who is suffering from overtaxation . " " The Mayor 's statement demonstrates the truth of what I say , " Mr. Church added . " The present Controller thinks and speaks only at the dictation of the Mayor . The present Controller can not use his own mind or voice in the campaign in which I am running against him for Controller . " City Councilman Louis Cohen , secretary of the O'Dwyer-ChurchFertig committee , replied to Mayor La Guardia 's criticism of the acceptance speech of Mr. Church in a statement issued at the headquarters of the Democratic candidates in the Chanin Building , Mr. Cohen said " Name calling and slander are only attempts to becloud the issue . It is evident that the Mayor is either unable or unwilling to answer the charges made by Justice Church . These will be elaborated upon in greater detail as the campaign progresses . There are many cases in this city of unfair overassessments and many cases of assessment reductions for Mayoralty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future to reach into the cemeteries to avoid answering specific proven allegations against the Fusion administration . " The selection of Carl J. Austrian as chairman of the Lawyers Committee for the Election of O'Dwyer , Church and Fertig was announced . Mr. Austrian , a lawyer , is senior vice president and acting president of the American Jewish Committee , treasurer of the General Jewish Council and a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital .

The Democratic First Judicial District Convention will be held tonight at Tammany Hall . at Tammany Hall . William C. Chanler , Corporation Counsel , also issued a statement last night denying the charge of Mr. Church that the city law department had hindered taxpayers in obtaining relief or that the number of taxpayers seeking relief from overassessment had increased . Mr. Chanler said that his department during 1940 had disposed of 9,293 tax writs and that the highest number ever disposed of by any of his Tammany predecessors in a year was 917 in 1933 . Mr. Chanler also asserted that Mr. Church was incorrect in asserting that the Supreme Court was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation Counsel said that this formerly was the case but that now , through the efforts of Justice in Manhattan and the Bronx , and Justice Lockwood in Brooklyn , presiding in Special Term , the court calendars in tax certiorari cases had been brought up-to-date .
