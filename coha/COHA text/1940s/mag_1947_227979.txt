After covering the U.N . General Assembly , Izvestia Correspondent Victor Poltoratsky wrote for his paper the kind of ill-natured piece about New York City that visitors have been writing ever since Dickens . From Moscow last week , New York Timesman Drew Middleton cabled a retort : <P> " Moscow does not look like a big rolling mill , which is the way Izvestia 's writer described New York . Once you get outside the center of the city , it looks like the biggest village in the world . . . . The truth is , the town is a little big for its britches . When the Bolsheviks made it the nation 's capital , the population jumped by hundreds of thousands . . . . There just is n't any place to put most of them without doubling up , so the family that has a room of its own is well off . <P> " Unlike Paris , Moscow is noisy without being gay . Most Russian drivers operate with one hand on the horn , so the traffic makes up in sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people march along with set faces , grimly determined to get where they are going . Thoughtful observers sometimes wonder why . There is n't any racial discrimination in Moscow , and the sexes are equal . This morning , women were out chipping ice off the streets just like men . <P> " New York is a rude city , but it is n't the only one . Moscow 's subway , which compares favorably in service with Manhattan 's Seventh Avenue line , is just about as crowded in rush hours as is that line 's Times Square station . I 've occasionally heard someone say ' Sorry ' in New York , but not in Moscow . You do hear a lot of stuff , such as ' Citizens , stop shoving , ' and ' Citizen , you 're standing on my feet . ' . . . <P> " I see that . . . some operators in a clothing store shook down our visitor for $1.50 to get his new trousers fixed . When I asked a Russian friend about this , he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The ' shake ' is not unknown in Moscow , as most foreigners find out . I can compliment Mr. Poltoratsky 's wisdom in buying a pair of trousers in New York . The Russians turn out millions of pairs a year , but their bottoms all have a tendency to bell out , like the ones Harold Teen used to wear , and still does , for all I know . "
