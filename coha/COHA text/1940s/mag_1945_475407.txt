of culture . It has been dinned into us for a couple of centuries by the arbiters of taste that American culture is inferior to that of Europe , less sophisticated , more provincial ; and they long ago so shook our confidence in ourselves that in what we recognize as cultural matters most of us are still easily Ied wherever the cultural faddists want to take us . But where mechanical things are concerned , we fee/ sure of ourselves . When the arbiters of taste begin to talk about the machine , we are on common ground and not afraid to talk back . And when we hear people talking , as some of the modern architects have done , about " machines for living , " it gets our dander up ! We know about machines and we know ? or think we do ? about living , and we have pretty definite convictions on how far we want one to intrude on the other . We want a machine that will keep us warm in winter and cool in summer . We want machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook our roast . We recognize that there is work to be done in the home as well as at the office or the factory ; and just as we accept the idea that the office or factory should be mechanized and efficient , so we accept the idea that the kitchen ? which is the housewife 's machine shop ? should be mechanized and efficient . The better organized it is , the cleaner it is , the more quickly she can get through with her work there and get about her life . Her escape from the kitchen is like her husband 's escape from the factory . She wants to move out of the confinements ofwork and its impersonal trappings into an atmosphere of relaxation with very personal trappings . As a homemaker she considers it her function to make the house comfortable , " homey , " a reflection of her personality and her femininity . Furthermore , she wants to look well in it . There are n't many women who look their most enchanting against a spare and simple background , no matter how handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be as desirable as beauty , but it is a commodity that we have lots of in this country , that we set great store by , and that is going to prevail if men have anything to say about it and if women can still capitalize on it . Women are going to continue to insist on a setting that shows their prettiness to the best advantage . Tell a woman that she must five in a machine , and she will revolt . Le Corbusier , the Swiss architect who is the idol of the functionalists , could have done the cause of modern architecture no greater disservice than by inventing the phrase " machine for living . " It sums up all too succinctly the basic theories embodied in the modern house and puts them in a package so uninviting that few people want to have anything to do with it . III N OT ONLY have the modern architects failed to understand the limits of our zeal for mechanical efficiency ; they have also , thus far , tended to take a somewhat arbitrary view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have functional houses , they have interpreted our human functions too narrowly . It is as if they had designed houses to accommodate part of our human nature and had left the rest of it with no place to go ? almost as if they did n't approve of it and preferred to exclude it . Let us look for a moment at these houses , outside and in . The outward and visible signs of modern domestic architecture have n't made much impression on our landscape as yet , though the inward and spiritual impact has been strong . There are still very few houses in America that the critics and architects classify as really modern . A catalogue published by the Museum of Modern Art lists less than a hundred and fifty in all the northeastern states . This means modern inside as well as outside , and excludes " modernistic " ( debased modern ) and " modernesque " ( debased " modernistic " ) . So far as the externals are concerned , the modern architect has devised a formula as doctrinaire in its attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation were in their neo-classicism . The strip window , the flat roof , the flush doorway without moldings , emphasis on the horizontal rather than the vertical , the glass wall , dependence for abstract composition on the juxtaposition of flat areas and solids : these are the stock in trade of the modern architect , the union suit in which he clothes , skin tight , the functional plan of the interior . Even a formula which frees the architects from traditional cliches , as does this one , runs the risk of becoming hidebound , and its application to all sorts of architectural problems in all sorts of climates seems as nonsensical as the traditions from which it sought to escape . Furniture designed to fit the modern house formula follows a similar established doctrine . A chair , for example , is conscientiously designed for what is considered by the designer to be a normal , functional fanny , for a healthy position for relaxation or eating or working , and for the conformation of the average body . The results are frequently handsome . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assimilate with older furniture ) . The furniture is less frequently comfortable ; but that is be-cause few of us have average figures , and nobody likes to sit in one position very long no matter how good it is for him , and comfort is not only a physical feeling but an optical illusion as well . ( Lots of modern furniture which is actually comfortable looks as if it had been designed for discomfort . ) Modern chairs are delightful so long as you give yourself to them utterly ; but try to shift your position ? to sit eagerly forward in a relaxing-chair , or to lounge limply in a brisk working chair ? and you are in trouble . Some , like the Aalto occasional plywood chair with no back legs , are out-and-out mantraps ; lean forward ? and they may abruptly pitch you on the floor . The trouble with such items of furniture is that they have not allowed for the part of human nature that likes perversely to stay in one place while doing different things . Their designers in effect insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and begin to take an active interest in life , we should celebrate the occasion by moving to another chair . jr is the interior plan of the house that IL interests the modern architects most keenly ( " the exterior grows normally from the plan " ) , and it is in devising the plan that they have made the greatest incursions into our lives . The " open plan " in which room runs into room , in order to give an illusion of space , is part of the doctrine that has spilled over from the functional house into all sorts of compromise dwellings . It is frequently handsome , giving as it does a look of unconfining airiness . But it sacrifices privacy unless the family can afford a large and rambling structure . In the small open-plan house , those of us who like to go into a room and shut the door against the children 's racket have no place to go when we want to read , except the bathroom or the bedroom ; and pleasanf as either may be , reading is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always an expensive luxury , but it is prized by every member of the family except young children ; and most of us are willing to sacrifice space for a place in which we can shut ourselves up . If we want to be moral about it and architects are now moralists ? we can say that it is better for our daughter to have a room in which she can entertain her friends than to go out on the town . The New England village house and farmhouse always had a parlor , often the most elegant room in the house , where the best furniture and the family mementos were stored , while the family lived in the kitchen . It was not reserved merely for funerals and calls from the clergyman ; it was there for escape , for courting , and for family dignity . It had a value that ca n't be explained in mere terms of spatial economy . The " open plan " does n't stop at the walls of the house . It brings the outdoors indoors . In a recent exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Modern Art , each of the ten houses seemed to have more glass walls than masonry . The glass in almost every case faced south in order to let in the maximum amount of sunlight during winter when the sun is low . Projecting eaves protected the rooms from too strong light in summer . The architects assume that we all want ? or ought to want ? all the daylight we can get , and that we want the illusion of space that comes from incorporating the outdoors into the living room . It is an assumption that goes back to the earliest experimenters in modern architecture . Le Corbusier , Mies Van Der Rohe , Gropius , and Oud rejected conventional fenestration to let the light pour in . ( The idea went along , chronologically , with the cult of nudism . ) It was , and still is , an appealing idea to any healthy city-dweller starved for natural light and sunshine . But it disregards the fact that for some people , at some times , enough is enough , especially if they live all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it disregards also our natural inclination to go home and shut the door behind us , to shut Out the world and enter our own private domain . If we want to look at the outdoors we have only to walk to the window , but to have the outdoors always peering at us , even through a curtained wall , is a little embarrassing . A similar arbitrariness appears once more in the matter of storage space . The architects know us very well statistically . They know precisely how many objects anaverage family in a given income bracket has to store ? how many bicycles , trunks , shovels , croquet sets ? and how big they are . Storage space is planned accordingly . The " storage wall , " for example , is based on the conclusion that the average small family has about a thousand small objects not more than twelve inches in depth to keep hidden . This wall , the principle of which dates back at least to the Renaissance and has been in constant use as a wall with cupboards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life magazine ; the basic difference is that theirs is made of movable units and you can get at it from both sides . It assumes that we are naturally tidy , and would rather keep things neatly in a wall than toss them into the cellar , the attic , or the hall closet , and also that we resolutely throw away the things we no longer need . These assumptions are flattering . But having eliminated the cellar in favor of storage closets and " utility rooms " ( in which the furnace and other mechanical necessities are hidden ) , and having eliminated the attic in favor of a flat roof , the architects are forcing us to get rid of our pasts . They are also forcing us to become men and women of decision , always ready to make up our minds whether we should throw away those outmoded galoshes , that outgrown kiddie-car , that unsuccessful oil portrait of grandfather , and that once convenient box for nursing bottles , or hang on to them in case the day might come when they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attic , the cellar , and the cavernous closet were wonderful devices for enabling us to postpone such decisions indefinitely in an unpredictable world . The architects are also depriving us , incidentally , of a place to dry vegetables under a hot roof , and of a place to store root crops and jellies in the damp darkness below ground . Presumably they expect us to live on frozen foods , slough off the past , and ? as really modern men and women should ? look only to the future . But is n't that cramping some of us just a little to make us fit the house 's functions , instead of making the house fit ours ? Again , some of us arc thoroughly neat , some of us are neat only on the surface , and some of us are downright untidy , In a modern house there is n't much choice . Its economy of design , its complete rationality , requires that we either be neat or look as if we were living in a rather messy breadbox . There is a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the average family were able to keep everything in its place ! And the modern house does n't let us improvise places to hide things without destroying the symmetry or planned asymmetry on which the character of the structare depends for its looks . There is no space for an extra cupboard where it would n't stick out like a sore thumb , or for an extra bookcase ? especially if you want to put it against that ingenious but uneasy invention , the movable wall . T IlE ARBItRARINESS , like the open plan , carries over into the outdoors , beyond the edges of the lawn , into the community . In the eyes of the modern architect-planners , each house , each multiple dwelling ( polite term for apartment house ) should be related to the others in the most economical manner contributing to the good life . This principle of theirs is sometimes somewhat obscured , for people unfamiliar with it , by the fact that at present there are so few authentic modern houses that each one seems strikingly unharmonious with its neighbors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural orthodoxy . But the architect-planners are as vibrant in their enthusiasm for the unified community as are the politicians , real-estate operators , and speculators in their opposition . Now there is no question that there are great advantages in the elimination of undirected and thoughtless community development . But some of the planners have devised so many formulae for all sorts of community activities ? our health , our recreation , our shopping , our education , our transport , and sometimes , to some extent , even our political views ? that they seem intent on making us citizens of a regimented democracy , a community of " happy impersonality . " What matter if some of us would n't be caught dead in a community center ? They 'll make us take it , and like it . For they know what is ( rood for us . The blood that coursed through the veins of Le Corbusier , a man with an aesthetic and sociological vision , still palpitates in his disciples . He was impatient with man , his unreasonableness , his slowness to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , Le Corbusier believed that the realization of his aesthetic and sociological theories of how a man should live demanded " considerable sacrifices " but " modern man ought to find his houses habitable . " The zeal of the reformer is still in his disciples ' hearts , as it is in the hearts of most true artists . But the architect is differently situated from other artists . Once he has muscled in , it is next to impossible to get rid of him . The work that he produces stays there . IV taFt.at-s rr is partly because of the mod- ern architects ' overestimation of our American zest for mechanical efficiency and their underestimation of our zest for sentiment , tradition , and other disorderly perversities , that they have had a rocky road to travel . Their wares have not really caught on . For one thing , the hankers have not seemed to kindle with enthusiasm for the modern house . In many communities ? if zoning regulations do n't exclude modern houses entirely ? the man who wants to build one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage on such a house is not considered a good risk . According to the money-lenders , its resale value is not comparable to that of a semi-traditional house . The reasons are many and reasonably obvious . Not enough people have learned to like their looks . It is usually thought that most modern houses are built with a mathematician 's eye to the needs of one specific family and therefore wo n't be likely to fit other families . Modern houses do n't age gracefully : architecture which depends for its looks on simple surfaces shows the marks of age much sooner than architecture dependent upon broken surfaces . A crack in the stucco of an unbroken wall stands out like a scar on a maiden 's cheek . Furthermore , today 's modern has a way of becoming tomorrow 's modernistic . Stylistically it often ages as do the products of fashions and fads in the other arts , and only the very soundest and handsomest examples can stand the test of even a little time . Bankers , for good or evil , are less concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they tend to stand aloof . Buying a house is the biggest investment that most people ever make , and usually only the wealthy are willing to risk so much money on an experiment . Modern house construction has been and continues to be , a series of experiments ? with materials , with methods of building , with heating and cooling systems ? and thus the potential purchaser is in much the same position as when he is faced with buying a new make of automobile . He hesitates to buy " until the bugs have been taken out . " In some ways we are at about the same point with the modern house that our parents were with the automobile in , say , 1905 . If we buy , it 's a sporting matter and we expect to get out every few miles and look under the hood to see why it wo n't run . If we do n't like a car , we can turn it in ; it 's not so easy to get rid of a house . These are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been higher than its advantages warrant .. And there is another . Like the automobile , the machine for living depends upon " technically perfect use of materials . " So long as the materials have to be hand-tooled for every job the price is bound to be high . Low prices for modern houses will depend upon mass production of building materials and standardized specifications for all the important structural elements such as doors , windows , wall units , heating , and plumbing . So far all attempts to mass-produce modern prefabricated houses have been unsuccessful . At present , we must confess , it does n't look as if the demand would be created in the near future on a sufficient scale to make mass production possible . Projects such as Buckminster Fuller 's new prefabricated Dymaxion house , turned out by airplane factories , may have some success in meeting immediate postwar shortages ; but their staying powers are questionable in view of the rigidity of their pattern and their overt mechanization of living . Purely functional housing will probably find its best opportunities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential than they are in this country . And even in Europe and Japan there are likely to be concessions to traditional patterns of architecture ; by some curious reversion , thatched roofs might even turn up on the new houses which will replace the bombed-out homes of Devonshire . The international style may not prove as international as its name . THAT , THEN , are we likely to get , here in America ? Modern architecture , in its doctrinaire sense , has its best chance for survival in factories and office buildings and in government-planned and government-financed housing developments . As for apartment houses in cities and suburbs , these  - -  if the published drawings of new projects are a reliable indication ? will continue to be fancy , though the fanciness will incorporate some of modern architecture 's clich ? s and some of its functional advantages . The housing developments , especially the very low-cost ones in which simplicity is essential , may make the most of the looks inherent in economical distribution of functional elements ; or they may turn out , as much pre-war housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular cheerlessness . White-collar housing developments will probably continue to imitate in some degree our traditional village architecture ( New England , Virginia , or mission , depending on the location ) . Private building is likely either to stick to the old forms or to develop new forms incorporating the old and the modern in a crazy-quilt of happy hominess , and there wo n't be much that the modern architects can do about it . The dilemma of the architect is a tough one . He is an artist who can not operate without impinging on other people 's lives . He speaks a special language of aesthetics which it is difficult for him to translate to those less sensitive people , his clients . He is likely to feel that it is his responsibility to lead them to the well of beauty and , if they do n't want to drink , to duck their heads in it and hold them under . He is concerned , furthermore , with seeing that man should live not only beautifully but rationally , and this makes him an arbiter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed with us only if he imposes upon us , not only his momentary taste , but his theories of life , and in some degree sets a pattern for our waking and sleeping hours . Once we have delivered ourselves into his hands , we arc committed for years ; only the wealthy among us can afford to buy their way out . And if , sensing this , we hesitate , he is frustrated . The situation is an unhappy one . It is unhappy both for him and for us . For him , because he is condemned to the fate of the pioneer who hacks out the path to the promised land and who , if his sense of direction has anywhere gone astray , knows well that he will never reach it himself . For us , because this country will never develop a new and indigenous architectural style until architects and homeowners can learn to see eye to eye on the way in which men and women should live , and this will require much experimenting ; anything which delays the experimenting delays the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , we should be grateful that there are not only experimenters but some willing guinea pigs as well , For without both groups architecture as an art and a science would exhaust itself , and we should all have to go on living in variations of prototypes . Even if the modern architects have thus far been too hell-bent on mechanical efficiency and too sure they knew what was good for us , at least they have done much to liberate their profession from its onetime slavery to tradition . If they can relax their insistence upon a too narrow formula , they may be able , in due course , to liberate us too . AND NOW , if I can raise the money , and if there is an architect who will speak to me , I have a hillside in the Berkshires where I should like to build a modern house with more glass in it than you should throw a stone at . Most of my furniture is high Victorian , of which I am very fond , though I have a few Finnish and Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten years ago before I had children to be trapped by them . I have n't the slightest idea how many toys my children need , nor how many of their broken ones they will be willing to part with . I should like a nice dark cellar , though I have n't any idea what I will put in it . I do n't feel at home unless I have stairs to go up and down , and I want to be able to shut the doors on every room in the house . If the house looks as unreasonable as I feel about it , I 'll be perfectly willing to take the consequences .
