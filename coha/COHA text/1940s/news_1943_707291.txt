txt Captain Rickenbacker is the latest traveler to return to this country with a glowing report of the Soviet war effort . In addition , he finds important changes in progress within that country . In his judgment Russia is moving toward the " right , " which he explains means toward democracy , and , " in a sense , " capitalism . Like observations about the general trend in Russia have been made by many others , who have also stressed the Russian return to the ancient verities of patriotism , family and discipline . But what all this means to the average Russian in terms of concrete economic reality , by which communism attempts to justify itself , is explained in a recent survey by the authoritative London Economist . The Economist finds that , in contrast to the rapid increase in wages in the United States , some of which , like those of the miners , have doubled in the last six years , Russian wages have remained stationary even after the outbreak of the war . Only two categories , railway men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been granted substantial increases . For the rest , though the working day has lengthened to twelve hours , the national wage bill is not appreciably higher than it was before the war . As regards individual workers ' incomes , 300 rubles a month appears to be a substantial wage , earned by the bulk of the workers in the metal factories . Some 8 to 12 per cent earn more than 1,200 rubles , and the earnings of some Stakhanovites reach 4,000 rubles a month . The salaries of technical staffs vary from 1,000 to 6,000 and more rubles a month . The same differentiation exists in the Red Army , where the private gets 10 rubles , the lieutenant 1,000 rubles and the colonel 2,400 rubles a month . The corresponding pay in the American Army is 00 , *150 and $333 a month . There is no way of translating the ruble into dollar values except in purchasing power , and in Russia this purchasing power depends entirely on whether the wage-earner can buy in the workers ' shops , where prices are fixed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " free " market , ruled by the law of supply and demand . Thus one kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) of potatoes costs 2 rubles in the workers ' shops , but 20 rubles in the " free " market . Meat costs 10 rubles a kilogram in the first , but 180 to 300 rubles , or up to a month 's pay , in the latter . Butter costs 25 rubles , or one-twelfth of basic monthly pay , even in the controlled market , and 350 rubles in the " free . " The comparative American prices are *1.10 a kilogram for butter , 70.5 cents a kilogram for cheap meat cuts , and 8.8 cents per kilogram for potatoes . If at these prices " millions " of Americans are near starvation , as some of our domestic critics charge , it is difficult to understand how any Russians have survived . The " free " market is , incidentally , an essential part of Russia 's national economy . It is the market for the surplus products of the new Russian " Kulak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collective farm , he now has goods to sell , either from his own private land allotment or from the surplus products distributed among its workers by the collectives . Uusually he sells them in the " free " market at prices which have enabled many to accumulate substantial savings and to subscribe up to a million rubles ' worth of war bonds . But there has been no outcry of " profiteering " or " exploitation . " For such outcries are not and can not be permitted under a totalitarian planned economy because they reflect on the planners . It is no reflection on the labor and the heroism of the Russian people in this war to say that the system under which they have been living for the last twenty-five years has not worked out in the ' manner envisaged by the Bolshevist Founding Fathers , or reported by some of our more enthusiastic literati . Nor is it possible to blame everything on the war , because in all essential features the same situation prevailed before the war . We suspect that the American people still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because they can speak up and demand improvement where possible .
