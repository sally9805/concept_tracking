Last week the biennial convention of the Congregational and Christian Church met in the big brick First Congregational Church of Berkeley , Calif . Firmly rooted in town-meeting tradition , the individual congregations of the C. &; C. Church do their own thinking and talking . For this independence the retiring moderator , Dr. Oscar E. Maurer of New Haven , Conn. , last week took his fellow churchmen to mild task . " Much of our work , " said Moderator Maurer , " fails in effectiveness because we so generally prefer to do it separately , each in his own way . " <P> Dr. Maurer 's predecessor as moderator , famed Statistician Roger W. Babson , jumped on this statement with both feet . Cried white-goateed , spry old Businessman Babson , 1940 Presidential candidate of the Prohibition Party : " Congregationalism was the original Protestant denomination that fought for democracy , namely delegates from each church . Now they have only one delegate from five churches , and they say they have n't hotel space for more . All nonsense . " Businessman Babson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Politely but firmly the convention pigeonholed it . <P> The 980 delegates mildly condemned President Roosevelt 's appointment of Myron C. Taylor as his personal ambassador to the Vatican , pledged aid to war refugees , agreed that Congregationalist ministers ' salaries ( average : $1,640 ) are too low . Between sessions , they made earnest " trips of social exploration " through San Francisco 's Japanese and Chinese section , toured migrant camps ( said the prospectus : " Delegates to watch under bridges and beside roads for migrants , and show friendly spirit and talk to them " ) . <P> Two laymen led the field in the election for moderator : a stanch New Dealer , 71-year-old ex-Governor William E. Sweet of Colorado , and a 35-year-old Maine Republican , Ronald Bridges , brother of New Hampshire 's Senator H. Styles Bridges . Sweet won by 16 votes . Slight , precise Congregationalist Sweet retired from a thriving brokerage business in Denver in 1920 , " to give my full time to politics and religion , " believes in the " application of the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
