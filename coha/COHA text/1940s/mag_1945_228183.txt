Baldish , moustachioed Sir Adrian Boult , who heads the crack BBC Symphony Orchestra , boasts that " blood seldom flows at my rehearsals . " But last week his musicians were up in arms : bad blood was up , if not flowing . <P> Before guests invited to a BBC rehearsal in London 's Albert Hall , Sir Adrian told his men that they were " all too tired to play their best . " He advised them to emulate him by resting up weekends , specifically forbade golf , gardening and repair work on blitzed houses . " A little washing up " ( but not too much ) was sufficient exercise , he said . <P> The musicians were irate at being told off in public , but Sir Adrian budged not an inch : " If the public were eavesdropping they had no right at all . ... I was not nasty and I did not lose my temper , as perhaps I have to do once every five years . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
