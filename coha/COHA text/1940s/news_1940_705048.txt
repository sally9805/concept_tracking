txt Labor Unrest Reprobated Conscription Suggested for Forces in the Defense Industries To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There is a story of an old lady who , going into the egg business , decided that she would sell at 11 cents a dozen eggs which cost her 12 cents . When remonstrated with , she said with a happy smile , " Yes , I know , but you see in this way I can sell so many more . " Just such is the attitude of our Federal Administration toward our labor organizations . Allen W. Rucker , in his address to the New York Newspaper Publishers Association , has demonstrated with perfect statistics the fact that our organized labor is being paid $6 for the work in supplying $4 worth of product , as determined either by our ability to sell it or by the ability of the very men who produce it to purchase it in the open market . The difference between cost and price is to be supplied from an assumedly inexhaustible stabilizing fund supplied by our government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public . Any attempt to oppose the demands of misinformed labor is met by the threat of ceasing production , which means the defeat of the nation 's defense program . To these demands the two political parties vie with one another in yielding submission to avoid the loss of votes . The great majority of the labor element is composed of men who are either too ignorant or heedless to efficiently study the subject . In the remaining minority there is one genuinely patriotic and unselfish factor engaged in trying to bring labor into a patriotic attitude , and another which cares only to maintain its system of looting . It is a true bandit element which says to the nation , as definitely as a highwayman says to his victim , " Your money or your life " ? " You will meet our demands or we will cease producing the necessaries for your defense . " To this demand the nation is tamely submitting . It claims the right to call on all citizens to go to the front and risk their lives without any compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to make any de mands , with the privilege of withdrawing if they are not complied with . For this situation there is only one possible attitude for the nation to take . If the Nazis were to win in this conflict , our labor organizations would be smashed as a mosquito is crushed . If this great enemy is to be defeated it must be done by the concerted effort of all parties in this country . On all important national issues partisanship must be eliminated and labor controversies must be suspended until the crisis is past . There is but one conclusion for all practical minded men ? if men are to be drafted to fight , there must be conscription of labor to support their fighting HENRY W. Rum- . New York , Oct. 4 , 1940 . Lease Forms Again Criticized In Fact , It Is Held Wise to View All Printed Contracts With Suspicion TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I like the letter of Emanuel Redfield in your issue of Oct. 1 . I do not think that most tenants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate Board form of lease . Ordinarily in the case of a short-term lease a tenant thinks it would not pay him to consult a lawyer . Often , also , it would save him a good deal of money in the long run . Most of the time the printed form is thrust at the tenant and he signs without reading , thinking or questioning . If the lease comes to him in the mail he figures , " Oh , what 's the use of a lot of fussing ? I wo n't get anywhere with it or I may lose the apartment . " A politely firm stand will sometimes get results . I have just signed a lease for a year 's rental of a suite in a kind of apartment hotel . As an attorney , I did not feel happy about agreeing in writing that nothing the landlord could do might establish a constructive eviction ; nor did I think , as a matter of principle , even though the last thing that I wish to do is to go to court about this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ancient right of trial by jury . As to both these features of the lease I expressed myself and said that I could raise more questions but that I should be satisfied with a modification in these two respects . In my letter to the landlord I said that I do not like most of these printed forms because they take away all semblance of freedom of contract . I also said that I had been in favor of the form issued by the Association of the Bar . Incidentally , I have never seen that form used except in ' an instance where I insisted that many of its provisions be incorporated bodily . All printed forms are to be viewed with suspicion . They are usually prepared by one side and they represent the practice of that one side over a period of years of making future provision against the recurrence of any disadvantageous happenings by the inclusion of appropriate language in the next printing of the form . Over the years the standard forms have worked out so that about the only right reserved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each and every month : A client of mine attempted some time ago to buy an expensive installation of machinery on time to insure interested service . A long printed form was sent to him . I read it and suggested several perfectly reasonable changes for the protection of the buyer . The local agent was willing , but the headquarters of the seller wrote curtly and impertinently that no addition or change of any kind whatever was permitted In the printed form . The prospective buyer wisely , I think , then decided to do business with some one else . I trust Mr. Redfield will not stop with his letter but will carry on his crusade . There should be a , standard statutory form for leases , and , for that matter , for conditional sale and salary-loan agreements , just as there is for deeds . He should submit a bill to his local As . semblyman . It would be better for hits not to include in the proposed form too many provisions for the protection m the tenant , or the Real Estate Boarci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Oct. 1 , 1940 . Facing of Facts Suggested Our Primary Concern Considered Not to Be With Feeding Europe To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I feel that the letter of Alexander S. Lipsett needs a reply . Mr. Lipsett 's concern for the mar of people under Nazi domination may soon be starving is laudable . However , it is surely wishful thinking to say that it is possible , if an attempt were made by the United States to aid in feeding the starving Europeans , th .. such aid would be ) ermitted to go to the people under Nazi rule . Everything the Nazis have done to date has clearly indicated that ever : move is ruthless and that they mu . ' continue to be ruthless if their hope fox complete European domination is to bL realized . That entails complete use ox all the agricultural produce their armie , can seize in the conquered countries . This they have already done . Why gc on hoping that the leopard will than , , its spots ? All Europe has reverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That being so , it is natural to expect that un told suffering , privation , property destruction and death through man . causes will result . We can not pertuiL our thoughts to run beyond the immediate question which faces both Englrand the United States  --  how to defer- ' the dictators , keep our own peoples fret and assist in freeing the many peon ' who are now under the yoke of nazism . Why does not Dr. Lipsett express concern for the innocent civilians in great cities who are being slaughtered daily ? Is there anything that can be done fox these poor souls other than render th greatest possible assistance to the force opposed to the dictators ? Are thot who might starve in any worse condition than those who are being bomb from the air and destroyed ? We must all face the situation . The blockade established by England is vita in the cause of defeating the Axis bloc . Starving people accept no master .

' " His cotton gin made cotton king . " This is the conventional answer Actually Whitney invented something even more influential in the development of the United States than the cot ton gin . He invented interchangeable standardized parts . The manufactur. of guns by this method made him rich although he never made a profit froir , the cotton gin . The importance of th invention of interchangeable parts as basis for our mass-production method : can hardly be overestimated . ARTHUR BERNSTEIN . Brooklyn , Oct. 1 . 1940 . Model Plane Maker Protests To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What has New York got against th builders of model airplanes ? What hay we ever done that we must limit oil flying to one field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anoth model ? All we want is a place near at h  --  - where we can fly our ships with as little waste of time , travel and money as po sible .
