txt The House Naval Affairs Committee announced today that it would reduce by about $500,000,000 the $1,300 , - 000,000 originally authorized in the 1939 naval expansion bill as drafted and approved by the Administration . This will be the largest reduction so far made in an appropriation bill by any Congressional committee in the present economy drive and also the largest cut in proposed naval appropriations since the beginning of the present expansion program in 1933 . When the committee convened for public hearings on the bill this morning Chairman Vinson announced that a motion would be made to limit the originally proposed increase in combatant units to forty-one instead of 77 , to be accomplished by the ' elimination of the destroyer part of the authorization in its entirety and substantial reductions in the cruiser and submarine categories . The only category not included in the proposed slashing is that of aircraft carrier authorizations , which will remain at three ships of an aggregate tonnage of 75,000 . The cost of the combatant units to be left in the bill will be about $550,000,000 . Cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including auxiliaries , in the original bill was 400,000 . In the redrafted bill the aggregate tonnage will be 218,000 , a reduction of nearly 50 per cent . Cruiser tonnage will be cut from 192,000 to 110,000 tons , the size of the cruisers to be left to the Navy Department . This may mean , Mr. Vinson said , a squadron of great battle-cruisers each of 27,000 tons , or a larger number of small cruisers which , whatever the decision , are to be larger , faster and of greater gun power than any now in commission in any navy . The submarine tonnage will be cut from 45,000 to 33,000 tons , enough for about 30 submarines , Mr. Vinson said . Representative Maas , of Minnesota , ranking Republican member of the committee , said he was in agreement with Mr. Vinson on tonnage reduction and cost , but gave notice that , in his opinion , this did not mean that the naval program should be reduced . " This is with the understanding that we are not in any way restricting the navy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply authorizing all the ships possible to build in the next three years , and next year , if conditions in the world are the same or worse than now , we will go right ahead with the bill as originally drafted . " Mr. Vinson subscribed to what Mr. Maas said , adding that the navy could not build faster than provided for in the new bill . Construction Facilities Taxed Representative Drewry of Virginia wanted to know if the reduction was made because the larger bill could not be passed through this Congress . " I do not know what Congress will do , but I do know this is all the construction the navy can take care of in the next three years , " Mr. Vinson replied . Rear Admiral Samuel M. Robinson , Chief of the Naval Bureau of Engineering , who was in the witness chair when the change of the bill from a $1,300,000,000 to an $800 , - 000,000 basis was announced , gave it as his opinion that as now proposed the bill " outlines a very fine program " and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Robinson estimated the cost of the combatant units provided for " in the redrafted bill as follows : Admiral Robinson differed with Chairman Vinson as regards the number of submarines . Mr. Vinson // HOUSE GROUP MAPS BIG NAVAL BILL CUT // fixed the number to be built at about thirty . The admiral was of the opinion that twenty-two would be more nearly correct . The new bill , it was announced , also will carry three features of the previous expansion bill , the WalshHealy amendment requiring contracts to observe wage and hour standards , a limit on profits to 10 per cent , and a requirement that 50 per cent of the ships might be built in private yards and 50 per cent in government navy yards . Representative Cole of New York saying the navy had contracted for twenty-three small anti-submarine and scouting boats and had given the contract to the Electric Boat Company without calling for competitive bids , challenged the procedure . Admiral Robinson said the Navy Department thought the course taken was proper in this case .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
