Franklin Roosevelt has at last cleared out the radicals from the National Labor Relations Board . Last week , for the first time , the Board was completely manned by men who have no social axes to grind . <P> NLRB has been racked by internal squabbles from the first . In its early days it was attacked by businessmen as prolabor , radical and Red . Gradually it took on a mellower coloration , acquired more tempered wisdom . The hot light of publicity passed it by . Its personnel changed . Finally the only charter member left was Edwin Seymour Smith , who was outvoted and hamstrung by William Morris Leiserson and elderly Harry Alvin Millis , middle-of-the-roaders both . When Smith 's term expired , the President did not reappoint him . <P> Instead , Mr. Roosevelt tapped young ( 35 ) , Boston-born Gerard Denis Reilly , for the past four years Solicitor of the Department of Labor . Sponsor was his boss , Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins . Harvard-trained , like his predecessor , Reilly is a devout Catholic , no radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Observers predicted that henceforth NLRB , for the first time , would pull together as a team .
