 | and jellylike masses that were free-swimming , propelling themselves not with fins but with a convulsive movement of the whole organism . There would be innumerable creatures resembling uprooted plants , having at the end of a long stalk a bundle of flattened tubes through which they breathed . There would be enormous colonies with rounded branches , thin leaflike foliage , and lacy fronds ; but they would have an alimentary canal , a nervous system , and sensitive tentacles round the mouth through which they breathed . The ocean teemed with life like a vast and experimental laboratory , indifferent alike to its waste of species or to anomalous development of structure that must soon perish . Nature then , even more than now , was prolific and extravagant , and depended not on the careful nurture of a chosen seed but on the experimental planting of everything in her womb . She would produce both motes and monsters , the gentle and the savage , the seeing and the blind ; and among themselves all these could fight it out to the triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millions of freaks , among all the eccentric and aberrant destinies of the luckless and the doomed , there would be a few endowed with the precious heritage of survival . And from the laboratories of the sea and the land , one beast eventually would emerge to rule the planet and break all other creatures to his will . That time was far hence ; and meanwhile the waters of the ocean and the continents standing upon its floor were to be soaked with the blood of the struggle . This is a law of life : to feel the need of an organ or a faculty is to evolve it if the urge is constant and prolonged . Among the creatures of the sea , some were strongly endowed with an urge to master their environment ; but in others this urge was not a  | constant and fierce Iusting , and they fell back upon the need to protect themselves against the strong . The one developed the trait of aggressive seeking , the other of protective coloring or armor , or of flight . Once set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside ; the trait persisted and became fixed . The one perfected its dreadful power to kill , the other to hide or to flee . The killer , being far more aggressive and determined , evolved more rapidly ; because the will to conquer and destroy has sired and brought to their highest development the talents that are potential in the seed . One of these is intelligence , and in the murderer it was to come to its highest fruition . Those creatures , on the other hand , that were impelled to a gentler way of life , were content to be sluggish and stupid , feeling no urge within their heavy protective armor to develop claws and fangs . They would often be only a torpid jellylike mass , walled in by their limestone shells . They would become snails , having a mouth , eyes , ears , and tentacles , as well as a broad clumsy foot with which to crawl awkwardly across the ocean 's bottom . They would feed on inoffensive plants , as the weaker beasts have always done ; or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too sluggish to feel an urge to leave their stone houses , too irresolute and stagnant to evolve backbones , they dwelt in primeval torpor , excreting stone and adding chamber by chamber to their impregnable prisons . With some , the foot became a funnel-shaped swimming organ through which water was ejected to propel the creature backward or sideways . Some , heavily armored , developed legs with which to crawl or swim , and long tentacles with which to sense the presence of food or enemies . Taken all in all , however , these animals were little more than stone sluggards on the ocean 's floor . They were the idiots ,  | half beast and half rock , in Nature 's amazing family ; she smiled on them with ironic indulgence and allowed them to specialize until they were practically sealed up and lost within their stone dungeons . During this era of time , as well as in all the eras to follow , these weird monsters would crawl about in darkness , thrusting witless heads out of their stone prisons . A million or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically unchanged . Peace they would have , but Nature abhors peace . An invulnerable refuge against enemies they would have ; and as the price of it they were sentenced to eternal stupor . Nature , deep in her inscrutable heart , reserved for the most savage killers the award of intelligence . Consistently , from the earliest experiments in her vast laboratories , fearlessness has been the highest of all virtues ; and if members of her family were allowed to withdraw from struggle into their armored homes , perhaps that was only to prove that safety weds with ignorance . Because the chronicle of this story , its achievements , its progress , and all its slow and terrible emergence from darkness into light , have been recorded in murder . If all the creatures of the ocean had developed armor and fed on seaweeds , there would today be only a world of snails and turtles , a blind and insensible paralysis without passion or dating or hope . The heritage in the germ , the urge that has reached steadily toward the mind , has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the protective devices of color and armor . The omnipresent sense of danger , the threat of foes , has impelled him to develop active weapons of protection . Instead of a shell , he hungered for great teeth , speed of movement , keener vision , and invincible strength . No sluggard of jelly in a stone fortress , he wandered in the depths , with his  | sleek flesh vulnerable to fangs and with a moment of inattentiveness as the price of his life . He was the bold adventurer in this drama , asking for no quarter and giving none . The greatest weapon in his arsenal would eventually be intelligence , and all his murderous hungers contributed to the evolution of a mind . Long before his time , it is true , some of his cousins had perished in armor . King of them had been a gigantic monster with a great plate of stone above its head that could slide backward as a sheath to protect its body . Without teeth , it had two enormous jaws , two crushing shears of bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlord in the ocean 's depths . Propelled by a huge tail , rolling like a thing with shifting ballast , and with its jaws wide open , it moved awkwardly and with no apparent purpose , a dull and overgrown beast that fed into its stomach everything that entered its mouth . Without intelligence or more than the feeblest vision , it prowled like a dredging machine ; and its gaping jaws closed on everything they touched . They closed on coral reefs and on limestone crags . They closed on unwary fish , too , or on small armored creatures that were crushed and swallowed , armor and all . Now and then they closed on a projecting neb of cooled lava ; and the mindless monster , unable to crush the rock , and too dull to distinguish between food and stone , would lie suspended as if anchored , with its mighty jaws set on lava like a steel trap . After a while the tide would float it away ; and again , with gaping mouth , it would go with the current , its tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , when swimming into a buried ledge , it would respond with a thickskulled tremor of fear ; and then the heavy armor of its head would slide backward and the monster would wait for an enemy to strike . Whereupon , moved not by a will of its own but by a simple reflex , the skull would slide forward , the jaws  | would open again to their widest reach , and the king of the ocean would thrust with its great tail and move off . Now and then these lumbering beasts would swim , mouths agape , head-on into one another , and their powerful shears would close on the thick plate of one another 's skulls . Thus for hours or days they would remain interlocked , drifting with the tides ; and when at last they were freed from the vises that held them , it was only because their muscles relaxed a little and their jaws fell away . When an unprotected part of the body of one drifted into the mouth of another it was instantly crushed , and the captured creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth . Hungering for thicker armor and more bulk , instead of for speed and daring , these beasts became slower and more awkward and of vaster size . They sank more and more to the ocean 's bottom and lay there like stranded hulks . As the price of being armored and gigantic and secure , they perished as all creatures must that overspecialize . From all danger they withdrew into their fortresses and sank in the depths and were buried by the sediment of wind and wave . Instead of the frontiers of struggle , they chose the refuge of the reluctant , and the ocean floored itself with their graveyards . While they were moving away from danger , their cousins were moving toward it . These sought neither armor nor vast size , but teeth and speed and audacity . The new overlord of the seas would not be a bone-plated and sluggish hulk ; he would be a swift and streamlined killer . At first he was a small fellow , this ancient sire of the sharks , this long-ago forbear of the tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as needle points , and a speed and grace of movement that made him master of his home . He had the kind of daring that Iooked  | upon the entire ocean as his frontier , and on all other creatures as his prey . He also was driven by an urge to greater size , and through the ages the fathers in one species bequeathed to their sons a little more bulk , until at last this tyrant of the seas became the most formidable killer that has ever lived on this planet . As large , eventually , as the biggest whales of a later time , he was not , like them , an awkward and slow-moving monster . He was a long swift torpedo of flesh , and almost with the speed of a torpedo he moved through the depths , propelled by a broad rudder and gigantic fins . His dreadful jaws , which he could open to a width of ten feet , were set with four rows of six-inch teeth ; and when these gleaming bone chisels snapped together , they could crush a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tyrant of the seas developed an appetite which in voracity has been without parallel . His lifetime was spent in devouring and digesting , as if Nature had fashioned and equipped him to exterminate all other creatures ; but so abundant were the other beasts of the ocean that for a million years he fed with insatiable gluttony and found the supply equal to his ravenous lust . We shall follow the marauder in one of his journeys . Gorged with flesh and blood and bone , and a little sleepy , he has been Iying idly in shallow waters off the barren coast of an emerging Asia . He has not been asleep . He has merely been suspended in drowsy content while his incomparably perfect digestive system assimilated into his blood and muscle the glut of his dinner . His eyes , alert , and shining like two huge black marbles , have been watching small fish drift by him or a clumsy lizard shoal toward the bank . In them he has no interest . When surfeited and digesting , he does not mind if other creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain ,  | entombed in a great skull , there is only dim awareness of their presence . He has no enemies that dare attack ; and if this huge murderer , idly digesting in sunlit shallows , had had the power of reflection , he might have foretold his end in the completeness of his triumph . He might have known that Nature eventually levels to the graveyard those beasts whose might makes them secure from all enemies . For in struggle alone is there the will to survive . This stupendous shark was absolute master of the deep . There were other monstrous carnivora but none with the speed and power of this king . There was none to dispute his control and urge him to further development ; and in consequence he had reached that terrible haven wherein he could devour and digest and degenerate . Among his distant cousins , much smaller than he , and surrounded on all sides by enemies , there was constant groping toward faculties which they did not have . Their mind was only a mote , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but dimly , sleeplessly , they were reaching toward a life on land . They devoured , but they were also eaten ; and in the menace of their environment lay their promise of a higher life . That was not so of the king tyrant whom a jesting experiment had made invincible . Arid now , having digested his gorge and felt pangs of hunger , he gives a thrust with his mighty rudder and swings , and under the powerful winging of his fins he shoots out into deep water , a mammoth sea-raider who is little more than teeth and stomach . Overtaking a school of cuttlefish , he spreads his jaws wide and snaps them together , and swallows a dozen creatures whole . The two hundred chisels in his mouth are only for capturing and crushing . Next he comes upon a slothful turtle-like beast the size of an ox ; and between the jaws , closing like pile-drivers , the creature 's thick  | armor breaks into a thousand fragments . He overtakes and swallows a few of his small cousins , but his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great monster with the head of a lizard , the teeth of a crocodile , and the body of a serpent . It is a gluttonous killer , too , but it is only helpless prey in the grasp of the kingshark . Moving through the sea at high speed , and as soundlessly as a piston in a bath of oil , the shark sees the monster swimming near the surface , drawing its long paddles up and forward and thrusting them backward . Its long neck is above the water ; and turning on it to scan the ocean are two small eyes in a flattened skull . Coming up swiftly like the long dark torpedo that he is , the shark circles his prey . Sometimes , in attacking this beast , he closes his jaws on the paddles and tears them from the belly . Sometimes , with a deflecting stroke of his tail , he comes up in a flashing arc of power ; and wide-open jaws break the surface , and teeth gleam like double rows of ivory chisels , and water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he closes on the tall slender neck and snaps it off . But today , after circling like a long curved darkness , he clamps his mighty vise on the tapering hulk of the tail . The captured beast , taken unawares , rears with all its strength , its four fin-paddles climbing with the might of broad oars beating upon the water . Its mouth , hinged back against its throat like a reptile 's , opens wide , and its rows of teeth are bright and dreadful in the sunlight . Its long neck writhes like the body of a snake . In the first upward thrust toward escape , its front paddles come above water and strike the surface like the flat slap of huge palms . Then all four paddles churn the calm sea until it rolls backward in foaming reefs or opens downward in sucking maelstroms . The tyrant killer still has his jaws set on the tail . The juicy  | hulk of it is crushed in his mouth , and while the monster threshes vainly , the shark is content for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to tear the huge tail off and swallow it , he thrusts with his rudder and smites with his fins ; but now , as in so many times before , he succeeds only in dragging his prey under the surface . Releasing his clutch he shoots backward and moves in for a more deadly attack . With jaws agape to their fullest span , and bloody water boiling across his open throat as he comes , he sets his vise on the underbelly and his chisels meet in the soft mass of guts . Turning on his enemy , the captured monster bends his neck backward in a long curve and bites into the shark 's back ; but the killer does not mind that . He has a deathhold , and death is relaxing the jaws of his victim . After drinking the warm living fluids that gush out of the belly and flood his throat , he devours the carcass ; and marking the place of his banquet is a red patch on the sea . Glutted , he moves back to shallow water and drowses lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of centuries his clan would devour and procreate and lie in idle peace where the sun warmed the waters . Undisputed master of all creatures in the deep , there was nothing else to do and no need to be more than they were . For they were perfect in the environment of their time . They had no need of greater speed or longer teeth because no beast ever approached them except those who mistook an idle tyrant for a submerged ledge or reef . The ocean was their garden and orchard of good things . Nature had been kind to them . Nature had made of them flawless engines of destruction without competitors , without foes , and without ambition . But Nature , when she errs in achieving perfection , is wise enough to see the folly of it and ingenious enough to plot its death . In her laboratory , perhaps she now and then achieves  | perfection because she is curious ; and if she destroys the perfect thing , that is doubtless because she abhors it . Because perfection begets a Iazy indifference to growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also abhors peace . In all the long and brilliant history of her experiments , she has given the pith of her scorn and her most devastating rebuke to perfection and peace , having perceived in both the complacent degeneracy of the changeless . Upon this planet , her first perfect creature , and perhaps the most remarkable in its perfection , was the shark-killer that ruled the seas . He was also her first child of great promise . As Iong as he was driven to seek speed and size and courage , his evolution was steady and exciting ; but when he became king of all the beasts , he was content to feed his hunger and to accept the world as his special province . Having no need of faculties which he did not possess , he felt no urge to acquire them , and so spent his time in idleness and gluttony . At the height of his glory , his own unparalleled and invincible position sentenced him to death . Other creatures , meanwhile , whom he ate and terrorized , were not satisfied . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their urge to growth ; and Nature , observing the folly of her first favorite , left him to degenerate and perish , and gave her interest to the wide-awake strivings of his prey . During all this long time , convulsive physicking had continued under the hot floor of the ocean , and land had slowly emerged . Most of present-day Asia stood above water , but it was only a featureless and barren waste of rock . There were no mountains upon it , no verdant valleys , no cool clear streams . Across the desolation of stone swept the great winds , busily eroding day and night and carrying sand back to the seas . Beds  | of gypsum and salt were laid down , and the ocean floor was covered with sediment , often miles in depth . Southward was another continent , vast and bleak , comprising what is today Australia and much of Africa and a part of Asia ; and between the two continents lay the huge Tethys Sea across what was to become North America , the Atlantic Ocean , and a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains and the winds gathering the sands . The floors of the oceans were slowly sinking and shifting and warping . Now and then part of a sea-bed was thrust up in the form of craggy reef or peak , and rain and wind eroded it into soil . Still later , there were stupendous upheavals , both from the ocean 's floor and the continental platforms ; and mountains were pushed into the sky . In crevices , in sheltered coves , and here and there along protected beaches , sand fell from the herding winds ; and thus was begun the task of converting stone continents into gardens and forests . It was a task that would take millions of years ; and meanwhile , as if impatient , the first land plants , migrating from the seas , made use of a soil that was only coarse sand . It is little wonder , then , that these first land plants were so strange in appearance , and seemed to be , as in large part they were , mere vegetation of stone . Green , red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin rocky beaches , were almost encased with lime . Some of them looked like greenish limeencrusted toadstools , or like clumps of coral or patches of stone seaweed . Others , sheathed with lime , resembled the outspread feathers of a cock 's tail . All of them were stone plants out of a stone world ; and , after completing their simple life span , they fell over and formed beds of limestone . But these , like the creatures in the sea , were " dreaming on things to come . " That clump of brown seaweed , standing  | behind a coral reef and looking like queer foliage of rock , had in it the seed of the pine and oak , the lily and the rose . In the ocean , this dullard , creeping blindly with an appendage thrust from its stone house , is cousin of the plant on the shore . If shattered by a blow , there would be little left of either except a pile of stone fragments ; yet they were the lowly parents of two great kingdoms . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawing sea , the rising sun one morning shone upon this landscape . A few miles in the background was a row of mountains , each bleak hulk Iooking as if a sculptor of phenomenal size and strength had completed his first chiselings . Utterly naked , each peak , like an inverted cone , stood in monumental loneliness ; and below them , the flanks were terraced to the lake shore . Upon the lake 's surface were several steaming vents ; if human ears could have bowed low to them , they would have heard deep in the earth the gurgling of liquid stone and the hissing of steam . The volcanic action under the lake floor was constantly boiling upward and overflowing ; and as the spilling stone cooled , it formed inverted funnels , with the mouth of each set on the lake bottom and the apex serving as a vent for escaping gases . On the shore opposite the mountains was a forest . Chiefly it was funguslike plants , left there by a withdrawing ocean ; and the largest of these plants had reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood and stone : Among them was a creeping swampland plant with hairs instead of roots , and a forked stem clothed with spines . There was also a kind of frond , tufted at the top , but with leafless branches . A hundred thousand years later , the sun rose on a scene that had changed little . The fumaroles of volcanoes were still smoking . Along the south shore had been piled huge dunes of  | sand . The water of the lake was a uniform green except small patches where decaying vegetation had turned it brown . The leafless trees , still no more than straight hard shoots rising from underground stems , looked like spires eroded and sculptured by the wind-borne sands . Among them now the swamp was carpeted with a slender rushlike plant , and at a distance it looked lovely and green . But neither in this forest nor in any of the others like it was there sound of insect or bird or of any living thing . There was only the sound of volcanoes and of water and wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the spinous leafless plants , with their archaic features , have disappeared . They have evolved into fernlike fronds with veined leaflets and various organs . The largest of them vaguely resembled the Joshua tree of today ; smaller ones , straight of shaft , were crowned with an umbrella-like canopy of branches and leaves ; and under them were the ferns . The fumaroles have stopped smoking , having been buried under sediment carried down by wind and mountain stream . The lake has shrunk to half its original size , and the great dunes on its southern shore have been scattered into thousands of tiny ravines and coves . But still far and wide upon the Iand surface of the new world there was no living animal . There was sentient life only in the seas ; because it was there for countless millions of years that Nature made her laboratory , and there she brought more species into being than she was ever to produce again except in the insects . In size and in shape , in ferocity and in shyness , in alertness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , begetting every conceivable form adapted to an ocean home . Most of these creatures were content to float lazily in their deep and fluid cradle , having no ears and needing none , and no hands to stimulate  | and develop their minds ; and yet in them there was , perhaps even from the beginning , an urge to resist the luxurious haven of water and move toward the violent temperatures and hazards of a land life . Some of these beasts , drifting into shallow places or tossed upon beaches by the tides , looked with feeble eyes upon another world . They had no minds , no power of thought , but in them , nevertheless , as a part of their heritage , as a part of their inscrutable will to seek and grow , was an urge to leave the ocean . It was the kind of blind and irresistible urge that moves fish upstream to their spawning grounds and drives them even to death before they will yield ; the kind of will that wings in the migration of birds ; the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the deep these sluggards , both great and small , moved toward a home on land , and their efforts wrote one of the mightiest chapters in the history of persistence and courage . By the thousands , by the millions , they perished , and their bones were buried deep in the sands where they died . For they had gills , yet strove to breathe the pure and intoxicating air of earth . They had paddles and fins but they tried to walk . What a beast wills with inflexible purpose , its far-distant progeny may achieve . These creatures thrust heads from water and looked around them ; they were stricken by a burning inrush of oxygen and withdrew . On shallow bottoms they waddled on paddles , and darkly , patiently felt the need of legs and feet . Stranded on shores by retreating tides , they died there ; and they died when , threshing like seals from water to Iand , they suffocated for want of air in a world of air which they could not use . But their will was unwavering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age after age this magnificent  | struggle continued  --  this exodus of the sea-born and the sealiving from the sea to the land . Life in the ocean was seeking a home in the forests . Creatures with gills and paddles were striving for lungs and feet . It was the most spectacular of all struggles that have been upon this earth ; and in its waste of life and its slow , dumb , and invincible seeking it is the greatest saga in all the long journey from crinoid to man . Nature cared little if it cost a thousand million lives to achieve one barely perceptible change in the evolution of gills into lungs . The vast oceans were her womb and her nursery , and there was no limit to the numbers she could throw into this uphill fight . And in regard to time she had an eternity if an eternity were needed . And so for millions of years this struggle went on . Huge reefs were made of the bones of those that perished ; islands rose from the graveyards of the dead . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to waddle to muddy banks and lie there until forced to return to water to breathe ; but they came out again , and the generations after them , and each added a little to adaptation and change . Their fins became things they could crawl with among the rushes and the canes ; and all the while , too , they were developing ears and the power to hear , and a brain that was more than a mote . In form they at first resembled lizards , frogs , and salamanders , and for ages these dull flesh-eaters lived along the banks of streams or in bogs and swamps , feeding on fish and worms and the weaker members of their own kind . Some , less valiant , were content to remain in the swamps , and eventually became the river pirates of the crocodile clan . Others , looking like ferocious scorpions three or four feet long , moved away from the seas and the swamps , but for a long time they had to return to the ocean or the rivers to give birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , developing in a little while the lungs that had cost their ancestors millions of years of effort . Some of the emerging beasts lost their aquatic armor , some brought it with them to land ; but they were all the amphibians , sons and daughters of the fish , born from the laboratory of the sea . Whether armored or not , they were monsters all , even the tiniest of them ; but they were more intelligent than the fish and more victorious , and in their land-breathing , ferocious , and ungainly bodies they bore triumphantly to the mountains and the forests the image and the soul of the man to be . During that very long period while some of the fishes were becoming amphibians and evolving lungs from gills and legs from fins , Nature was preparing a home for them ; because plants , too , moved in a worldwide urge toward growth and change . Rootless and naked trees , set like monuments of stone on barren headlands , had been seeking roots and foliage and flowers ; and during those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them became fragrant . There were dense dank junglelands of fern that ranged through six thousand species , and in size from small delicate plants to tropical trees fifty feet tall . Some wore crowns of large beautiful leaves , some unrolled in huge bouquetlike fronds , and many were dainty climbers that built a tangled undergrowth . There were magnificent scale trees a hundred feet in height , standing in groves carpeted by club mosses and creeping vines ; and there were vast jungles of horsetails , their trunks sheathed with whorls of narrow leaves that made each tree resemble a tall staff growing out of a cylindrical vineyard . And there were strange-looking conifers , the parent of today 's pine and fir . But not at once , not for a long time , did the beasts emerging from the sea take to the forests . They were an in-between clan  | of monsters , sea-born but land-driven ; as cold-blooded as the killers who still swam in the ocean and were content to remain there ; and so stupid that they could only waddle around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Most of them could smell a little , some of them could faintly hear the most violent sounds , and nearly all of them had flat teeth to crush or long curved chisels to seize and hold . They were not of great size yet but many of them would be ; because Nature , moving her principal laboratory from the sea to the land , turned her creatures free , giving them only the law of their urge and their hunger . As if appalled by the stultifying luxuries of an ocean cradle , where her beasts had been content to roll with the current and eat and propagate and die , she fetched a part of them to land where they would develop their minds or perish . From a lazy bath of water , she gave them to changing temperatures , stinging winds , and a burning sun . And on land , as in the seas , some of the creatures sought the protection of size and armor . They became stupendous bone-plated machines that were controlled only or almost entirely by a few lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but a backward look at her experiments and fumblings suggests that she had no certain knowledge or foresight , but moved by trial and error , sensing only that among her vast and clumsy and murderous progeny there was a man coming to birth . The most the ocean had been able to produce was the killershark who had perished in his perfection . Now Nature had two new mediums , the land and the air . Instead of swimming , beasts had to learn to walk or fly ; but above all else , the ability to grow and change was the price of the lease to live and endure . Of fish she had spawned thousands of species , wastefully , extravagantly , until the oceans were choked with the  | kinds ; and from those millions of years of experiment there had evolved the great urge to migrate from water to land . That was the one priceless heritage in the cold-blooded sluggards that wallowed like boars in the slime and caught faintly the stench of their own brothers rotting on the beaches . In her second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first  --  as if hoping among a million seeds to find one that could build a kingdom . In form , in size , in appearance her creatures now moved to every possible extreme . From the amphibian horse , with flat head and wide mouth , came active lizardlike beasts that developed their legs ; ugly brutes that specialized in armor and bulk ; and hopping monsters that strove for batlike wings . All these , in turn , divided and subdivided into innumerable species , until land and air were alive with them and the stage was set for the mammal to come . But the air , like the sea , is a medium that encourages slothfulness and arrested growth . Insects multiplied until after a while there were more than a thousand kinds . There were beetles as large as sparrows , cockroaches four inches long , and dragonflies with a wingspread of thirty inches . These flies , upon whom Nature must have smiled in their early history , became another of her odiously perfect beings ; because after having with speed and voracity made themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seas , to be changeless . It was out of the bloody struggle of creatures that crawled and then walked that intelligence was to be born ; but among these , too , all those species which sought and achieved safety were sentenced to death . The past of this planet is , in considerable part , an enormous graveyard of those creatures that chose physical safety instead  | of intelligence ; and the largest of those cemeteries has been filled with the reptiles . The amphibian became in turn the cold-blooded lizard and the snake , and the first of these was for a long time the undisputed lord of earth . His clan multiplied into many species . A few of these returned to the waters to prey on fishes , a few were content to be ungainly hulks feeding in swampy places , and others developed agile legs for swift running ; but one of them , who in time was to have many cousins , strove for size and armor and became the invincible tyrant of them all . As if sardonically curious to learn what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nature gave to the reptiles millions of years in time , a favorable climate , and lush plants and hordes of smaller beasts on which to feed ; and the result was a marvel of awkward , ill-shaped , and purposeless ugliness . Never before or since has she been so lavish in the production of stupidity on a colossal scale . Never have such extravagant hulks of muscle and bone housed such small and feeble brains or eaten gluttonously to such little purpose or evolved such amazing variety of form only to floor lakes and valleys with the carcasses of their tribe . It may be that Nature was again intent on defining and declaring the folly of perfection ; because these beasts became perfect , each in his own way , and were sentenced to extinction . In the great dank forests of this time , and upon the prairies and plains , these beasts could have been counted by the millions ; but all their brains combined in one could hardly have served the need and purpose of a solitary ant . Yonder , on a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred feet in length . Upon four huge legs , his trunk resembles that of an elephant ; and from the trunk behind extends a forty-foot cylinder of useless tail that  | drags on the earth when he walks . His neck , more than half as long as the tail , and looking much like it , supports a small head , a head so absurdly small that it appears to be only the end of another tail , set with eyes and teeth . This beast lives chiefly on plant life and insects , and his neck , therefore , serves a purpose in reaching to foliage ; but his tail , dragging like a great calloused palm over the stones , is only several tons of useless flesh . Across the valley from him is a herd of his enemies . One of them resembles him in shape , though the hind legs are more massive , the long tail is armored and looks like a monstrous javelin , and the head , set with huge flesh-rending teeth , is a plated engine of destruction . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are taloned ; but another monster , not far away , has lost all use of his front legs . They hang from his breast , ridiculous vestiges from ancestors that walked on four feet . Nevertheless , this beast is the king of them all . Standing twenty feet in height and fifty feet in length , he has an armored skull as large as a grown ox set with broad powerful teeth half a foot long . The curved claws on his feet are a little longer than his teeth . Half-sitting on his tail , he can rear on the pillars of his legs and look far over the landscape ; and then his terrible head is thirty feet from the earth . He feeds on anything he can kill and tear apart . Around him are beasts whom he can not destroy . One of them is even more frightening of aspect  --  a monster resembling an overgrown hippopotamus . He lives solely on vegetation , and to protect himself he has evolved an armor unbelievably perfect . Backward from his skull , and curving upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and almost as wide ; and growing out of the front of it are two huge horn-sheathed spears . On his broad nose is a snout , another  | sharp horn-spear , but it is not so deadly a weapon as the two javelins projecting four feet from the skull plate . Among the many other monsters is an awkward ungainly brute about twenty feet long and half as high ; it has an absurdly small head close to the ground , and an arched back , rising in a great curve from its neck to its rump and continuing in a downward arc to the end of its tail . Upon the entire length of this arc , from head to tail , are two rows of pearshaped plates of bone , looking from some distance like enormous petals growing out of the spine . Below them , the tail , dragged on the earth , is fitted with four sharp spears , curved upward and parallel like the tines of a fork . The thick legs are encased with armor , and imbedded in the tough hide are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies , but is so weighted down with armor that it can barely move . Among creatures sacrificing everything to safety , and perishing as the price of it , Nature has never achieved a more formidable and horrifying instance of perfection . Over the earth during this time life was a spectacle of continuous and bloody slaughter . The king tyrant , like the killershark , fed on everything he could kill  --  and when hungry he attacked all objects that moved , including members of his own clan . He was a machine of reflexes and appetites , destroying , gluttonous , and perfect . Too powerful to feel fear , too dull-witted to distinguish between friend and foe , and impelled to stir only when pangs of hunger goaded him , he fixed his stupid gaze on anything moving across the landscape and moved toward it , walking on his two mighty legs and balancing himself with his tail . The herb-eating monsters , with long tails and necks , and with no bone plate on them anywhere , he found easy prey ; with his awful teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads off , but when he attacked the armored vegetarians his chisels closed vainly on bone . A great male , seeking a ton of dinner , has espied one of the two-horned monsters and is lumbering toward it ; and with the amused indulgence of Nature , we may as well watch the fight . Spanning ten feet at a stride , the tyrant comes ; and the beaked one , sensing danger , turns to face him . He turns toward him his stupendous plated head and gleaming horns . Braced on four short pillars , as well as by the heavy trunk of his tail , he stands foursquare , a leviathan of prodigious strength ; but like his enemy he has almost no brain at all . There is no intelligence in either beast . One is moved by voracious hunger , the other by fear . As the tyrant approaches , barely able to distinguish between a hulk of living flesh and a ledge of stone , he opens his mouth into a wide cavern of teeth and wet throat . Under the roof of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up , with the earth trembling under his taloned feet , and reaches down over his prey to close his vise ; but at this moment the horned monster lifts his head suddenly and drives the two sharp spears into the tyrant 's breast . He drives them a foot deep into the flesh , and while he waits , the other , towering above him , stands impaled . Then the tyrant closes his jaws on the broad curved shield and bone rakes bone . Six-inch chisels rake scars across the shield but they do not crush it or bite through it ; and all the while the two spears stand in the killer 's breast . There is very little pain . These giants of the ancient world felt Iittle pain even in violent death ; they were only torpid mountains of bone and meat with the sluggish and cold-blooded nervous system of the reptile . The tyrant moves backward and the horns withdraw from gaping wounds ; he turns to sink jaws into the body , but the beaked monster  | swings , too , and faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his snout . There are no bellows of rage . There is no sound at all save that of heavy feet and breath and of bone on bone . There is no agile feinting , no maneuvering , no cunning attack . Two hulks are deadlocked , the one trying to devour the other ; and presently , with the dumb patience of water that hesitates and turns aside from an obstacle , the tyrant strides off . He conics to one of the defenseless beasts with the long neck and tail and makes his feast . And so it was for millions of years upon the earth . These were only a few of the many species of dragon that lived on the ground . Meanwhile , smaller dragons had taken to the air , flying on wings like those of-the bat ; and in appearance they were even more dreadful than those that walked on feet . Some of them had the wingspread of a small airplane . The hairy weblike wings had grown to their arms and legs , and the creatures when flying looked naked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and talons hanging from their rear where wings had grown fast to ankles . They had the cold bleak eyes of vultures . They had beaks two or three feet long , set with rows of teeth . Bird-hipped and bird-footed , these were the reptiles of the air and the ungainly parents of the birds to come . It was a world a brief glimpse of which would turn our blood cold ; but it was Nature 's marvelous laboratory , and among the dreadful flying vampires were the lark and the nightingale to be , and among the monsters on the ground was the father of man . He was not the huge reptile , laying eggs a foot thick in the sands . He was among the smaller beasts that were becoming mammals and carrying their young in wombs . He was , very anciently , in the beast-toothed theriodont , a reptile too in the beginning , a blood brother of the  | tyrant himself ; but this beast developed , not size and armor , but longer legs and greater speed . To speed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature ; the metabolism became more complex ; and while the monstrous reptiles , of both land and air , stagnated in their protective devices , the lowlier beasts forged ahead and entered another and a nobler kingdom . Nature 's experimenting in dreadful killers came , as before , to a sudden and dramatic end . The dragons that had ruled for millions of years perished in a few centuries . Overspecialized , unable to adapt to climatic changes , too sluggish to migrate and too long supreme to sense approaching peril , they froze to death by the tens of thousands ; and hastening their exodus to the graveyards were small alert mammals about the size of rats . These ate their huge eggs or gathered in flocks to chew at their helpless feet . More and more , too , the dragons devoured their own kind , having come to be little more than insatiable appetites . They had been a mighty and invulnerable clan , but time moved a glacial epoch down upon them and floored continents with their bones . Indulgent for a long while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them back to the stone beds out of which they had come . And the voracious reptiles of the air , those grotesque appendages attached to a pair of enormous wings , she also destroyed . They had ruled the atmosphere , eating anything they could find , including one another ; but they were helpless against a wind . It overturned them and sent them in gawky sprawling defeat to the earth . Above all , however , these creatures , gliding on leathery wings and spending most of their time in gluttonous feeding like vultures , were content  | to be what they were . The largest of them Nature sent after the earth-dragons ; for her interest and her laboratory were now to be given to another kind of beast . Almost for the first time in the history of the planet , the creatures to which she gave sympathy and care were creatures of fear . From the day of their birth to the day of their death they were terrified . It was as if , having experimented recklessly and with incalculable extravagance , Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machine-like form was the goal she sought . During millions of years , fear had been a casual and unimportant thing . The killer-sharks and the tyrant lizards had been her favorites , and there had been no fear in them ; but now she turned to the be sts who were born with terror in their souls and lived in dread . Dragons of land and air she destroyed , as well as most of those in the seas ; and as if to prepare the earth for a new and a greater experiment , she softened and beautified the formidable earth , covering the mountains with forests and scattering gardens of wild flowers over the hills . The valleys teemed with butterflies and singing birds . To the morning and the evening she gave the lights and shadows which we know today . The mammals had come , including the milk-givers . They housed the unborn in their bodies and gave them care after their birth . Love had entered the world . But it was not , by any means , everywhere the gentle dawn of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cat and all its kin  --  the saber-toothed tiger , the bear-dog , the great wolf . There were the giant hogs and the mammoths . There were flesh-eaters of many kinds ; because in this new experiment of intelligence evolving out of fear , there was need of those who killed , of the murderer as well as his prey . The world was to  | be a kindergarten of the terrible and the terrified , but there would no longer be , except in survivors of an ancient time , the security afforded by thick armor and monstrous size . Even the great cats were to be haunted by fear , too ; but instead of a bone-plated fortress they were to seek speed and agility and j courage . Speed and cunning were needed now , but above all else , in the mighty struggle to survive , intelligence was needed ; and to urge intelligence to rapid growth , every creature in the sea and upon the land and in the air was given its enemies , and in every living heart fear became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great clans all the earth 's people were divided . There were the predaceous killers who ate only flesh and spent most of their waking hours in stalking and trapping their prey ; and there were the timid beasts that fed on the plants . From one of these clans , Man was to come . It is the origin of intelligence , and its forgotten glory , that it came from the leaf-eaters who daily fled for their lives . It came from beasts who trembled in terror in the jungles and forests and upon the prairies and hills . It came from the ancient cousins of the rabbit and deer and gazelle . But as the cats were an extreme on one hand , becoming arrested by their very ferocity , so was the forbear of the gazelle an extreme on the other hand , making of terror almost its sole meaning , and a shy and timorous path its way to defeat . Between these two somewhere , with courage and fear mating and assisting one another , was the golden mean which Nature sought . Neither brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull . And so on one side were the fangs and talons , and on the other were nimble feet or wings ; and between them , feeling both , and uniting them in purpose and plan , were the animals who took the middle road into the  | modern world . Courage they had because without it they would have been gazelles ; and fear they had because without it they would have been chiefly fangs and claws . They were creatures of muscular strength , but strength alone was not enough . Over the whole earth , and in the waters if they ventured there , were beasts waiting to tear them limb from limb . In the jungles were huge serpents and deadly insects ; upon the prairies were the gaunt wolves hunting in packs . There was no spot on earth where the ancestor of man could safely lay his head , and if he had not taken to the trees he might have perished long ago . In the high ceiling of the forest he made his home , and practice there gave him such amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch with surpassing grace and ease . For ages he was an arboreal tenant , rarely venturing to the ground ; for he drank water from the leaves and he ate the foliage and he made his bed in a tree crotch . After a long while he came to the earth more frequently and loped along on four feet , but at the sight of an enemy he ascended with astonishing speed . In his high leafy temples he could scold to his heart 's content and survey , with brown alert eyes , the spectacle of endless slaughter below him . If he had been willing to remain in the trees he would never have been more than the monkey that his distant cousins still are . He was not willing to remain there , nor , upon coming to the ground , was he willing forever to walk on four feet . He attempted to stand up on his hind legs and look around him ; and though he fell awkwardly because of a curved spine and lack of balance , he tried again and again , generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright on short bowed legs and walked erect . He discovered then that his hands were freed to other uses ; and this , the greatest of all  | discoveries in our Iong dark past , made of the creature a man . When his front legs became arms and his front feet became hands , his mind was freed to a path of development that lay in full sunshine ahead . He was , or he soon would be , the king of the earth . He had fallen , not by chance , but by persistent trial and effort , upon a pattern of behavior that set him free ; and never again could his supremacy be threatened , or his enemies be more than his slaves . Now we shall give to him this early chapter in his long journey out of darkness and the deep .  | I THROUGH dense growth and into deeper jungle , seeking a dark and tangled fastness for the night , went a group of thirteen in single file , with Ho-wha , the mighty lord and guardian of the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women , bringing up the rear . The time was late spring . After a winter of hungry and nomadic prowling , they had come in their wanderings upon a broad and succulent thicket ; and for many days they had fed gluttonously and put on weight . Their bellies this evening were stuffed with good things , and they were all content except Ghak , an old and sick and petulant man who was always driven from the juiciest patch of foliage and fruit and had to feed where he could . Their hunger was appeased and they were sleepy , but they were watchfully alert . Never for a moment did they dare to relax their vigilance in a land where deadly enemies skulked in the undergrowth and vultures soared overhead . Ho-wha now and then paused to smell out the scents of the jungle or to listen ; and Ka-ka often turned to look  | behind her , or stopped , tense and expectant , if she heard a sudden sound . A great bird , unexpectedly taking off in flight , or a small ground animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rigid attitude of listening and lift for a moment in fear and anger the stiff thick hair on Ho-wha 's crown . But there were no enemies around them tonight . For half a mile they marched in single column ; whereupon , perceiving that they were in dense growth , with materials for beds all around them , Ka-ka busied herself in choosing the most favored spot as her own . In this they all deferred to her wish . She was not only the oldest and the chief of Ho-wha 's women ; she was also far advanced in pregnancy and needed a soft bed on which to lie . After her , the preference was given to Who-ah , the second wife , to whose back clung a suckling only a week old . There was no social equality among these persons . From the queen-mother down to the lowliest , from Ka-ka to the second wife and the third , and from them to the children , the old woman , the old man , the dwarfed waif , and the ugly female with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all knew their place and they all kept it except when Ho-wha fell into deep sleep . Now they were all making their beds . Each sought a thick clump of pliable vines and shrubs . Standing within it , he bent them all toward the center and interlaced them until he had formed a kind of vine hammock on which he could lie . It was an excellent bed when properly made . Sometimes the older children fashioned a vine mattress in the crotch of a huge tree and slept securely above the earth ; and more rarely the women did likewise when they could find a tree to their taste . The men never left the earth . Above all else , Ho-wha was guardian of the group ,  | and he would never have thought of placing himself wholly beyond danger . Like all the family guardians of this time , he slept when he could with his back toward a stone ledge or a very dense thicket ; but he always faced the area from which attack would most likely come . Too , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving to the women and children the more protected spots . The children tonight were not ready for sleep . Gah , the oldest girl , was a roguish and mischievous and curious lass who loved to frolic about ; and now , after going a little way from the group , she found some juicy fig leaves and began to smack her lips over them , looking meanwhile at her half sister Murah . Murah watched her with sober interest for a long moment and then went over to join her ; and presently the two of them began a game of hide-andseek in the tall grass . With cries of gleeful challenge , Gah darted away and into a tangle of liana and then dropped into the grass and was still ; and Murah ran after her , chattering excitedly , and pausing again and again to part clumps of fern and peer for her sister . When she found Gah she threw herself on her and the two girls rolled squealing and clawing among the grasses ; but after a little while Gah drew the younger girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust her tongue against the back of Murah 's neck . Murah liked the caress . She yielded , happily expectant , though she was not , like her sister , budding in young womanhood and she did not feel Gah 's erotic bliss . She liked to be fondled , but when Gah stopped caressing with her tongue and began to examine  | her , Murah drew away . She was only eight , and Gah was ten . For many weeks now , Gah had been looked upon with covetous eyes by Wuh , a strange young man who had joined the group . He was an interloper who remained apart from the others because Ho-wha turned upon him with scowling anger and threatened him if he came near . While the girls played , Wuh sat in his bed and looked round him . He had built it , as he always did , at some distance from Ho-wha and the women , but his aloofness did not mean that he was content to live apart from them . Sly and cunning , like all the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the females , he lived and slept on the margin of their lives and awaited his time . If he had dared , he would have gone to Gah to roll in the grass and embrace her . That she was ripe and approachable he had known since the day he joined the group , when , standing apart and looking in turn at the females , he fixed his lustful interest on her . He was not the only young man here with such knowledge and lusting in his mind . Hwah , Ho-wha 's own son , a huge fellow of sixteen , also coveted Gah ; and the fact that she was his sister was not one of his recognitions . These people knew nothing about kinship . A man took a mate when and where he could  --  and he took his own mother if the father was slain in battle or if the son could drive him out . Dull-witted , and less cunning and eager than Wuh , Hwah had curled up in his bed to sleep ; and if he had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he expected soon to be driven from the group , as was the custom with his people . He would be  | driven forth , as Wuh had been , and would , like him , join another family elsewhere . Wuh , sitting in his bed and listening to the shrill excitement of Gah , was troubled by the invisible boundary which he dared not cross . Ho-wha was a selfish and tyrannical lord . Insatiable in his lust and absolute in his despotism , he forced his women to yield at the most unlikely moments , and ignored , as an obdurate tyrant is privileged to , the greedy and angry watchfulness of the other men . Not always , Wuh reflected in his small dark mind , would life in the group be as it was now . If he could not slyly seize a mate and run off with her , then the day must come when he would attack Ho-wha and try to kill him . An unexpected sound drew his attention away from the girls . Ho-wha had summoned his youngest woman to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedient slave she was , to scratch his back . With strong fingernails she curried the heavy dark hair on his broad shoulders , and he grunted with pleasure . Wuh wanted a mate to do these little things for him ; because he itched , too , sometimes with almost intolerable impatience . He wanted a mate who would search his scalp for bugs that housed themselves there , who would fill him with bliss as she dug sharp nails along his spine , and who , when he was well fed and vain and indulgent , would fondle him and examine him with little cries of pleasure . He wanted , in this moment , to grunt out of deep delight as Ho-wha was grunting now . On Who-ah 's back clung her infant who looked curiously round him , and presently he decided to explore as much of the dark jungle world as lay within reach . Venturing downward , and grasping his mother 's hair as he descended , as if letting himself down from a tree , he at  | last freed his clutch on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . Who-ah now divided her attention between her mate and her son . She raked the broad dirty back and then paused and turned to see what mischief her son was up to ; and when he moved to crawl away on hands and knees , intent on exploring the leafy depths around him , she reached down and gave him a smart slap on his pate that knocked him over . He whimpered but he did not return to his perch . Ho-wha spoke in a rumbling growl of warning , and at once she resumed her scratching , but her eyes and ears were still on her son . When he made another move to escape , she seized him by a leg and dragged him back and cuffed him , and thereupon he was content to sit by her and stare with dark brown eyes at the dank gloom . Wuh had been watching this family idyl and thinking of it with all the mind he had . Two months had passed since his father had attacked him with awful fury and driven him out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . When a son reached manhood he was forced to leave the group and seek a life of his own ; but the daughters remained in the group and became sexual mates of their father . Sometimes , though , a son grew to such strength and courage that he stood his ground and fought it out with his sire . If he won in the duel of ferocity and might , he took over the family as his own and the father became a solitary and lonely wanderer . There was Ghak . He did not belong to this group . He was an old man who had been chased out by his own son or by the son of another ; but instead of leading a solitary life , as most of the old men did , he was trying to attach himself to Ho-wha 's clan . He had never been , even in his  | prime , a mighty man like Ho-wha . From a scrawny and undersized tantrum child he had grown into a neurotic adult , subject to stormy moods and glottal cramp attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy victim for any more aggressive and more powerful man . He was , indeed , and had always been , full of self-pity and mean vengeful trickeries , and now in old age he hated and feared every living thing . Wuh was not that kind of man , nor did he have Howha 's sullen and wrathful temperament . By nature he was sanguine and gay , full of fun and optimism and hope , and inclined to plot for what he wanted rather than to fight for it . He was by far the most intelligent man in the group . Never for a moment , save when feeling foolhardy and frustrated , did he intend to have a physical showdown with Ho-wha . He was afraid of him ; and besides , Wuh was a very cunning fellow with the makings in him of a smooth and practiced knave . Most men took by force what they wanted ; but some , like Wuh , sat around with sly faces and infinite patience and bided their time . Watching Who-ah curry her lord 's back , Wuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert in reading feminine whims and fancies , he had perceived from the first that Who-ah was bored with her mate . Or perhaps that is not the right word . She resented him and his moody and unexpected hungers and his insatiable wish for little attentions when she was sleepy and tired . Of the three , she was his favorite woman , but favoritism in Howha placed on the unlucky one not greater kindness but greater burdens . Kuoh he ignored completely , and not in many evenings had he summoned Ka-ka to search his scalp or awaken ecstasies along his itching spine .  | All these things Wuh intuitively perceived , no matter how dimly . They were not facts that he counted off one by one , relating each to its cause and motives . They were matters which he sensed as he sensed the approach of morning or evening or the invisible presence of a leopard or the erotic hunger of Gah . His plotting , too  --  such as he was capable of  --  though far beyond in its subtlety and sagacity anything Ho-wha could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calculating mind . It was very simple because its materials were simple things . I lc felt , for instance , that if he ever caught Gall safely out of sight of the tyrant he could quickly approach and embrace her . Perhaps Ho-wha knew that much also  --  because he never let her out of his sight . Wuh realized , too , with an emotion akin to despair , that Gah would soon be drawn into Ho-wha 's group of women , and that Murah , in time , would follow her . He knew these things as clearly as he knew the use of bananas or the covering of the oil palm or the leaves of the Christmas tree . He thought and worried about them and plotted meanwhile to wrest authority from Ho-wha and drive him out . If he had been a little more intelligent than he was , he would have fashioned some kind of snare for the man and choked him to death . Murder was not a crime among these people . By discovering new uses for their hands , and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted themselves far above the level of beasts ; but they had no notions of right and wrong . Selfish , greedy , sly , covetous , and vain , their chief task was to survive , to outwit their enemies , to find an abundance of good things to eat , and to spend their sexual hunger in lustful mating . The men took women  | when and where they could and kept them as long as they were physically able ; and as they grew old and feeble they lost them to younger men . A part of their lives and their energy was spent in ferocious brawls over women . Toward their fierce feuds and fighting the women were indifferent , going obediently with the lord who in any moment proved to be their master . The men were jealous , and often murderously so , but the women were not . They were content to be protected and to bear their young and to be guided to the lushest feeding grounds . After Who-ah returned to her bed , with the infant again riding her shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face on a hairy arm , and fell asleep . In another bed , Gah and Murah , the two girls , were asleep , too , lying in one another 's arms and almost mouth to mouth . A small lad shared his mother 's bed ; Ka-ka slept alone . Hwah , the big morose son , slept alone , too , as did Kuoh , the old and unloved and barren wife . Ghoo , the horribly ugly woman , slept near the only one in the group who was kind to her , Kughh , the dwarf . Wuh looked round him at the deep jungle night but he was still thinking of the females and particularly of Gah . In his mind was the dark and obscure notion of going quietly to her bed and dragging her off to his hammock . Perhaps , indeed , he could flee with her while all the others slept ; but also in his mind was fear of Ho-wha who often awakened during the night to peer about him and see if all was well . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth his wrath like an attempt on the part of another male to steal one of his women . But also , during this long-ago time , there was nothing that could goad a man to such foolhardy daring and dangerous risks  | as his lusting for a mate . That is why Wuh sat on his bed , sleepless , resentful , baffled , and considered his loneliness . He was helpless between his fear of Ho-wha and his hunger for the girl . Sometimes , when placed in such a predicament , bachelors less timid or less discreet challenged the lord of a family and fought it out with him ; and then the jungle roared with the desperate struggle . They fought with powerful hands and strong teeth , and the women and children stood back , trembling , and waited . Usually the vanquished one was driven out , lacerated and bloody and defeated ; now and then he was slain . More rarely the two fought until they were both killed or later died of their wounds . Almost from birth until he was driven out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the bold men who invaded his domain ; and because he was an uncommonly thoughtful child he had decided that discretion was of more worth than valor . That was a tremendous decision to come to . Perhaps he was not the first among men to perceive that sly plotting could often accomplish more than frank and unabashed warfare , but he was one of the first to stick to this social philosophy , even in the face of the most provocative temptation to fight . This new perspective was to become his great advantage over less intelligent competitors . Obscurely related to it was another fact which Wuh had observed . He had no concept of old age , but he knew , perhaps intuitively , that the time must come when the boss of any family would be overthrown by a rival . That had happened to Ghak . That had happened to many old fellows , now gray and solitary , whom Wuh had seen during his wanderings . They had been driven  | out to spend their last years in solitude and to die alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually slain by their enemies , by the great snakes or the leopard or by other beasts of forest or plain . These old men , enfeebled , crippled by old scars , and full of inflammation and pains , became more and more defenseless ; and at last the beasts and the vultures closed in . But Wuh was not thinking of that . All that , it may be , was a dimly realized part of his knowledge and of his feelings about himself and his people ; but when a man was young and vital he did not think about the old or care what they did . Age and death were not a part of his consciousness or his interests . He was solely concerned about females and food and safety from his foes . It never occurred to him , or to any other young person of his time , that some day he would be old and abandoned , diseased and sick , and haunted not by the fears of youth but by the loneliness and dread of age . Wuh stirred on his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hear Ho-wha 's deep and rumbling snores , and in the beds around Ho-wha he could see the dark bodies of the women and children . Discretion told him to curl up in his bed and sleep , but the hunger in him was a persistent and throbbing unhappiness that beat as an invigorating and wakeful pulse in his whole being . It was an almost irresistible impulse to reach out with his arms and clasp and embrace . It was a hot and anguished wish to explore with his hands and eyes and tongue . And it was an unrelenting compulsion that made him sit up in his bed , rigidly attentive , his eyes staring with hypnotic earnestness into the darkness where Gah slept . At last , moved by the aching hunger in him that was as  | deep as life , he rose softly , stealthily , and stood erect . His breathing was as loud and labored as that of a beast in pain . After staring for a long moment over at the black shadow of Ho-wha and listening for the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his bed , and went as noiselessly as if his feet had been sheathed with fur . Without snapping a twig or rustling a vine he reached Gah 's bed and dropped softly to his hands and peered at her sleeping face . She and Murah were lying on their sides , with arms thrown across one another . As soon as he felt the warmth of them , Wuh almost yielded to an impulse to examine the girls . He wanted to pull Gah toward him and turn her over and over and with all his senses inspect her from head to feet , feeling and smelling her , biting her gently , exploring her with his tongue , and discovering everything about her that made her a woman and not a man . He wanted her to examine him , too , and play with him ; to slap and cuff him about with excited interest ; to awaken all the lust in him and bring it into sharp focus and then to assume a sexual posture and reach round with a hand and draw him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , and his instinctive behavior was a little inhibited and confused . Besides , all the while , like a dark threat of teeth and hands in his mind , there was his realization of Ho-wha , snoring in slumber a few feet away . Without touching the girls , Wuh sat by their bed and continued to look at them . He stared at their faces as if expecting to find there a response to his desire . Presently he had to fight against another impulse . He wanted to crouch forward and lick Gah 's neck and cheeks with his tongue ; and he did move a little toward her , very gently , but instead of touching her he began to play with himself .  | A few minutes later , without having touched or disturbed the girls , he slunk back to his bed . He felt more at peace now , but it was a shoddy and unmanly peace that gave no homage to his ego . It was a softening of the wild and lusting pain that had driven him , against his fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like one returned from the leopard 's path to the rabbit 's den ; and he felt , too , the gall of his plight , as if his feast of ecstasy had been tinctured with bitter juices . He felt no shame , no guilt , no disgust , but in him was the obscure unhappiness , the frustration , the outrage of his manhood that would eventually , in the ages to come , father and foster a concept of sin . He stretched out on his bed under the black canopy of the jungle but he did not sleep for a long while .  | WHEN morning came Ho-wha was the first to bestir himself . He awoke and yawned and stood up to look round him , and then gave a thunderous yell to arouse the group . One by one they stirred and rose , including Wuh who had been dreaming simple dreams of eating and lusting . The women and all the children , except the morose and sullen Hwah , gathered around their lord . Hwah and Wuh and Ghak , the embittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely daylight ; the jungle was still full of the sleepy dusk of night . Ho-wha , still standing in his bed and looking round him , was wondering in which direction grew the juiciest plants and fruits . His hunger for food , like that of all people of this time , was ravenous , and especially upon waking in the morning . He felt as if his great protuberant paunch had been empty for a long while . Shouting again , as if the sound of his voice gave him a sense of dominance and power , he left his bed and set off through the leafy and interlaced walls of vine and fern ,  | with the women and children eagerly trailing him and the other men falling in behind . He fed a little as he went , pausing to gather a handful of leaves or to break a stalk and examine its heart ; and humbly the others paused behind him , waiting on his will . He was seeking a plantain thicket , and after a half-hour of wandering he came to one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich and abundant breakfast , close by a garden of fragrant bloom . Taking as his own the choicest spot , Ho-wha began to eat , and he ate with the zestful gusto of the tiger or the wolf , feeding his huge mouth with both hands and acting as if he intended to draw the whole forest into his stomach . He liked the fruit of the plantain but preferred the succulent heart of the stalk . The stalk he tore open and twisted until the heart fell free in his hands . The fruit , a red pod filled with bitter seeds and soft pulp , was a favorite with the children ; but Ho-wha found it a little too caustic in the first ravenous hunger of morning . He had more relish for it after his belly was nearly full . While he ate , indifferent to all hungers but his own , Who-ah nursed her baby . The infant seized with both hands a dark pendulous breast and sucked for all he was worth ; and his mother caressed him and stared at him with affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , was bending stalks down for Kughh , the dwarf , to reach and rend ; and with that maternal tenderness which was her most dominant trait , she denied her own hunger while feeding the hideously malformed idiot whom she had adopted as her own . Ka-ka was feeding with the girls close by her . At some distance from all these were the other men .  | Hwah , a greedy and selfish lout , born in the image of his father , paid no attention to anyone . Ghak , the old man , full of self-pity and tantrums , half-screened himself with a vine tangle , but he divided his attention between food and Ho-wha , whom he constantly watched . During most of the time his fear of Ho-wha almost paralyzed his will . When that giant looked at him he began to tremble and stood as if hypnotized ; and the instant Ho-wha took his scowling gaze away , Ghak hastily withdrew to a safer distance . He lived on the margin of the group life and never dared venture close to any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hop up and down and scream and beat his knuckles on the earth , he kept himself ready for instant flight . Wuh was also feeding apart and alone , with one eye on Ho-wha and the other on the women . He was eating , and staring with a kind of meditative lustfulness at Gab , when Ghak , for no reason at all , began to work up a dreadful fury . Perhaps a thorn had pricked him or the fruit had been too bitter on his tongue ; or perhaps , and more plausibly , it was only because he felt abandoned and useless and wanted the others to be compassionately aware of him . In any case , he suddenly gave a fearful yell and then beat his breast while uttering a dismally plaintive " Ohhh ! " that dropped a note in pitch and ended in a long-drawn whine . Nobody paid any attention to that ; whereupon , as if he had only been announcing himself , Ghak began to leap up and down and tear madly at the vines and howl as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simulated , it became , nevertheless , very real ? so real , indeed , that it churned him in its violence until his mouth slobbered and his eyes bulged . His cries now  | started off with a long doleful bleat and then burst explosively as if set off with powder and poured out of him in choking howls . He tore at his hair , at his limbs , at the brush around him . He gouged at the earth with his long nails or attacked a tree and ripped scars down its bark . He beat the tree with his hands , hopping up and down meanwhile , and then hurled himself to the ground and tumbled over and over , hissing and writhing as if in the throes of a deadly poison . Ho-wha had stopped feeding . It was not that he cared anything about Ghak or what , the petulant old fool did . It was only because violent sounds and extremes of frenzy invaded his breakfasting calm and demanded attention . He looked over at Ghak as he might have stared at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mildly , quietly annoyed because this unpredictable lunatic was making such an uproar that feeding for the moment was out of the question . Others , too , were looking at Ghak , but only one of them moved toward him . Ghoo , the ugly one , the warden of the dwarf , was sympathetic , but she went experimentally , as if her legs responded step by step to the uncertainty in her mind . Upon approaching within a few feet of Ghak she paused and looked at him , her large brown eyes full of compassionate inquiry . But she made no move to touch or restrain the self-pitying simpleton who was now sitting on the earth and hammering it and venting his sickness of soul in chilling wails . Ghoo stood where she was because she was baffled . She had seen him in a tantrum before but his behavior was a riddle to her , as it was to all the other people here . Tantrum children she had seen and in a mother 's way she had understood them ;  | but there seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat helplessly on a nest of thorns . Ho-wha resumed his eating . A lot of things interrupted and angered him a little as this old man did . There was the loud racket of jungle birds or the gibbering of monkeys . They often beat upon the morning calm , but they were not dangerous and Ho-wha strove to ignore them . Ghak was the same kind of harmless nuisance . If Ho-wha had ever felt deep anger because of the old fellow 's tantrums , he would have slain him long ago . Ghak had worked himself into an attack of cramps that had silenced his voice and almost paralyzed his body ; and now he lay on the earth , suffering intense pain and looking beseechingly at Ghoo . She was the only one who paid any attention to him after his outcry ceased . Wuh had been slyly watching and eating . The sounds of physical agony in one of their fellows was deeply disturbing to all people except infants ; but their response to suffering was wholly emotional and beyond their will , a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of their own personal welfare . Perhaps it was instinctive with them . Even Who-ah 's baby had cried out as if in pain , and the other young children had moved in close to their mothers . Wuh had been excited , too , by Ghak 's dreadful yelling , but he was more intelligent than the others and had dim notions of a few relationships and values . He knew , or at least he felt , that Ghak was only acting a part ; but nevertheless his scalp had begun to tingle and the hair had risen on his head , and over his body he had a creeping gooseflesh alarm . He had made an irrational response and vaguely he knew it and that is why he had tried to ignore  | Ghak . He wondered , meanwhile , if Ho-wha would march over to slap the old fellow down . If he did , then , Wuh perceived , there would be a chance for him , in the confusion of the moment , to seize Gah and drag her off into hiding . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of sullen contemplation of the old man , he had resumed his eating , and he did not pause again until his belly was full . The women and children also ate again , being largely guided in all but their instinctive acts by what their master did . The baby stopped crying . The other children moved away from their mothers . After Ho-wha had crammed into his bulging stomach all the plantain hearts it would hold he was thirsty , and when he wanted a thing he never consulted any wish but his own . With a roar to advise them that he was on the march again , he set off in search of water , and obediently the others fell in behind him . Ghak was the last one to go . Either very sick or pretending to be , he paid no heed to them until Ka-ka had passed out of sight ; whereupon , with a howl of dismay and terror , he leapt up , as nimble as any other , and rushed after the column . Ho-wha took a devious course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then to lick a spoonful of dew from cupped leaves . When he came to a fresh-water lake he shouted again as if to point out to them what they could all plainly see . Many generations before , their ancestors had drunk by kneeling to a stream and lapping in the manner of wolves ; but these people had learned to drink from their cupped palms . Sometimes the children preferred to lie on their bellies and drink . Like all the other people of the earth they were afraid of water  | and none of them was able to swim . When , in their nomadic wanderings , they came to a deep river or lake , they made no attempt to cross it but accepted it as one of the boundaries of their domain . Deep water for them was a terrible thing like lightning and thunder and fire . A storm on a lake or the sea , plunging in great waves and roaring toward them in a foaming tide , could almost paralyze them with dread and make the boldest man whimper like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and destroying thing . Having slaked his thirst , Ho-wha marched back into the jungle , followed by the others . He wanted an open spot where he could stretch his huge body at ease and feel the warm sun upon it . This area of wilderness pleased him . Food was abundant , and he had seen no sign of his most deadly enemies , the skulking leopard and the coiled and waiting snakes . He was a lazy , a complacently indolent , man who was content to feed and mate and sleep . If all people had been like him , there could have been no progress , but only the cycle , endlessly repeated , of birth and vigilant idleness and death . It was restless and frustrated men like Wuh and women like Who-ah who added a little , generation by generation , to the heritage of their race . Finding a big tree in full sunlight , Ho-wha sat with his back against it and relaxed . His long hairy arms lay idly at his sides . His chin sank to the thick growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace but his dark brown eyes , showing no iris , and set with small pupils that were like points of light , missed nothing that went on around him . Every member of his family , as well as the  | interloping bachelor and the silly old Ghak , he kept within the circumference of a watchful distrust . Ka-ka , the pregnant one , was resting not far from her lord . By a drooping wall of vegetable ropes and mosses and parasitic creepers , Murah was playing with a half brother , a lad of four . They were busy inspecting one another and picking insects out of their hair . At some distance from them sat Ghoo , gazing fondly at the stupid and misshapen and almost speechless Kughh , whom she had adopted to care for and cherish . Ghoo was so repulsive that Ho-wha had never shown her any favors . Ugliness was not a recognition among these people unless it was so extreme as to be horrifying . Ghoo was so pathologically thin of hair that she looked naked . She looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and pimpled her flesh with tiny chronic sores ; for her skin seemed to be abraded and yellow and ripe with disease . The natural body odor of these people , when glowing with health , was a strong musk smell ; but about Ghoo there was an awful stench . None of them could endure the smell of her except the dwarf about whom there was a strong unnatural odor . Ghoo 's face was as hideous as her skin . Her grotesquely long upper lip was completely hairless and looked leprous ; and her overhanging brow ridges were barren and yellow . But in her face was a gentleness to be seen in no other face here  --  the kindly inoffensiveness of one in whom all the native savagery had been chastened and subdued by social ostracism . Timid , submissive , and denied children of her own , she kept out of everybody 's way , asking only the privilege of devoting herself to the idiot who had been abandoned by his own family .  | Once or twice she had made a friendly gesture toward Ghak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Ghak spurned her . He had nobody , not even a dwarf , to call his own , but he did not want this unsightly and illsmelling female . In his foolish old heart he wanted Gah , and he often sat and looked at her , perceiving no good reason why an old and worn-out man like himself should not have a young girl . He did not actively strive to possess her . He was too lost in self-pitying darkness to do more than to stare at her with rheumy old eyes that were full of chronic lusting and an outcast 's loneliness . He hated Ho-wha with all the strength left in his senile mind , and if he had had the power of prayer in him , he would have prayed for Ho-wha 's death . Ho-wha sensed none of all that . He suffered the old man 's presence because he did not recognize in him a rival ; nor did he , for that matter , see a rival worth bothering with in Wuh . To understand why , it is necessary to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average man of his time in size , he weighed more than three hundred pounds and stood close to six feet in height . Never had he faced a rival who had been a match for him . More than one bold bachelor had invaded his small kingdom to dispute with him over his women . All but one of them had fled with the marks of Ho-wha 's teeth in their flesh and the memory of choking hands on their throats . One of them Ho-wha had slain . He did not like the presence of Wuh , but as long as that man minded his business , the lazy and complacent Ho-wha was content to let him remain . If he had been more intelligent , if he had observed and understood what was going on around him , he would have been worried  | by Hwah , his oldest son . Ghak eyed the giant with petulant resentment , Wuh with sly distaste , but Hwah looked at him with thoughts of murder maturing in his heart . And Hwah , not fully grown yet , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The morning drew to noon and the lord of the clan still sunned himself ; but another hunger was beginning to suffuse him with its warmth . He looked at the women ? at Ka-ka first , who , lying on the ground , seemed to be nothing much except a great belly to which were attached arms and legs and a head . He looked at Who-ah , who was nursing her infant . The babe had grasped a brown dug with both hands and was vigorously drawing milk from a nipple . For a long moment Ho-wha stared at the child . These people never mated during the period of lactation ; and Ho-wha , therefore , had had for more than two weeks only a pregnant wife to ease his lust . He was weary of her and more morose than was his habit . Ka-ka did not feel well . She resented his despotic demands ; and besides , she was a large and powerful woman and sometimes when he laid his hands on her she snarled at him and bit or struck him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because she wished to but because he was stronger . After looking at Who-ah and sensing that the child made her unapproachable , Ho-wha turned again to Ka-ka ; and as if the sight of her had been enough to release his will , he grunted and rose to his short hairy legs . When he rose , every person in the group except the baby stiffened with uncertainty and suspense . They did not know what was in his mind , but whatever it was , they knew they would not like it .  | While Ho-wha stood by the tree , staring at Ka-ka , and intending in a moment to go over and seize her and force her to mate with him , his attention was caught by his oldest daughter . Gah had been rolling in the grass and playing erotically with Murah . Ho-wha sensed in her a lustful excitement , and instead of striding toward Ka-ka he turned toward her . A strange thing happened that would be difficult to explain . Perhaps Gah was frightened by his abrupt advance or perhaps she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approaching male because it is in the nature of the female to flee . In any case , she leapt up and ran , and Ho-wha paused in astonished wrath to stare after her . She ran to the leafy wall and vanished into it and then turned to peer out ; and for a long moment Ho-wha , baffled and angry , looked at the spot where she had disappeared , and the other persons looked at him . The people of this age had not learned to express their joy or their malicious triumph in laughter . If they had been able to shout with glee , Wuh would have shouted now . He was as maliciously pleased as a primitive man could be . At first he thought of dashing into the thicket to seize Gah and make off with her ; but on second thought his ardor was cooled by the threatening hulk of an angry man . So Wuh sat where he was and waited to see what Ho-wha would do . Ho-wha struck his breast a great blow and roared  --  and the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlish foolishness and come to him . If he had had the power of speech he would have scolded and abused her ; but because he was only a dull-witted man he started toward her  | in baffled rage , and in the same instant Gab 's face completely vanished . When she withdrew her face , Wuh moved swiftly toward the thicket , but a roar of anger that could have been heard for miles stopped him in his tracks . Ho-wha had read the man 's intention . His annoyance with Gah had been nothing at all in comparison with the rage he felt now . He started toward Wuh , but that sly fellow , who depended more on his cunning than on his teeth , promptly fled away from the thicket and threw himself to the earth and cowered abjectly . Ho-wha paused . He looked at the wall where Gah was hiding and then at Wuh ; and after turning from one to the other as if caught helplessly between two urges of equal strength , he swung suddenly and laid his big hands on Ka-ka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of them , including the baby , now watched him with intent eyes . Gah was peering out to watch him too . Shaking more with fury than with lust , Ho-wha rolled his woman over and over as if she were a barrel and then lifted her and set her down on her rump . After staring at her a moment , he reached long arms around her and set her on hands and feet , making it as plain as he could that she was to assume a sexual posture . But Ka-ka was an angry and an outraged woman . She bit his arm , an indiscretion that fetched from him a dreadful bellow of wrath ; she tore at him with long sharp nails ; she slapped him with the calloused heels of her palms . If she had persisted in the struggle he probably would have killed her . The excitement of the moment , the vision of a huge despotic fellow mauling a female , threw Ghak into one of his tantrums . He began to howl as if covered with  | leeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly about him , and then dropped it and smote his breast . His eyes all the while were fixed on Ho-wha mating with his woman . The sight of it was almost more than he could endure . Thrusting his long lips out in a monstrous pucker , he drooled with rage and fear and drummed with both palms on his distended cheeks . He was so excited and terrified that he fouled himself with his own excrement . Wuh 's anguish was just as extreme but he gave no sign of it . His face had turned a brownish yellow and his loose lips quivered , but he did not move because he was the prisoner of fear . It was Hwah , the oldest son , who was the most dreadful one to look at . He stood on his feet , his body tense , the hair erect on his scalp , and his eyes shining like windows upon the murder in his mind .  | 3 A FORTNIGHT later , Ka-ka knew that birth of a child was imminent . For many days she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because birth among these primitive people was not the easy and casual thing it was among the beasts . Parturition often took an hour or more and sometimes the mother 's agony was severe and prolonged . Sometimes , indeed , the child was born dead , choked by the cord or suffocated in the delivery ; and now and then a mother , especially if very young , forfeited her own life . Childbirth was one of the most harrowing of all the experiences common to these people , and none of them , during the delivery of the young , was unaffected by the mother 's struggle and her cries of pain . When , therefore , Ka-ka took great care one evening in the making of her bed , they all sensed that a crisis was at hand . Adding to their apprehension was the ominous rumbling of a dark and distant storm . A wind made whips of the tree tops and the jungle roof lashed like frenzied arms . Lightning awoke on the night sky in broad dim  | fields . There was a smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest and the earth . Unaided , but with the whole group watchful and sympathetic , Ka-ka bent many supple vines toward a common center and united them in a soft and cushioned tangle ; and then she gathered huge green leaves and spread them over the hammock . For an hour or more she labored , fastidious and thorough and silent . She wanted a deep lush bed on which with ease she could assume the crouched position of birth-giving . These people had not learned to build shelters . Under the wildest storms or in the bitterest weather they were unprotected except by their hair . When drenched by a sudden deluge they sat around like shivering half-drowned things , waiting for the storm to pass . In unusually cold weather they sometimes drew vines and big leaves over their bodies , but a thunderstorm was a wet and roaring terror which they fearfully and patiently endured . Ka-ka looked up through jungle ceiling at a patch of sky , sensing that in this night a wild storm would be roaring above the trees and loosing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and she was trembling when she entered her bed . Ho-wha felt as tender and solicitous as a man of his dull and savage nature had power to feel . Only two things in life , a mother giving birth and a helpless infant , could soften him to gentleness . This in him was not , of course , a reasoning and purposeful behavior ; it was only his heritage , the instinctive duty of the guardian male . After a child was old enough to care for itself he paid no attention to it unless he saw it in danger ; nor did mothers have maternal interest in their offspring after they were grown .  | The affection of father and mother , the latter 's much stronger and more enduring , was chiefly a watchful custody of the child during the years when it was easy prey . Ho-wha was anxious tonight . He sensed that another child , a tiny creature , naked and helpless , and dependent on him , would soon join the group . Until the ordeal was over there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand guard against his enemies , the tiger and the leopard , who , smelling the blood of birth or hearing the cries of a mother in pain , might press in from darkness , eager to kill . At thought of them he felt the hair stand erect on his skull and down his spine . While Ka-ka smoothed her bed and took a crouching position , he marched round and round her , now and then giving a warning cry that roared with the thunder or rushing toward the jungle wall when he thought something was moving there ; and after she began to shake in her bed and moan he doubled his vigilance . If one of the other males had ventured near her he would have leapt upon him and tried to tear him limb from limb . In a time like this he did not distinguish between enemy and friend . The path he made around her bed was the boundary against all invasion ; and the others , more in dread of him than of the storm , had withdrawn to a considerable distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After making and entering their beds they were disturbed and unhappy ; for they were only a small group of people in a vast world , in a dark and terrible world that was full of pain and struggle and death . Their dread of it , of the unknown and the unforeseen , was always with them , was in their minds a troubled wonder and a constant anxiety even in their most carefree moments . When feeding or  | mating or playing their games there was about them the nervous apprehension of the hunted . Their fear of death was an instinctive and desperate struggle against it . Of what it was or why it must be they had no notion ; but it was for them one of the certainties ; and in opposition to the destroying power of it they had set the wonder of birth . Birth , too , they did not understand at all , but in their simple way they thought about it , and they had begun , no matter how obscurely , to invest it with mystery and to regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued from one of them . That much they knew . They did not know that their sexual matings had anything to do with the miracle of a new life . Periodically , mysteriously , it came ; and after a while it ceased to be . There was no natural death among them . When young they sometimes died of wounds or more infrequently of disease , and when old they were slain by their enemies . This was so not only of the males who were driven out to a solitary life , but also of the females who , becoming enfeebled , fell more and more behind the wandering groups . Birth , therefore , was a precious thing for them , and their eager welcome of a babe was as characteristic of them as their indifference to the old . They learned early to rest their faith in the womb instead of the graveyard . It could not be said of Ghak or Wuh , or indeed of Ho-wha himself , that they had any affection for the baby now coming or would ever have ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In numbers , in the mysterious fecund power of the mothers , was their principal assurance of survival . This in them was an intuitive recognition born of their instincts ; and when twins came their delight was extreme .  | So they all waited , hushed and anxious and expectant , while Ka-ka delivered a child . Crouching on hands and knees in her bed she clutched the vines and repeated endlessly a low plaintive whine of pain ; and above her , thunder shook the world , and lightning opened white valleys in the black sky . Ho-wha stood alone , a silent sentinel in the rain . Now and then he bellowed if he heard a sound or he went close to peer at her and learn if the new one had come . Rain was falling on the jungle . Rain hung in big drops to his hair and with a finger he would touch the drops and lick moisture from his hands . After a while he looked like a wet and gleaming monster in the darkness . When lightning flashed he lowered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by he bellowed with sudden anger and fear . This invisible voice out of the deep he hated because it came from nothing that he could see or attack . The lion sometimes roared , too , but he had seen the lion , as well as the saber-toothed tiger and the howling jackals and wolves ; but the angry bellowing above him and the terrifying illuminations in the dead of night came from some gigantic enemy whom he had never seen . He answered challenge with challenge , and when the thunder became louder and more threatening he worked himself into a dreadful fury . Then there was a lull in the clamor overhead and a steady rain fell . It was past midnight when Ho-wha peered at his woman and saw that the baby had come . Ka-ka was holding the infant in her lap and was very busy with it . The umbilical cord had not been severed but there would be time enough for that after she had made the child breathe . Babies were sometimes born dead ; nearly always they were born breathless and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do . For a few moments Ka-ka blew breath into the infant 's mouth . When that did not arouse it she slapped it vigorously and jounced it up and down . The child gave a barely audible gasp ; whereupon , with startling abruptness , like one who knew there was no time to be lost , Ka-ka clutched it to her breast and i put her mouth to its mouth and blew again . With her belly heaving like a deep bellows , she breathed into the babe , alternately forcing air to its throat and sucking the air out . Failing in this she shook it again and slapped its back and belly with hard blows ; and suddenly , with a strangled gurgle , the infant gulped air and filled its lungs . Ka-ka held it up and looked at it and listened . Perceiving that it was breathing naturally and steadily , she laid it across her lap and began to dry it . With rough palms she rubbed the moisture of rain and birth from its body , and with her tongue she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made low sounds of joy . The sound she made was a repeated cry , plaintive and monotonous and faintly tuneful . Some of the others , hearing the cry as they lay in their beds , sat up and listened ; and there was joy in their faces . There was joy in Ho-wha 's big brutal face as he stood by Ka-ka and watched . Next , she severed the cord . Holding the baby up and resting it on upturned palms , she chewed the cord in two close to the navel ; and then she grasped the placenta and moved it away from her bed . In an earlier time the mothers had eaten the placenta , and some of them did still , but Ka-ka had always thrown hers away . She now wanted to dry the child and make it warm . A heavy rain was falling and the babe was wet and chilled and whimpering . Weighing  | only about four pounds , and absolutely hairless except for the heavy growth on its skull , it was a helpless and shivering creature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out and broke off some leaves and spread them over it . But the leaves were wet and only added to the babe 's dismal whimpering . Perceiving this , Ka-ka brushed the leaves away and tucked the child close against her belly and bent forward to shelter it ; and in this position , holding it to the warmth of her body and keeping it dry , she spent the remainder of the night . When daylight came she inspected the babe . He was nothing much but a tiny paunch to which were attached two short and crooked and unfleshed legs , two powerful little arms as long as his legs , and a head covered with coarse black hair . His face was so seamed with wrinkles that it looked very old . His feet , with toes spread and grasping and with the large toe far removed from the others , were much like his hands . His eyes were tightly closed as if , having once looked at the world and found it frightening , he was resolved never to look again . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger she thrust against an upper lid and turned it back until she could see part of an eye ; but the instant she removed her finger the lid closed again and the wrinkled face puckered as if repressing a sneeze . Patiently and in turn she thrust the lids back and after a little while the babe began to blink in the strong light . The small eyes , a dark smoky brown , and with pupils so tiny they were barely visible , stared for a moment at his mother 's hairy belly and closed again . Ka-ka 's next urge was to feed her child . She held him cradled in her left arm and with her right hand pressed  | his face to her breast . At once , with eyes still tightly shut , he began to root about in search of a nipple ; and upon finding it he sucked with strong lusty hunger . His hands meanwhile explored and clung to her , and his feet also ; because his power of grasping with his feet almost equaled that of his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put a palm to his face and thrust his head back and guided his seeking mouth to the other nipple . While he filled his belly and clutched her hair with both feet and both hands , she bent over him , striving to caress his homely little face with her tongue . Her effort to reach down dislodged the nipple from his mouth , and with an impatient wheeze followed by a shrill bleat of anger , he tried to climb her frame ; but she shoved him down , allowing him to sit now on the shelf of her paunch , and gave him the nipple again . After his hunger was satisfied she held him up and gazed at him long and earnestly . She was not looking for birthmarks or malformed bones ; and yet in her simple way she was searching him to see if he was all right . He was so small that her hands completely encased his body , leaving only his head and feet visible . Next she laid him across her lap and turned him over and over , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , his legs , his genitals , and the wound at his navel ; she peered into his ears , she opened his big mouth and stared gravely at his throat , she searched the thatch on his skull for bugs , and she unclenched his hands and licked his palms . After looking him all over , she held him up again , her big strong hands embracing him , and stared at his face . He was a hideously naked little monster of bony angles and wrinkles and brown skin ; but not for her . Deciding that he was all  | right , she fondled him against her breast and murmured over him . The others had been eating their breakfast . They had spent an anxious night , alarmed by Ka-ka 's cries of pain and frightened by thunder , but the morning was cool and calm , with enough water on the plants to satisfy their thirst . They were talking in the way they had . Symbolic language they had not learned , but they made many sounds which they all understood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement , of anger , of concern . Now they were chattering happily because the crisis with Ka-ka had passed and their dreadful enemy in the sky had killed none of them . It was a ripe morning , full of fragrance and peace . Ho-wha was feeding alone when he heard a shriek from Ka-ka 's bed and quickly he marched over to see what the trouble was . But there was no cause for alarm . Unwittingly the mother had tickled her child and he had let off a howl of pleasure ; and now she was looking at him as if bewildered , and the babe was grunting and rooting at her because he wanted her to tickle him again . The hair on her arms had brushed the tender soles of his feet and he had liked the tingling sensation that flushed his nerves . Of his own will he moved his feet about and when at last he succeeded in tickling himself he puckered his face and gave another howl of joy . Ka-ka held him up to look at him . Ho-wha , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comically grave , and wondered if the cry had been one of pain . But the infant  --  whom we may as well call Kooloo because it means man of the woods  --  was only coming to life , now that his belly was full , and beginning a curious and insatiable exploration of a strange world . He had discovered  | that there was pleasure in it , and he was to be greedy , almost from the hour of birth , for all the pleasure he could find . Ho-wha 's grunt as he turned again to his breakfast seemed to be one of disgust . After the others had eaten they gathered round Ka-ka to stare at the newcomer . A baby just arrived was always for them a strange and inexplicable object , not only because it was so small and hairless and helpless , but also , and perhaps chiefly , because they had no understanding of how it came to be . Birth was the darkest of all mysteries . A babe , they knew , came from its mother 's body , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were always a little astonished to see one . They had a wish to take it in their hands and carefully inspect it from head to feet , as if by curious examination they might discover the secret of its origin . Because birth was a mystery , the people of this age had begun to feel for the mothers a vague reverence and awe . This was especially true of the males . They produced no young , and , so far as they knew , they played no part in the miracle . They had come to expect , almost to demand , infants from the females , and when one of them , like the unfortunate Kuoh , turned out to be barren , they resented and distrusted her . Often , in former times , Ho-wha had solemnly examined Kuoh 's genitals as if to learn why there was no baby in her . More recently he had tolerated but had felt no friendliness for her , and he cared little enough when she died . Now , after gathering round Ka-ka , they divided their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved , they did not presume to touch either of  | them ; and all the men , of course , except Ho-wha , remained discreetly in the background . Who-ah pressed forward , with her own child riding her shoulders and clutching her hair , and with her went Kuoh , the barren one , Ghoo , the ugly one , and the girls . While they peered at the child and talked out of excited wonder , Who-ah 's baby , perceiving the hideous little fellow lying in Ka-ka 's lap , decided to come down from his perch . He descended as if from a tree , with feet and hands clutching his mother 's hair or skin , and moved to crawl toward Kooloo ; but his mother cuffed him a vigorous blow that knocked him over . That so angered and frightened him that he gave a terrible squeal . Then Who-ah seized him and shook him and set him again on her shoulders , and he stood on her back , grasping the hair of her skull , and peered over and down at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , a scowling sentinel who uttered warning growls and kept his eyes on the other men . They , in turn , cautiously watched him while trying to look past the women at the child . To all this curious interest Ka-ka gave no heed . She licked her child or held him against her body to warm him or now and then with sudden interest she parted his coarse mop to look for bugs . If she glanced up , in the quick nervous way they all had , there was something tense and expectant in the way brown eyes looked into brown eyes . After a few minutes Ho-wha 's growl was almost a roar . He meant that the time for gawking was done and they should all scatter and mind their business . The other men moved away . Soon they all withdrew except Kuoh , the barren one . Sitting close by Ka-ka , she remained , her gaze fixed intently and hungrily on Kooloo ; and when Ho-wha  | gave another guttural warning she did not seem to hear . More than she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her arms and fondle it . She wanted to warm him and press his face to her empty brown dugs . When Ho-wha roared at her and came forward to strike , she did not look at him or move . Such disobedience frightened the others . It was a law among them that when the lord of the group spoke , the others must obey . As a matter of fact , every member of the group bossed , or , except Ho-wha , was bossed by somebody . There was no equality of privileges and rights . Only a person out of her mind could sit as Kuoh sat and dare the wrath of the tyrant . He growled again as he came toward her and when she did not leap up and run he struck her with a flat hand on the side of her skull and almost knocked her senseless . She lay sprawled and quivering by Ka-ka 's bed . When Ho-wha reached down to strike again , Hwah , his big morose son , stopped him with a thunderous cry . For a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted a warning at his father it would be difficult to say . He cared nothing about Kuoh . Perhaps it was only because he hated the brute ; more likely it was because people were awakened to instant and almost uncontrollable fury when they saw one of their kind in grave danger . It was the most violent of all the blind and murderous rages which they had power to feel . After Hwah shouted his warning , Who-ah screamed , and Ghak hopped up and down in shrill defiance . Instead of striking a second blow Ho-wha stood erect and looked across a distance of thirty yards at his son . The struggle between the two that was inevitably to come  | might have come now if Ghak had not made such an infernal uproar . He acted as if he were the one who had been abused . His insane behavior distracted Ho-wha 's attention and calmed his wrath . Kuoh , meanwhile , had crawled away .  | 4 THE people of this long-ago age were sometimes happy but they never lived happily together . In Ho-wha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were old enmities , petty feuds , jealousies , and the constant struggle for dominance and power . It could not have been otherwise among persons so restless and curious and energetic who had so little besides eating and sleeping to keep them busy . All of them except the meek ones like Ghoo or the stupid ones like Kughh were arrogant and overbearing egoists who wanted others to wait on them and defer to them and obey their will . When in the presence of enemies they swiftly united , of course , and forgot in the moment of danger their dislikes and grievances ; but when sheltered and secure they turned on one another . This was as true of the children as of the adults . Gah and Murah often played together , but Gah was the boss and often slapped her sister down . Who-ah 's older son , a husky youngster , was a tyrant with his younger brother and sometimes would have beaten  | him soundly if others had not intervened . From birth to death , nearly all of them tried to boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their chief meaning , their sense of personal worth , in domination , and the more tyrannical it was , the better they liked it . If they had been more intelligent , the stronger ones would have tried to enslave the weaker ones and hold them in serfdom . They were not yet civilized enough to perceive any advantages in that . Nevertheless , Ho-wha now and then seemed to have a vague inkling , and Wuh an almost definite notion , of what a more ruthless and resourceful tyranny might achieve . The former , for instance , not only delighted in summoning his women to scratch his back or search his hair ; he also would sit at ease , as if labor were unworthy of him , and try to command the others to bring him food . If he usually bestirred himself at feeding time , that was only because he had a selfish desire to seize for his own use the best of everything in sight . The children faithfully imitated him . Observing one evening that Ho-wha sat by a tree , clamoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise ; and he chose a tree and sat by it , assuming , as well as he was able , the posture and the ferocious aspect of his sire . Then he yelled angrily at his small brother , trying to make him understand that he wanted whatever it was that Ho-wha desired . But the younger lad would have none of that . On the contrary , he sat by a tree , too , and barked at his sisters . He looked over to observe how his brother was sitting , an I the brother in turn alertly watched the father ; and so the three of them , arrogant and impatient , sat there by trees and yelled at the women and girls . It was during such family scenes that Wuh came close  | to a sense of humor . He did not actually smile , but he did narrow his eyes and thrust his long upper lip out and down . Perhaps , though , the joy he felt was malicious and always more intense when Ho-wha was thwarted ; because Wuh , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would jump and tremble when he yelled . He did not realize that frustration was developing his mind and leading it to notions that otherwise he would never have perceived ; or that Ho-wha , on the other hand , was seduced by his arrogant power into being content with what he was . For many days after the birth of Kooloo their lives were uneventfully lazy . Each day they ate in a new spot and each night they slept in fresh beds . In all but Wuh there was little incentive to seek more than they had or to wish to be more than they were . Wuh , the plotter , the sly bachelor , the fawning and two-faced interloper who had been kicked out of another clan , impatiently watched and waited . One evening the discretion in him almost gave way to foolhardy courage . Since Kooloo came , Ho-wha had been a continent and a very sullen man . Each day had added to his moroseness and his wrath . One of his women was old and barren , another was ugly and sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening after eating his supper and making his bed he had growled in gloomy discontent because nobody now scratched his broad and dirty back or picked thorns out of his flesh ; but chiefly he growled because he was an erotically frustrated man . He would glare at his two favorite women , sitting in their beds and caring for their infants , and when neither of them paid any attention to him he would bellow with rage . Because  | the older children and the other men had daily become more afraid of him , they made their beds half-screened from his sight . What Ho-wha could not see he was unable to be aware of . He would look round him as if searching for the other men and then fix his terrible gaze on the women ; and after growling and roaring and making everybody anxious he would fall asleep . One evening while shaking himself in a tantrum of anger and self-pity he espied Gah . At once he fell silent and looked at her as if wondering where she had been all the while and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slyly watching , knew that the hour had come . After staring at the girl and making up his dull mind , Ho-wha called to her . It was the cry of the male to the female . Gah understood it and turned to flee , but a furious bellow stopped her short . She understood that , too . Trembling with fear she looked over at him and Ho-wha looked at her ; and then he called again . It was a tense and dreadful moment . As usual , when he saw a younger man lusting for a woman , and was thereby reminded of his own senile loneliness , Ghak began to talk in hysterical gibberish . None of the others made a sound . Hwah softly rose in his bed and looked across at his sire . Wuh sat half-concealed and peered at Gah . She was still transfixed between fear of disobedience and a desire to flee . It was a trait of women to be both attracted and repelled by their men . As if born to rape , yet resenting its brutal indignities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flight ; but at the same time they were fascinated and allured by the male 's imperious strength and will . This was especially true of them when young . But even  | in the older women , even in the grandmothers , a shy and timorous modesty sometimes made them behave like virginal girls . They , too , were both fascinated and terrified by the candid lustfulness of their master . And so it was with Gah now . She was so frightened by the big shaggy monster calling to her that she trembled all over ; but she was also thrilled by the fiercely lustful way in which he looked at her . One desire urged her to flight . The other desire was almost a wild compulsion to run over and throw herself at his feet and grovel before him . She wanted his big rough hands to seize and examine her . She wanted him to take her and force her to mate with him and then thrust her from his bed after his will was done . With an emotion no less intense she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle and hide . Caught and held by the ambivalence of her heritage , she was unable to move . Ho-wha left his bed and went toward her . She began to cry . She cowered and raised both arms as if to protect herself from blows . Her cry of fear and distress was a whimpering wail , and after a moment her sister Murah echoed it as if she , too , had been chosen for a dreadful mating . She leapt up and ran to Gah and threw her arms around her , and the two girls shivered and wailed together and waited for Ho-wha to strike . But he only seized both of them and dragged them to his bed . Presently Murah broke free and ran . Hwah , with his jealous rage beyond control , now advanced a few steps , smiting his breast and shouting a warning ; and Wuh , forgetting his customary discretion , also left his bed . The two men , standing almost side by side , set up a fearful outcry . They were telling Ho-wha not to ravish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like one who had found a treasure that completely engrossed his interest , he was examining Gah as if to learn how ripely female she was . He handled her with powerful ease , turning her over , laying her on her back , or setting her on hands and feet , and grunting all the while as if deeply pleased by what he saw . He did not look at the two enraged men who threatened and challenged him and drew nearer step by step . Gah had been helpless between fear and a wish to surrender . They were helpless between fear and rage . Hwah , the braver of the two , advanced again , leaving Wuh standing alone . He was still beating his breast and shouting a wild challenge . Wuh had cooled off a bit . A moment ago he had lost his head and had almost attacked a man twice as powerful as himself ; but now , recovering a little of his poise and remembering that he was not one who with hands and teeth took what he wanted , he fell silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile even withdrew a few steps and looked calmly around him . The women were paying no heed to all this uproar . When a male took a female , it was no affair of theirs . All their lives they had seen males , both man and beast , fight over the females , and Gah 's cries now they understood only too well . Years before , when young , they had cried aloud , too , when possessed against their will . Slaves to the passions of men and the chattels of their lust , they had learned that surrender and obedience were their lot in life . Ka-ka and Who-ah were holding their babies in sleep . Ghoo was lying in a bed with the dwarf , and Kuoh , the old one , was alone . Not a one of them stirred or looked over at the son who was crying murder at his father . If Murah had not been so young , Wuh would have  | tried to abduct her while Ho-wha was busy . Perceiving that she was only a child , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly or burdened with infants . He returned to his bed , this man who had in him the simple rudiments of a philosopher , and Hwah was left alone . Hwah was still howling with furious indecision . If he had been capable of so fine a judgment , he would have told himself that the tyrant could examine Gah as long as he did no more than that , and he would have been content merely to threaten and restrain him . As it was , he thought he could frighten Ho-wha and make him run . Men always strove to frighten their enemies , attacking only , but by no means always , after their breast-beating and shouting proved unavailing . Hwah . did not say to himself , " I 'll make a fearful racket and if that does not scare him away I 'll attack . " Nevertheless , that is what he had vaguely in mind . Ho-wha seemed to be in no hurry . He behaved as if he were prolonging a blissful expectancy ; because never would he have examined an older woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . As a matter of fact , Ho-wha 's hands were now so gentle and his manhandling of her was so exciting that she had lost most of her fear and was content to let him have his will . Hwah perceived the change in her . Her submissive and almost cooing behavior mixed lust with his rage , and he advanced to kill . He reached the bed before Ho-wha became aware of him . Leaping up , and giving a roar that would have stopped a lion , Ho-wha 's mighty hands reached for his son , and in this moment Hwah 's courage deserted him . If his spine and all his other bones had suddenly been withdrawn  | from his body he could not have felt more limp and helpless . Strong hands seized him , and strong teeth sank and came together in the flesh of his shoulder . For Hwah that was more than enough . There came to him , like a nightmare , memory of all the years when he had lived , as they all had lived , in terror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , howling with pain and dismay . He vanished headlong into a thicket but after a little while he came slinking out and found his bed ; and there , looking toward Ho-wha but unable to see him , he shook with the sickness of a castrated thing . Wuh , more philosophic , and quite serene now , looked over at Hwah and thought of this dark matter as well as he was able . Ho-wha had completed his seduction . After lustful dallying he had mated with Gah and thrust her from him . Wuh had seen her steal through the darkness and a few moments later he had heard her murmurous wonder as she lay at Murah 's side . The tyrant had taken another woman and now he had five . When she was old enough , he would take Murah also , and then he would have six . Wuh could count to that number and beyond it ; and now , sitting in his bed , he thought of Ho-wha 's women . He thought of Ho-wha , too , and for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that perhaps a rival could be killed while he slept . It was not a notion that came to him suddenly like a light out of darkness . It was a long time in coming out of the desperate thinking of an unhappy man . First he was dwelling on the realization that Ho-wha slept . He had taken a woman and now he lay in his bed asleep . That was the first thought . The second thought , growing naturally out of it , was a question : could he , Wuh , steal over to  | Gah 's bed and embrace her ? On that prospect he dwelt with the threatening presence of Ho-wha enveloping it . His problem was a desire opposed by an obstacle . It was a very simple problem , but he found it baffling and exasperating , and his thought shuttled back and forth . There was Ho-wha and there was Gah . He considered one and then the other , or with almost frantic desperation he tried to consider both at once and understand the relationship between the two . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel only her nearness and his wish to be with her , and his eagerness would impel him to make a move toward her ; but in the next moment he would be inhibited by fear . He would pause and sink back to his bed , and his thoughts would turn to Ho-wha . The instant thought returned to his enemy , his obstacle , the erotic longing in him was obscured and dulled , and in despair , in anger , he would give his whole mind to the hulking despot who was dimly visible to him across the darkness . Then again , as before , would come the realization that Ho-wha was asleep . In this recognition there was instant relief . It was the relief , however , of temporary security and not of the understanding that in sleep an enemy was helpless and unaware . That is the thought Wuh was trying to come to . It was as if , in an effort to solve his problem , he moved round and round Ho-wha , looking at him and wondering what to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fickle and erratic and danced about in confusion . They tired him easily . Wuh 's dim and vagrant reflections , for instance , were constantly interrupted by his physical needs or an itching back or the sound of a night bird . Always , when he seemed about to reach a conclusion and see a way out , a sudden emotion  | would fetch him up and darken his mind ; and then everything was blotted out except the steady and burning hunger that was his only reason for thinking . Then his thoughts would dwell lustfully on the presence of Gah until an impulsive move toward her would remind him of Ho-wha . Like a creature endlessly threading a maze he would begin all over again . He would return to the simple recognition of Ho-wha 's presence , and Ho-wha would again absorb his entire interest . With futile and despairing effort , wasted by its own intensity , blinded by anger , and interrupted by his physical sensations , he would again think of Ho-wha and come , as before , to the realization that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , there was a sense of security , in this recognition . But not for a long while did Wuh 's mind reach beyond this point . As soon as he felt secure , the moment his angry apprehensiveness was lulled , his thought returned to Gah ; and so for a long while he moved between the two poles of lust and fear . His effort , however , was not entirely futile . In turn he thought of his desire and of the obstacle which stood in his way ; and both of these he saw clearly in spite of the strong emotion that clothed them . He perceived the relationship of the two as a problem vital to himself . But how to restrain Ho-wha while embracing the woman he was unable to figure out . New thoughts , new ways of doing things , new modes of behavior came only rarely to these people , and then only to the genius among them who was more resourceful and more intelligent . Necessity was also at this time the mother of invention . And Wuh was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him had  | been able to solve , and that very few , indeed , had thought about . If a man did not have the strength to take a mate , he went without one ; and those like Wuh who were physically weaker and whose boldness was tempered with sly discretion never mated save now and then in a chance moment when the lord of the clan was caught off guard . Wuh did not intend to make all his years wait on the lucky chance . He had resolved to possess Gah and to keep her ; and perseverance , which is the soul of resourcefulness , he had in abundance . Nevertheless , he was a baffled and unhappy man tonight . He was consumed not only by jealousy but also by the lust of the weakling male to murder his stronger rival ; but when at last he left his bed , going softly in the grass , there was no thought in his conscious mind of killing . He was not moved by any conscious purpose . He left his bed because hours of unprofitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , however , was the fact that his unconscious mind had been harvesting the materials for a tremendous conclusion . He went noiselessly to Ho-wha and looked at the big fellow . He was sleeping on one side with his head on an arm and with the other arm lying along his body and reaching below his knees . Resting gently on hands and feet like an animal ready to spring , Wuh leaned forward and peered at the slumbering giant , his nervous eyes marking the size of him . And suddenly in this moment there came to him the harvest of hours of thought . There came to him an idea that no man before him had ever had . It was the thought that perhaps he could kill Ho-wha while the man slept . If Wuh had been the man now that he was to become , Ho-wha would have died this night . A blow from a club  | or a stone would have crushed his skull . But men had not learned the use of weapons ; and Wuh , looking at the hulk before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was able only to think of his strength and of the power of his hands on a waking giant 's throat ; and he knew it was not enough . For several minutes , nevertheless , he stared at Ho-wha , thinking of him and of himself and wondering What to do . At last , like one who had walked is his sleep , he was startled to find himself so near his dreadful enemy ; and he turned , shivering and dismayed , and slunk back to his bed . Fear has been the parent of hatred , and hatred Wuh now felt with all the strength he had . Hatred made an idiot of him , a helpless and tortured idiot who sat in his bed like a Kughh , looking at nothing and focusing all the intensity of his hunger and frustration in stuporous despair . If he had been anesthetized he could not have been more unlike the man of an hour ago . Then his mind had been alert , even though confused , with all his senses framing it like a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Kuoh . But out of such excesses of alternate hope and despair have come the small and precious additions to patterns of behavior . The complacent fellows like Ho-wha , possessing all that they had power to dream of , added nothing to the race 's heritage . It was the Wuhs who had come down from the trees , who had first stood erect , who had learned to walk . It was the Wuhs who , physically less dominant than the overlords , and goaded by thwarted desires , were to seek with their wits what they were unable to take with their hands .  | In the centuries preceding this time , it had been chiefly mother love that had impelled one of the beasts to become a man . Among the thousands of species of reptile that had ruled the earth , not more than a half-dozen had given any care to their young . Among the birds and mammals , none paid any heed to their offspring or even recognized them after the brief period of nesting or nursing was over . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged the custodianship of her baby and perceived that it was still a part of her after it left her breast . But now it was to be the frustrated ones , the unhappy and underprivileged ones , who would insure the steady progress of their race . In them survival would come to rest less and less on the strength in their hands and teeth and more and more on the alertness of their minds . It was intelligence they needed , and in such furious unhappiness as Wuh 's , intelligence germinated and grew . Tonight , in realizing that an enemy could be slain while it slept , he had marked another milestone in human progress . He was just a little wiser than he had been before .  | 5 GAH became one of Ho-wha 's women and his chief vassal . Two or three times a day he embraced her , and each evening after his belly was full he summoned her to him . He made it known to her that he wished to be inspected and petted and curried ; but once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving his tongue across her neck or cheeks or turning her over and over in blissful examination . To his love-making she yielded with delight and gave little cries of joy . After fondling her he would try to make her understand that he wished to be petted . He would grunt and act a part for her and then wait , gravely expectant ; and if she did not respond he would slap or bite her or take her hands and move them over him . Gah was an apt lover . She soon learned to do as he wished , though often , when caressing her , he bit too hard and then she yelped and strove to escape . In such moments he seemed to regard her with solemn wonder . Grasping her , he would stare at her gravely for a long moment , his  | eyes questioning her ; and Gah , a little angry and frightened , would passively submit and wait . Wuh missed none of their doings . He was a wiser but he was still a completely baffled man . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made his bed where his view of them would be unobstructed ; and each evening he soberly watched their love-making . Everything that Ho-wha did he wanted to do and would have done if he had had a chance . There are other things that he would have done . Because he was a more intelligent man he would have been a more resourceful lover . He was a nimble dancer , for instance , and in a simple way he had learned the use of ornaments . Ho-wha never danced to arouse his or his woman 's lust and he never adorned himself . It was with dancing and ornament that Wuh strove at last , not with deliberate but with intuitive cunning , to win Gah 's interest . One evening the group came upon an unusually lush supper and ate and made their beds long before dusk . To Wuh the moment seemed opportune and with unwonted boldness he resolved to dance . He chose a spot where dry clay had been laid upon a peat bed and was , in consequence , of such resonant quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this floor of clay Wuh danced . He hopped about with rhythmic movements , beating all the while on the clay with his feet , beating on his body with his hands , and keeping time with mournful cries . The clay drum under him took up the sound and amplified it until it was a deep booming as of muffled underground thunder . The sound of his palms striking his breast were like the sharper overtones of a second  | drum ; and above both drums was the eerie music of his cries . Almost at once every member of the group was interested . Some watched him with sober delight and some with mild astonishment . Never had they seen anything dance as Wuh was dancing now . Presently , as if intoxicated by the sounds he made and by the rhythms of his body , he redoubled his effort , hopping and smiting in a kind of jig-time ; but all the while he was watching Gah . Human eyes at this time could eloquently speak the language of love . Wuh 's warm brown eyes , fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger and his loneliness . He was watching Ho-wha too . That lazy tyrant was interested but he was not alarmed . When younger he had tried to dance , but awkwardly , as if his body were too heavy for his legs . He had seen others dance . He sensed that Wuh 's dancing was an appeal to the women but he felt too secure in his lordship to care . Sitting by his bed and grunting in time to the music , he was too slothful to move , and too stupid to envy a younger man 's grace . The other men were less indifferent . Hwah stood up as if impelled to act but too confused to know what he should do ; and Ghak , the foolish old one , began to leap and tumble as if contriving an impromptu dance of his own . It was the women , however , and especially the younger ones , who gave the most eager and delighted response . If Gah had dared , she would have gone to Wuh and danced , too . Murah dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had not entered womanhood and nobody moved to restrain her . Dancing was an inherited behavior in her as  | in all people . In the manner to which she was born , she found a small clearing and began to dance , whirling round and round in a circle . She acted as if she were drunk with Wuh 's music . With her arms , legs , and hands she kept time , jumping up and down and leaping and spinning , and all the while vocalizing her ecstasy with a strange cry . The dancing of either male or female was deeply exciting to the other sex . Wuh 's dancing did not stir the nursing mothers , and the excitement it aroused in their infants was not sexual . These alert youngsters , with mouths agape and eyes shining , started to crawl away from their beds and were seized and dragged back . Thereupon they beat themselves in an angry tantrum and began to howl . But it was Kughh , the idiot dwarf , who behaved most strangely of all . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bent over , with his hands almost touching the earth . In such a manner he now strove to dance ; and if there had been among these people a sense of the ridiculous , they would have been convulsed with laughter or moved to pity . Because Kughh danced as if he were in a great fury . He barked . He rushed at trees and tried to tear them from the ground . He fell on his face and rolled over , his hands threshing about him and his voice barking as if he scented prey and was rooting along on the trail of it . But nobody paid any attention to Kughh . Not even Ghoo , the ugly woman , watched the antics of her adopted ward . Like Kuoh , the old one , and Gah , the young one , she had eyes only for the lustful pantomime of Wuh . The men and boys , on the other hand , were watching Murah . The sexually immature children were delighted . Their  | response was imitative , but that of Hwah was savagely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in part fed by , a sadistic lusting that sometimes appears to be deliberately cruel . If Wuh had continued his dancing , Hwah would probably have thrown himself on Murah and tried to destroy her . He did , indeed , move toward the girl , but an ominous growl from Ho-wha stopped him . That growl for Wuh was enough . As if doused with cold water , he suddenly stopped . Looking round him , as if abashed by his own daring , he saw Ho-wha rising from his bed , and at once he withdrew . Murah , left alone , and almost exhausted , ceased dancing , too , and went over to her sister . Ghak alone remained on the scene and he was trying only to draw attention to himself . In Wuh 's mind there had been no plan to dance himself into passionate union with a female . His impulse had been much simpler than that . Dancing with these people , as with many of the beasts and birds , was a part of their innate behavior . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tenderness and gentleness , if indeed there was any at all . Sometimes a man danced himself into such a frenzied lust that he tried not to embrace his woman but to slay her . He was moved by an urge to bite and choke and rend . Wuh had danced because his hunger had been stronger than his fear . If he had not been a sly fellow , with a weather eye for danger even in times of orgiastic release , he would have kept on dancing or he would have thrown himself on Murah . As it was , discretion had again intervened , showing that in him , if not in the others , mind was becoming the warden of emotion . After entering his bed ,  | he forgot his reckless ecstasy and strove again to consider his problems . The next day in feeding , the group came upon a thicket of lovely jungle orchids . Wuh adorned himself with flowers . Between sex and adornment there was at this time no relationship  --  or if there was , it was not conscious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thrust flowers into their scalp lock or set them on their heads or shoulders ; or sometimes they used large leaves or bright stones or pieces of wood . They were probably moved only by a wish to draw attention to themselves . They were all of them vain , selfish , and strutting egoists whose greatest delight was in being the cock of the walk . But also , to be sure , their five senses were well developed . They were attracted by large colorful flowers and by everything gaudy and glittering . Fragrance they all liked , and some of them were very fond of it . Wuh was such a man . He was continually thrusting his face against an odorous bower to breathe and smell of it ; and he had , in comparison with the others , such cleanliness in his personal habits that he had learned the use of Simple tools in removing accumulations of dirt from his nails and skin and hair . His delight in fragrance was sensuous . His delight in adornment grew from a vain wish to draw attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and thrust another into the hair on his skull and walked about as if he were sole lord of the earth . The older children , quick to imitate the behavior of adults , and especially that of the more resourceful Wuh , ran in haste to gather blooms ; and presently they were all strutting in orchidaceous glory . Even Hwah , the big morose son , set a flower on his  | shoulder ; but because he was a stupid fellow with no perception of degrees in magnificence he was content with one solitary little bloom . Soon it fell off him but he continued to march about like one enviably adorned . Wuh , indeed , was the only one of the men with enough intelligence to perceive that several flowers were more showy than one . If he had been a little more imaginative he would have carried a bouquet . More than three he had never adorned himself with ; none of the others had ever used more than one . These people were vain but their interests were fickle . In one moment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored . Observing that others did as he did , Wuh lost interest in the flowers and allowed them to fall . He looked dejected . He looked as if it were hardly worthy of his talents to behave in a manner that his inferiors could emulate . What he wanted  --  but this he realized only dimly if at all  --  was a personal distinction unapproachably apart from all other living things . Orchids were nice , but always when he used them other members of the group did likewise and abashed him with their arrogant clamor for attention . If he sheltered himself from the sun with a huge palm leaf , he had only to look around to see that others were copying him . If , instead of lying on his belly to drink , he sucked from his cupped palms , the children barked with delight and drank from their hands . They observed how he made his bed and they imitated him in that . When , spurning pineapple leaves , which Ho-wha and the women ate with gluttonous relish , he turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to eat nothing but fruit . If he found a nest of eggs and sat by a tree to eat them , the children  | squatted about and stared at him with hungry brown eyes , behaving as if eggs , above all other delicacies , were what they wished for . Wuh was imitated because he was more resourceful . The imitation was a powerful stimulus to the development of his mind , but he was not aware of that . He did not know that he was constantly striving to behave in a way that others could not copy . In his simple soul , he wanted to be distinguished and unique . As a matter of fact , there was in him , because of Ho-wha 's tyranny and his own sterile bachelorhood , an obscure and perplexed feeling of inferiority . He did not think of himself as physically an inferior one  --  such a recognition would be a long time in coming to men ; but he did know , vaguely and unhappily , that he was not all that he wished to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their desires , born of simple thinking , were frustrated , the women became patiently submissive creatures , but the men became ugly malcontents . In this group there were four frustrated ones . If an unfortunate woman was denied children of her own , she tried to mother any helpless thing she could find . If she did not , like Ghoo , find a dwarfed outcast , she strove to adopt a sick animal or a wounded bird . She would draw within the shelter of her arms any friendless thing and lavish on it that mother love which was almost the whole meaning of her life . But in the men parental love was very feeble . Ho-wha would stand guard at birth , not because he felt any affectionate gentleness for babies but because he had learned , like most of the animals of the earth , that there was security and strength in numbers . The sentiment of love  | was unknown to men of his time . They found their egoistic fulfillment in sexual embrace , in acquisition and possession , in dominating other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like Ghak , who in his youth had known all those , was driven out of a group , he was so completely frustrated , and at the same time so old and impotent and helpless , that he could declare himself only in self-pitying tantrums . Nothing was left to him but the contempt of his fellows , and old age and death . With the young men , the Hwahs and Wuhs , it was another matter . They were neither an ugly , sick woman nor an old and querulous man . Vigorous and lustful and in the full flush of their hungers , they found their frustration more intolerable and blighting than that of a Ghak or a Ghoo . Day and night they had no moment of peace . They lived constantly around one who had a generous share of everything that a man wanted . Ho-wha had women whom he possessed and bossed and growled at . He was the undisputed lord of all the men within sight . And when enemies appeared , either human or beast , he made a terrible racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had these things , these possessions and privileges , and they hated him . They would have murdered him with intense joy if they could have found a way . In the hatred and despair of two of them , there was no contribution to their growth . Ghak would never be more than a howling spitfire of frantic grief . Hwah was too dull to do more than sulk and scowl and imprison himself in a small unprofitable world of dark thoughts . And even Wuh 's maneuverings were hitor-miss experiments rather than cunning design .  | When , for instance , he danced or adorned himself , he did not have any definite purpose in mind . Dancing and adornment were , like scratching himself or making a bed , a part of his heritage . Nevertheless , in these , and in many other things that he did , he was impelled in a fumbling way toward discoveries and answers . He danced because instinctive lust for a little while was stronger than fear ; and he set flowers on his body because they made him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , has been the mother of learning . It was restless and curious seeking that pitched a man , now and then , beyond the periphery of his bondage and set him on a new path . Of unhappy and impatient curiosity , Wuh had more than his share , and it kept him busy . A few days after adorning himself with flowers , he did something that no man before him had ever done . He had climbed a tree to eat bananas ; and while sitting on a limb with his back to the trunk , and eating fruit , skins and all , Ghak presented himself below . He wanted to share the fruit . He first vocalized his wish , chattering and scolding while he peered up at Wuh . Wuh ignored him . Then with pantomime Ghak made his desire known . He went through the motions of plucking bananas and eating them , all the while watching Wuh to see if he understood . Wuh understood but he was annoyed . Men did not wait on other men . He looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was too feeble to climb , embraced the trunk and strove to shake the fruit down . Or perhaps he was trying to dislodge Wuh from his perch . He scolded again , his voice shrill and angry , and indicated with frantic gestures that he was hungry and wished to eat .  | Wuh meanwhile fed himself and looked down at the old man . When Ghak again tried to shake the tree , Wuh flew into a rage . He seized a banana and hurled it at Ghak and struck him in the face with it . Pleased with the old man 's howl of dismay , he pelted him with a second banana and a third ; and then , as if to test the efficacy of such a method of attack , he grasped a cluster of the fruit and hurled it at Ghak and almost knocked him down . This was the first time a man ever used anything as a weapon to strike another . If Wuh 's behavior had been more calculating and less impulsive , he might have sensed now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he calmly resumed his eating ; and Ghak , unhurt , and happy for the deluge of fruit , gathered the bananas and went off to be alone in possession of them . Wuh watched him go , but there was no triumphant realization in his mind . He was conscious only of having driven a pest away . In his subconscious mind , however , there was to be troubled memory of this experience ; and in the months ahead , the meaning of it would be busy there , germinating and coming to birth . It would grow there like a seed and slowly push its way into consciousness , until at last it would stand bright and certain in Wuh 's mind like something forgotten but always known .  | 6 PEOPLE of this time were not migratory but they were nomadic and they wandered throughout the year , confined only by the natural boundaries of each group 's domain . No matter what lush feeding grounds they came to or what haven of safety , they were constantly and restlessly on the move , never spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This nomadism , a part of their heritage , had grown out of fear . For several weeks Ho-wha had seen no enemies but never for a moment had he relaxed his vigilance . Like other men , he had neither foolhardy courage nor craven cowardice ; but every hour of his life was anxious , even in sleep . His dreams were mild nightmares of terror and struggle . His dread was of the leopard and tiger and lion and the venomous or devouring snakes . There were other unfriendly creatures , including the crocodile , the wild boar , and certain great flesh-eating birds , but he was less afraid of them . The boars never attacked when unmolested , and the birds were cowards who preyed on the diseased and crippled and old .  | Ho-wha had led his group into jungle so dense that the sun was visible only through the canopy windows , and full noon was no more than twilight . It was a damp odorous wilderness of huge trees cloaked with the tangled ropes of parasitic vines . Monkeys and birds screamed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms moved up there ; but the forest floor was so quiet that nothing stirred . Ho-wha was alarmed to find himself in a dank gloomy prison of spiders and bats and wasps and the smell of old decaying leaf-depth ; and day after day , in an effort to find his way out , he plunged through the trackless world , roofed and strangled by its lush excess . The ferocious cats did not prowl here , but lying in wait , Ho-wha well knew , were the great snakes . The dark brown python was here . He was often indistinguishable from the foliage he coiled and waited in , though on his body there were bluish iridescent markings ; and these in the dark jungle sometimes shone like a terrible and fantastic fire . Here also , especially near water , was the anaconda , a gigantic greenish-yellow murderer marked with rows of large black spots . More dreaded than either of those by Ho-wha and his people was the king cobra , the most terrible in size and deadliness of all the poisonous serpents . The python @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust of his fangs could paralyze an elephant . Ho-wha knew that he had invaded the home of these mighty killers . He knew that up in the trees , with thirty feet of sinuous body coiled around trunk and limbs , the anaconda waited in silence as deep as night . He knew that in wilderness dark the cobra was always ready to spit his  | poison and bury his fangs . But Ho-wha had been born of the jungles , too . For countless centuries they had been the home of his people ; and in their blood and emotions was this deep and lost and terrible world of wet and perpetual gloom . When he wandered out on the unclothed plains he felt more anxious and defenseless than when prowling under the tangled roof where poisonous insect and venomous snake made their home . Nevertheless , he had not intended to penetrate to the deepest heart of it , and he was alarmed . It was Kuoh one morning who screamed in the sudden crushing embrace of a python . Old and feeble , she had fallen behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big tree , the monster dropped as soundlessly as oiled rope . His great writhing body went swiftly , softly around her ; and while she screamed , he coiled again and again until only her head was visible above the smooth gleaming folds . Her arms were imprisoned at her sides . She lay shoulder deep in a cylinder of snake . Her first scream of terror lifted Ho-wha 's scalp lock and chilled him to his bones . When one of his own kind gave a cry like that , he knew that a deadly enemy had struck ; but from where he was he could not see Kuoh and he did not know what had happened . His bellow of fright and rage rolled away through the jungle and struck a wall of stone and broke in deep echoes . Hwah roared next , and almost at once Wuh and Ghak took up the cry ; and the four voices filled miles of forest with a dreadful clamor . Ho-wha 's face was awful to look at . The cool brown of his eyes had turned a yellowish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had opened his  | mouth in a wide snarl , with the lower lip drawn far down , and the upper lip , edged with stiff coarse hair , twitched so violently that the spasms in it pulled at his cheeks . The hair on his head and down his back stood up like black wire . Fear and fury poured like lightning along his nerves . He struck his breast with blows that rocked him , and he continued to bellow with all the power of his lungs ; but he had not moved a single step since Kuoh screamed . Following her first cry there had come another , and then a third that sounded weak and choked . It was the third cry that told Ho-wha where she was . With a wild rush that would have made a lion pause , he plowed through the jungle toward her , and after him went the other men . The women and children had gathered in a group . The babies were whimpering but their mothers were as furious as the men . Ka-ka , the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in defense of her child . A woman protecting her baby was , indeed , more reckless and savage than any male , and would throw herself at an enemy while the men stood by and roared . Ho-wha was standing by and roaring now . His first mad rush had brought him within sight of Kuoh and the python , but he did not leap forward and attack . The vision of the monster chilled his blood and his wrath . Between dread that was in him like an engulfing nightmare and rage so overwhelming that it darkened his senses , he stood transfixed . Upon the earth the python was a pile of shining flesh , and embraced by the mound , with only her head showing , was Kuoh , so nearly crushed that she could no longer make a sound . The serpent lifted its head as if resting on elbows and looked at Ho-wha . It was the strategy of a man to try to frighten an enemy  | which he feared . That is what Ho-wha did now . With terror like an electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the python , bellowing and smiting himself and tearing at shrubs as he went . After a savage rush of a few feet he stopped short and roared , and the ledges roundabout hurled back his challenge in thunderous applause . The other men were roaring , too , but they were not so brave as Ho-wha . Ghak was out of his mind in a tantrum ; he rushed about at a safe distance and seized trees as if determined to uproot the forest . Hwah stood behind his father and echoed him , challenge for challenge ; but Wuh , whose mind had not been wholly obscured by anger , barked for a few moments and then was quiet as if lost in thought . Ho-wha rushed at the serpent and then paused to strike the earth with his feet and roar and smite his chest . As motionless as a dead thing , the python looked at him , its gaze unwavering . Ho-wha took another step or two forward and again stopped . He could not distinguish between vipers that squirted poison or struck with fangs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he came within reach . For Ho-wha they were all lethal at five yards . In another wild rush he approached within twenty feet , and then with all the rage in him he screamed a challenge and jumped up and down ; but the python never faltered in its steady hypnotic stare . With eyes as cold as death in the gaze of a dead thing , it looked at Ho-wha and waited . There was no sign of life in Kuoh now . Embraced with the huge rings , with only the top of her head showing where brown gleaming belly sank around her skull to meet belly , she was probably crushed and smothered ; but Ho-wha never thought of that . He  | could see her skull and he knew she was there . It was his simple way to believe that a person lived until he knew beyond doubt that the person was dead . As a matter of fact , he was not thinking at all . He was depending wholly on instinctive rage and trying to frighten an enemy that could be alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuh had remembered his experience with the bananas and learned from it the lesson that he was eventually to learn , he would have hurled things at the python and driven it off . But all three men were maddened by rage and restrained by fear ; and after roaring until nearly exhausted , they all withdrew to the women as if to seek advice or encouragement . Instead of bellowing like demented creatures , they uttered low plaintive cries . The python uncoiled and made ready to engorge its victim . If Kuoh was not dead she was at least senseless , and she did not stir when the serpent began to swallow her headfirst . Its mouth , looking small when closed , now opened so wide that its head seemed to be only the hinged wings of a gaping cavern . Its throat dilated . Its eyes were expressionless and cold . Swallowing a prey the size of Kuoh took patience and time . The mouth closed over her head , almost enveloping it , and throat muscles sucked at her , pulsing like a bellows . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the throat and was a huge bulge there just back of the jaw hinges . Engulfing the big hairy shoulders was more difficult and took more time . If a person had been watching , he would have seen a hairy woman lying there with her head in a python 's throat , and five or ten minutes later he would have observed no change ; but after an hour he would have seen that the shoulders were vanishing . He would have seen  | that the throat had distended to unbelievable size , and that the broad shoulders lay crosswise between the gaping jaws . The monster looked more like a creature giving birth than one swallowing its dinner . The skull had been thrust so far upward that a blow on its snout could have broken it backward on its hinge and laid it helpless along the neck . In the eyes there was still no change . Ho-wha , meanwhile , had not fled with his group . He had been growling in terror and behaving like one who had been flogged . The babes , whimpering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened . Nobody expected Ho-wha to attack and slay the enemy . They expected nothing and hoped for nothing . In moments like this , when a snake or a big cat struck at one of them , they were overwhelmed by dread of the vast dark world in which they lived . Leopards and tigers and lions the men could usually frighten away , but no outcry they were capable of could drive off the python and king cobra . That is why fury in Flo-wha had turned to despair . He had not forgotten that Kuoh was out there in an enemy 's clutch . He knew that a coiled python was not far from him , cold and deadly and invincible . This encounter with the monster had been like all his other encounters . He had tried to frighten the thing away and had failed , and then he had been overcome by dread of it . Today , after growling for an hour and recovering a part of his courage , he began to be angry again . The rage in him had been like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It fed on movement , and as soon as he began to walk about , a lust to kill flushed him with its heat . Suddenly his roar was thunder again in the jungle . Again rage and fear made the black hair stand up like stiff grass on his head and down his back , and blood poured fresh and  | hungering strength into his great muscles . The ledges echoed his call , and Hwah and Wuh took up the cry . The three of them screamed with renewed power , and then , as if bent on overturning worlds , they rushed in the direction of the python . And as before , they fetched up in an attitude of frenzied indecision . There lay the serpent like thirty feet of enormous brown cable , with Kuoh 's legs thrusting from its mouth . Its throat was a monstrous bulge . Its eyes were still coldly watchful . Ho-wha shouted and dashed toward it and stopped . There was not the slightest movement in the python . He did not know that the creature was helpless and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat head and torn it off . Wuh advanced and looked at the snake as if thoughtfully considering it , but he did not perceive that it was helpless . Dread of the creature stood in the way of recognitions . Then , unexpectedly , the python began to move . As noiselessly as a thing in oil it crawled away . Ho-wha roared at it and rushed after it but he did not venture within twenty feet of the vanishing tail . He felt that he had frightened the creature , and as it disappeared , his fear gave way to fury and he howled like a madman . He rushed back and forth , making a frightful clamor , even after the python had completely vanished . Out of sight with Ho-wha was out of mind , and when , in looking round him , he could see no sign of the enemy , he became calm . Like one who had acquitted himself well , he returned to his family , and they knew by his behavior that the enemy had been slain or driven away . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy has eaten Kuoh . " They  | did not think of Kuoh at all . If Who-ah 's or Ka-ka 's baby had been the victim , the mother would have been thinking of it ; but Kuoh had been in their consciousness only when visible , and not always then . She was gone now and immediately she was forgotten . Only in the hour of peril did these people have unity of purpose and will . Only in danger did the least of them become important because a threat against one of them was a threat against the group . Observing that Ho-wha was no longer furious , Ka-ka drew the infant from her shoulders and looked at it . She wanted to be sure that it was all right . When Kughh made sounds of hunger , Ghoo began to look round her for food . Gah barked at her sister and invited her to play . The fouryear-old son of Who-ah climbed a tree and sat perched on a limb , bidding for admiring approval . None of them acted as if only a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had entirely forgotten the serpent , stared in turn at his women ; but he was not counting them to learn if one was missing . He was returning to the watchful guardianship of the dominant male . He was doing more than that . The intense excitement had aroused his lust and presently he yelled at Gah , indicating that he wished her to come to him . It was always this way . After being deeply stirred , no matter by what , the women were always more receptive and the men more eager . It was as if their emotions ran in channels not separately but spilled over into one another ; and terror or anger , after the danger was removed , poured into the veins of lust . Gah went to him gladly . Even the ugly old Ghoo would have gone to him . Murah , the immature girl , might  | have done so . When one of them died , the passion in them stirred toward birth . When one of them was killed , or when one of them was abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced as if birth and death fought eternally in them for supremacy .  | THE MOTHERS kept constant watchfulness over the behavior of all the children in the group , but it was not a reasoning vigilance . It was a protective and possessive and sometimes it seemed to be a fiercely jealous guardianship . The sons were their favorites , even so long ago . For their daughters , too , they would have given their lives , but it was on the boys , not the girls , that they looked with the tenderest emotion . Their examination of them was more frequent and more absorbingly curious . For them the penis was a strange and mysterious thing that seemed almost to have a separate life of its own . The fathers , on the other hand , had no interest in the boys , and little interest in the girls before they were old enough to embrace . When , in playing , the children fought with one another , or when , as was often the case , they curiously inspected one another 's bodies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another with gentle manipulation . The mothers missed little of that . They did not mind as long as the children  | seemed playful and happy ; but if a boy tried to embrace his sister and she cried out in fear and alarm , then one of the women boxed his ears and drove him away . One day the children were playing . They liked to swing from limbs of trees or from the network of vine ropes , feeling in swift graceful movement the ecstasy which their ancestors had felt long before . Their ancestors , of course , had lived above ground , and in speed and dexterity had been the peer of all living things . So strongly in their blood was a desire to dip and swing and soar that babies were born with powerful grasping hands and feet . They had lost nearly all of their tails but they had lost little of the rhythms that intoxicated them when swinging from branch to branch or dipping downward in a long curve on the support of a vine . Today Murah and two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Murah , too heavy and awkward to swing with much grace and abandon ; and the younger one , in consequence , set the enviable pace . He did not have the nimbleness and audacity of his remote cousins who still lived in trees . They could move with the speed and grace of creatures of the air , swinging from limb to limb across the chasms of the forest without ever missing their clutch or pausing a moment in their flight . Who-ah 's son would have broken his neck trying to follow them . He did well to bridge twenty feet of space while swinging on a long vine ; and when essaying to dip from branch to branch he sometimes missed and fell . When he misjudged the distance or his skill and tumbled to earth , his mother would run to him , not to see if he was hurt but to box his ears for his recklessness . He fell today . In showing off to his sister and brother  | he had ventured much higher than they dared to go . From time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taunted them . They were swinging clumsily and heavily from the lower branches . The smaller lad had climbed up where tangled vines hung in a downsweeping wall . Because he could have shut his eyes and jumped and closed his hands on a rope , he became increasingly reckless , never suspecting that some of the vines were too insecurely anchored to support his weight . He called to the two below , wishing they would stop their play and give all their attention to him . He yelled over to the group where his mother sat and watched him . When he was sure that everybody was admiring him and waiting for his next feat , he made a very bold leap ; and the vine which he clutched stripped its anchor far above him and down he came , head over heels , with a terrified yell that brought Who-ah to her feet . If his plunge had not been broken by the tangled wall he might have struck with enough force to kill him . As it was , he was almost knocked out . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very angry woman . She did not wait for the lad to recover his senses and his breath . Barking with shrill rebuke , she set him on his feet and gave him a blow on the side of his skull that knocked him over . At once she set him up again and slapped the other side of his face . That fetched from him a yell of rage . He moved to run away but Who-ah seized him and bit his neck . When he felt her teeth he howled as if she were murdering him , but she went right ahead with her punishment , slapping and biting him , and chattering at him all the while in a language which he understood . He was a very abashed and crestfallen lad by the time she had finished . What , she was asking in the  | only gibberish she knew , what did he mean by climbing away up there and then leaping into the air and tumbling down on his head ? Did he not realize that such antics would be the death of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show-off ? The boy understood her . He crawled away , smarting under the indignity of her hands and teeth and hating her thoroughly . He went on hands and feet into a liana thicket and turned to peer out ; and he wrinkled his forehead and thrust his lips at her . If he had been a little more resourceful he would have stuck out his tongue . Who-ah returned to the spot where she had been sitting . With alert and curious interest , all members of the group had watched the little scene between mother and son . Ho-wha had stared as if bored , Ghoo as if outraged , and Kughh as if convulsed by witless joy . Ka-ka had approved . Wuh looked as if a feeble sense of humor were stirring within him . A little later he fell to that persistent and careful examination of the body which in all of them was a dominant trait . A thorn had gouged him in the rear of one thigh and left a small wound ; and now he was trying to see it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg with both hands and thrust his head down between his legs , striving to lick the wound with his tongue ; he put the leg up and across the back of his neck and sat for a little while like a ridiculous fellow , gazing solemnly at his hairy limb . But he was unable to see the wound or to touch it with his mouth . Thereupon he probed at it with a dirty finger and then looked soberly at his finger . He thrust the finger into his mouth and salved the wound with saliva .  | After a few minutes he forgot the sore and began to examine his hair and skin . Leaning forward and using both hands , he would part the long hair on his belly or breast and peer for bugs ; and when he found one he would clutch it with two fingers and hold it up to rapt and prolonged scrutiny . No matter what kind of pest he found or how repeatedly he found the same kind , he would gaze at it with curious and almost friendly interest before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and some merely dwelt in his hair , but he did not distinguish between them . Small children when finding bugs on themselves often put them into their mouths experimentally to learn if they were good to eat . If the flavor was offensive they made a face and spit the thing out , but if the taste pleased them they swallowed it and searched their bodies for others of its kind . Spiders they spit out with shudders of dislike but a certain species of small grasshopper they found good . When they picked off gnats or mosquitoes bloated with blood , they crushed them and then licked the blood off their fingers . Wuh never ate any of the creatures . Except for an occasional feast of eggs he was wholly vegetarian by habit and taste ; but like an amateur entomologist he would stare with wonder at his captives as if by persistent study of them he might at last discover why they infested him . Sometimes when he found an unusually colorful beetle or a spider with bright markings he worried it to death . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only a torso left he turned that over and over in a palm , searching it for teeth and eyes and genitals . Today , with painstaking care , he examined every part  | of his body which he could see , parting the hair in furrows and spreading it on either side and peering at his brown dirty skin . With a stick he scratched his back . He had learned the use of tools to clean or delight himself . With a sharp stick he reached across a shoulder and down and raked himself vigorously . Then he used two sticks and both hands and prodded up and down his spine . After he had gouged that area and flushed it with tingling pleasure , he examined his feet . Grasping one with both hands and drawing it up against his breast , he stared at it with intense concern . His feet closely resembled his hands . The big toe was far removed from the other toes and was a grasping tool like his thumbs . The other toes were like supple foreshortened fingers . Wuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot as if it were the most remote and least familiar part of him  --  a part which , in times of reflection , he was astonished to find attached to his leg . It was so tough and calloused that only the strongest and sharpest thorns ever pierced it . The sole of it , like soft dark buckskin , was a pattern of fine wrinkles ; and its toes when not in use folded within like his fingers . With one hand he held the foot against him and with the other he examined it , picking briars out of the hair and flakes of dead skin off the heel . In turn he inspected the toes , drawing small pieces of leaf or twig from under the nails and then straightening and pulling each toe until its joints cracked . After he had cared for one foot , with both hands he set it down as if it were fragile , and then drew the other foot to him . His own face he had seen but he did not realize that . The first time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool he had seen it , but he had thought he was looking  | at a stranger . After staring in bewilderment at the image , he had cautiously reached down to touch it , but his hand broke the water and the face poking at him danced in distortions . That had mystified him . All members of the group were fascinated by the faces which they saw in clear pools , but why or how persons could lie submerged in water and look up at them they did not understand . That was another riddle in their dark and terrible world . Wuh was curious about his face , and never did he sit to examine himself without prodding over it as if to make out its contours and uses . He thrust fingers into his mouth and gently bit them ; he felt his big strong teeth ; he shoved a finger into a nostril and sneezed ; he softly touched his eyelids and strove to withhold their reflex and touch his open eyes . Sometimes , overcome by wonder of himself , he looked at another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 's he tried to come to a simple understanding of what a face was . He palmed his ears and pulled the stiff wings forward and over the apertures ; he ran exploring fingers across his heavy brow ridges ; and he inflated his cheeks and beat on them as if they were drums . They had all learned to make sounds by smiting their distended cheeks or by exhaling through their mouth while with a finger they repeatedly drew their lower lip down as if it were on a spring hinge . In these matters , Wuh was the most versatile artist of them all . Today , after picking off all the bugs he could find and inspecting every part of his body that he could see , he began to experiment with his lips and cheeks to learn if he could make sounds that he had never made before . Soon he caught the curious attention of the others . They  | had inflated their cheeks and drummed on them but they had never made such an astonishing lullaby with their lips as Wuh was making now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes by interrupting a long moaning cry , he blew both lips far out and patted them as he yelled . The effect was so startling that the children came over and sat in a group before him . Eyes watched him with rapt interest . Soon Murah began to imitate him as well as she could . When the sounds did not please her , she stared gravely at Wuh for a few moments and tried again . Their emulation so delighted Wuh that he astonished even himself with his genius . While experimenting with his lips he quite by chance pinched his nostrils together ; and the muted and nasal quality of the sound he made filled him with joy . Realizing that never before had they heard such music , the adults came over and sat with the children , and none looked on with more fascinated interest than Ho-wha . He no longer saw Wuh as a male and a rival . He saw him only as a creature producing strange and mystifying sounds . Wuh was saying , " Hoo-ooo-ooo , " breathing a continuous outpouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by manipulating his lips and nose . Then he pinched his nose with one hand and drummed on a distended cheek with the other and achieved effects even more astounding . Everyone watched him breathlessly , including the infants clinging to their mothers ' backs . When Wuh paused , some of them tried to copy him , but when he resumed , they were eagerly attentive , all of them peering at his nimble hands in an effort to understand what he did . Wuh was intoxicated with joy . Nothing so pleased  | him or any other person as envious attention , and never before had he commanded the hushed interest of the entire group . There he sat , with all eyes fixed upon him , and if he could have had his wish these persons would have admired him forever . But he was obscurely aware that their interest was fickle , and that to hold it he would have to put forth greater effort . His eyes in turn studied all of them . If he saw a sign of waning expectancy or hint of boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and in the plaintive wooing of his voice . It had occurred to him that in pinching his nostrils together he had an advantage ; and when , therefore , the children crouched to look up or stood above him to look down , trying to see what his fingers were doing with his nose , Wuh slyly defeated their gaze and pretended that he was doing many things which he was not doing at all . To mystify them he led them to believe that his sound effects depended chiefly on swift and baffling movements of his hands . He did not let them see that he was pinching his nose . Murah , closer to him than the others and more attentive , thought at first that he was drumming on his nose with his palms . She tried that but without happy results . She decided next that the hand covering Wuh 's nose was experimenting with his upper lip ; but again her own efforts produced only a violent sneeze . And all the while Wuh was wondering what else he could do . Presently nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightening babble of sounds . Ho-wha , and his son Hwah , drummed on their cheeks and roared . Nobody was interested in that . The women , with shriller voices , cried and patted their mouths and sounded tortured .  | The babies began to scream , not with fear but from a wish to contribute to the hullabaloo . All of them together so completely drowned Wuh 's more musical syllables that he gave up in despair , wishing they had sense enough to be silent and listen . When there came an interruption in the bedlam of voices , he fell to again , resolved to be the center of interest or nothing ; but almost at once they again overwhelmed and silenced him . Hwah thought he was doing so well that he went away so that he could be alone and listen to himself . Soon Ho-wha and Ghak followed him . Each man went off by himself and made a dreadful racket . Wuh , left with so many females around him , became excited ; and forgetting that he was an inimitable musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he could lure her into the forest . He rose and moved away , still looking at her . When Gah looked at him he beckoned to her to follow him . Perhaps she thought he intended to instruct her in the art of new and unfamiliar music . Certainly she did not suspect what was in his sly mind . She went eagerly when he beckoned but she had gone only a little way when she heard a bellow from Ho-wha . He had been delighting himself with thunderous drumming but he had also been watching his property . He came forward with a threatening rush and a roar . That for Wuh was enough . With a movement like a shrug he dismissed Gah and turned away , withdrawing again to the margin of this group 's life . In sullen despair he sat by the great buttress of a corkwood tree . For all his resourceful genius , the most he could ever get was a few minutes of rapt attention . Then he was a nobody again , an outcast , a lonely  | and frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered his little while of triumph . He wanted to be the center of the stage , day and night , with all other persons deferring to his wishes and making room for his will . If he had known that he was squatting on an enormous world , he would have desired to boss it from pole to pole . If he had realized that there was a stupendous universe around him , he might have wished , after conquering the earth , to rule that , too . For such was the egoistic craving of him and his kind . But he could only sit by a tree , a weaponless and frustrated fellow , darkly unhappy , and lusting furiously to possess and control . Again he thought of Ho-wha and wondered how he could slay him . In his simple mind , thoughts raced along simple channels . In the darkness that engulfed him there was no light , no plan , no future ; and there was no joy except the fading memory of himself sitting in a group and delighting them with sounds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this time were thriftless , and during the colder season they suffered from hunger . Unlike the squirrels and the bees , they had not learned to store supplies against the lean periods or to look beyond the present moment . When food was abundant they ate gluttonously and fattened , and when it was scarce they starved . Nor had they learned to protect themselves against unfriendly weather . Snow and ice they had never seen , nor even frost , but when during winter months they left the warmth of the jungle floor , searching for juicier plants , they were sometimes chilled to their marrow . Their only protection was their hair . Some of them had a heavy coat of it , but others , like Ghoo , were almost naked . They caught colds during the winter season and sniffled and felt very wretched , but none of them had ever thought of building a shelter . Sometimes they spent a night in a cave or in the great buttressed base of a mora or a corkwood tree , but they did not make these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving about had not been with them a precaution against enemies .  | The mothers , at least , might have done so . The welfare of their children , and especially of the very young ones , was their chief concern . The fretful sickness of a baby could fill a mother with such anxious and watchful solicitude that other adults were afraid to go near her . Anything that seemed to threaten her child she repelled with terrible violence . The men attacked only what they thought they could frighten or destroy . A mother in defense of her child would leap upon any creature in the world . A man 's rage was a dreadful thing , but in comparison with the fury of an aroused mother it was little more than bluster and bluff . When she sprang at an enemy she never paused to consider the danger to herself or to weigh the odds against her . She was ready to sacrifice her life ; and when aroused she was , like the lioness , a dozen times more deadly than the male . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had only very obscure notions of what might be wrong with him but she knew he was not the healthy and lively little fellow that he had been . He was pale and fretful ; he whimpered ; he refused to eat . As a matter of fact , he had , unobserved by her , devoured a whole litter of poisonous insects . Babies then , as now , often tried to put into their mouths anything they could lay their hands on . They ate spiders and ants and bees . They ate nearly everything that they could chew and swallow ; and the mothers , knowing what stupid little gluttons they were , had to watch them constantly . If a wasp came along and settled for a moment in Kooloo 's hair , he captured it first if he could and then he promptly thrust it into his mouth . A thousand times he had been slapped for such rashness . He had been shaken and cuffed . He had had his jaws pried  | open while Ka-ka looked into his mouth and with rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs . He had even tried to chew sticks and stones . When a baby fell sick , its mother 's first thought was of harmful objects which it might have swallowed . That was , indeed , almost her only thought . Sometimes she examined the child from head to feet to see if it had an infested wound or if a blood-sucking parasite had burrowed in its flesh ; but such matters never occurred to her until she had peered anxiously and repeatedly into its mouth . If she saw there no sign of gluttonous indiscretion , she was baffled . Ka-ka was baffled now . She held Kooloo up , clutching him around the waist , and stared at him with troubled eyes . For several minutes she would hold him and look at his eyes , and solemnly the child would look at her . She seemed to feel that his eyes might give some hint of his malady . The second day after he became ill she held him up for a long while and scolded and talked to him . He did not understand her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips out , indicating that he wished to caress her . She shook him for his impudence and he whimpered . He understood that in some way he had displeased her . He knew she was scolding him , and because he did not know why he felt resentful and angry . If his gaze wandered , she shook him until he again looked at her , and then he would wrinkle his forehead and pucker his lips and act as if he were about to sneeze . He would distort his whole face as if getting ready to howl , but he knew that howling would do him no good . When his mother was annoyed with him there seemed to be nothing he could do except to look at  | her and let her look at him until , weary and baffled , she set him down . And when she set him down he was not surprised to find her peering again into his mouth . With strong hands she would grasp his jaws and open his mouth as wide as it would open . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in it . Again and again , too , she had thrust a finger into his mouth and scraped along his teeth and tongue and then looked at her finger . He also looked at it but there was nothing to see . Later , she examined his feces . She spoke a word that sounded like hoo ? , making a question of it ; and Kooloo echoed her . " Hoo ? " she said . " Hoo ? " said Kooloo . Then curiosity overcame him and he moved toward his excrement , and for that he got a sharp slap on his ear . He gave a howl of dismay but almost at once he forgot the rebuke and curiously watched her . She examined the dung , trying to find in it an explanation of his illness . " Hoo ? " she said again and again , addressing the question not to him but to the invisible mysteries around her . Kooloo strove to imitate everything that she did . If for a moment she seemed to lose interest , he lost interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , he did likewise and peered for all he was worth . The other persons in the group knew that Kooloo was sick . When he lay in his bed , the others came , not together but one by one , to look at him and touch him . Who-ah came and stared at him for several moments . They were all very gentle , including the men . The other children played but less noisily than was their custom . They were careful not to go near Kooloo or disturb him , and if Ka-ka cried angrily at them , they at once fell into  | abashed silence . Now and then Murah , the most sympathetic one among the children , softly approached Kooloo ; and she would crouch by him and pat him or touch her lips to his neck . She would look at him with grave compassion before stealing away . Almost never for an instant did Ka-ka take her eyes off her son . Instead of allowing him during the day to ride on her shoulders and cling to her hair , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad case of indigestion , and nausea and a little fever . In a few days he was well again , and Ghoo was sick . She had never been a healthy person . She had a strange organic disease that manifested its symptoms in her sparse hair , yellowish skin , and lackluster eyes . The winter months she found difficult . Then food was scarce and she had to provide not only for herself but also for Kughh , the dwarf ; and nearly everything that she could find to eat she gave to him . In starvation she became weaker and the prey of colds . One morning when the group marched away , Ghoo was too feeble to stir . From her bed she watched them with sick and anxious eyes . Kughh followed the others a little way , but when , in looking round him , he saw that his foster mother was not coming , he set up a cry of alarm . Thereupon they all stopped to learn what the trouble was . Ka-ka came back and went over to Ghoo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her and brown eyes asked what the trouble was , though she had sensed almost at once that Ghoo was ill . Ghoo looked up at her in the meek and apologetic way of one who wanted protection and care but knew that these were not given to sick old people .  | Others had come up to stand in a group around Ka-ka and look at Ghoo . The women and children were sympathetic , the men were curious ; and Ghak , as if seeing in the woman a portent of his own doom , was frightened and began to clamor for attention . Nobody paid any heed to him . Nor did they give any heed to Kughh who was hopping about and crying like a small child that had lost its mother . For a long moment Ka-ka looked at Ghoo . Then , as if undecided , she went down on hands and feet to peer more closely . After another searching stare that revealed nothing , she opened Ghoo 's mouth and looked into it , seeking a reason why the woman was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she examined her for sign of wound or broken bones . Of the invisible maladies of starvation and age she knew nothing . After her examination was done she seemed convinced that Ghoo could rise and follow if she wished to , and she turned away and the group moved with her . Kughh trailed the others until he heard his guardian crying after him . In turn he looked at the vanishing group or back at Ghoo while his dim mind strove to understand . Then he began to run back and forth . He took a few loping steps in the direction of the group , and stopped short and swung and loped toward Ghoo ; and back and forth he went , never pausing for a moment and whimpering all the while . In his simple way he was trying not only to keep them all in sight but also to bring them together . Each time he ran toward the group he went a step or two farther and he did likewise in returning toward Ghoo , and presently he was racing back and forth across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate in his frantic efforts  | or in his plaintive crying like a lost thing . After the group had passed out of sight he stopped , exhausted , trembling , and covered with sweat . He went over and stood by Ghoo and looked at her , his eyes asking what they should do now . Ghoo looked at him and her eyes asked the same question . For several minutes these two persons , the one sick and the other an idiot , looked at one another , knowing that they had been abandoned and were helpless . Their eyes were bright with grief and terror . They listened  --  but in the wilderness around them there was no sound . Crying with anxiety and dread , Ghoo began to crawl on hands and feet ; and Kughh , overjoyed , ran on ahead , as if feeling that his eager nimbleness would give her strength and speed . He dashed ahead fifty yards or more and stopped to look back and wait . He was impatient and he scolded her and jumped up and down . Ghoo crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only in the dread of being left alone did she find the power to move at all . Overcome by impatience , Kughh rushed back , shrieking at her , and seized one of her arms and tried to drag her . When he pulled at her she sank as if stricken , and for several yards he yanked at her and scolded and asked her in his gibberish to get up and walk . Then in despair he dropped her arm and ran forward again . With eyes and nose he marked the path of the group and shouted with glee as if he had discovered what it had been difficult to find . He yelled back at Ghoo and with wild gestures beckoned to her . But Ghoo was too sick and weak to move . She was lonely with the loneliness of approaching death , and she was only dimly aware of Kughh 's cries or of his attempts  | a little later to drag her after him . In her tired and starved body she felt him pulling her , and when he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could have made him understand , she would have told him to run on ahead and rejoin the group . Kughh would not have done that . He was a dwarf and an outcast and he had a feeble mind , but this woman who had cared for him so many years was the only meaning and anchor of his life . He did not realize that she had starved herself almost to death that he might live . He did not know that she was sick . He sat and looked at her and wondered why she did not run ahead with him to find the group . He wondered , too , why she did not find food for him . His exertions had made him hungry , but for so many years he had been babied and cared for that he had little sense of how or where to find food , and little knowledge of what was good to eat and what was not . An hour later Ghoo had recovered enough strength to sit up and to realize that her ward was hungry . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her , she saw nothing that he would eat . Under her care he had been accustomed to the choicest plants and fruits , and the vegetation here was coarse and tough and bitter . She reached out and stripped leaves from a twig and handed them to him ; but Kughh spurned them . He struck them from her hand . He barked at her , trying to express his distaste for all the woody pulp in sight . Then Ghoo began to crawl about , searching for more succulent plants , and Kughh followed her , angrily observing and sometimes anticipating her moves . At the moment , for instance , when she reached toward some foliage , he gave a bark of rage that told her he would eat  | none of that . Ghoo filled her mouth with the bitter leaves , as if to teach him that these would sustain life when there was nothing better . Kughh closely watched her . She chewed the bitter mouthful and swallowed it , but Kughh was so dubious that he made signs to her to open her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ghoo ate no more of these leaves . They were too bitter . She crawled again , seeking more savory growth , but Kughh would eat nothing that she found and ate . Nevertheless , he watched her as if fascinated and suspicious and baffled , and again and again he looked into her mouth to be sure she was swallowing the stuff . When night approached he had forgotten that the two of them were alone . Like an infant that feels secure with its mother , he felt safe with her ; but Ghoo was anxious and frightened . She crawled to a thicket and sat under it , half-hidden , and Kughh sat by her ; and when she caressed him he moved close to her like a child . He looked at her , his eyes asking why there was no food for him , but Ghoo looked at the deepening gloom and was afraid . As clearly as she was able , she wondered what to do , knowing well that old or sick persons , deserted by the clan , were the prey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would have tried to climb a tree to spend the night above ground . After a little while Kughh laid his shoulders across her lap and slept . Ghoo did not steep . Wide awake , alert , and so terrified she hardly dared breathe , she stared into darkness and listened . Every sound in the deep night made her Alin hair rise and her flesh turn cold . She heard invisible wings and the night-crying of birds ; and all around her on the soft damp decay of the jungle floor she heard  | the sound of small feet . These sounds she had heard all her life , and nobody in the security of a group paid any heed to them ; but now every sound , no matter how faint or far away or how familiar , seemed ominous and dreadful . For members of a group they were only the sounds that disturbed sleep , but for a sick woman alone with a helpless and overgrown baby they became a part of the unknown and nameless anxieties that haunted her people . While she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a wing passed in heavy flight above her , she looked up , and if a small thing scurried by she leaned forward in an effort to see it ; but she knew that the harmless creatures made a lot of noise and the killers came on padded feet . The loudest sounds startled her , but she knew they were nothing to fear . The downward breathing of great wings chilled her , but it was the stealthy movements that made her almost scream . Her ears were sensitively recording all the stir around her and her nose was marking every odor that came on the breeze ; but it was her eyes that probed the darkness for another pair of eyes . The eyes of the great cats she had seen many times . These beasts often approached groups during the night and looked in , but only their eyes , like a pair of green and burning stones , were ever visible in the outer darkness . When Ho-wha roared at them they went away . The eyes went out suddenly and there was only blackness where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming that Ghoo watched and waited during the slow hours of this night . It would come on soft feet that would make no sound at all , and she would not know until she saw a pair of green lights that it was looking at her . She would not be able to see its body . She would not know if it was  | standing erect and moving its tail or if it was crouching to spring . And when , after long hours of dread , she saw the two terrible eyes looking at her , she was so choked by terror that she could not scream . The hair rose on her head and over her body ; a sensation like that of cold flowing water moved in her flesh . The beating of her heart shook her and trembled in Kughh asleep on her lap , and she could feel the soles of her feet burn as if stung by nettles . But when she tried to move she seemed to be numbed by crushing weight as if not Kughh but a great tree lay across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost at once they were looking at her again . As Ghoo stared at them , hypnotized and helpless , she realized that they were approaching , but soundlessly as if floating toward her in the dark . Then she gave a choked cry of despair , an awful strangled moan , and Kughh sat up ; and the moment he saw the leopard 's eyes he screamed and flung himself , howling and frenzied , to the earth . It was his cry , it was awareness of the threat to him , that aroused Ghoo to furious strength . She leapt to her feet to put herself between Kughh and the beast , and in the same instant the leopard sprang . It struck her with the full force of its weight and knocked her down , and talons and teeth sank deep into her flesh . In the first awful moment of realizing that she was in the beast 's grasp she screamed and fought to escape , her hands wildly clutching fur or seeking the throat . She felt no pain . She felt only crushing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness with death . The claws gutting at her belly she did not feel , and when open jaws closed on her throat there was no pain then . There was a sense of having her breath choked off . Then there  | was an inrush of smothering horror as if the black night were pouring into her mind . When the beast sprang , Kughh shrieked and ran away , plunging blindly and headlong into trees and fighting with them as if they were alive . He knocked himself down and then raced on all fours until spent ; whereupon , still howling with terror , he cowered and looked back . He felt around him in the darkness to learn if Ghoo was with him . Too stupid to conceive of her death , he believed that she had deserted him and he began to whimper like a frightened child . He thought that if he waited here she would come . At the first sign of morning he became a little bolder and moved about , trying to see or smell her . In full daylight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was alone , and it never occurred to him that Ghoo was dead . In searching for her he came to the spot where she had been slain and he could see and smell fresh blood . He did not know that it was her blood . He believed that she was near and perhaps gathering food for him , and he called to her and listened and called again . " Hooo ! " he said , but there was no answer of living thing in the quiet dawn . Again feeling terrified , he began to lope about , crying for her . He would run aimlessly in a direction and give his call and listen . Getting no answer , he would suddenly rush in another direction and repeat his call . After a while he was so frightened that he chased about wildly and without purpose ; and when , worn out , baffled , dejected , he paused to listen , he thought he heard her coming to him . Then his dull face awakened with inexpressible relief and joy . With a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran forward to meet her , never doubting that she was coming to him and bringing him food . He would run a little way and stop to give his plaintive call and then run again . " Hooo ! " he said , but there was no answer in the vast and friendless loneliness around him .  | 9 HO-WHA and his group quickly forgot Ghoo and her dwarf . Perhaps nobody except Wuh thought of them at all , and he observed only that they were gone . He did not care . Nobody cared much about unfortunate adults who were chronically ill or repulsively malformed . Except in the relations between mothers and their children , strength was not the faithful warden of weakness , nor health of disease . The well ones and the strong ones had all the problems and worries they could take care of . Even among them , none ever lived into extreme old age or died a natural death . So hazardous was their existence , so constantly surrounded by the forces of destruction , that for life itself and health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little while , forgetful of dangers , they felt secure , their egoism was arrogant and despotic , and they behaved as if they were the favored tenants of the planet , chosen to rule and command . Then they were impertinent and overbearing , and each of them was tyrannical toward  | those weaker than himself . All of them , but more especially the men and boys , liked to order others around and force them to obey and cringe and show deference and fear . It delighted the lad of nine , for instance , to tyrannize over his brother who was many years younger . He played with him , to be sure , but now and then , if the mothers were not watching , he cuffed him and knocked him down or he snatched food away from him . He did not really covet the food . He felt more important and meaningful if he could force his brother to serve him ; and the younger lad , in turn , had a wish to boss Kooloo . This urge to enslave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition was to mother rather than to command . The egoism in any of them was insufferable only when there was no sense of danger . When they felt anxious and afraid , when their attention was drawn from despotic whims to the terrible and inscrutable world around them , then their meekness was as extreme as their presumption or arrogance . In such moments even Ho-wha , or his morose son Hwah , could feel humble and defenseless and lost . Instead of feeling the strength of his muscles and the bold lusting of his hungers , a man then perceived himself , dimly and unhappily , as a friendless creature on a mysterious and unfriendly earth ; and his humility or despair was particularly strong if the threat was something that he did not understand at all . Against beasts that moved , that struck with teeth and claw , that behaved in many ways like his own kind , he could assert himself . They were enemies but they were not mysterious . But his emotion was quite different toward such utterly baffling things as thunder and lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | often invisible ; and if not invisible they manifested themselves in such dreadful ways that it was impossible to frighten or destroy them . It was inevitable , therefore , that people should have come to feel not only that the world was unfriendly but that much of it was moved by anger and a wish to kill . If they had been more intelligent , they might have tried to placate the furies around them . No such notion had ever occurred to them . On the one hand they were moved by a vigorous will to conquer and enslave , but on the other they were chastened and rebuked by forces mightier than themselves . Between despotic assertion and humble submission they spent their lives , and each emotion tended to drive the other to greater extremes . If Ho-wha was lording it over the others when thunder suddenly crashed above him , he behaved as if he had been personally rebuked . Sometimes he whimpered like a child . But sometimes , too , after cowering for a while , humble and abashed , and listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if a bluff and a braggart , too cowardly to show his face , had been making a jest of him ; and when the danger passed he became a more oppressive bully than was his custom . He howled at his women and he strode wrathfully about , restoring with bluster and abuse his self-respect . But the other emotion in him also ran to extremes . By nature he was , like all men , a tyrant , and like them he felt most important when others humbly submitted to him . If , when he was roaring manfully , one of the dreadful mysteries spoke to him in rage , his self-esteem collapsed and his majesty sank to the level of any terrified creature . He behaved then as if he felt that he had overplayed his part ,  | as if he had offended some power mightier than himself , and as if to atone for his rashness he had to humble himself . Of all the devouring angers loose in the world , the most terrible for him and his people was fire . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notion at all . It seemed to be the very substance of anger itself ; and as suddenly as it came it vanished , leaving behind it only ruin and the strong smell of its breath . Sometimes they could smell it in the air when there was no other sign of it ; and one evening many weeks after Ghoo 's death they had eaten and made their beds when Ka-ka uttered a warning and stood sniffing the wind . Observing what she did , the others faced the breeze and smelled of it and talked in the excited way they had when they sensed danger . There was an odor of burning things in the air . Even though night had come , Ka-ka set Kooloo on her shoulders and moved away , and the others fell in behind her ; and the group went down the wind . Now and then Ka-ka paused to be sure she was going with the wind and not against it , or to sniff the air for the heat of approaching fire , or to see if all the children had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stepped past Who-A , who was next in line , and in turn touched all the children as if counting them . She included Gah , who was not a child any longer but a pregnant woman . They moved across an area that a former fire had devastated but they did not know that their enemy fed on dead growth . Ka-ka did realize after a while that the heat was overtaking them . The smell of it was stronger . The warmth of it was coming down the wind . She turned , scolding at the others , and they all came together in a group around her ; but they did not talk . They had no words to express the terror they felt now . In turn they '  | peered into the darkness or looked at one another or pointed to a faint light far away in the sky . Their faces were those of people baffled and terrified . Looking at Howha , Ka-ka gestured to the right of their course and to the left , and Ho-wha , after appearing to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they should take . They resumed the march , swinging leftward , and presently they climbed a hill that offered a view toward the distant fire . On this hill they found another group . The two groups looked at one another , curiously , almost with friendliness , but they did not mingle . Then Ka-ka looked out and across the dark wilderness below . Far away in the sky she could see the yellow light of the enemy . Rolling away from the light she could see its breath . It was the smoke of a vast encircling fire and it was filling the sky with a darkness deeper than that of the night . Upon the belly of the smoke was the yellow radiance of the flame below . After a few moments the other group moved away and down the hill , and Ka-ka thought not of them but of the direction they had taken . She looked at the darkness into which they had vanished and then far away at the fire ; she turned her face to catch the flow of the wind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other group had chosen the right way to safety . The other adults , too , were thinking of this matter . They stared at the fire in an effort to decide which direction it was taking . Ghak was running back and forth , his gaze fixed on Ka-ka , and his frightened gibberish telling her that they ought to be going . Ka-ka did not intend to move until she was sure of the safest course . While she waited and watched , the yellow sky  | turned a pale red and a burst of flame ran up several dead trees and exploded in showers of light . Then a wind caught the torches and waved them like flaming wings , and long tongues leapt into the sky and vanished , and from below there rose a broad crimson sheet . Then the sheet fell out of sight but after a moment it rose again in two tides of flame , with the tree tops like torches between them . Ghak was frantic . The children began to cry . Who-ah came up to Ka-ka and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who-ah pointed in the direction the other group had taken but Ka-ka scolded her and she withdrew . Ka-ka had lived long enough to learn that this terrible enemy always marched with the wind , She knew that to the right or left of the great anger visible to all of them there was flame low down and hidden , skulking there , like any stealthy killer , and feeling its way . When , three or four hundred yards to the left of the parent fire , there was a sudden gleam in the darkness , Ka-ka thought she knew what the main path of the monster would be ; and instead of following the other group she turned down the opposite side of the hill . She went , not with the wind but at a right angle to it , and she moved as fast as she could , paying no attention to gouging limbs or the thrust of thorn and briar . She beat a path for those behind her but after a while she stepped aside and indicated to Who-ah that she was to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and climbed a hill higher than any they had crossed ; and there they paused to look around them . There was no moon or stars visible , but the wilderness before them was faintly alight , as if touched by the afterglow  | of sunset . Far away the crest of the fire was two or three miles wide ; and rolling away from it on the wind were vast clouds of smoke . It was a broad and dreadful anger sweeping through the night . Ka-ka looked the other way and saw higher hills than this on which she stood , each thrust up like a pile of gloom . Again she led them , going down the hill and into a valley of darkness and climbing another hill . All around her she heard sounds and she knew that other things were fleeing for their lives . Throughout the immense forest there was a frantic emigration of life and all of it seemed to be moving down the wind ; but Ka-ka continued to cut across the wind in an effort to outflank it . Living things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear or smell them , but they were never visible . She did not know that in the stampede before a fire , no beast ever interrupted its flight to attack another ; but if she had known that great cats were cutting across her path almost within reach , she would not have paused . From hill to hill they went , traveling all night and never stopping for more than a moment until they felt safe . They had come to a mountain , faced with rock , and they climbed from shelf to shelf until they stood on a stone ledge far above the surrounding country . Morning had come . Toward the sun they could see for many miles , and they looked across a broad desolation , fire-swept , blackened , and smoking with death . On the western horizon the fire was a reef of smoke around the sky . Ka-ka felt that they had had a close escape . She knew that multitudes of living things had perished in that mysterious and devouring anger that had moved through the night . She had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasteland and found the bones of the dead . Now , after gazing at the ruins below , they turned to look at one another , their eyes eloquent with fear and awe . If they had had words to express their thoughts they might have said : " What is this angry thing and where does it come from ? " That was the question in their minds . Ghak was so exhausted that he fell asleep , but the others stared at a landscape of dead trees , wondering about this engulfing fury that did not kill with hands and teeth but poured in a hot flood . They were so curious about it , now that all danger was past , that the boys went down the mountain to inspect the ruins ; and soon the other members of the group followed them . Ghak awoke and descended too . Cautiously , as if the mysterious thing might suddenly rise again , they went to the edge where fire had burned itself out against a ledge of stone . They kicked at the ashes . They gathered ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined shrubs that had been green and were now leafless stalks . They talked excitedly to one another , trying to express the wonder they felt . The older lad entered the devastated area , but when his feet struck a hot ember he yelled with fear and dashed back to Ka-ka . Presently they all ventured out , seeking sticks that were still burning , and marveling when a gray surface , lifted into the wind , became a pulsing red . Intently they looked at it , fascinated by the crimson stain . When they thrust the stick down out of the wind the glow faded to gray but when they held it up again it turned bright . Ho-wha waved the stick about and soon it . burst into flame , and the moment flame appeared he dropped the stick and roared at it . They were utterly baffled by this thing that could fasten itself on wood  | and consume it ; for it had no body of its own and no life apart from the things it fed on . They were so eager and curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy and hungry and tired . When they came to stricken trees they paused to stare at the smoldering embers in their trunks ; and they walked round and round the trees , looking at them and at one another , their eyes asking questions . Apprehensively but resolutely they invaded the desolation . It was the four-year-old lad , running on ahead of the others , who came upon a horrifying sight , and with a yell of terror he rushed back to his mother and tried to climb to her shoulders . He had seen a group of persons who had burned to death . There had been nine of them and they were all huddled together as if , when there came to them the frenzied realization of doom , they had clung to one another as death closed in . They were only a pile of skeletons now , but in the atmosphere about them there was still an odor of burning flesh . When the living group advanced to look upon the dead , their emotions were so overwhelming that they all set up an outcry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children in the extremity of their fear began to defecate ; and all of them in chorus uttered their sound of grief . It was a low moaning cry in three syllables , " Haaahhh-eahayeh ! " that began as a kind of guttural groan and rose to a plaintive wail . Their cry became a chilling lamentation , a dirge , that continued for several minutes without pause ; and though their eyes shed no tears they looked stricken with anguish . While lamenting , they all stared at the skeletons , and some of them in grief snatched  | at the hair on their heads , and others , like Ho-wha , softly drummed on their breasts . They were uttering more than sounds of woe . Their mournful lament was also a kind of entreaty , a supplication , a prayer to all the unpitying forces in the world that attacked and destroyed . They felt chastened and humbled and defenseless . If they had been a little more imaginative , they might have striven in a spirit of sacrificial giving to placate and appease those terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out of grief and abasement and the superstitious loneliness of their heritage . If they had gone farther across the miles of desolation they would have found the bones of other creatures , some of whom had been their enemies . They would not have found the king cobra melted to a streak of ashes and stain or the anaconda looped among dead branches like a charred cable , because these did not inhabit the more open woods of the higher hills ; but they would have seen the bones of a great tiger that had been encircled and destroyed . The results of ravaging fire the adults had seen before . They had seen anger drop from the sky and sweep over an area and slowly withdraw , leaving a field of the dead . They had no wish to explore farther , and when Ka-ka turned away she headed back for the mountain , talking to herself with low excited cries as if she had gone daft . The others followed ; and the sounds they made were mournful astonishment in the women , and rumbling fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both growled as they waded through the ashes ; Ghak chattered with shrill despair ; but Wuh , not so deeply , affected as the others , was silent . He had lamented with the others  | while looking at the bones but now he was trailing Murah and thinking of her . Ka-ka reached the mountain and led the way up until they were again safe but she did not go at once in search of food . She still suffered from grief and shock . Sitting on a stone shelf , with Who-ah and the children around her , she stared out across the burned waste , remembering the dead ones she had seen there . Mother love was a deep and anxious emotion . It was almost the only meaning a woman had . No matter what she did , whether it was sexual embrace , the gathering of food , the making of a bed , or only the calm watching of children at play , her concern and her labor were for her offspring and her life was given to them . In thinking now of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in mind . With the men , on the other hand , personal welfare and safety and hunger were uppermost in their thoughts . Howha began to strip leaves and eat . Upon a ledge , Ghak found a smooth pathway of stone and ran back and forth , capering and yelling and disporting in lunatic antics in an effort to fix attention on himself . It was always this way after he had been deeply stirred . In varying degrees it was so with all men . A threat to their existence made them clamorous exhibitionists after the danger had passed  --  as if by taking the stage they could recover a sense of personal autonomy and worth . Ho-wha and Hwah were feeding but they were also growling angrily and looking at the others to see if they were paying any heed . They acted as if they had suffered an ordeal and had behaved courageously and ought to be singled out for admiration and applause . In this respect Wuh was no exception , but most of his  | hunger for attention he repressed . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little enough what he did . He now fed apart from the others and cast his eye over the landscape , alert , as always , for sign of a wandering female . He wished that Murah would come over his way . If she had done so he would have seized her , never reflecting that she would make an outcry and bring Howha upon him . Of foresight he had , like the others , almost none , and could not plot more than one move ahead or anticipate the consequences of that . His interest in Gah he had lost , not because she was big with child but because he had sense enough to perceive that she belonged to another . In Murah his interest had grown . She was a vivacious girl with an uncommonly intelligent interest in things about her . But Wuh was interested in her because with one of her brothers she often engaged in erotic play , and she so excited Wuh that he could barely restrain himself . She and the lad explored and patted and stroked one another , rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instinctive movements of coitus ; and all the while they vocalized their excitement with cries of pleasure . When he saw them behaving thus , Ho-wha stared at them as if puzzled , but the mothers sometimes slapped the youngsters and sent them off alone to mind their business . Their playfulness Wuh watched with lustfully eloquent eyes . During this day Murah did not come close to him ; and after he had eaten a lean meal of bitter leaves and tough shoots , Wuh prepared his bed . He understood that Ka-ka did not intend to leave this mountaintop until she was sure all danger had passed . They were all hungry and thirsty  | and irritable . Wuh himself was in an ugly mood . After making his bed , he sat in it and looked across distance at the others ; and again he wished that he could murder Ho-wha . After a while the others slept and Wuh lay on his bed and looked at the stars .  | 10 YET THAT is not quite what he did . He could see the stars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no interest in them and he never thought of them . Like all people of his time , he was not interested in anything except the small environment in which he lived . Even the sun , floating every day across the sky , was of no interest to him . In his infancy and childhood it had been there , just as water and trees and food had been around him , and he had grown up accustomed to the presence of these things . His attention was captured only by unusual manifestations of familiar objects . If the moon had pitched out of its course or exploded or come close to the earth , Wuh would have been alarmed and he would have given to it anxious attention ; but it was only a light that waxed and waned , that changed its shape , and that alternately appeared and vanished . The sky was full of stars tonight , and moon and stars flooded the earth with soft radiance . Wuh was used to sleeping in jungle gloom . Now he lay on a summit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never thought of that . He was , like the others , imprisoned by a few simple emotions and by an unimaginative mind . He felt no mystery or awe except when things touched his physical welfare . He was not conscious at all of the wideawake beauty of the night , of its infinite calm and peace , of its fragrance enhanced by moonlight and silence . If there was a faint stirring in his soul , as if he heard soft music far away , it aroused in him no more than angry resentment of Ho-wha . After a while his keen nose caught a scent that he recognized , and it fetched him bolt upright , sniffing the breeze . It was the strong musk odor of beings like himself , and at once he knew that another group of persons was not far away . Pointing his nose into the wind he sniffed the strong smell of human bodies , and he opened his mouth wide as if to verify the evidence with his throat and tongue . Convinced , he left his bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no formulated thought in his mind . He went as if an invisible hand had reached out to guide and direct his will . Hunger had made him reckless again . Stealthily he moved down the mountain , guided by the odor in the wind but ready at any moment to turn and flee . The group he sought was a half mile away , and this distance he covered without snapping a twig or rustling a leaf . Upon approaching close to the strange people he dropped to his hands and went on four feet like a monkey . A shadow moving through the night could have been no more soundless . Soon he could hear their snores , and a few moments later he was able to see several of them , asleep in the moonlight . Wuh sat to study the forms and to consider his next move .  | On the far side lay a hulk which Wuh took to be the lord of the group , and such reflection as he was capable of told him that this was so . The guardian would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first to scent the approach of an enemy . The person closest to Wuh seemed to be a young woman , alone in a bed ; and on her for a few moments he fixed his impatient and inquiring gaze . As quiet as the moon in the sky he was , sitting there , looking at her , and wondering if she would make an outcry if he touched her . After deciding that she was the one he wanted , he gave attention to other members of the group , studying their positions and trying to tell if more than one adult male was present . As nearly as he could tell , there was only one . Thought of him , however , made the flesh quiver down Wuh 's spine ; and each impulse to move forward was restrained by fear of the tyrant who was not more than thirty yards away . Presently he felt so angrily impatient that his teeth clicked a little and saliva fell to his breast . Between the two , the overlord sunk in slumber and the girl almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn from one to the other and struggling between fear and lust . Then his hands reached out , exploring the grass around him by no will of his own . He did not realize that he was seeking a weapon . A former experience was formulating a hint but he had no knowledge of that . On the contrary , he followed his hands and crept forward and came so close to the girl that he could see her clearly . His almost uncontrollable urge was to examine her at once , to turn her over , to draw her to him , to set her up on her hands and feet . The wish to do these.things was so strong  | in him that he began to tremble and sweat , but still he did not touch her and he made no sound . She was a girl of about ten but large for her age and very hairy . She slept alone . Lying on her side , she presented to him a view of her breasts , and it was on these that Wuh fixed his ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most obvious sign of femaleness ; and if he felt a wish to examine them , that was perhaps only to be sure that his eyes were not deceived . Sweating , trembling , and breathing as if half-choked , he crouched above her , his eyes avidly exploring . He looked down her body but the womanliness of her was hidden by thick dark hair . Then for a long minute Wuh stared at her closed eyes as if by prolonged and ardent contemplation he hoped to make her look at him . If she had awakened to look upon this stranger hovering by her , she might have been hypnotized by the burning hunger of his eyes . His eyes were saying what his tongue had never learned to say  --  and they were saying it with such intense and unwavering passion that the girl stirred in her sleep . Her movement so excited him that he reached out and touched her . He felt , with the logic of intuition , that he was communicating his wish to her , and that she would soon awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would yield to him . His fear was too extreme and his awareness of danger was too sharp to allow in him more than a feeble sense of triumph , or to blind him to the fact that he had invaded another 's domain . That the girl was slowly awaking became clear to him . Fear now was stronger in him than lust , and he stopped caressing her and waited . But he continued to look at her with hypnotic eyes , and when , after a few moments , she seemed to sleep soundly again he resumed his gentle attentions .  | Boldly he moved forward and thrust his tongue against her face . She stirred a little and moved toward him , and in this moment his defenses fell within him like a downrush of blood , and before he could realize what he was doing he had put arms around her and drawn her to him . He was facing her and looking at her when she opened her eyes . For perhaps a minute they looked into the eyes of one another and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of his hunger ; in her eyes there was sleep and a question . He thought she was going to yield to him . He thought , indeed , that she had yielded , but when he moved again , intending to set her in a sexual position , she came wide awake and screamed . She leapt up as if not a man but a leopard had crept to her bed . She screamed again , and her cry was wild and ringing in the night . The whole group was instantly aroused . The lord of the family came up from his bed roaring with fury and at once ran to a tree and beat a challenge upon it . The woman and children leapt up , too , and with dramatic suddenness that took Wuh 's breath away he found himself on his feet , chilled to his marrow , half paralyzed , and sweating from every pore . The girl had fled from him . And now they all stood there , dark and terrible in the moonlight , looking at him and shrieking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord stared at him , and thus for a long moment two men looked at one another . Then the lord of this group roared another challenge and rushed forward , and Wuh vanished into a thicket as if thrown by a mighty hand . But he did not go far . He knew that men , in defending their feeding grounds or their family , were content to bluster and shout .  | They never pursued an enemy that fled . Wuh , therefore , plunged into hiding and stopped , knowing that he was safe as long as he was invisible . Besides , he was now a very angry man . The passion in him , suddenly stifled , had mixed with rage and fear and turned him sick . He felt dizzy and he acted as if he were drunk . Thought of the tyrant who had driven him off deluged his blood with wrath , and blood surged in him and darkened his senses . On hands and feet he began to crawl away as if he had been flogged . Spiritually he had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied a female when females were plentiful and to be chased off as if he were only a beast of prey  --  this was the most humiliating experience that could come to a man . It blighted his self-respect . It so outraged his egoism , his manhood , his conquering and adventurous soul that he could feel only a bewildering urge to kill . This urge was in him as he crawled away . He went up the mountain to seek his bed and was surprised to find Hwah up and prowling about . They looked at one another , curiously , suspiciously , and without friendliness . The outcry below had aroused this group , but all except Hwah had sunk into slumber again . Hwah had a notion in his mind . He had grown to be a powerful man almost as large as his father ; but he was a thick-witted fellow , habitually sullen and resentful , who moved awkwardly as if his strong young muscles had no mind to guide them . He had become bolder as time fleshed his frame and matured his hungers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The screams down the mountain had angered him . He had taken them as a personal challenge and he had been on the point of attacking his father when the cries subsided . So  | stupid was this young giant that he was unable to distinguish between the enraged voices he had heard and Ho-wha who had done no more than to rise from his bed and look around him . When a battle cry sounded , Hwah felt an urge to attack anything that moved within the range of his vision ; and after the yells died away in silence he felt confused and cheated , as if he had been slapped by an invisible and audacious foe . The emotion aroused in him then became a wish to seize and ravish , and this urge was moving him when Wuh unexpectedly appeared . After staring at Wuh for a moment , Hwah felt an impulse to attack him ; and he might have done so without delay if Wuh , sensing the young giant 's mood , had not gone quickly and discreetly to his bed . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such an unreasoning blockhead that he could not think of anything as an enemy unless it stood on its legs and faced him . Creatures that took to flight or threw themselves on the earth as if wounded or defeated he could only stare at and dimly wonder about . He looked at Wuh and Wuh slyly watched him . In Hwah 's dull mind was the notion that this was the enemy who had roared at him out of the night . But there the enemy lay now as if knocked down and conquered , and he could think of nothing to do about that . Bewildered , but still angry , he turned to look at Howha who was also supine and peaceful . In turn he stared at one and the other . All the while a thought was entering his mind . The thought said that these two enemies were both defeated or frightened , and that he stood here , by reason of some strength of his own , in possession of this group . As this idea took hold of him with the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave  | way to eagerness ; and he turned his gaze from the men to the sleeping women . He seemed to stand there and meditate on the unexpected wealth that had come to him  --  as if , relieved of all doubts , and chastened to a mood almost philosophic , he wished to savor in full the realization of his triumph and look calmly at his females before choosing one to use . He now looked in turn at the sleeping females . He made a move toward Gah but stopped short and glanced suspiciously at Wuh . He moved again , and again paused because in him the inhibitions of many years were laying a restraining hand . His emotions were hobbled . He behaved like a man whose bones were too heavy for the muscles that sheathed them . After each awkward advance , he looked over at Wuh or at Ho-wha and seemed to consider the risks . Wuh all the while was watching him , though he pretended to be asleep . Knowing well what was in Hwah 's mind , he eyed him anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho-wha came roaring from his bed . He was also worried about his own part in a struggle that seemed imminent . Sensing that Hwah intended to face the lord and fight it out with him , Wuh began to shake with excitement ; and he was so anxious and alarmed that he rose a little from his bed . Hwah saw him move and turned to growl a warning . Thereupon Wuh again sank to his bed and discreetly pretended to be unaware . But he tingled with expectancy and felt the hair rising on his back and crown . A few moments later he felt angry alarm . Hwah had changed his direction . After approaching and looking down on Gah , he turned toward Murah who lay a few  | feet away . That , Wuh decided , was more than he could endure without a protest . He had come to feel that Murah was his property . Softly he rose from his bed . Hwah did not see him . He had dropped to his hands to gaze at Murah with anticipatory delight . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wuh left his bed and came forward , but he advanced softly and without any notion of what he would do . He approached within a few feet of Hwah . When he saw Hwah clumsily trying to draw Murah to him , his first impulse was to leap upon him ; but he restrained that urge , and in the next moment was astonished to realize that he had uttered a ringing cry of defiance . It seemed to him as if another throat had uttered the cry . Hwah sprang to his feet , and in the same instant Howha sat up . The cry had aroused every sleeper in the group . Murah sat up and looked at Hwah , towering above her ; Hwah looked at Wuh and bared his teeth ; and Howha rose to his feet and looked at both men . For a tense moment there was silence . The silence was broken by a bellowing challenge from Ho-wha . At the sound of it , Hwah swung to face his sire . His hour had come . The hour had come that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ; and this time Hwah did not intend to cringe and slink away . He bared his big strong teeth . The hair rose straight and stiff on his skull and down his spine . But he did not advance . He was content to wait and to fight only if he must . It was Ho-wha who advanced . With a cry that roared from mountain to mountain and awoke every sleeping thing within a radius of three or four miles , he , too , bared his teeth and felt his hair rise in anger ; and with another  | bellow he made a savage rush forward . He dashed a few feet , smiting himself , and stopped short to challenge again . They all knew what was coming when Hwah answered the challenge . His voice , as mighty as his father 's , was like the crash of thunder . His face was a picture of murderous lust . But he did not advance . He stood his ground and waited , answering challenge with challenge ; and when Ho-wha rushed forward again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off in a group and looked with unhappy astonishment at the two men . Wuh , meanwhile , had retreated . He wanted Ho-wha and his son to destroy one another ; but though he was , in his way , a sly opportunist , he was also a very primitive man , and the challenging cries aroused in him a wish to fight . He stood ten yards behind Hwah and eyed the two warriors , but he was trembling and sweating . He wanted to roar too and beat his breast and leap upon the men . When Ho-wha rose from his bed he was about forty yards from his son . Each savage dash forward covered only a few feet , but with each advance his fury mounted and his cry became more menacing . His gaping mouth exposed to view nearly every tooth in his jaws . His long upper lip , covered with a very short mustache , was drawn like a tight belt across his upper gum and back into either cheek , with his big nostrils looking like caverns at its edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep V between his brows . Hands beat a warning on the broad drum of his breast . Again he rushed forward as if bent on tearing worlds apart , but he stopped suddenly with theatrical waving of his arms and clutching of his hair . His behavior , in these short advances , was intended to suggest to an enemy his  | power and ferocity and so frighten him ; but Hwah did not budge . In his rage he was a frightful image of his father . In determination he was more than his match . Because it was clear that Ho-wha , for all his fury , weakened a little after each rush , and mixed fear with rage in his bellowing . He had never before faced an enemy that did not give ground  --  at least no enemy that walked on legs . Each advance was a little shorter than the one that preceded it ; and in his voice now there was something plaintive . It was a note of anxiety and alarm  --  as if , while trying to intimidate his foe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Ho-wha to pass the whole thing off and save his face . Perhaps Hwah heard and understood the change in his sire . Perhaps he sensed that the old man was chiefly bluster , and that now , if ever , was the time to attack . From the moment of Ho-wha 's first cry he had not moved . But he moved now , and he moved with such unexpected speed that his teeth sank deep into flesh before Ho-wha realized that his foe was upon him . Ho-wha 's next cry was one of rage mixed with pain . Hwah 's teeth had entered his shoulder , and Hwah 's hands , with nails like strong talons , were seeking Ho-wha 's eyes and throat . They were two monstrous men , locked in a death struggle and matched in strength and ferocity ; and they fought with an earnestness rarely found among the beasts of the earth . Their fury was that of the lioness ; their singlemindedness was that of the stag . Their courage , once they stopped bluffing and closed in , had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought , not to maim or to frighten but to kill ; and those who watched them sensed that this struggle would be the death of one of them .  | The women , staring at them with fascinated and griefdarkened eyes , began to wail , and the children took up the cry . The two warriors fell to the earth and rolled over and over like cats . They bit into flesh , and the smell and taste of warm blood redoubled their fury . With grasping feet , with rending hands , they strove to tear one another limb from limb , to choke breath off , to gouge eyes from their sockets , to strip cheeks like rotten flesh away from teeth . The most terrible thing was not the sight of them but the sound of their voices . It was a sound that impelled all beasts that heard it to flee for their lives . If Wuh had not been so fascinated by the struggle , he would have known that his opportunity had come . He would have seized Murah 's arm and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his blood was also pouring in a lust for battle , and instead of fixing his attention on the women he moved closer to the men . He ran round them , echoing their cries and seeking a chance to attack either one of them . When , for an instant , Ho-wha broke loose , with blood streaming from his breast , Wuh stepped in , intending to finish the old man off ; but in the next moment Hwah leapt upon Wuh and knocked him flat . That so enraged Wuh that his hands clutched about him and one of them closed on a stone ; and when he rose to his feet he was grasping a rock the size of a cocoanut . Something awoke and flashed in his mind . Grasping the stone with both hands , he drew his arms up and over his head and hurled it at Hwah . It struck his skull and dropped him and he sprawled , face downward , his whole body shuddering . Ho-wha , almost too weak to move , looked at his fallen enemy and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little with something shining like a dim light  | in his mind . He did not understand fully all that he had done but he knew that he had felled Hwah with a stone and that the man seemed to be dead . So astounding was this realization that he , too , crouched to look at Hwah ; and when he perceived that the skull was crushed and that the man seemed to be dead or dying , he rose to his feet and looked around him as he might have looked if he had conquered a world . Ho-wha recovered a little of his strength . When he saw Wuh standing near he challenged him and moved to attack ; and Wuh , instead of hurling another stone , ran away . The women were lamenting . Ka-ka went over to look at Hwah and above him she set up a mournful chant of grief ; and Ho-wha , still puzzled , again bent forward to stare at his foe . Wuh now perceived that his chance had come . Wasting no more time in foolish anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away . When Ho-wha saw them going he began to shout and wave his arms , and the women and children set up a barking outcry ; but Wuh did not look back or pause . Leading Murah , he went quickly over a ledge and out of sight . He went downward from ledge to ledge , half-dragging the crying and frightened Murah with him ; and he did not stop until he was far from Howha and safe with his woman in a small world of his own .  | II IF Wuh had stopped to think about it , he would have realized that he was safe from Ho-wha after he had gone a few miles ; but he continued his flight as if angry breath were on his back . But there was another reason . He was a man now without a domain of his own , and he knew that . No matter where he went he would be a trespasser . It did not occur to him that if he traveled far enough he might come to an area that he could safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notion of where he was going or of what he would do . While he journeyed he felt anxious and triumphant , and bewildered by what he had done . He had killed Hwah . He realized that much and he was proud of himself . But he had killed an enemy with a rock , a weapon , with something besides his hands and teeth ; and that was such an inexplicable circumstance that he could think of little else while he fled . Memory of it so occupied his thoughts and emotions that Murah , who followed obediently , became a shadowy and secondary object in the twilight of his wonder .  | He did not have a mind sufficiently rational to formulate a conclusion . He did not say to himself , " With a weapon you killed a foe mightier than yourself ; and now you have a secret , a discovery that is yours alone , and with it you can frighten or destroy all creatures that threaten you . With rocks you can crush the leopards and with clubs you can smite the snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive the matter so clearly . His intelligence did not grasp it at all . His emotions , fed by memory , were obscurely triumphant , but there was no recognition beyond that and no new vision of himself . After he had gone a few miles and felt beyond danger of attack , he was inclined to swagger and bluster . He threatened the birds that flew above him . When he heard a great touraco drumming in the ceiling overhead , he stopped , but he did not shout a challenge or rush forward . On the contrary , he looked about him for something to seize and hurl . In one moment his impulse was so sharply directed that he looked for a weapon , but in the next he acted as if confusions darkened his intentions . It seemed as if an effort to be deliberate ran into an ambush of capricious whims . It was not foresight , it was the unexpected impulse that flashed with meaning and memory and sent his hand groping . When , a little later , Murah whimpered and with gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her and then suddenly seized a dead branch and struck her with it . Then , quite as suddenly , the branch dropped from his hand and he looked confused and helpless . Still later , when Murah cried again , he again seized a stick and struck her . She cowered abjectly and wailed . Wuh stared at her for a moment ; but now , instead of  | dropping the stick , he strode about , growling at the woods and striking at things  --  as if feeling that he could fix his discovery in memory only by exercising it . He smote trees , and then , experimentally , he fetched the stick in a sharp blow across his own legs . The pain he felt seemed to delight him . Murah , meanwhile , was watching him closely ; and because , like all people , she was very imitative , she , too , grasped a club and walked around in mock combat . Presently she was as delighted and excited as he was . When he struck a tree , she ran to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she approached Wuh and struck him . Turning on her with a howl of rage , he showered blows on her head and shoulders ; and crying with pain she sank before him . Wuh looked down at her and at the stick in his hands , and his eyes winked gravely , darkly , as he thought of himself . He felt an impulse to beat her to death , not because he wished to kill her but only because he was confused by this new power that had come to him . When he raised his stick , Murah looked up and whimpered ; and then , instead of striking again , he forgot his club and let it fall from his hands . He seized her arm and began to drag her after him . He did not realize that he had dropped his stick , and he did not remember it . A weapon was still an alien thing that was no part of him . It was hardly more than an unpredictable notion that flashed into his mind and moved him in an urge to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him only a bewildering memory . He would not entirely forget it but neither on the other hand would he be able to keep it in mind . When , after another hour of wandering , he paused to eat , he did not  | remember his power with a weapon . He was only Wuh again , the sly and cunning and timid one who had no feeding grounds of his own and would have to be a poacher wherever he went . Each lord of a group had , within rough limits , his own domain , and other men invaded at their own risk . Wuh knew that . He realized that even now , while he stuffed his belly , he was an unwelcome stranger in another 's field . He fed with both hands and kept an anxious watch . If he had seen an enemy , he would not have thought of grasping a weapon . He would have blustered or fled . It was Murah , the one who would bear children and have need of security , who kept in memory the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and necessity then , as now , was the mother of progress . After eating , Wuh wanted to continue his flight . He went off a little way in the gloom and looked back at her ; and when she did not follow , he beckoned to her and made movements with his feet to suggest walking . He scolded her in the wordless language he used . When he came over and seized her arm , intending to drag her after him , Murah shook his clutch off and made it plain that she wished to fashion a bed and sleep . She began to make a bed in a bamboo thicket . Wuh looked apprehensively into the gloom around him and listened . He remembered next that Murah was his mate and was alone with him , but his erotic hunger was inhibited by fear . In his mind was a restraining picture of Ho-wha , coming across the earth , bloody and roaring , to recover his woman . He was troubled , too , by the realization that he had entered another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare to sleep he did not understand . Wuh failed to understand much more than that . He did  | not know that he had chosen by far the most intelligent female in Ho-wha 's group  --  and if he had known he could hardly have cared . He did know that Murah felt secure with him because he had killed a man , and had threshed trees and her and everything in his path . She had a dim and happy notion that she , and her children when they came , would be safe with him ; and though she felt no love , she did look upon him with an emotion akin to respect and pride . She would make her bed and sleep ; and if an enemy came , Wuh would kill him or drive him off . That is what she felt , remembering his show of strength , and that is why , in spite of his anxious gawking about , she made a bed and entered it . She looked at him and wondered why he did not make a bed ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose years of bachelorhood had made him apprehensive when there was no cause , stared down at her and wondered what he should do . He talked to her , trying to make her understand his anxiety . " Hooo ! " he said , making of the word both a warning and a question . He uttered other syllables , too , that scolded or questioned her ; and though Murah understood him she was sleepy . She curled up on her side , laying her head on one arm and drawing her knees up to her belly , and seemed not to hear . Wuh then decided to make a bed , but while he bent stalks to form a hammock he talked at her , chiding and complaining and disputing like one arguing with himself . And that , in a way , is what he was doing . He was trying , more for himself than for her , to clarify his new position in which he had a mate but no kingdom of his own . Where , he was asking , would they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat and play and  | sleep and be unmolested ? Did she not know that every man had his own domain from which he drove invaders ? Did she not realize that they had made their beds on another 's property and might at any moment be set upon and killed or chased out ? No , Murah was not thinking of such matters . The time had not come when the woman looked upon her mate as the one to bring in the food ; but she did expect him to drive enemies away and to protect her and her children . That was his job . When the job was too much for him , she sprang forward to assist , but fighting was not her task . Trespassing on another 's home was not her worry . And so she fell asleep . Wuh , still growling like one abused and misunderstood , made his bed and sat in it . Darkness had come , and with it , high in the leafy canopy , was the melancholy music of rain . They were on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight , and curtains of fog . It was a wet and gloomy and depressing world of parasitic growth where mosquitoes and sand flies and gnats swarmed in fogs of their own , and the cuckoo told over and over its mournful notes . Most people seemed to like this world with its heavy ceiling , its sunless undergrowth , and its smell of centuries of leaf-depth and old trees rotting on the ground ; but Wuh preferred open places and friendly light . He was a sad and dispirited fellow at best , and the monotonous language of rain and of huge trees sighing in the winds filled him with anxious and oppressive doubts . Leaving his bed he went over and sat by Murah and looked at her . Over the side of her exposed to the weather , hair glistened with the jewels of rain , and moisture was a  | dim light upon her cheek . Her eyelids were closed and wet . Wuh felt so chilled and dejected that he looked round him for a shelter  --  for a mora or a corkwood tree under whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a large hagenia tree and stood under its wide branches . Rain did not come down through the ceiling in solitary drops . On the high leaves the drops gathered and coalesced and then came down like a spilled handful of water ; and when one of these struck Wuh he shivered . Occasionally , in extremes of wet and cold , people built crude shelters , and with such a project in mind Wuh studied his situation . Looking above him , he saw that two branches formed a downsweeping canopy ; and at a little distance away he saw a plant with broad leaves that looked like shadows in the dark . He went over and stripped an armful and laid them upon the two branches . Then he sat under them , feeling that he had done well ; but soon the water , gathering on the leaves above , overflowed their basins and poured down upon him . Like a lazy fellow who added to his workmanship only if he had to , Wuh fetched another armful of leaves and spread them above him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of his labor as an experiment . Again and again he gathered leaves and laid them above him across the two limbs . After a while he had a roof that did not leak and he was deeply pleased with himself . He stared up at it as if to understand in what way he had fashioned a miracle . As a matter of fact , he had scattered the broad leaves like shingles , with each overlapping the next ; and the water ran from leaf to leaf and spilled from the eaves . He was so delighted to learn that the water did not touch him that he left his roof and walked around it , trying  | to understand by what cunning craftsmanship he had protected himself . He stared at it , but the simple mechanical principle he did not grasp . He was , in fact , so dubious that again he sat under his roof to be sure that he had not been deceived ; and he gazed solemnly up at it , with both delight and astonishment in his eyes . He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ; and then he dug into the humus under him , throwing the wet surface out and sitting at last on a dry floor . He was deeply pleased with himself . For the first time in his life he sat under a rain and was dry and warm because of his own efforts . He knew that he had protected himself but he had only a dim and troubled notion of how he had done it . He was so obsessed by wonder of himself , and doubt that he sat under a roof of his own making , that he resumed his curious peering at his handiwork . With dubious fingers he touched the leaves above him to see if they were dry ; he examined the dry earth on which he sat ; he thrust his head out to learn if rain was still falling ; he listened to the sound of wind and rain in the tree above him and upon the dark wet world around him , and he searched himself for signs of water . When , convinced at last , he drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remembered Murah , lying on a bed out in the storm . He did not care how soaked and distressed she might be . So far as her own welfare was concerned , he would not have cared if she had drowned . But because he was so proud of himself and wanted her to see what he had done , he crawled forth and went over to her . He seized an arm and dragged her out of sleep to her feet and then pulled her after him as if she were a dead thing . She protested and slapped at him ; but Wuh was determined to  | show her how wonderful he was and he took her with him to the roof he had made . He stooped and entered and drew her under it with him ; and without waiting for her to see for herself , he began to talk to her , trying to make her understand that he had built this shelter against water and wind . She sat on the dry earth , shivering , sleepy , and not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , and presently in his eagerness he left the roof and went into the rain to look again at what he had done . He peered in and scolded her . When she paid no heed he entered and sat by her and looked out at the storm . After a while he felt warm and secure , and he turned to embrace her , but she barked at him angrily and slapped him . Instead of persisting , as Ho-wha might have done , he drew away from her and sulked . A man 's erotic advances were always clumsy and experimental . There were times , he knew , when the female was not approachable ; but he did not know why she was not . Neither the man nor the woman had any notion at all of the relationship between copulation and birth . The man was in rut all the time , but the woman was so only for a short while during each moon cycle . Selfish and tyrannical men , like Ho-wha , slapped the women down and made them yield when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of man . After Murah struck him , he drew away and stared at her and luxuriated in self-pity . During this night he made no attempt to approach her again . Murah curled up and fell asleep . Wuh , like a shy and gawky fellow , sat half under the shelter and half in the rain and looked at her . Lulled by the music of wind and water , he dozed , and after a while  | he sank into sleep and dreamed unhappy dreams . His dreams were simple parables in which he copulated or fled from enemies or starved in bramble patches while others around him fed and grew fat . The climax of each dream aroused him , and then he would bestir himself and listen and scent the odors in the breeze and peer out at the dark world . He would look over at Murah who was curled up like a cat and snoring ; whereupon , feeling abused and cheated , he would doze again , with his chin resting on his wet breast .  | 12 FOR DAYS and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going without sense of direction or purpose and behaving as if enemies were on their track . The great forest in which they were vagrants was soaked by rains . It was a stupendous wet gloom out of which huge trees a thousand years old lifted their leafy empire to the sun . Titans among them , thrown down by winds or felled by age , lay like rotting monsters in the undergrowth and were so covered by plant parasites that each was a long reef , its trunk hidden and its dead branches clothed with vines . The lush dank wilderness was such a tangle of mosses and creepers and ferns that it was sometimes impenetrable ; and under riotous growth that often looked black in the perpetual twilight , invisible streams talked along dark channels or overflowed banks and spread into stagnant pools . Throughout the jungle was the melancholy of sunless life . The smell of it was the muggy odor of marsh and fen , of sodden and rotted leaf-depth , of decaying boles sheathed  | with fungus , of swamp-ponds , of plant-rust , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuding from mingled rot and growth , was a heavy and saturated atmosphere seldom stirred by a breeze and never cleansed by the sun . Under the oppressive ceiling , drooping and drenched and overladen by its own lush excesses , the air was like the concentrated breath of centuries , keeping all the stench of death and all the fragrance of life , and fertilizing the growth of the living with the decayed pollen of the dead . Throughout this gloomy wet underworld into which Wuh and his mate had plunged were countless billions of parasites who made it their home . Grasshoppers were there , aglow with moisture and chirping ceaselessly in a realm where there was neither day nor night . Mosquitoes swarmed in ravenous hordes that had little to feed on but darkness . Sometimes they moved in such dense bodies that they were like a dark and agitated cloud of sleeplessness . When they sensed the presence of a moving thing , no matter whether animal or only a released vine , they closed in upon it and sheathed it completely ; and if they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger . Only creatures protected by feathers or thick hair could live in this underworld that was the paradise of their breeding and the graveyard of their brief and famished lives . Mosquitoes and sand flies and gnats tortured Wuh and his mate day and night . The pests bothered them little while they were moving , but when they paused to eat or sleep their bodies were so mantled with them that with one slap of a palm they slew scores . The larger ones Wuh sometimes picked off and amputated , tearing legs and wings from the body and then looking curiously at the  | maimed creature wriggling on his palm . He killed thousands of them but if he had slain millions he could have perceived no thinning in the swarms . His face and hands and feet were pimpled with festered sores where they had sucked his blood . At night he tried to burrow among vines and cover himself with broad-leafed plants , but the bloodhunters found their way in . He would sit up with a roar of anger and scatter his bedding and strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become strangely quiet , realizing that he was defenseless . One evening he hit upon another plan to protect himself . Lying in a sheltered spot with his back to a big tree , he drew Murah against him , intending to use her as a covering while he slept . She did not understand at once what he had in mind and she was obedient to his will until mosquitoes made her frantic ; but when she moved to withdraw , Wuh howled at her and drew her against him . She struck him then and leapt up , scolding ; and Wuh , as if feeling rather mean and selfish , looked up at her with an expression on his face that resembled a foolish grin . During these weeks spent in deep jungle they were both driven to experiment , but it was Murah who devised the most adequate protection . Sitting , and drawing her feet under her , she would bend forward , with her face against the earth , and pile leaves around her head ; and then she would burrow her hands into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her cheeks . In this cramped position she slept . Observing what she did , Wuh walked several times around her , studying her position ; whereupon he dropped to the earth at her side and copied her way of protection . But he did not sleep . Murah had a heavy growth of hair on  | her skull ; Wuh , in comparison with her , was almost bald . The leeching parasites raised welts on his head and infected him with fever . He became ill . The constant rain and the miasma of the jungle depressed and saddened him , and for many days he was a sick and disconsolate man . During this time Murah served him faithfully . When not eating , or sleeping from exhaustion , she sat by him under a shelter which she had made and brushed the swarming insects away from him ; and while thus engaged she would look at him with grave and motherly concern . Men were restless and fretful , and in sickness they often indulged in self-pitying tantrums , behaving as if convinced that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Or they sulked and despaired as if appointed for death . But patience was part of a woman 's heritage . The periodic distress of her menses or of pregnancy , the pain of childbearing , and the watchful care of offspring had taught her to be stoical in the face of illness and to be philosophic about the slow crawl of time . For Murah , Wuh , during his sickness , was a foolish and petulant child . She did not regard him with ironic amusement ; but neither , on the other hand , did she believe he was half as sick as he pretended to be . He had a cold , to be sure , and he sniffled and coughed and moaned . He was alternately flushed and chilled . He refused to eat , or even to try to eat , any but the juiciest things she fetched to him . For the most part his large brown eyes gazed at her with lambent melancholy , as if he wondered whether she knew he was sitting on the threshold of death and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day he stared at a huge mosquito that stood as if propped on one of his fingers , its bloated belly a dull red .  | He indicated the pest to Murah as if he were too feeble to do more ; and at once she slapped it . Then Wuh , with the same owlish despair , looked at the blood stain . He smeared a finger with the blood and touched it to his tongue . Out of his hair he plucked a fragment of mosquito and ate it . Then , as if to avenge himself before dying , he caught several of the creatures and fed them into his mouth . He looked around him and picked up a wandering beetle and a crane fly and ate those too . This perverse industry seemed to brighten his spirits . To his diet , later in the day , he added more mosquitoes , a few moths , and a huge morpho butterfly . Whether he liked the flavor of them , or ate them because he imagined they were trying to devour him , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Murah went away and found a nest and fetched to him three small eggs . Such delicacies as eggs Wuh had eaten before . He took the eggs one by one as if counting them and laid them by him under the shelter ; and then he laid one on a palm and slowly crushed it and licked the juices off his hand , eating shell and all . He ate the other two and added to them some tender vegetable growth which Murah had also brought . He ate all of these things with a sad and melancholy thoroughness , his eyes meanwhile looking at Murah as if to ask what she thought of him . Murah thought he did very well . She was so delighted that she ran away to find other delicacies , including more eggs and a whole armful of bamboo ; but when she returned , Wuh was a most dejected and cheerless fellow . His dinner of vegetables and insects and eggs had been too much for his stomach . He had ejected the whole unsavory mess and was staring gloomily at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed his spew away and sat by him , determined that he should eat again . When , after offering him a bamboo shoot , he turned away in disgust , she moved upon him and crushed it against his mouth and tried to shove it down his throat . She broke an egg against his bared teeth and the juices of it spilled down over his breast . With a howl of wrath he moved away and turned to look at her as if she were trying to feed him poison . Their gaze met and for a long moment they looked at one another . In Wuh 's eyes were distaste and self-pity and anger . In Murah 's was the anxious kindness of a mother who was trying to cure a sick child . Then his attention was caught by the egg juices on his breast and he dipped at them with a finger and licked his finger ; but when Murah proffered other edibles he barked and snarled and behaved as if she were wantonly torturing him . Intuitively wise in the ways of the male , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the notion that everything done for him he did himself . He cleaned the egg off and ate it , and presently he ate other things and looked round him more cheerfully . Watching her closely , as if he had to be on guard against her destructive whims , he ate a little of the green stuff , paused meditatively to pick off and crush between his teeth a bloated mosquito , and then stared at the rain like one who was trying to decide whether to die or live . And all the while , hovering near , ready to assist , but giving him his way in all things , Murah studied in his face the expressions of delight and disgust and wonder that she saw there . Then she withdrew to lay more leaves on his shelter . A roof for herself she made a few yards away . Though
