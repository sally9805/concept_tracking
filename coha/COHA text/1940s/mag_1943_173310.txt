One year ago , on the German Heroes ' Memorial Day ( March 15 ) , Adolf Hitler told his people : " The Bolshevik hordes , which could not be defeated this winter by the German soldiers . . . will in the coming summer be crushed to utter destruction . " Last week , Heroes ' Memorial Day was postponed without explanation . <P> No bulletin from Berchtesgaden , no communique from the Reich Chancellery told the German people and the world where Adolf Hitler was . He had not spoken or made any public appearance for four months and a half ( a few public statements had been read for him ) . The U.S. State Department had seen reports that Hitler had suffered a complete nervous breakdown , added that these reports were wholly unconfirmed . Stockholm reported that a famed brain surgeon , Professor Herbert Olivecrona , had been in Germany to treat an important patient . <P> From a neutral government with representatives in Berlin , London heard that the Fuhrer was suffering from mental depression . That much , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
