You may be interested to know that one country in the world now has as many English-speaking readers of TIME per capita as the U.S. That country is Canada . This generous acceptance of an American news publication by another country had its beginning in 1924 ( TIME 'S second year of publication ) , when 172 copies were sold in Canada . In 1928 circulation had reached 1,000 ; in 1936 , 9,000 ; today it is 108,000 . These subscribers and newsstand buyers get their own edition , TIME Canadian , which is the same as TIME 'S U.S. edition except for a maple leaf insigne on the cover , three full pages of Canadian news , and its own advertising directed to the Canadian market . <P> Unlike TIME 'S three other International editions , which are published by TIME-LIFE International for readers in 178 countries and possessions outside the U.S. , TIME Canadian has not had to struggle with transportation difficulties , censorship , bans , dollar shortages , import restrictions , iron curtains , and a host of other problems . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most Canadian readers by the time U.S. readers get theirs . <P> With the advent of TIME 'S Canadian edition in 1943 , we established a permanent news bureau in Ottawa . Since that time , as TIME Canadian 's circulation and advertising volume have more than doubled , our Canadian coverage has grown steadily . We now have additional bureaus in Montreal and Toronto plus 26 string correspondents who are high-ranking journalists on Canadian newspapers . This Dominion-wide network of reporters represents an increasing effort to get the best possible coverage of the news in Canada . <P> <P> Over the years we have learned a good deal about our Canadian readers . They include all of Canada 's 20 cabinet ministers , Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent , Skater Barbara Ann Scott , and businessmen like Edward P. Taylor , president of Argus Corp. , etc . A majority of them are businessmen , of whom 75% are executives . More than 75% of all our readers in Canada live in cities . <P> Those who live beyond the reach of fast surface mail get their copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news while it is still fresh . For instance , eight copies go via Canadian Pacific Air Lines to subscribers in Aklavik above the Arctic Circle in the Northwest Territories near the Beaufort Sea , where Subscriber J. C. Callaghan claims that not even good radio contact can be guaranteed . Other copies are flown to subscribers like George Pinsky at Fort Resolution on Great Slave Lake in the District of Mackenzie , across the lake to Gordon D. Scram-stad in Yellowknife , and farther north to D. E. Webster in Good Hope . <P> In my Letters of February 28 , March 21 and April 11 , I discussed our three other International editions : the Latin American , printed in Jersey City ; the Atlantic , printed in Paris for Europe , the Middle East and Africa ; the Pacific , printed in Honolulu and Tokyo for the Far East and Pacific areas . This Letter on TIME Canadian completes the story of TIME 'S International editions . <P> <P> Cordially yours ,                @ @ @ @ @
