Other utilitymen did not point to it with pride . Utility-baiters called it an octopus . Roly-poly Utilitycoon Howard Colwell Hopson and his partner , John I. Mange , called it Associated Gas &; Electric Co . <P> The assets of the system were listed at about $7,000,000 in 1922 , when they bought control of it . Flashing an ear-to-ear grin , but keeping his own counsel , close-mouthed Howard Hopson reached far &; wide . By 1938 , Associated had bought or formed some 500 corporations . The top of the pyramid had been jacked far into the sky as Builder Hopson shoved more operating companies into the base , inserted sub-holding companies near its apex . At one time , some bottom operating companies had to feed through eleven layers to get their tribute to the capstone . Today Associated 's assets are booked at more than $1,000,000,000 . After attempts at simplification , it still has 18 holding companies , stacked as deep as six layers , a bewildering complexity of operating companies . Total number of corporations in the system : 172 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease more than a year ago , keeping Associated in a pyramid had become a prodigious balancing act . The Hopson " service " companies had siphoned off too much of the system 's fat in better times . The Hopson lawyers , who had al ways kept one jump ahead of the Government in playing hide- &-seek; among the hundreds of interlocking subsidiaries , got to the end of their legal inventions . When , in November , SEC ruled that registered holding companies and their subsidiaries could no longer draw dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without permission , must draw on earnings or go without , the writing was on the wall . <P> Month ago J. I. Mange , longtime president and chairman of Associated , stepped down , was succeeded by veteran Washington Lawyer Roger Joseph Whiteford . Mr. Whiteford , who makes annual lectures on the trial of Christ , was providentially reading a tome on the mathematics of the pyramid about the time Associated called . He was hired at $10,000 a month , but it was not certain whether he would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $26,500,000 loan to Associated 's sub-subsidiary NY PA NJ Utilities Co . ( Nypan ) , unless SEC allowed Associated 's No. 1 subsidiary ( Associated Gas &; Electric Corp. ) to pass $557,000 up to the top of the pyramid as dividends or as interest on a note for $71,800,000 Associated was headed for bankruptcy . <P> Last week RFC and SEC spoke out . The answer in both cases was no . RFC refused its loan . SEC ruled that the No. 1 subsidiary could not pay Associated the necessary sum because it had not been earned . This decision Mr. Whiteford had seen coming because he well knew that SEC was more concerned about Associated 's operating and sub-holding companies ( with outstanding securities of $539,139,000 in the hands of the public ) than it was about Associated at the top of the heap .
