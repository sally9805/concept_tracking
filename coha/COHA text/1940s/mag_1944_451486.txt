two words " fame " and " fashion " begin with the same two letters ; after that , they have not a letter in common . And what is true of their spelling is true also of what they stand for : fame and fashion have very little in common . What makes a writer fashionable is not what makes him famous ; in a good many cases a writer would probably have achieved fame , had all ? or most ? of the elements which made him fashionable been loft out . It would be going too far to say that a writer owed his fashion , his popularity , to all his bad qualities , and to none of his good ; but it is very generally true that some , at least , of the qualities which helped him to fashion are not the qualities which add luster to his fame in after years . They had been better away . Let us take some instances from the day before yesterday ? the Victorian Age , which , during the last generation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that day ( famous and fashionable ) were Dickens and Tennyson . Now there can be very little doubt that the popularity of Dickens was enormously enhanced by the way he played down to the intellect of his readers ? ho was sedulously " low-brow . " Dickens is never difficult to understand ? he is always terribly easy . He dots the i 's and crosses the is of his characters not once but a dozen times . And where his rich humor wears thin ( as it sometimes dpes ) , he carries on with an arch facetiousness and a heavy-handed exaggeration of statement which not merely require no effort of the intellect , for their appreciation , but require that the intellect shall be temporarily nonexistent , or dormant , to make them at all credible , or tolerable . Take for instance the letter written by Fanny Squeers to Ralph Nickleby after Nicholas has thrashed her father . Blind admirers of Dickens regard that letter as a masterpiece of humor .

We are in a state of mind beyond everything , and my pa is one mask of brooses both blue and green likewise two forms are steepled in his Goar . We were kim polled to have him carried down into the kitchen where he now lays . You will judge from this that he has been brought very low . When your nevew that you recommended for a teacher had done this to my pa and jumped upon his body with his feet and also langwedge which I will not pollewt my pen with describing , he assaulted my ma with dreadful violence , dashed her to the earth , and drove her back comb several inches into her head . A very little more and it must have entered her skull . We have a medical certifiket that if it had , the tortershell would have affected the brain .

My pa begs that if he comes to you the ring may be returned , and that you will let the thief and assassin go , as if we prosecuted him he would only be transported , and if he is let go he is sure to be hung before long which will save us trouble and be much more satisfactory . Hoping to hear from you when convenient I remain Yours and cetrer FANNY SQUEERB P.S. I pity his ignorance and despise him . Now , as I say , blind admirers of Dickens do not in their pious blindness regard that performance as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a gem ; and its postscript ( which by itself is not so bad ) has passed into the currency of our language . Why is it , then , that I find it so painful an exhibition of unscrupulous pandering to the cheapest sense of humor ? In ultra-burlesque , incredible statements are permissible ? they are part of the game ; but in comedy and in novels some relation to real life is demanded . And when Fanny says that she is screaming all the time that she writes , and that her mother 's back comb was driven several inches into her head , and a little more and it would have entered her skull ? well , as a bit of isolated extravaganza you may be able to laugh at it . But as part of a letter possible to be written by an angry young woman whose father has been assaulted ? it simply wo n't wash : it is so absolutely unreal and so abysmally silly . It is supposed to represent a character prone to exaggerate ; but Dickens is not artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it incredible . Dickens discovered that he could get the cheap laugh from scores of thousands of his countrymen ; and he yielded to the temptation . It helped his popularity , but it has not helped his fame . Another of his popular qualities was his sentiment , as expressed in the deaths of Paul Dombey , Little Nell , Dora , and other small fry , whose dyings were a delight to the Victorian Age ? but delight us less now . Dickens is famous because he created a collection of characters of extraordinary vividness and variety , which remain alive in spite of , and not because of , his absurd exaggerations about them . And because his rich sense of life was infectious , he made his readers feel that ( filled though it was with the bad and the indifferent as well as the good ) life was abounds ugly worth while . Not a sense of beauty , but a sense of vitality , of exuberant spirits , is what we get from Dickens , in full measure pressed down , and bubbling up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less of a sentimentalist , he would have been just as famous in the present day , but less fashionable in his own . Then take Tennyson . When Tennyson came into literary being , he was adored by a small group of sensitively cultured minds ; but the older critics disliked him . A highly educated Don of Cambridge said , " Tennyson is poetry gone mad . " Curiously , after his death , the charge against Tennyson was that he was " poetry gone tame . " And it is quite true that in the interval much of his poetry , in spite of ( perhaps because of ) its technical delicacy and polish , had gone tame . Tennyson achieved his popularity , his fashion , by a taming process , which luckily did not infect all his poems . It infected " The May Queen , " " The Princess , " " Enoch Arden , " " Idylls of the King . " It did not seriously infect " In Memoriam " ( which was a far bolder poem for its time than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infect at all his best short lyrics , or " Maud , " or certain other pieces that one could name . But " Maud " with Tennyson 's contemporaries was never popular  --  it was deprecated as morbid , hysterical , and unwholesome . And it is only within the last few years that a Neo-Georgian poet , Mr. Humbert Wolfe , has come along to assert boldly that " Maud " is Tennyson 's finest poem and h s surest claim ( outside his lyrics and a few other pieces ) to permanent fame . What made Tennyson fashionable was not what has re-established his fame . It was not on " Idylls of the King " that his reputation recovered from the slump that lasted for a few decades after his death . The only one of the Idylls which keeps its hold is " The Passing of Arthur , " which ho cribbed largely from Malory , and made a very beautiful poem . One of Tennyson 's faults was that he was so self-consciously polished in his diction that sometimes he could not call a spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of King Arthur 's mustache , he called it " the knightly growth that fringed his lips . " And his Victorian readers thought that was poetic . ( It is curious that poets talk freely of a man 's beard , but not of his mustache or of his whiskers . I do n't know why : it simply is not done . Similarly a lover will invite his " Nita , Juanita , " to lean upon his breast , but not upon his chest . ) So , with the weight of tradition against it , perhaps one ought not to be too hard upon Tennyson for being so wordily evasive of mentioning King Arthur 's mustache ? though " bearded lip " would have been more straightforward and sensible . 2 SOME writers , of course , are in a way " fashionable " ? the vogue of a certain set ? without achieving popularity in the larger sense . Swinburne was never popular ; but he was once very much the vogue . He is less so today . That is not to say that Swinburne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that the degree of his fame is by no means yet settled . But it was with some amazement that I heard , not many years ago , a man of brilliant critical discrimination ( himself a poet ) say that he would not be surprised if , eventually , Christina Rossetti took higher place than Swinburne . And it amazed me , not because I do not think highly of Christina Rossetti myself , ? she attracts me more deeply than Swinburne , ? but because it seemed so unlikely that a general estimate of cultured minds could bo so drastically reversed ; yet there was a critic of penetration , sensitive to the higher values of poetry , saying that it might be so . He may be wrong ; but he may be right . We ca n't tell . And in the inability of even highly cultured minds to be independent of vogue and fashion , there is something of a mystery . It seems that fame is necessarily a product of the ages : that it can not be conferred with certainty by one generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicative gift from age to age to make us more sure of ourselves in giving right judgments concerning fame . For fashionable judgments we can rely entirely on ourselves . If you look through the history of literature , with its contemporary judgments , you will be able to pick out great names which would have died and been buried , had their final disposal been in the hands of their contemporaries . And many names ( little considered today ) would have been foisted upon us as great , had the voice of contemporary approval been able to decide the matter , But it was not . It never will be . Therefore , in delivering our dictums of blessing or cursing on the upstarts of fashion , let us remember that those judgments are not likely to be final ; and with caution ( avoiding arrogance ) be courteous toward experiments which are not popular . For what becomes easily popular seldom lasts . In my own day I have seen reputations go up like a rocket and come down like the stick . But what is worth notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were vouched for by most of our leading critics in poetry and literature . The 1890 's were eager to discover a poet of the first rank ( and I still think that some really fine work was then produced ) . But somehow , most of it lacked staying power . Possibly hereafter some of it may be retrieved and single pieces may have fame accorded them . For we have , in poetry , instances of single poems to which the rank of fame has been rightly given , where almost everything else by the same writer is forgotten except by students . And of those single poems , one can say confidently that they are first-rate ? that , of their kind , nothing has been better done . Take , for instance , Drayton , whose " Agincourt " is a well-known poem of good but not tremendous quality . But Drayton wrote one sonnet which ranks with the sonnets of Shakespeare and higher than all Milton 's sonnets except his very best . Take another poet ? John Donne . John Donne never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has written passages of love poetry , and of religious poetry , which are unbeaten in their intensity of bitter and sweet emotion combined . Yet it is only in the last generation that Donne 's intellectual stature among the poets has been fully recognized . And there is more likelihood of that belated appreciation 's being well-founded than had it been accorded in his own day . Between then and now , so great an authority as Pope belittled him ; and Doctor Johnson had not much to say for him of good . 3 AND having mentioned Pope , I have mentioned a writer who was once tremendously the fashion ; but whose fame is not now ( and never will be ) so great as fashion once made it . Nevertheless ho remains ( quite worthily within his limitations ) a very considerable figure in English literature . There are signs today of an attempt to " boost " Pope back into a higher rank among the immortals than his qualities warrant ; and I do n't wonder that the untidiness of our present school of poetry should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by force of contrast ) for those whom untidiness repels . Yes , polish ? expert tidiness ? was one of Pope 's pre-eminent qualities . Now , as parody is a good short-cut for getting in with one 's criticism ( the " Two Voices " parody of Wordsworth by J. K. Stephens is one of the best criticisms of him that I know ) , perhaps a little parody may help to indicate one of the defects of Pope 's qualities . And so I have tried to write a small poem in that manner of delicate balance and perfect sobriety which formed so large a part of the recipe for writing poetry which Pope imposed on the Augustan Age . In thinking of Pope in terms of parody ? a seesaw ( his admirers will be horrified to hear ) came at once to my mind . And my thought was : " If Pope had set himself to rewrite See-saw , Margery Daw , ' how would he have done it ? " I suggest that he would have done it ( far better no doubt ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines will have told you , I imagine , why , when one comes to parody Pope , one thinks of a seesaw . I think his mother must have swung daily on a seesaw while she was expecting him . Can a seesaw become a vehicle of genius ? It can ; and Pope is the exponent of that extraordinary fact . You may despise the seesaw as an instrument of locomotion ; but you can not despise Pope . Nevertheless you can place him ( where he has placed himself , with a gusto which shows how thoroughly the instrument satisfied him ) on the seesaw and can watch him exercising himself upon it by the hour . Look at this : it is from the poem selected in the Oxford Book of English Verse as representing Pope at his best : - In that poem of eighty-two lines , dedicated to the death of an unfortunate lady , I can only find fourteen of genuinely inspired and moving poetry . And that does not seem to me the proportion due from is great poet when he composes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , not only is the mechanism , though skillful , too obvious for spontaneity of feeling to survive , but the sentiment itself does not bear examination ; for , in spite of the statement , " Thy fate unpitied , and thy rites unpaid , " we find , in the concluding lines , that the rites were abundantly paid by foreign hands , and her fate abundantly pitied by strangers . If Pope had really meant us to be heart-wrung , he would have accentuated the indifference with which strangers buried her . But having given grief a graceful turn , Pope is satisfied . Now if you can convince yourselves that above a quarter of that poem is more than polished artifice , you will think me unfair , and will be the readier to agree with those who rate him more highly . But I should run some risk of unfairness in any case , if I based my criticism on one poem alone . I turn for further illustration , not to less considered examples , but to another of his most famous poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take the following from the impassioned address of Eloisa to her absent lover , Abelard ? which gave ( in Pope 's words ) " so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature , virtue and passion " : ? That is the " lively " picture as Popo presents it : a sparkling performance , tersely phrased , brilliant in diction . But does it really touch your emotions ? And now for my last example ? the brilliance of which I think nobody can dispute : here is Pope doing the thing he was meant to do , and using his recipe , touching it with sharp , delicate flavors , like the chef that he was : ? Now that is top-notch ; and it is , of its kind , perfect form . Why ? Because it is a satirical attack . Because it is incisive ; because it is giving a series of short sharp stabs ; because , for dexterity , a stab must be short , sharp , and quick . If it 's long , it 's blundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup de gthee which closes the account . And that is why , for this sort of thing , Pope 's device of couplets ( each couplet containing two antitheses ) is a perfect device . But it descends into mechanism when he tries to apply it to the softer emotions , or to continue , for page after page , what should be kept to give climax and clinch to the venomous sentiments which God sent him into the world to express ? better than any other poet I know . And in order to show you just how , to my mind , this system of antithesis becomes a second-rate thing when removed from satire to sentiment , I take the most antithetical passage from Shakespeare that I can remember , and translate from the manner of Shakespeare into the manner of Popo : ? For that sort of thing Pope 's method imposes shackles which even the genius of Pope ( so ready of wit , so quick in turn of phrase ) is unable to escape . 4 FROM Pope , too highly esteemed in his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite : one of the most remarkable examples in English literature of contemporary neglect , followed , after a very considerable interval , by fame . In 1927 the centenary of William Blake 's death was commemorated by the unveiling of a tablet to his memory in St. Paul 's Cathedral . To the critics of his own day , Blake ? long-lived , frugal , in dustrious , but poverty-stricken ? was not merely " poetry gone mad " : he was mad , nothing else . The charge of madness was allowed to wipe out from the comprehension of his contemporaries ( except a very few : Charles Lamb and Wordsworth were two of them ) any critical sense of the extraordinary beauty and value of his poems and paintings . And even fifty years ago , when I edited a selection of his writings and poems , a leading critic , Mr. Andrew Lang , began his review of it with the words : " It is the mark of a clique to admire Blake . " It was true enough then ? if the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult today to find anyone of serious literary standing who , whatever ho thought of Blake 's sanity , failed to recognize the rare and high qualities of his genius . The lifelong neglect and dislike of Blake by his contemporaries brings up the question of the effect of environment and of contemporary modes of thought and fashion on a man 's work ? the work of a man of genius . I once heard a lecturer make the acute remark that , had Shakespeare lived in the reign of George H , ho could not have been anything like the Shakespeare we know ; he could not have produced so well or so spontaneously . For a man of his temperament the age would have been out of joint ; and his genius could only have revealed itself with difficulty . That unpropitious atmosphere would either have damped down , or exacerbated , the workings of his brain . Undoubtedly that did happen to Blake . He suffered from his environment . His age would not have him ; and , as a consequence , he rebelled against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things extravagantly , to annoy and puzzle a generation which ( from his point of view ) was extraordinarily stupid . The unimaginative assault and battery which was paid out to Blake by that unreceptive age ( and paid back by him more imaginatively in explosive fireworks , which still do his fame some harm ) was also , in a certain sense , directed by that same age against Shakespeare . But Shakespeare was dead , so it did not affect him ; it only affected his work in the way it was published and presented during the eighteenth century . The mangling and " improvement , " to suit contemporary taste , of Shakespeare 's plays had begun under the Restoration ; and during the eighteenth century it went on . Why ? For the simple reason that Shakespeare and the eighteenth century had not the same sense of beauty , or the same sense of truth , or the same sense of life 's values . " Exuberance is Beauty " said Blake . " Exuberance is bad taste " said the eighteenth century . And Shakespeare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , was exuberant . The eighteenth century had the defects of its qualities ; it could n't help it . Shakespeare had also the defects of his qualities ; but they were better qualities . And so , to an age which did not especially value those qualities , they were not merely a falling-short of the perfection aimed at : they were " in bad taste . " 5 WHAT else did the eighteenth century dislike , or wish to make different ? Its undervaluation of Shakespeare was not likely to stand alone . And it did n't . Not only was the eighteenth the century which least understood Shakespeare , being least in sympathy with all that Shakespeare stood for : it was also lacking in understanding of two other great influences of the past Christianity and Gothic architecture . John Wesley had nothing in common with the cold culture of the age in which he lived : his living Christianity seemed shockingly out of taste . Similarly out of taste , Gothic architecture had become a curiosity : like Christianity , people preferred to see it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with . Horace Walpole 's reconstruction of Gothic in a toy version for his own domestic amusement was no more than a pet fancy ? on a par with the contemporary " tapestries " which Miss Lindley worked in imitation of oil paintings , and framed into pictures . This being the taste of the age , we find that at the theater King Lear was made tolerable by being given a happy ending . And Garrick 's acting versions of other plays afford an accurate measure ( in their departure from the text ) of the separation between Shakespeare and the eighteenth century . Two of its most prominent characters passed judgments on him which are representative enough to be worth quoting . " Was there ever such stuff as Shakespeare wrote ? " exclaimed George III irritably ; while Doctor Johnson declared that you could not find anywhere in Shakespeare six consecutive lines of good poetry . And yet Doctor Johnson had a great mind ? was , indeed , a most sensible person ; and if he sometimes said foolish things , those foolish things nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . There was , therefore , something the matter , either with Shakespeare or with the eighteenth century , to cause this critical coldness , in a great mind so representative of its age , to the form of Shakespeare 's poetry : Johnson did not question his greatness . That matter was ( as I have already said ) that their defects ran in opposite directions . The eighteenth century was overcorrect in its literary conventions ? too much ruled by rule , and too limited in vision , to be able to think or write freely . Shakespeare , on the other hand , had no use for correctness ; he followed no rule , obeyed an almost limitless vision , was careless of scholarship , and had an exuberant love of human nature , which he expressed on a heroic scale . A. E. Housman , a critic for whom I have a natural respect , comparing the perfections of Milton with the imperfections of Shakespeare , said that Milton was a great artist , and that Shakespeare was not : that Shakespeare lacked Milton 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fine scholarly mind . I am not scholarly ; and perhaps it is for that reason that I am inclined to retort : " Who but a pedant wants sobriety from Shakespeare ? " Had Shakespeare expressed himself with sobriety , how much of Shakespeare would have remained ? But from the Restoration period onward , producers of Shakespeare for the stage were constantly trying to reduce him to sobriety , by pruning down the too exuberant language of his characters . And so , when Macbeth ( his overwrought speech expressive of an overwrought mind ) cries out to the messenger of Doom : ? Davenant comes along , and reduces the phrase to " sobriety " by making Macbeth say : " Now , Friend , what means thy change of countenance ? " And the character of Macbeth and the state of Macbeth 's mind ? sacrificed to sobriety of statement ? become , for the moment , nonexistent . Macbeth is wiped off the stage . But though Shakespeare often indulged in overwrought phrases , with less excellent dramatic excuse than in the instance I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form which helped to produce a cumulati en effect . You hear a passage of Shakespeare at his worst : it is still in the Shakespeare style of big utterance ; it remains consistent , of a piece , with Shakespeare at his best ? with the scale , that is to say , on which Shakespeare molded his characters and gave them accompanying speech . But ( and here is the clue to the dramatic value of Shakespeare 's range of style ) you might hear a short , specially selected passage of Shakespeare , and not know that it was Shakespeare , unless you came on it in its dramatic setting ; and then ? if you were intelligent ? you would say ( not because of its form , which might beextraordinarily stark and simple , but because of the greatness of its invention for the place in which you found it ) that nobody but Shakespeare could have thought of it ? just there . Take , for instance , this :  --  Disjointed from its setting , it 's nothing : there is no style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even bad verse ? bald , uneventful , monotonous . But in its place , in that last scene when Lear is dying with Cordelia dead in his arms , it becomes a tremendous invention , a thing of absolute genius . Out of that general background of large utterance to which he scales his characters comes now and then this utter poignancy of the vox human , stark and stripped of ornament , terse , direct , simple . That is what Shakespeare 's form leads up to ? to moments when mere form disappears and the very simplest thing that can be said has a tremendous significance : pure human nature emerges pinnacled in tragedy ? brought to an ultimate simplicity that is more revealing of the springs of being than any ornament of imagery or rhetoric however grand . 6 THE actual range of Shakespeare 's form is , therefore , very wide ? from the most elaborate language to the most simple ; and it has that range for dramatic reasons , not for mere literary . That is a point which critics sometimes miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more important than literary value ; and Shakespeare , being a dramatic artist , is the greater artist because his form varies . In some of his great scenes " sobriety " would be out of place . It is nonsense to demand it . To go back , then , to this question of the separation which , had arisen between the mind of Shakespeare and the mind of the eighteenth century ? - how did it arise ? How should one define it ? One might account for a great deal of it its a single word : " enthusiasm . " Shakespeare , in his exuberance , was of an enthusiastic temperament : the eighteenth century was not . The very word had , for the eighteenth century , a reprobate meaning . I terms to an eighteenth-century dictionary , and there I find " Enthusiasm : a vain belief of private revelation ; a vain confidence of Divine favour ; heat of imagination . " " Enthusiast : one who vainly imagines a private revelation ; one who has a vain confidence of his intercourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only reluctantly , as a last alternative , that the more favorable definition is conceded : " One of elevated fancy , or exalted ideas . " The earlier definition has etymology behind it ; but the word " vain " is opprobriously thrown in without any etymological justification whatever . So , perhaps , to many cultured minds of the eighteenth century , Shakespeare was a " vain fellow , " a man who , by his enthusiastic language , showed that he had a vain confidence of his intercourse with God , in terms of beauty . Now if Shakespeare needs any excuse for the exuberance of his language ( the high key in which he pitched most of his dramatic dialogue ) , it should be remembered that he was doing on the plastic stage of his own day what in the pictorial stage of our day is not so much required . Shakespeare 's dramatic figures stood out on a platform-stage , without scenery , and practically without background , with the audience on three sides of it . And the whole of his atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actors . When they spoke , they provided their own scenery , which we now provide for them . They had to do a good deal more ( when they spoke ) than actors have to do nowadays in order to give the setting . They carried the scenery on their backs , as it were , and spoke it in words . That condition alone made it impossible for Shakespearean drama to be naturalistic in form . But it did aim at giving you human nature . The large utterance of Shakespeare 's characters tends to give them a larger scale , enabling the actors to hold the stage in the difficult circumstances of having so much more than themselves to express . And this particular condition of the Elizabethan stage suited the exuberant temperament of Shakespeare : he adapted himself to it con amore . But were you to ask me if there was not also a fashion in Shakespeare 's day which made merely for popularity , and which has done some harm , if not to Shakespeare 's fame , to the form in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say yes . Shakespeare 's plays would have been better than they are , more acceptable , more completely appealing to the mind of posterity , had they not been affected ? adversely affected ? by certain fashions of his own day . Certain things which then made for popularity give them a certain unreality now . They are less convincing , less satisfying to us , because they accepted certain rather cheap conventions , devices , and makeshifts which the public of his day liked and were always ready to swallow whole . The public of his day liked ghosts : they demanded them ; if you had a murder , you almost always had to have a ghost also . Without the ghost ( if it was the murder of an important person ) the murder was not complete . You have a curious instance of that in Webster 's The White Devil or Vittoria Cormrthona , The wife of one of the characters has been murdered . The husband , who does not know it , begins thinking of her . Immediately her ghost enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he does not know that the ghost is there at all . But the author wants the audience to know ; and so , there the ghost stands , while in soliloquy he talks about his wife . And when he has done talking of her , the ghost goes again . It is quite silly ; but the fashion of that day required that sort of thing , and got it  - -  got it from Shakespeare along with the rest . And sometimes ( not always ) Shakespeare 's ghosts Would be better away . We could do better without them . Another contemporary stage fashion of Shakespeare 's day which has become unreal to us is the comedy ? or the tragedy ? carried to fantastic lengths , of mistaken identity , two people exactly alike ; sometimes a boy and a girl  --  twins . Of course on the Shakespearean stage both actors were boys , which made it just a shade more possible . But though we accept that stage convention today , for the sake of laughter , it is not in the least convincing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , acceptable , and readily swallowed by all playgoers , Shakespeare would hardly have condescended to it , although in comedy the fairy-tale element in which the play is cast may give it a sort of rightness . But when you have similar devices of mistaken identity in tragedy , the result is sometimes lamentable in its mock make-believe . ? Take for instance the play Cymbeline , which contains one of the loveliest of Shakespeare 's female characters ? Imogen . But that play is almost ruled out for modern audiences by the crude and clumsy device of Cloten 's headless body left a nasty mess for Imogen to weep over . And because the body wears the clothes of her husband , she proceeds to identify him , with a particularity which leaves one gasping at the nonsensicalness of an age which could swallow such stuffing devoid of all reason : Murder in Heaven ! ' T is nonsense ! Here you have a devoted wife , examining the anatomy of another man , piece by piece , and swearing it to be her husband 's , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " And with an Elizabethan audi ' ence that sort of thing ( in spite of its wild improbability ) went down . They liked it . We do n't . As for Titus Andronicus , that orgy of bloodshed and mutilation ? I do n't know what the latest scholars say about it ; for myself , I devoutly hope that Shakespeare did n't write it . 7 THERE you get two instances of the bad effects of fashion on the great literature of its day . We meet with them , it is true , in plays one of which is negligible and the other a work which , in spite of its many beauties , does not take decisive rank . But I will give you instances from two of Shakespeare 's finest plays , where it seems to me that fashion has imposed on him a stage device which had been better away . In Julius Caesar , in the tent scene ( after the quarrel with Cassius , and the military discussion and the Boy 's song that follow ) , Caesar 's ghost appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it is done exceedingly well . But I can not help feeling that Brutus was not the sort of character to see ghosts visibly . Indeed his way of dealing with the ghost when it appears shows a philosophic acceptance of the pass in which fate has landed him which the apparition does not trouble . Brutus needs no ghost for the stirring of his conscience or the rousing of his fears , for it does neither . But the audience of Shakespeare 's day did need it : so ? enter ghost ! Ghosts have another drawback for modern audiences , in addition to their frequent superfluousness . When the ghost appears and all see it alike ( as they do see It in the opening scene of Hamlet ) , then the apparition is consistent and the scene remains all of a piece . But in the scene between Hamlet and his mother ( when Hamlet sees it and she does not ) credibility is . If Horatio and the rest saw the ghost on the ramparts , why does not Hamlet 's mother see it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business ? Still I admit there is no possible getting rid of the ghost in Hamlet . But the other instance , to which I wish specially to call attention , is in that ghost-ridden tragedy , Macbeth . That play is , of course , so steeped in the supernatural ( in the scenes with the Witches , and in the whole machinery of doom foretold ) that ghostliness has its right setting . But in that play , there is one very effective scene where an apparition is described but remains invisible . I mean in Macbeth 's dagger-soliloquy , beginning : It is reported in the annals of the stage that at some time or another , upon the opening of that speech , it was customary for a material dagger to be let down from the flies , like bait to a fish , for Macbeth to bite on . Nobody would do anything so foolish today . The haunted state of Macbeth 's mind is better depicted if no dagger is there . But apply that ? I ask you to apply that same consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered Banquo comes and occupies the seat which is waiting for Macbeth . As the scene is written , nobody sees the ghost except Macbeth . Even Lady Macbeth , his partner in guilt , sees nothing . Now I am convinced that that scene would be very much more effective , and terrible , and haunting , if no ghost appeared ? if the chair were to remain vacant while Macbeth ( to the bewilderment of all present ) speaks to a ghost which only he sees . That , I believe , has beer done at the " Old Vic " in London ; and it is a thoroughly sensible thing to do . And I believe that Shakespeare would have done it , if he had not been tied down by the stage fashion of his day , which ? after a murder ? demanded on all possible occasions a visible ghost .
