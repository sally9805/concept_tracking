txt President Roosevelt said today that he agrees with the captions on two morning newspaper editorials which read " On Dangerous Ground " and " Mr. Wheeler Goes Tnn Far " He volunteered that observation at a press conference and this recalled the controversy between the Administration and Senator Burton K. Wheeler ( D ) of Montana , one of the severest critics of current foreign policy . Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson read a statement to reporters in Washington yesterday in which he assailed Senator Wheeler for distributing cards suggesting that the recipients ask the President and Congress to keep the country out of war . Some of the cards went to men in the Army , and Mr. Stimson said the Senator 's action " comes very near the line of subversive activities against the United States , if not treason . " Senator Wheeler acknowledged sending out a million cards , but denied that soldiers as such had been placed on the mailing list deliberately .                   @ @
