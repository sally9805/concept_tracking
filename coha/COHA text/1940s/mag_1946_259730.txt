Angels Who Drink Too Much Sirs : A number of letters and reports indicting the behavior of American troops in occupied countries-not a few of them signed by chivalric G.I.s-have been published in your periodical , without fear or favor . It would be unfair to deny the stand to a witness for the defense . <P> A friend of mine , a writer in northern Italy , who was in the anti-Fascist underground since 1931 , wrote soon after the liberation , asking about my wartime broadcasts to Italy , which he regretted to have missed . My answer was that there had been no such broadcasts ; all invitations from official or semi-official agencies I had declined , unwilling as I was to connive , even by implications alone , with an Anglo-American policy in Italy and Europe to which I strongly objected . <P> My friend replied ( Nov. 20 ) : " I can well understand your feelings about Anglo-American policy toward us . What should I say ? Accustomed as we were to Germans and Fascists , when we saw the British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-in shirt sleeves , clean , handsome , kind , they looked to us like angels on earth . The Americans especially have been very much liked in Italy for their cordiality and spontaneity . Their childishness and innocence , in contrast to the false brilliancy and self-styled cleverness of so many of my countrymen , was delightful to me . Pity that they drink too much . " <P> G. A. BORGESE Professor University of Chicago Chicago <P> <P> Third-Class Country ? <P> Sirs : In reference to Mr. Leroy Blodgett 's letter TIME , Dec. 3 , in which he accuses the U.S. of being a third-class country with first-class equipment . . . . Tell me , Mr. Blodgett . . . would you act differently after months and years of living under adverse conditions , common only to a war theater , and not to your comfortable home in Burlington , Vt. ? <P> You are a victim of a joke , my friend ; just walk down your own Main Street in your own town and count the drunks and smell the liquor ; does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it , why not the boys who bled and fought for you ? Instead of running down the American youth as you seem to delight in doing , you should thank your God that it is Americans running wild in Europe and not Nazis and Japs running wild in the U.S. . . . <P> ( Two SERVICEMEN 'S NAMES WITHHELD ) % Fleet Post Office San Francisco <P> Sirs : So , Mr. Leroy Blodgett , you will hate to see the faces of those five children of yours when they find out they live in a " third-class country " ? TIME LETTERS , Dec-3 . . . . America is one of the few spots left on earth where you may rear your five youngsters with the relative certainty that they will receive a liberal and democratic education ! <P> As for your charges against " a generation brought up on comic books , flabby popular music , " and motion pictures , it seems to me that that so-called unthinking generation just finished one of the toughest jobs in history , and do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! . . . <P> ( Sgt. ) JAMES R. STEPHENS % Postmaster San Francisco
