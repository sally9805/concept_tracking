ARMCHAIR AVIATORS , high-altitude radio commentators , and literary strategists have , in the last few months , managed to throw the public mind into a dither of doubt as to the value of our military aircraft . Their chief weapon has been comparison ? the quotation of figures which have made some of our planes appear third-rate . The public , untrained to weigh evidence in this highly technical field , has been given the wholly unwarranted impression that Uncle Sam is sending his air crews out to meet the enemy in inferior ships . The industry producing aircraft has been too busy to refute these comments ; the Army has rightly declined to reply to them . Both prefer to allow the military record of the nation 's aircraft to make its own answer . Unfortunately , however , the very information which would vindicate our military seers , designers , and builders happens to be of highly confidential nature . For the time being it is more valuable to the enemy than it is in the hands of the average layman . Perhaps it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yardstick against which he can measure the success or failure of the aircraft that are being produced for his protection . The fate of the world is being decided in the field of military conflict . The outcome of this conflict is , in a large measure , being  | decided by air power . The success of an air arm depends upon how well its aircraft are fitted to perform the tasks set for them by the pattern the conflict has taken . This fitness depends on how shrewdly our military planners guessed many months before . In a large measure , the Axis has lost a phase of this war , despite a measure of territorial success , owing to what was probably the worst guess in history . The Luftwaffe , originally , was a shortrange army co-operation machine geared to act as artillery over a front 50 to 150 miles deep . It rolled over Poland like a tidal wave . If it had kept going , it might have caught Russia with its air-power down . Instead , the tidal wave turned and swept over an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Luftwaffe ran into the first correct guess on the side of the United Nations ? the Hawker Hurricanes and the Supermarine Spitfires . In 1935 , Sir Hugh Dowding , Chief Air Marshal , called for open bids on a fast , rocket-climbing , eight-gun ship , capable of outspeeding and outmaneuvering anything on wings . Its rate of fire would make it poison to anything ' capable of operating over a longer range than its own . Virtually everything was sacrificed for speed , climb , and maneuverability and fire power . At the evacuation of Dunkirk and the bitter battle for Britain , the Luftwaffe measured up to the specifically ordered job only eight inches to the R.A.F. 's 12 on the ultimate scale of comparison . Swarms of aircraft invaded the island , only to be driven off . The early Junkers JU-87 , the Dornier DO-17  | and other models that carried the brunt of the early blitz were short-range aircraft . Their mechanical advantages had to be pared considerably to get them over England and the thousands of wrecked aircraft that littered the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goering had , in the homely words of the late Paddy " Finucane , " tried to eat soup with a knife . " How good have our guesses been ? How well are we prepared to fight the type of war that is unfolding , with equipment that had to be planned two or more years ago ? Ten or possibly 11 United States types sow in production will carry the weight of our part in the current conflict . Probably the most discussed and maligned of our types has been the Curtiss P-40 . This ship has , at times , been called the worst and the best guess of the entire war . Its design was laid down when no one knew quite what the war was going to turn out to be . The type has undergone seven alterations and modifications , each one a distinct improvement . It evolved as the work horse among United Nations single-seaters . Tactically , it is an advance-guard airplane . It is assigned to new operations where all-around performance is needed plus the ability to " take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front in this war where land-based aircraft have operated . They are selected because they are tough and can be thrown against anything the enemy has . Even if they are outperformed , they are " beefy " enough structurally to " duck for home , " bringing with them what special information is necessary to dictate the specialized aircraft or action needed " to replace them . They are easy to maintain . Simple , rugged design and structure have produced an airplane that is easy to service and repair . Major structural replacements , needed only when the ship is badly battered , can be accomplished with the most elementary tools . The , airframe requires virtually no attention . It is sealed and bonded against the ravages of sand , snow , and tropical rain . They can be staked outdoors for months on end . A mechanic who serviced the type in the Philippines , where airplanes are known to disintegrate outdoors , said that all the P-40 needed was gas , oil , and a few kind words and it would keep running forever . Justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box score wherever the P-40 went . In the Philippines , a handful of them cost Japan over five ships for each P-40 in combat . Here they acted as fighters , scouts , photo ships , and even bombers . During the last days on Bataan , MacArthur 's mechanics stuck four P-40s together out of wrecks and spare parts , rigged them as bombers , and sent them out to sink 30,000 tons of shipping in Subic Bay . In China , their score was 3.9 to one , in Australia , 3.1 . In Russia they were the only craft capable of clearing the way for the Stormoviks , while in the Libyan desert they tackled tanks and bombed troop emplacements . Wherever the task assigned to it paralleled the original purpose of the fighter , the U. S. defense problem , it made every- thing else it encountered look ridiculous . The war in the desert belonged to U.S. types , for at those distances and under those conditions they were at home . Probably the prize dumb comparison in this war is that of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The over-all box score should have told the story ? 3.52 Japanese lost for every P-40 . In turn and rate of climb , certainly the Zero had an ample edge , but it paid plenty for the privilege . To begin with , the Zero weighs 4,750 pounds wringing wet . It carries neither armor nor a self-sealing tank . Its fuselage , from the cockpit back , is covered in a gauge of dural thinner than any rolled in the U. S. It had only a fraction of the number of instruments carried by the U.S. pilots , the flier wore no parachute , the general structural factor of safety was about 2.5 to 1 , differing from the 12-to-1 characteristic of our craft . Annodizing , to protect the ships from ravages of the weather , is virtually unknown . The Zeros are frequently unpainted and only a " dimmer " coat keeps the sun from making them a long-range target . Those who would like our men to fly this kind of a winged coffin are reminded of one thing . At the outset of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jap pilots would crash-dive their airplanes rather than allow them to be captured in examinable shape . This was a figment of the imagination . The truth of the matter was that the Zero was so frail , that any mishap in landing would practically roll the craft up into a ball . The Curtiss-Wright Corporation finally sank the " magnificent Zero " myth once and for all when they stripped thirteen hundred pounds of weight out of a P-40 ? spare guns , self-sealing tanks , instruments and the like . They reduced its armament and load to that of the Zero without impairing the P-40 's inherent structural strength . The experimental airplane , thus stripped , carrying a 180-pound pilot with his parachute ? and , toting a wing loading in excess of the Zero 's 20 pound per square foot , outclimbed , outturned , outmaneuvered and outfought the Zero on every one of the 11 basic categories of performance laid down by General Chennault and the Flying Tigers in China . The question arises , why are these airplanes fought carrying these heavy wing loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophies of the two nations . To the Japanese , the victory belongs to some abstract personage and the soldier . His individual existence means nothing . Providing for a better than even chance for the pilot is unheard of . Techni- cal experts who have examined the wreckage of the Zero state that its frailty made simply flying this craft an act of desperate heroism . Extreme gust acceleration found under thunderheads or similar meteorological conditions have been known to shake the Zero apart . We as a nation believe that the victory belongs to the individuals who make up the nation , the air crews among them . The victory is of little value to them if they do not survive to enjoy it . We choose to enhance our pilots ' chance of survival by every mechanical means at our disposal , leaving heroism to the individual choice . We simply do not elect to pay for that kind of performance with the safety of our flight crews . The ultimate justification for our philosophy of sacrificing the edge of performance for a margin of safety lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zero , carries self-sealing tanks , heavier general structure , etc . Despite 300 more horsepower , it is inferior to the original Zero on climb and turn . While human life is a small consideration to the Japanese high command , the number of men lost through structural weakness of the craft prompted a change . The Jap Air Staff guessed wrong ? the change admits it . The next in line for literary back-stabbing is the P-39 , the Bell Airacobra . From its inception , this child of scorn and wizardry had a lot of people disliking it . The pilot sat in front of the engine , the power was delivered in a U line down from the drive shaft , under the cockpit floor , and up to the propeller . Here it met the basic assumption of the Airacobra , the 37-mm. cannon , supported by two synchronized .50 caliber guns and four .30 's firing free outside the propeller arc . Changes may have  | been made in the general armament setup , the theory of building an airplane behind a gun had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets in front of it . The radical idea of putting the engine , the heaviest single piece of equipment in the whole airplane , smack on the center of lift and load was looked at with suspicion orthodox designers and air tacticians . Off-line power delivery looked uncertain , unreliable , and an invitation to maintenance trouble . Nevertheless , the guess was that somewhere an airplane would be needed that could blast its way into and out of formations of anything that flies . Larry Bell started with the idea that the best place to put an antiaircraft gun was on an airplane . The most important single advantage of the P-39 general design is that the size , rate of fire or shell velocity of the forward-firing gun can be altered as the requirements of war change , without major modification of the type . The P-38 was our original bid for highaltitude strength . A radical design , it is singularly maneuverable for a twin-engined ship . The basic disadvantage of most twinengined fighters is their inability to make short-radius turns . Having two parallel lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft must " bend " two force lines in order to turn . This makes the banking harder , just as it is more difficult to turn sharply with a car than it is with a motorcycle . The Lightning gets away from this problem in a measure by turning the propellers in opposite directions . Thus each engine counters the other 's torque , eliminating dynamic allowances for this turning tendency such as wing warping , and offsetting the  | vertical fins which cut down speed . It also , in effect , makes the airplane practically torqueless , therefore , more maneuverable . Putting the pilot and armament in a separate nacelle or streamlined pod in the center of the wing offers several advantages . In the first place , the accuracy of fire from the four .50 caliber. machine guns and single 37-mm. cannon is enhanced by the fact that they are not mounted over or in the same line with any vibrating power plant . Grouped as closely together as they are , the guns ' fire pattern is concentrated over a small area and has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets the range for even a short burst . The small nacelle can be sealed airtight and supercharged without the mechanical difficulty encountered in the ordinary fullfuselage designs . This makes it one of the top high-altitude jobs of all time . The P-51 is our latest baby , so good that even the British have gotten enthusiastic about it . It is a change-of-pace airplane . The hell that the U.S.-built Flying Fortresses have raised in the " out of sight " fighting levels have forced the Axis to build such monstrosities as the Focke-Wulf 190 , the new Messerschmitt 210 , and the like . Suddenly the Mustang arrives , capable of making great speed within a shadow of the ground . Only the luckiest kind of a shot can bring one down . The human ear can pick up the sound of this low-flying infant only when it is overhead . One of the forerunners of the Dieppe raid was said to be a lone P-51 that picked itself a deep , rolling Channel swell and , skidding all the way across the Channel in its trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , heaved a salvo of delayed-action bombs into the largest radio installation on the occupied French coast , and dashed back before the German alarm system had a chance to function . It is a lot harder to get a low-altitude ship to go fast than one built to operate in the substratosphere . The thin air in the higher levels offers little resistance to the wings , and as long as there is enough surface and enough power , the airplane can move at quite a clip , simply because there is little to hold it back . At the lower levels , while the lifting characteristic of wings is far more efficient , the air offers far greater resistance . At high speeds , it tends to " pile up " just behind the highest point of wing curve . At speeds approaching 500 m.p.h. on most con- ventional wing curves , the air actually breaks its " laminar flow " and lift-destroying turbulences occur in the boundary layer . The Mustang is winged with a special airfoil whose profile permits the smooth flow of air at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized upon the scant early information on the P-51 to criticize the fact that it had poor high-altitude performance . To begin with , the P-51 has no high-altitude performance ? none was built into it . Every line , provision , and device in the ship was built for phenomenal speeds at low levels . An early critic stated that the new German FW-190 that appeared at about the same time would probably outrange and outfight the Mustang if it tried to come up and do combat at the 190 's most efficient level of 22,000 feet . In the first place , the P-51 would probably never seek combat with a 190 . It is not built to do that kind of a job . Secondly , the P-51 could not get to 22,000 feet with anything less than a strato-balloon . But ? if the 190 had the bad judgment to come down to the lower levels , it would be as helpless as a fish out of water . Consider the weight side of it . The 190 would be running around with the weight of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thick , high-altitude wing , 40 percent of which would be surplus at low levels , and its pilot wrapped up in a teddy-bear suit . Its engine , geared to produce its top power in thin air , would be putting out less than 60 percent of its power . Compare this flounderer with the cocky kid flying in his shirt sleeves in a comfortable low-altitude job , with only the things he needs surrounding him ; his engine Jutting out every rev it can and a wing ustom-built to keep him flying at his own particular level . Fit mate to the Lightning , the P-47 , Reublic 's Thunderbolt , is our newest bid for high-altitude supremacy . As yet unproved . n battle , we have only characteristic comparison to check it against . We know that a type is needed that can stand and fight . t high altitudes , that has range enough to meet and intercept high-flying , low-range aircraft , that will have speed and climb to spare and have one prime virtue missing in most high-altitude craft ? gunpower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demonstrated the horizontal speed of the Thunderbolt . Its rate of climb is phenomenal , its gunpower burst equal to the impact of a five-ton truck at 60 m.p.h . The fact that the two latest-type fighter craft operate at opposite levels indicates the justification of the former U.S. theory for the conduct of  | war , the change . of pace that requires the enemy to keep a great diversity of equipment in production . The A Class ? attack and dive bombers ? are the group that stands between fighters and bombers . We have concentrated on taw-. such types . The A-20 , known as the Douglas " Boston " in its day-raider conversion and the Havoc as a night fighter , is basically an attack bomber . It is built to operate at near pursuit speeds , pack a lot of gunpower forward and enough maneuverability to take on any single-seater built . The big thing that was asked of the A-20 design was range of speed ? the ability to cruise at near-stalling speed for hours on end , hunting out troop concentrations , convoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A-20 hauls up its flap , opens the gun , any ' . punishes the objective with a murderous fire-cluster forward , baptizes it with bombs as it goes over , and then dusts it off with the rear gun as it speeds by . The Boston 's record in daylight sweeps over the continent is equaled only by the African record . A thoroughly disorganized. busted-up troop , supply , or tank movement is termed Bostonized no matter how the action happened . The A-20 's wide range of speed and favorable landing characteristics promoted by an awninglike flap and tricycle landing gear have made the night version , the Havoc , with double forwardfiring power , ideal for prowling around German flying fields in northern France . waiting for some unfortunate bomber to try to take off . At the precise moment when the bomber begins to be air-borne , the Havoc dives in and gives it a single burst . frequently causing the ship to explode with its entire destructive load aboard . The manufacturer 's designation for this type is the DB-7 . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stuka and fight anything that came against it . The other U.S. member of the A class . other than the Douglas " Dauntless , " which was borrowed from the Navy as a shortrange stop-gap , is the A-31 , the Vultee Vengeance . Originally programmed for exclusive British production , this design incorporates all the virtues of the former types of single-engined dive bomber , stamina plus good control of diving direction : and speed , plus enough gun-power for its own defense . The original Stuka , the Junkers JU-87 is an outstanding example of a one-purpose airplane carried to a great extreme . A  | capable dive bomber , it was a dead duck if caught by anything that could really fight . The Germans tried to counter this frank tactical mistake with imitations of : he DB-7-light , twin engined bombers equipped with diving brakes . While these were fairly successful , they gave up some f the essential virtues of the JU-87 : economical operation , great maneuverability lose to the ground , steep diving angle , and great variety of dive pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German ideas plus the British experiences , the Vengeance eras built . In the first place , the Vengeance s plentifully armed . Its total gun power is : hat of the average single seater . It carries : s bombs internally , permitting at-will bomb selection and higher speeds . The average enemy dive bomber carries most of . : s missiles externally , and the loads , usually hung under the wings , must be symmetrically released to keep the ship under good control . Our two current medium bombers stack : p well against their basic requirements , : rid the basic requirements indicate that the Air Staff were better guessers than average n this class . In the B-25 , they asked for a mediumweight bomber that could operate out of short , unprepared fields under all conditions . It required mid-altitude performance for middle distances under fire through hostile country . Therefore , a good part of the useful load had to be invested in armament . While the first submarine sinking in the Atlantic and General Doolittle 's raid on Tokio may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomber , General Ralph Royce 's raids on Japanese emplacements in the Philippines showed the ship to its best advantage . Slipping into hastily prepared advance bases , so quickly arranged that the enemy has n't found them yet , Royce punished them soundly from both low and medium altitudes and was out of range before the yellow brethren could gather their wits . This demand for " get up and go " is amply supplied by the Mitchell , as the type has been named . In Australia and the Archipelago it has been flown from beaches and rudely hacked-out fighter-advanced posts . Its heavy armament allows it to operate without fighter support and frequently withJut any advance pursuit co-operation . In other words , a gang of B-25 's is capable of parking anywhere midway between the enemy and a supply base and operating as long as the fuel , ammunition , and supplies flow in at a tolerable rate . The Martin Marauder , the B-26 , was one  | of the most spectacular guesses in air history . There were some in the Air Force that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racer would wind up a prototype and a number . Like the bumble bee , one could prove on a slide rule that it was incapable of taxiing , much less flying . Magruder , young , lithe . handsome nonconformist , kicked half of the accepted theories for bomber construction out of the window when the Army asked for a terrifically fast short-range bomber that could interchange weight for range at will . Several basic sketches were presented at a staff meeting at Martin 's . Some were improvements on the existing Marylands and revised Baltimores , others were radical changes . The most radical was the Magruder suggestion . Glenn Martin took one quick look at the B-26 and selected it . Some wondered if the boss was slipping . No one , thus far , has doped out a logical way of attacking the B-26 . Hauling nearly as much armament in a small area as a heavy bomber , carrying nearly as much weight as a Fortress ( a shorter distance ) , most fighter craft would have to work hard to catch this ship and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With plenty of guns forward , top , tail , at its sides , and below , it resembles the B-17 in the completeness of its gun-arc coverage . At Midway and off the Aleutians , they have been " doubling in brass " as torpedo planes . The rack for torpedoes has been built into all existing models . It can serve interchangeably as heavy-weight , shortrange bomber with its normal tanks ; middle-weight , mid-range bomber with a fair load ; or it can , by installing self-sealing tanks in as many of its four bomb bays as needed , haul a bigger torpedo farther than anything except a submarine or a destroyer . We can stick our chests out the farthest in the long-range bomber class . First , our B-24 , the Consolidated Liberator . Having the intestinal fortitude to adopt a radical wing curve is something even Japan 's desperate ministry dared not do . The Davis wing that mounts its long , tapered span , permits greater lift from its area than any other yet devised . There is a lot that can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B-24 is the backbone of our air-freight system indicates that it is the hottest long-range hauling machine in the history of transportation . Like the P-40 it is a foot-in-the-door airplane . Its tricycle  | landing gear allows it to get in and out of places formerly reserved for light , twinengined transports of the 9,000-pound class . Alongside the Hurricane and the Spitfire , the B-17 will probably remain among the greatest tactical guesses in history . The self-sufficient bomber was a pet dream of General Arnold for a decade . The original proposition was to build an airplane that could strike hard or sink a battleship half way out in the Atlantic , disperse landing efforts off the bulge of South America , or hop off the bastions of Hawaii or the stations in the Philippines to meet an enemy fleet anywhere in the Pacific . More important , it was determined even then that a bomber , trying to get to a vital area in the heart of an enemy country , would have to tight off wave after wave of attackers . This meant that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the defensive ammunition it could carry . Load-hauling , high-climbing aircraft had teen built before , but this ship had a specific job to do ? precision bombing at long range at high altitude . It could not afford to have its radius of action limited by the range of escort aircraft . It had to proceed a distant target alone . The U. S. Army bombsight would permit spot effectiveness bombing , so too much weight was not necessary . This was no pattern-bombing - aft , satisfied to slip in at night and oblterate an area ; the global war for which this was built required that it be able to . t one ship , one block , or one house from height out of range of any attacker . How has the General Staff guessed ? Look the pattern of its result in every theater war . To begin with , what other nation 's equipment is serving wherever fighting is taking place ? Obviously , our equipment is the only group built to fight a global war . In each class , two types are represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced bases , feel out the enemy and establish the pattern of action . The others are the knockout types , the ships to come in and deal the telling blows . Our aircraft have shown up as superior to any , even those of our allies , in one outstanding general characteristic ? stamina . Those who foresaw a global war knew that aircraft would have to be dispersed to far places , transferred from one climate to another , live outdoors for the duration and frequently be maintained with the simplest tools or no tools at all . These are the 11 main types . We will probably see many more added before the conflict is over . Nevertheless , there are experts who expect to see only modifications of these less-than-a-dozen in the fight when the Axis is finally buried .  |
