" AT THE SUBSCRIBER 'S REQUEST " A Story F. HUGH HERBERT N ANcv , mending the children 's socks in the living room , heard the scrape of Bill 's key in the front door and scurried hastily into the little hail . " Shh ! " she whispered mysteriously before he could even open his mouth . She took her husband by the hand and led him quickly upstairs to their bedroom , closing the door behind her in a furtive manner . " Oh , Bill , " she whispered , " I 've got some wonderful news for you ! " Bill cocked a puzzled , dubious eye at his wife . " I got the most marvelous maid , " she announced . " She 's absolutely perfect . She 's a real treasure . " " I 'll bet she drinks like a fish , " said Bill . " Pm always leery of your ' treasures ' . " " She drinks only milk , " said Nancy . " She comes from a farm . Honestly , Bill , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , brought her home with me , and she settled down at once and has been working like a dog ever since . The kids are crazy about her already . " Bill regarded her thoughtfully . " I shall reserve judgment till I 've tasteddinner , " he said " and given the old duck a personal oace-over . " " Old duck my eye , " said Nancy . " She 's not more than twenty and she 's very pretty . Wait till you see her . She 's so cute . " " How much are you paying this ravishing creature ? " Bill inquired . " Fifteen dollars less than we paid that Iast old emetic of ours , " Nancy gloated , " but of course I 'll raise her by five dollars a month as she learns the language . " " I knew there was a catch somewhere , " said Bill cynically . " What is she  --  an Ethiopian ? " " She 's Dutch , " said Nancy . " She 's a refugee . They bombed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful ? " . " Yes , indeed , " said Bill gravely . " Does she speak fairly good English ? " " She ca n't speak a word , " said Nancy . " Not a word . Literally . The poor kid came over in a tanker or something and only landed here a couple of days ago . She 's so nice , Bill . Was n't it lucky I got her ? " " My knowledge of Dutch , " said Bill , " is limited to three dirty words that a Dutchman once taught me , and you do n't even know those  --  I trust . How do we communicate with her ? Through an interpreter ? " " Do n't you worry about that , " said Nancy airily . " She 's very intelligent  --  and an excellent cook  --  and since noon when she got here the kids have taught her lots . They understand each other perfectly . " She broke off with a laugh . " Just before you came home , " she added , " they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hot diggety dog ' . " " That 's going to be very helpful , " said Bill , " when I want my breakfast in a hurry or something . " " Her name 's WiIhelmina , " Nancy announced , " but the kids have already shortened that to Mina and she answers to that beautifully . " " You talk as if she were a bird dog or something , " said Bill . Nancy 's smile faded for a moment . " Now that you mention it , " she said gently , " that 's exactly what her eyes are like . A big sad dog . She had scads of little brothers and sisters in Holland and they were all killed . The woman at the employment agency told me the whole story . I think that 's why she 's taken to our children so quickly maybe . " Bill was still very dubious , but even during dinner that night he was already beginning to weaken . Despite their complete ignorance of each other 's language , some mysterious communion seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nancy and the children on the other , whereby their alien tongues were an inconsiderable barrier . With smiles and signs and a lot of giggling they made known to Mina , without difficulty , all their wants ; and , stranger still , Mina made innumerable inquiries and absorbed information . Mina was a plump pretty girl whom any casting director would have instantly picked as a farmer 's daughter . Her skin , innocent of all cosmetics , glowed with health ; she had big capable hands and broad strong shoulders , andwhen her full , naturally red lips parted in a grin she displayed as fine and white a set of teeth as Bill ever remembered seeing in one mouth . It was one of the strangest meals Bill ever ate . Mina was in and out of the room all the time , but because of her ignorance of the language they could , and did , talk about her constantly . " Is n't she cute ? " said Nancy as Mina started to clear away the meat plates . " Very cute indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tugged at Mina 's apron to get her attention . " Het heet aardig , " he said . Mina giggled and went into the kitchen . " What was all that about , Conrad ? " Bill inquired . " I just told her that ' cute ' means pretty ' , " said Conrad . " She has a Dutch-English dictionary , and that 's one of the first words I looked up myself . Het heet ' is Dutch for ' it means . ' Pretty is aardig ' . " Within a very few days it was no longer possible to discuss Mina in her hearing . She seemed to be a natural-horn linguist . At the end of two months Nancy was able to report that Mina had thrown the milkman for a loss , in the course of a somewhat heated discussion , by saying , " Go fry the egg , you . " The Americanization of Mina was well under way . Nor was this confined to an expansion of her vocabulary . Lipstick , rouge , silk stockings , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Mina was very pretty , she acquired a steady boy-friend . " But do n't worry , Bill , " said Nancy , reporting this latest circumstance , " he 's a soldier  --  and a very nice boy  --  and they 're being very sensible and are n't dreaming of getting married till after the war . " " Good , " said Bill smugly . " If we lost Mina now and had to go back to those fleeting horrors who never stayed longer than two days I 'd go out and cut my throat . " " Is n't she a sweetheart ! " Nancy crowed . " I can always tell about people . " A tiny frown flickered across her brow . " There 's only one fault that Mina has , and that 's the telephone . " " Young girls are all the same , " said Bill tolerantly . " They think you have a telephone just for them . If she uses it too much , tell her not to be so gabby . She wo n't mind . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't understand , " said Nancy . " It is n't that at all . I wish she would use the ' phone  --  but she 's scared to death of the darned thing . " " How do you mean  --  scared ? " " Scared stiff , " said Nancy solemnly : " In the first place she never even saw a telephone until she came to this country . She 's convinced she 'll be electrocuted or something if she touches it . " " Then take her by her hot little hand , " said Bill laughing , " and show her that no harm will come to her . " Nancy sighed irritably . " You poor fish , " she said coldly . " What do you suppose I 've been doing for the past eight months ? It 's just no use . It 's a phobia or something . The children have all tried to kid her out of it , but it 's no use . She shies from it like a mustang . " " Rubbish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that in two minutes . " He strolled into the hall and yelled , " Mina , would you come here a minute , please ? " Mina came in from the kitchen smiling . Eight months in America had changed her appearance considerably . She was no longer plump and solid as she had been , and a casting director viewing her now would never put her on a farm . By careful dieting she had taken off fully twenty pounds . Hcr trim white uniform showed off a slim neat figure . Only the friendly grin remained unchanged . " Mina , " said Bill casually , " I 'd like you to telephone to the drugstore for me and tell them to send round a carton of cigarettes . " " We have plenty cigarettes , Mr. Hunter , " said Mina paling . " Not the kind I want , " said Bill . " Tell them to send . . " Not me , " said Mina emphatically . " Look , Mina , " said Bill amiably , " do n't be a dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there to be scared of in a telephone ? " Mina looked at Nancy , blushed , and giggled sheepishly . At that moment the telephone rang . Bill reached out a hand toward it and then looked sternly at Mina , who recoiled away from the instrument , her eyes lively with panic . " Mina , " said Bill , " answer that ' phone and do n't be a little idiot . " " Not me , " said Mina quaking . " Mina , do n't act like a half-wit , " Bill yelled while the telephone went on ringing . Mina burst into tears and ran back into the kitchen . After a few moments Nancy followed her . She found Mina bending over the sink sniffling unhappily . " Honestly , Mina , " said Nancy sympathetically , " I 'm amazed at you . Why ca n't you get over that silly , stupid fear ? " " I wish I can , " Mina sobbed miserably , " but always it scares the pants from me . " " Well , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . Mina looked at Nancy unhappily . " Will Mr. Hunter getting sore as hell ? " she asked fearfully . She was devoted to Bill , and Nancy , who knew this well , was touched . " Do n't worry , Mina , " she said , " he only yelled because he said he could cure you in two minutes , and I was laughing at him . " The next evening Bill came home in a towering rage . " Something 's got to be done , " he thundered as soon as Nancy followed him into their bedroom . " I tried all afternoon to ' phone the house , but there was no answer till around four when Conrad got back from school and answered it . I asked if Mina was out , but he said she 'd been here all along . She just let the ' phone ring . " " I know , " said Nancy gloomily . " That 's what she always does . Unless I 'm here or the children are around she just lets it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bill stormed . " Suppose we 're out for the evening some night , and the kids are asleep , and some urgent vital message comes  --  then what ? " Nancy shrugged her shoulders uneasily . " I do n't know , " she said . " So far that has n't happened though , has it ? " " How do we know ? " Bill growled . " God knows what important messages we 've missed because Mina 's a psychopathic imbecile . " " Oh , come , come , " said Nancy soothingly . " If it were anything really important they 'd keep on ringing all night till we got home or they 'd send a telegram or something . " Bill ran his fingers through his hair and dramatically envisioned other dire contingencies . " Suppose we 're out some night , " he said , " and one of the kids gets taken sick , or the house catches fire or something  --  then what ? " " Well , " said Nancy , " fortunately Dr. Prentice lives next door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just run over and get him . And if the house catches fire she 'd be much better occupied rescuing the kids than telephoning , would n't she ? Besides , we 're fully insured . " " My good child , " said Bill , " it is obviously fatuous to have a maid in this day and age who refuses to answer a tele-phone . " " It is rather silly , " Nancy conceded , " but what can we do ? Do you want me to take her to a psychiatrist at twenty-five bucks a throw ? They do cure people of stranger things than that . " Bill looked at her pityingly . " There 's only one thing to do , " he announced firmly . " We 'll have to get rid of her . " " Get rid of Mina ? " Nancy yelped . " Over my dead body . Why , Bill , you must be out of your mind . " " I am not , " said Bill grimly . " I 'm just as fond of Mina as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid who wo n't answer the ' phone . Do you realize I could be missing thousands of dollars ' worth of business ? Lots of myclients call me at the house . Or try to . " " You 're doing very nicely , " said Nancy , " and if you got thousands of dollars ' worth more business what would you do with it ? Pay it out in income tax . You 're much better off this way . " " You seem to think it 's a joke , " said Bill , " but I do n't . Mina must go . That 's all there is to it . " " The kids 'll be desperate , " said Nancy . " They 're all crazy about her , and she 's so wonderful with them . Peggy follows her like a shadow all day , and Dick would too if he could crawl out of his play-pen . " " They 'll get over it , " said Bill coldly . " And Conrad already can speak Dutch like a native , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked up at Bill with large soulful eyes . " Do you want your children to hate you ? " she inquired . Apparently this horrid possibility did not disturb Bill unduly . " Nonsense , " he growled . " They 'll be just as crazy about someone who can answer a ' phone . Give her a month 's notice to-night . " " Not me , " said Nancy firmly . " I just could n't , Bill . I adore the fool girl too . I just could n't tell her . " Bill was getting really angry . " Good God , " he said , " you talk as if we were heaving an orphan into a blizzard . She can get fifty jobs to-morrow at bigger money than we 're paying her  --  and without three kids to look after too . We 're doing her a favor . " " Not Mina , " said Nancy sniffling . " You do n't understand , Bill  --  she 's not just a servant . This is her home . She loves us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bill . " She 's no longer a scared refugee . She can talk good Brooklyn already , and she looks like a million bucks . I can fire her without a twinge . " " All right , " said Nancy , " but you 'll have to do it , because I just could n't . " Bill smiled in a superior masculine way . " At the office , " he said , " I fire dozens of people every month without turning a hair . " - ? r Nancy faced her scowling husband and fiddled with the lapels of his coat . " Bill , you 're not really going to fire Mina ? " she pleaded . " I certainly am , " said Bill . " I 'm not going to live in a house where I ca n't get a simple telephone message . " " Well , do n't tell her while I 'm around , " said Nancy ; " that 's all I ask . " " I 'll discharge her to-night after dinner , " Bill announced calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ridiculous . " It was an exceptionally good dinner that night , but gloom pervaded the dining room and there were no appetites . Conrad and Peggy , who were big enough to have dinner with their parents , had been informed by Nancy of their father 's decision , and throughout the depressing meal they looked at him with large reproachful eyes that were definitely unnerving . Only Mina , blissfully ignorant of her fate , was cheerful ; but soon she sensed that there was something amiss . She carried on a brief conversation with Conrad in Dutch and then went into the kitchen . " What was all that about ? " Bill inquired . " Nothing , " Conrad whispered . " She wanted to know if anything was wrong , and I said I did n't know . " " It sounded like a longer conversation than that , " said Bill grimly . " Did you tell her , by any chance ? " Conrad looked at his father with cold , level eyes . " Me ? " he whispered . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was only seven , and emotional , burst into tears . With a withering glance at Bill , Nancy rose from the table and led her small daughter , weeping loudly , upstairs to her room . Mina came back from the kitchen with the dessert . She was just in time to see and hear Peggy 's tragic exit . " Mr. Hunter , " said Mina alarmed , " what 's the matter ? What is it ? " " I have no idea , " said Bill . " She 's probably just a little cranky . She 'll be all right . " Mina set down the plates hurriedly . " I go up , " she announced . " Peggy -- -she always minds for me like is nobody 's business . " Nancy came in from the ball . " She just had a little tummy ache , Mina , " she said . " She 's lying down for a minute . Just leave her alone . " The dessert , a special Dutch pastry in which Mina excelled , was barely touched . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs to join his sister . Bill faced Nancy across the dining-room table . Mina had retired to the kitchen . " Why on earth did you have to tell them ? " he whispered fiercely . " If you must know , " said Nancy viciously , " they came to my bedroom before dinner and saw me crying  --  and so I told them why . " " It was a terrible thing to do , " Bill hissed . " AlI through this ghastly meal they 've been looking at me as if I were a monster . " " That 's exactly what you are , " said Nancy . " Just because you might miss a silly telephone call you get up on your high horse and fire somebody we all love . " She pushed back her chair . " If you 'll excuse me , " she said frigidly , " I 'm going upstairs to my children . " Bill followed her into the hall and halfway up the stairs . " Look , " he said grimly , " you 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . We did n't make a life contract with the girl , did we ? " " Go ahead and fire her then , " Nancy whispered stonily . " Look , " said Bill , struggling to control himself . He spoke very slowly and distinctly . " I am a business man . It is imperative that people should be able to call my home and leave . . " " I know , " Nancy whispered . " You 're right  --  that 's the damnable part of it . She is a pain in the neck about the telephone  --  and since she ca n't get over it , I guess we 'll have to get over her . . . but we ca n't help being unhappy about it , can we ? " She kissed his cheek and ran up the stairs . He heard the door of Peggy 's room shut behind her . An hour later , when Nancy came downstairs again , she found Bill in the library reading a magazine , a large empty highball glass in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she say ? " Bill poured himself another highball . " Have n't told her yet , " he admitted reluctantly . " Little touch of cold feet perhaps ? " Nancy inquired maliciously . The highball went the way of its predecessor , in three large gulps , before Bill made reply . When he finally spoke it was in a solemn , dignified tone that caused Nancy to raise her eyebrows and to lift up the bottle of Scotch and hold it quizzically toward the light . " My dear good child , " said Bill patronizingly , " I assure you that the prospect of discharging an employee of mine does not fill me with terror . " He promptly poured himself another highball . Nancy glanced at the clock . " If you do n't get up the nerve to tell her pretty soon , " she said , " Mina 'll he in bed . She always hits the hay the moment the dishes are done . " " You arc mistaken , " said Bill . " She 's out for a brief walk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was okay for her to go with him . " " Why did n't you tell her then ? " " Why should I depress a soldier ? " said Bill . " He 's going off to some distant camp to-morrow , Mina said , and he just stopped by to bid her farewell . She can write to him in a few days and tell him she 's got a better job . " Nancy plopped herself affectionately across Bill 's knees . " Darling , " she murmured , " I wish you 'd reconsider . " She kissed the tip of his ear . Bill shoved her off his lap . " Your tears fail to move me , " he announced firmly , " and it 's no use trying to get amorous . " " Good-night , " said Nancy icily , stalking to the door . " Good-night , " said Bill politely . " Send the kids down to say good-night too . " Nancy stood in the doorway . " I already told them to , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're a louse  --  and so do L ' . ' She slammed the door . About half a highball later Bill heard the back door open and , bracing himself for the ordeal ahead , went into the kitchen . Mina was just shrugging herself out of her overcoat . She still had on her trim white uniform . " Hello , Mr. Hunter , " she said cheerfully . " You come to raid my icebox , I bet you . " She beckoned to him grinning . " I got three kinds cheese for you special , Mr. Hunter . I hide it in a coffee can so Conrad do n't swiping it from you . That boy  --  he 's nuts from cheese  --  like you . " Bill cleared his throat noisily . " Mina , " he said solemnly , " sit down a minute . I 've got something to tell you . " Puzzled , and faintly alarmed by his tone , Mina sat down and stared at him with large frightened eyes . Gently but firmly Bill delivered his ultimatum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she began to howl  --  just as Peggy had done . " Oh , no , " she wailed . " Oh , my ! Oh , no ! " " Now , look , " said Bill unhappily . " It 's nothing personal . We all like you , Mina  --  and we hate to do this , but I 'm a business man , and the telephone . . ? " Mina 's sobs became hysterical . " Now , now , " said Bill soothingly , " just pull yourself together . " He patted her shoulder clumsily , and Mina clung to his arm in a frenzy of grief . " Oh , no , no , no , " she sobbed piteously . " Do n't be a goof , child , " said Bill . " You can get a million other jobs  --  like that . " He snapped his fingers to show how simple this would be . " No , no , " she insisted tearfully . " Every job else there is telephones too . " She clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed it in a frenzy of pleading . " Please , no , " she wailed . " No , please . " Tears were pouring down her cheeks and her face was all twisted up , like Peggy 's when she 'd been having a crying spell , and because it seemed like a good idea at the time . Bill kissed her and told her not to be an idiot . This was a mistake because she only cried harder , and what could you do in a case like that but put your arms round the poor , unhappy little nitwit and tell her to shut up , and lend her your handkerchief ? To Corporal Sam Bailey , U. S. Army Air Corps , however , these facts , as he peered in horror through the back door , were not apparent . He had taken a ? walk round the block , and , returning on an impulse for a final good-by , he got a very different impression . He saw his girl in the arms of a lecherous employer and heard her frantic appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This accounts for the fact that Corporal Bailey , without waiting for an invitation , shoved open the back door , and punched Bill in the eye so hard that he reeled against the stove , knocking over some pots and pans with a deafening clatter that brought Nancy and the children running to the kitchen , wide-eyed with alarm . " What on earth is happening ? " Nancy cried . " Oh , boy , " said Conrad , awed , " will you look at Daddy 's eye ? " Corporal Bailey held off Mina , who to his astonishment was menacing him with a skillet . " Clumsy ox ! " yelled Mina . " Fool ! Idiot ! " And a great deal more in shrill Dutch . " He was kissing you , " Corporal Bailey insisted stubbornly . He recognized that there was a mistake somewhere and wasextremely anxious to justify his mayhem on the grounds of chivalry . " You are a big jerk ! " cried Mina . She put down the skillet and sobbed on Nancy 's neck . Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy , " she said , " your eye is all closed up . " Bill cut through the clamor of explanations and apologies . " Send the kids to bed , " he yelled , " and let 's all go have a drink . " He looked at Mina and grinned . " Stop that bawling , " he suggested , " or I 'll sock you  --  harder than your boy-friend socked me . " Corporal Bailey scuffed his large feet uneasily . " How was I to know ? " he mumbled , grinning feebly . " You were kissing her . " With his one good eye Bill winked at the large embarrassed soldier . " In the words of your fianc  --  e , " said Bill , " you are a big jerk . Come on . " . He led the way to the library . " Bill , darling , " said Nancy some fifteen minutes later , " I think you can be fined or imprisoned for what you 're doing . " " Rubbish ! " said Bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With the poker he pried a square black metal box from the wall with a pleasant rending sound . " If a guy ca n't disconnect his own telephone if he wants to  --  then what are we fighting for ? " He placed the metal box with a tangle of wires on Mina 's lap . " There , " he said handsomely . " Now let 's not have any more nonsense about telephones . Who wants a telephone anyway ? They 're more trouble than they 're worth . " " But , darling , " said Nancy dubiously , " what if anybody wants to call us ? " " A courteous operator , " said Bill , " will inform them that at the subscriber 's request the number has been discon-nected. "
