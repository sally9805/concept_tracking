In Washington last week , at the Army War College 's sumptuous officers ' club , two admirals and their wives gave a little party to commemorate the dissolution of Joint Army-Navy Task Force No. i , which staged Operation Crossroads at Bikini . An East St. Louis ( 111. ) group of bakers sent a cake , made out of tiny angel-food puffs , in the shape of an atomic explosion . Vice Admiral W.H.P. ( " Spike " ) <P> Blandy , Crossroads commander , and Mrs. Blandy were photographed gaily cutting the cake , while Rear Admiral F. J. Lowry stood happily by ( see cut ) . The picture made the Washington Post 's society page . <P> It also made a lot of people indignant and unhappy ; it made the Rev. A. Powell Davies , Unitarian pastor of a fashionable Washington church ( TIME , Oct. 7 ) , as angry as Moses denouncing the golden calf 's idolaters . Brandishing a clipping from his pulpit last Sunday , the Rev. Mr. Davies thundered : <P> " . . . An utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call it obscene ... I only hope to God it is n't reprinted in Russia-to confirm everything the Soviet Government has been telling the Russian people . How would it seem in Hiroshima or Nagasaki to know that Americans make cakes of angel-food puffs in the image of that terrible diabolical thing . . . . Try to imagine yourself for a moment a continental European , wondering , brooding , asking yourself a hundred times a day , will America lead us ? ... Then imagine yourself being shown this picture . If I had the authority of a priest of the Middle Ages I would call down the wrath of God upon such an obscenity . I would damn to hell these . . . traitors to humanity who could participate in such a monstrous betrayal of everything for which the brokenhearted of the world are waiting . " <P> These were probably the harshest words ever spoken of a dessert . But a lot of non-Americans ( notably Britons ) had long regarded the U.S. public 's attitude toward The Bomb as callous to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had a certain justification . Some Americans , for instance , missed the point of Davies ' tirade . Said L. K. Stephens , bakery supply salesman , who helped design and bake the cake : " We intended the cake as something to eat .
