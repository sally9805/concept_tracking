At a war-bond rally in the Loop last week hundreds of readers of the Chicago Daily News met two of their favorite newspaper characters . They were there in person : 1 ) " Oxie O'Rourke , " a baggy-pants commentator off West Madison Street who speaks the unimportant man 's view of important matters in a side-of-the-mouth argot ; 2 ) fat-chinned Clem Lane , a near-legendary Chicago newspaper man . The two are one &; the same . <P> Seriocomic " Oxie O'Rourke " has lately been taking on more importance than ever in the Daily News ( circ. 440,000 ) . Once he was merely a sidelines character , along with his straight man , " Torchnose McGonigle , " in Clem Lane 's stories of Chicago crime and political shenanigans . Now Clement Quirk Lane has become City Editor , and the Daily News has been ballyhooing him as a Finley Peter Dunne , finding with more ease than accuracy a parallel in Oxie and Torchnose to Dunne 's " Mr. Dooley " and " Mr. Hennessy . " <P> In recent weeks Oxie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from " stratosphere strategy " to Presidential press conferences , with a fine disregard for the official position of the Daily News 's publisher , Navy Secretary W. Franklin Knox . <P> Oxie and Lane have been sent out on tour , to New York and Washington . A sample of Oxie 's style and philosophy : " Congress is bending an ear to the farmers , to the unions , to the veterans , to the big shots , to this bloc and that group . I wish some time somebody would rise up in the House and holler ... a kind word for the miscellaneous lugs like Oxie O'Rourke . . . . But I 'm afraid the other lobbyists would gang up on us , claiming we was un-American . " <P> He Is Never Scooped . White-thatched Clem Lane has been doing Oxie pieces for about six years . Oxie came into being when Mayor Edward J. Kelly ( ever since a target of Oxie 's meat ax ) was trying to legalize Chicago 's large population of bookmakers . The Daily News editorialized against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbooks , invented Oxie as a wiseacring mouthpiece . <P> Close by the Daily News building was Louie 's saloon , where a bookie named Moxie shined a well-tailored elbow on the bar . He met Lane next day : " Who 's this guy Oxie ? The cops 'll be thinking he 's me . " Lane fumbled only an instant : " You do n't know Oxie ? Why that 's Oxie O'Rourke , down the street . " Thus Oxie got a last name . <P> To Lane , Oxie is " the perfect answer for a newspaperman ; he ca n't be scooped because he knows everything . He is the voice of the people west of the tracks . " <P> West of the tracks , near the sprawling stockyards , is where Clem Lane was born 46 years ago , and much of Oxie 's slangy. slipshod idiom springs from Lane 's playmates and his long acquaintance with Chicago 's Irish cops . <P> Unferocious . During Prohibition , Lane became the Daily News gangster specialist . He was creating an Oxie technique then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : " Greasy Thumb " Gusik , " Loudmouth " Levine , " Violet " Fusco . ( Fusco 's pals thereafter sent him bunches of violets. )
