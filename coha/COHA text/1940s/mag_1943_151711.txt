In too many U.S. communities this week , whites and blacks tiptoed stiff-legged around one another , watching , waiting and a little afraid . The ugliest strand of the U.S. fabric had tightened under wartime pressure . <P> In New York City 's Harlem , Negro capital of the U.S. , a white policeman arrested a Negro woman for disorderly conduct . A Negro soldier , on leave , tried to stop him . Both went to the hospital , the policeman with a battered head , the soldier with a pistol wound in the shoulder . The story , much garbled , spread quickly through Harlem . <P> Bands of Negroes broke windows , looted shops , burned an automobile , beat up two amazed British seamen leaving Harlem 's famed Apollo Theater . Twenty-four hours later six Negro rioters were dead , 543 rioters and police injured ; a curfew was clamped on Harlem . <P> Through the confusion strode troubled Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , urging the crowds to go home , trying to justify the hope of decent Americans that the race problem need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irascible but patient , with his own peculiar dignity : <P> " This was not a race riot . There was no conflict between groups of our citizens . What happened was the thoughtless , criminal acts of hoodlums , reckless , irresponsible people . Shame has come to our city , and sorrow . . . . "
