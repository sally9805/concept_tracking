txt The Cause of N.Y.U. 's Woe Last week two letters appeared in THE TIMES criticizing the N. Y. U. football policy . This letter is in defense of it . It is n't Dr. Stevens 's or Professor Badger 's fault that N. Y. U. has taken and will take some more terrific beatings . Blame it , rather , on the draft boards . Any one who has watched N. Y. U. play this season ( and I have seen four of its games ) can see that the backfield is definitely above average . However , the line , unlike Fordham 's " Seven Blocks of Granite , " should be known as the " Seven .7.1 : - : -. cks of Jello . " At about this time last year the N. Y. U. squad approved this year 's schedule . But last year it looked as if N. Y. U. would have an experienced 210-pound line . This would have meant ample protection for the backfield . But the draft boards had their say and now more than one-half of N. Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ranks . MONROE FAUST , N. Y. U. , ' 44 . New York , Oct. 28 , 1941.
