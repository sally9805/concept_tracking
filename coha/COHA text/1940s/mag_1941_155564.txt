The Night Before Christmas ( by Sidney Joseph &; Laura West Perelman , produced by Courtney Burr ) is not a bedtime story . It is a mottled Sing Sing folk tale of a silver-haired confidence man past his prime and a slop-house plug ugly who pair up to crack a bank vault for Christmas . They buy a tired Manhattan luggage shop next door to the bank and start tunneling . Obstructed by unwanted customers , garrulous neighbors , former penmates , they dynamite , not the vault , but a nearby cafeteria , while Santa Claus stuffs their stocking with a cop . <P> The screwball wit of S. J. Perelman strangely enough fails to make this wacky plot rock his audience back on their seats with the clanky shock of his offstage writings . The play 's isolated episodes , bald-faced gags , screwy curtains are sometimes hilarious , but they fail to bind together into effective farce . <P> Eight years ago , on their honeymoon , the Perelmans wrote another play , All Good Americans , which failed to come off . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 's best pictures , and Mr. Perelman gagged the best of the Marx Brothers ' films . His best book ( of four ) was his first , Dawn Ginsbergh 's Revenge ( 1929 ) . On its jacket was the blurb : " This book does not stop at Yonkers . " The Night Before Christmas does .
