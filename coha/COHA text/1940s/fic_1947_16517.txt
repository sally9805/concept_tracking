1 INT . CORRIDOR LOS ANGELES COURTHOUSE - DAY FADE IN LONG SHOT  --  a marble-floored corridor broken at intervals by ornate , hand-carved riahogany doors  --  entrances to the chambers of the various judges . There is a hushed quality about the corridor : clerks , bailiffs , lawyers go about their business quietly , almost on tiptoe . At the far end of the corridor is a group of men and women , waiting silently by one of the doors . CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN , APPROACHING the corwed , which is blocked from the door by a burly policeman . As the CAMERA NEARS the door a glit inscription can be made out  --  SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA . Below this , also in gilt , is  --  JUDGE CHARIES PLETCHER . The CAMERA PASSES THROUGH the door TO : 2 INT . COURTROOM - DAY LONG SHOT  --  SHCOTING along aisle towards the judge 's bench . A jury trial is in progress : every seat in the room is taken .

The witness stand is vacant , but in front of it , pacing between judge and jury , is Defense Attorney Ralph Cahill , a homespun character in a wrinkled suit . All eyes are on him : he has evidently been making an important argument . As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG the aisle , he is speaking to the jury . &nbsp; CAHILLI guess you folks all realize this is a mighty important matter we 're deoidin ' here ... whether or not a man has committed murder ...

But , in this case , I think he 's been led astray by the passion of one woman .... Cahill turns as does everyone in the court , toward Janice Bell , seated by the prosecutor 's table . 8 CLOSE SHOT Janice . If she is aware of the eyes , she does not show it .
