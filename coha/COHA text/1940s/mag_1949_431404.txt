SATAN rode a fast-stepping , high-spirited stallion , mighty fine for the flatlands , but on the mule trail above Canillo , Andorra ? high in the Pyrenees between France and Spain ? that fancy thoroughbred just did n't belong . Picking its proud way among the boulders , it slipped , and the Devil , to save himself a second Fall , grasped wildly out for support , but down he went , too . That happened long ago , but if today you are skeptical , Andorrans will show you La Roca de la Salve , the jutting granite block along the road , where you can see for yourself the long gashes marked by Satan 's claws as he fell . That trail is a one-lane dirt road now and the rocks have been cleared ; but it 's no longer safe to travel down it by mule , because you never know when a shiny new automobile will come speeding around a curve . The driver of that automobile , whether it 's a Lincoln or a cream-colored , red-leatherupholstered Delahaye you saw at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andorran peasant . And his wife seated beside him is certainly wearing nylon stockings and probably headed for town to make her weekly appointment at the beauty shop . Electricity in Medieval Places The 20th century has pierced the mountain-shelled isolation of Andorra and converted what was only a few years ago a sleepy little feudal country into Europe 's most bewildering land of paradox . Feudal laws ? and electricity in the lowliest peasant hut ; modern hotels alongside stone houses three and four centuries old ; shop windows displaying the luxury goods of all the world , such as cameras , Swiss watches , English woolens , American nylon stockings ; and flocks of sheep and goats that ramble through the streets ? this is Andorra . Two more paradoxes explain the rest . Andorra is ruled jointly by " co-princes " ? the President of France and the Bishop of Seo de Urgel in Spain . And this devoutly religious community has grown wealthy by smuggling and black-market trading . A tiny triangle on the map , the country is only 20 miles across at its longest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its gateways , the passes through the encircling Pyrenees , are all in the clouds , up the mountainsides on steep , tortuous roads and trails . For 70C years the mountains insulated the country from the social and industrial development of its neighbors . In the 1920 's , despite Andorra 's opposition . France and Spain built roads to its borders . In 1933 the road on the French side was paved for motor traffic . It is open for five months of the year , from late June , when the snows melt , until mid-November , when they pile high again . But it has sufficed to change the ways of Andorran life ( page 272 ) . Revolution , war , and international tension have made it a well-traveled road . Down it refugee Republicans fled from Spain after the Civil War . Outbreak of global war sent spies from both sides scuttling to this ideal vantage point and listening post . In the tragic summer of 1940 it saw the flight of anti-Nazis from France . Later . Allied airmen shot down over Europe made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . Then the wheel came full circle as Nazi collaborators fled through Andorra to Spain . Sheep Cross Border ; Visitors Wait We drove up the road from France on a stormy day in early November . At the border a convoy of six heavy trucks , surplus property sold by the United States Army , their green paint and insignia still untouched , was lined up before the French customs barrier . Forty feet up the road the barrier on the Andorran side had been raised to let a flock of some 100 sheep into France . We waited half an hour while the Andorran drivers of the trucks cleared the exit formalities . By that time three more flocks of sheep had come down from Andorra , to mill around expensive American and European cars whose owners were having more difficulty in crossing the narrow strip of no man 's land . When we had cleared French control , there was another wait for a fifth flock of sheep . Then we plunged immediately into a new atmosphere ( page 270 ) . The paved road ends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt lane that succeeds it and runs on through Andorra to Spain , a collection of wooden shacks showing all the signs of recent and hasty construction had been thrown up . Their narrow windows were crowded with such merchandise as one found  | in France only on the black market , from American cigarettes to Spanish cordovan leather shoes . We sensed a Klondike air about this community . No gold had been discovered here ; it was rather the equivalent of a western American frontier trading post of the past century , offering pioneers the last chance to purchase the products of the civilization they have left . ' We entered one , a barrackslike structure , lit brilliantly by the glare of strong and unshaded light bulbs . Bolts of cloth , woolen and cotton , were stacked to the ceiling along the walls , with cases of canned goods , shoes , wines , electrical equipment , and groceries . Modern Goods ? and Salesmanship We soon found that not only modern merchandise but salesmanship , too , had invaded Andorra . As my wife purchased bananas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matches . " We have these , from Spain , with Don Quixote on the cover , " she said , extending a box . " Have you read Don Quixote ? " I answered that I would take the matches , and , yes , I had read the book .  | " Well , then , " she said briskly , " you will be interested in this book about the book , and this one about Cervantes . And here we have some bracelets and brooches , very lovely , with the knight and Sancho Panza on them . And here are some picture postcards of the Cervantes country , and . . . " She had everything , it turned out , except the original windmills . I finally escaped with only the matches and two postcards . It was cold and raining on the muddy road as we wound back and forth following the mountain contours , climbing to the Port ( or pass ) d'Envalira , the 9,226-foot-high peak of Envalira to our left ( page 281 ) , and the 8,661-foot peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowned with snow . As we climbed , the rain changed to snow , but through the 7,897-foot pass we could see a patch of blue sky . We drove slowly , for the curves are sharp and bordered much of the way by sheer cliffs . The blue patch in the sky gradually grew larger . Suddenly we were through the pass . " Why , it 's like finding Shangri-la ! " my wife exclaimed . And so it was . Below us stretched a splendid vista of warm and verdant valley , terraced fields dotted with farmhouses , villages , and cattle grazing peacefully in stone-fenced pastures .  | Beside the road ran the eastern branch of the Riu Valira ? the River of the Valley ? sparkling like a million diamonds as it tumbled down the mountainside , winding its way swiftly between giant boulders , foaming into white spray at the rapids , now and again plunging over a little waterfall , and then stretching its way to run smoothly down the valley . Through the automobile windows came the first warm sunshine we had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and the long , difficult drive , we relaxed at once , feeling as prisoners must who emerge from a dank dungeon into the fragrant summer air . We drove on through Soldeu , Canillo ( page 284 ) , Encamp , three of the country 's large villages , to Escaldes , best base for wandering through the country ( pages 267 , 278 ) . The typical Andorran is lean and dark , of less than average height , and , like many mountain people , extremely taciturn . There is an old Catalan proverb , " The fish opens his mouth once too often , and he dies , " which the Andorran learns in his cradle . Our first Andorran acquaintance , however , was a jovial fat man , bubbling over with good  | humor and talk . We sat at dinner in our hotel together , for our first Andorran feast : soup with tiny disk-shaped dough patties , fried brook trout , a salad of endive and pimento , veal chops fried in olive oil with fried potatoes and asparagus , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countryside 's favorite beverage , a half-and-half mixture of sweet red wine and dry white wine . A Smuggler Reports His Business Good Between the soup and the trout our jolly Falstaff told us he was a smuggler . " Andorrans have always been smugglers , " he said genially , ignoring my wife 's raised eyebrows . " In the old days the local government sold citizens monopolies on the right to contraband certain articles . Those days there was n't much to smuggle . But now business has never been so good , and there 's plenty for all the competition . " After World War II , he continued over the fish , the big profits lay in the semilegal importexport trade , chiefly in automobiles . A car bought in France sold in Spain for twice its cost . Andorrans , with the prerogatives of both French and Spanish citizens , took advantage of the closed border blocking trade between their two big neighbors . They bought cars in France , registered them in Andorra , and then sold them in Spain . I asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . " Ah , " he said , his chubby face lighting up , " this was the most profitable of all . " The French Government , he explained between mouthfuls of salad , acquired surplus American Army property in France . Trucks , greatly in demand all over Europe , were sold to individual Frenchmen for a million francs . Sales were on a priority basis , with former concentration camp victims and ex-prisoners of war getting first call . " Now , I ask you , " he said with a deep chuckle and a glass of wine , " where could a man four years in a concentration camp get a million francs ? If he had had that much , he could have bought his way out from the Nazis . " Changes in Smuggling Practices Andorrans lent the money to individuals , he continued , and repurchased the trucks , often giving their intermediaries as much as a half-million-franc profit . They could well afford this , because the trucks sold in Spain for the equivalent of two-and-a-half-million francs . " And , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , " it was almost legal ! " With coffee and liqueurs we learned of changes in smuggling technique wrought by technological advances . In bygone days , our friend related , the smuggler put his pack on his back and climbed the mountains , sticking to trails known only to his family for centuries and proceeding on foot to the French or Spanish town where hicontacts , descendants of those who had deal : with his grandfathers , were awaiting him . After World War II , three or four smugglers would drive in an automobile to within half a mile of the frontier . There all but the driver got out . Carrying packs and suitcases they clambered over the mountain slopes and crossed the border at unpatrolled points t meet the car again on the road at a prearranged spot beyond the customs post . I ? is obviously impossible for either the French or the Spanish to patrol every foot of the wild mountain territory . In olden times the main contraband commodity of Andorra was tobacco , for in both France and Spain tobacco manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 18th century , tobacco cultivation was introduced in Andorra , both France and Spain energetically attempted to stamp it out . They met such determined resistance , however , that they soon gave up . Andorrans still raise more than 70,000 pounds of tobacco a year , most of which is smuggled into France . where the price is high . But after the war there was more important contraband . From France to Spain went perfumes , radio parts , tires , silk , and pepper . All brought high profits . Pepper , for example . bought in France for 125 francs a pound sold in Spain for the equivalent of 1,300 francs . From Spain to France went shoe , and leather , fine woolens , oranges , sardines . and olive oil . Such sinister items of contraband as arms and narcotics were even more profitable . Everything that passes through Andorra leaves part of its profit behind . No wonder , then , that the Andorran is now wealthier than his wildest dreams of 20 years ago . An Andorran peasant who makes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sizable fortune in either France or Spain . Where Three Valleys Meet Officially ? and aptly ? named the Valleys of Andorra , for it is the valleys which support life , the country has a population of 5,900 Andorrans and 1,500 Spanish Republican refugees . Catalan is the Andorran 's native tongue , but he understands both French and  | Spanish . The franc and the peseta are interchangeably his official currency . Escaldes , situated at a point where two of Andorra 's three main valleys meet and converge to form the third , boasts some 1,000 inhabitants , which makes it the country 's largest village . Its name is derived from the hot springs , sulphuric and magnesic , which bubble up from the mountainside at a temperature of 147 ? to 150 ? F. These have made Escaldes a vacation haunt for many wealthy Frenchmen and Catalonians . The waters are piped to a fountain in the village square from which housewives draw steaming bucketfuls all day long , and to the modern hotels , all of which feature thermal baths . Unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hotelkeepers to heat their hotels with the hot water or even to pipe it to the individual rooms . On cold , brisk mornings we warmed ourselves as best we could by snuggling close to electric heaters , and the chambermaid had to bring hot water in a pitcher up two flights of stairs . The water was the softest we had ever known . A touch of soap produced rich , foaming suds , and although my tough beard normally requires a new razor blade daily , I was able to use one for six days in Escaldes . The dirt road running through the valleys is Escaldes ' main street . Here it is bordered on both sides by splendid new hotels , with balconies looking out across the valley to the mountains and on houses three and four centuries old alongside . At night the street was lit brightly and shop windows gleamed with displays ( pages 263 and 264 ) . Off the main street , though , we found old Andorra , largely unchanged . Ancient buildings seemed to lean toward each other across narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salting and smoking against the long winter months . Children played with their shaggy sheep dogs , and housewives gossiped gaily as they hung their washing on the balconies . Old men sat reflectively on door stoops smoking their heavy pipes . Over all hovered the odors of Andorran cooking ? frying olive oil , garlic , and strong spices . Escaldes ' central position , plus its hotels and modern garages , made it the ideal base for exploration of the country . We found that we could reach any of the main villages  | in only an hour 's drive from here and that all of Andorra 's important officials and enterprises were near by . Only a short walk down the valley is the town of Andorra , Andorra the Old , * which is probably , with its 900 inhabitants , the world 's smallest capital ( page 288 ) . Here we found the ancient Casa la Vall , dating from the 1580 's and almost unchanged since then . A simple rectangular stone building , with little ornament of any kind aside from the paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andorra 's government , as well as church , museum , prison , fortress , and monument . It is eloquently the main public edifice of a nation of farmers and shepherds . Twice a year , before Easter and before Christmas , the 24 councilors of the principality , four elected from each of the six parishes , meet here ( page 277 ) . We were shown through the Casa by its keeper , an old woman who had to use both hands to insert its foot-long 7-pound key in the antique lock . To my wife , the most interesting of its rooms was the historic kitchen , a dark , cavernous room with a hole in the ceiling designed to serve as an outlet for the smoke from the cooking fires built flat on the center of the scarred stone floor . " Could they really cook anything here ? " she asked . Our guide led us into a smaller room adjoining , where she showed us a framed document . It was the menu of a state dinner of 1688 : chicken liver a l'Andorrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewed goat au jus ; whole mutton a la brioche ; almonds , sugared and grilled ; coffee and cigars ; wines of the countryside , and brandy . Most of the excellent Andorran dishes we ate , we learned later , were cooked on wood or coal stoves , although there are some electric ranges in the valleys . Every Andorran kitchen , we also discovered , is equipped with a labor-saving device , a rack on the wall above the kitchen sink in which dishes are set sideways after washing , allowing the water to run into the sink and eliminating the necessity of wiping dishes . A High Living Standard To my mind , the Andorran lives at a higher standard than many other Europeans today . He is able to do it partly because of a historical and geographical accident amazingly unmodified by the passage of centuries . " Great Charlemagne , my father , liberated me from the Saracens , " the national anthem of Andorra recalls . With the breakup of Charlemagne 's empire , Andorra became a bone of contention between the Counts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Urgel , in Spain , and many minor , undecisive wars were waged over the territory . Finally , in 1278 , Pedro III of Aragon intervened in the dispute , and on September 8 of that year the quarreling feudal lords signed the charter which still constitutes the basis of Andorra 's semi-independence . It provided for joint overlordship by the Bishop and the Count , with a measure of local self-government vested in a council of Andorran landed gentry . This skeleton put on very little flesh over the years . As feudalism died in France , the hereditary rights of the Counts of Foix passed first to the Kings , and later to the Presidentof France . In 1866 a minor social revolution extended to all heads of families the right o ' suffrage and election to the Council General But the Bishop of Seo de Urgel and the President of France are still Andorra 's coprinces , and every year the feudal tribute ? 460 pesetas , six hams , six cheeses , and a dozen hens to the Bishop , 960 francs to Frances chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended Andorran independence for all time , is reported to have said : " Andorra is too fantastic . Let it remain as a museum piece . " The supreme resident rulers of the principality are the veguers ( administrative agents ) . one appointed for life by the French , the other named every three years by the Bishop . Each veguer in turn selects an Andorran from a list submitted to him by the Council General as his bayle ( deputy ) . These officials execute laws and customs which have been handed down from medieval times . These laws and customs , which still give Andorra a museumlike quality , were describes to us by B. Riberaygua Argelich , secretarygeneral of the Council . A vigorous middleaged man , he comes from an old Andorran family and was educated in France and Spain . An attorney by profession , he is a scholar by love . He had just published , in Catalan , the first thorough study of Andorran folkways . " By law and tradition , " he told us , " the cap de casa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Andorran life . He rules not only his children and grandchildren but the servants of their households . He alone may vote for the members of the Council General , and . if he is a man without either creditor or debtor , may be elected a councilor . " Only the cap de casa , Riberaygua continued , may negotiate for the marriages of members of his family . Boys may marry at  | 14 and girls when they are 12 , but nowadays they generally wait a few years longer . Should the Council mobilize the militia , only the cap de casa is obliged to serve . Against this contingency he must keep a rifle and ammunition ready in his home . The cap de casa appoints his heir , who in turn becomes cap de casa . The heir may be a younger son , or even a daughter , and inherits by law all but a fourth of the property . However , so strongly do Andorrans feel about preserving their family estates that normally this law is circumvented , and the other heirs yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment to the land , natural in a country where until only very recently the landless had to emigrate to live , is reflected also in an odd and complex legal tradition . This provides that anyone who sells land retains the right to repurchase it at the sale price . Should the buyer resell the land , he , too , acquires this right : and so on for future purchasers . The tradition was long ago modified to limit the repurchase right to a fourth of the original sale . But after many years four or five claimants with this right may suddenly sue to rebuy the land . There are an uncounted number of lawsuits , growing out of this tradition , still unsettled after decades of litigation . With this attachment to the land goes a deep devotion to the Roman Catholic Church , a strong family feeling , and intense clannishness . No one can apply for Andorran citizenship whose family has not resided in the valleys for three generations , unless he marries an Andorran heiress . Children born out of wedlock are not tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border into either France or Spain to a foundling home . They may never obtain any rights in Andorra . Divorce is unknown . Inheritance Laws Limit Population The inheritance laws are responsible for Andorra 's static population , which has fluctuated between five and six thousand for centuries , despite the fact that Andorrans normally have large families . The disinherited have had to emigrate to France or Spain to earn their livelihoods , and there are more Andorrans in either country than in Andorra itself . The inheritance laws create many cases of ill feeling within families , as many children compete for the cap de casa 's favor . From another source we heard the tale of Andorra 's most recent murder , which had taken place some four . years before our visit . In a mountain wood neighbors found the body of an eldest son who had just become an heir . In accordance with the medieval tradition for cases of violent death , the rite of visori was performed . A bayle called out three times : " Dead one ! Arise ! Justice calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , again thrice : " Dead one ! Who killed you ? " Again silence , and the bayle turned to the assembled crowd and pronounced three times , " Here is a dead one who will not reply , " thus officially opening an investigation . Andorra , an orderly country , has only six policemen , none of whom knows how to classify a fingerprint , but it took no great detective work to fix the guilt on a younger brother of the slain man . In prison , the culprit confessed not only to the slaying of his brother but to the poisoning of his sister 15 years before so that he alone would inherit the one-fourth portion excluded from the patrimony of the main heir . On a Sunday noon , before the assembled populace in the square of the capital , he was sentenced to death . Within an hour he was shot . Even today , with hundreds of refugees from Spain swelling the normal population , crime is almost negligible in Andorra . ( No Andorran considers smuggling a crime . ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , 80 French gendarmes were sent into the country . Spain , in retaliation , sent in several companies of mobile guards , but after a short time withdrew them . We sat basking in the sunshine one morning on a stone parapet on the cliffside at the edge of the town of Andorra , looking down on the Riu Valira and the green fields of the valley , talking with Paul Ramond , the French postmaster , and two of his daughters . The girls , aged 18 and 20 , wanted to know about Hollywood . Ramond was curious about towns all over America and about Americans who write to him . " Not a day passes by , " he said , " but I get at least one letter from America , with money enclosed , asking me to send Andorran stamps . Both the French and Spanish have post offices here , and we both have special stamps for Andorra . But ours must be more beautiful , because I get the most requests . " I 'm not allowed to send the stamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put as many stamps as possible on the envelope and postmark them with special care " ( page 289 ) . Ramond , a wounded veteran of World War I , had brought his wife and five reluctant children to the mountains in 1935 when he received his appointment .  | " Now we are all happy , " he said . " Here is a clean and beautiful life , a paradise . " Both girls shrieked in protest . " Paradise ! With no dances in the evenings and only one movie a week ! And so few young men ! " There is a big modern movie theater in Escaldes now . It features not only French and Spanish films but Hollywood products as well . Its chief attraction is for the young , especially the younger women . The men still prefer their cafes , their traditional card games , and evenings full of talk . No newspapers are published in Andorra , but the illustrated weeklies of both France and Spain are widely read . Andorra has had telegraph connection with France since 1887 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone service within the country , but , as we learned when my wife tried to call our daughter in Paris , no longdistance lines to either France or Spain . This lack , we found on investigation , stems from the Council General 's attempts to get more money from the concession than has yet been offered ( page 279 ) . Smuggling Approved ; Gambling , No ! The people of the Valleys long preferred to be left alone . In the 1880 's a group of European promoters sought to establish a giant gambling casino in Escaldes , where it would be free from the restrictions imposed  | by other governments . Handsome payment was offered Andorrans for the concession , but they turned it down . Gradually the temper of the people changed . When in 1917 two Australian promoters , impelled by similar considerations , sought to establish a world-wide sweepstakes lottery headquarters in Andorra , the Council General succumbed to the lure of easy money and accepted the proposition . This time the coprinces joined to veto the scheme . A concession was let , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stands high on the hillside above Escaldes . Furnished with the best and most recent American equipment , including a large room stacked high with American jazz recordings , the station is heard far and wide . Primarily directed to England , France , and other European countries where radio broadcasting is government-controlled and no advertising is permitted , Radio Andorra 's programs are almost equally divided between commercials and ready-made entertainment . This enables it to pay a handsome tribute to the Council General . The country 's one bank and the hydroelectric company also pay a sizable portion of their profits to the Council General . And the Council is anxious to develop the mining of Andorra 's deposits of iron ore . Revenue from these concessions is sufficient to meet all national expenditures . Add to this the fact that the French , Spanish , and the Church support Andorra 's schools , and it will be no surprise to learn that Andorran taxes are infinitesimal and that there is always a surplus in the budget . " We may not always be so lucky as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one member remarked at a Council meeting . I asked a leading Andorran why the Council General did not spend some of its budget surplus on paving Andorran roads because good roads would attract more tourists . He replied matter-of-factly that the Council would soon force the concessionaires to build roads . This is part of an old Andorran technique . Over the course of centuries Andorrans have played their co-princes against each other . gaining concessions from both they could otherwise never have hoped to gain from one . Today the Andorran has almost all the privileges of both French and Spanish citizens , with few of the obligations . Andorrans may live , work , and travel freely in France and Spain without the special permission and registration required of other foreigners . They pay no taxes to either country and are exempt from military service in both . " Frenchmen look at Andorrans as the kings of France , " Germain Soulie , the French veguer , chuckled . " Free in their native country , and freer than Frenchmen in France . " Andorra has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II many Spanish Republicans lived in the principality unmolested by either the Vichy or Franco regimes . Only Hitler violated the country 's neutrality . " First there were tourists , ' " Soulie recalled for us . " Husky male tourists who always walked in perfect step . The only thing civilian about them was their clothes . Then came the Gestapo , asking questions and snooping . For there were Allied agents coming through shortly after the fall of France . " Two Gestapo men used to come to my office every morning . They would walk in without knocking , sit down , and remain a while . Then they would ask me , What 's new ? ' Always I would answer , ' Nothing 's been new here for a thousand years . ' Then they would go away . " After a while it got so that when they came in I would ask first , What 's new ? ' We never learned anything from each other .

And , most important , flyers shot down over Europe were coming through in large numbers on their way to North Africa . About 200 Americans alone passed through , we were told , as well as many British and Canadian aviators . " Always the Gestapo sat and watched , although the strange faces must have warned them what was happening , " Soulie said . " Finally , in the summer of 1944 , after the invasion of Normandy , they must have realized the jig was up , " he continued . " They made a raid one night and kidnaped eight people ? two American flyers , some Poles , and others I had never seen . They knew just where the hiding places were and went directly to them . They took their prisoners down to France in two taxicabs . " Everyone was afraid . Nobody tried to stop them and nobody protested . Shortly after , the Gestapo , too , left .

Most of the land , however , is pasture . Andorra boasts an animal population of some 1,500 goats , 17,000 sheep , 400 cattle , and 300 mules . The sheep graze high in the mountains all summer , but are driven down to the near-by valleys in France for the winter . On the mountain trails the mule is still the only reliable method of transportation , and we frequently encountered him in the villages , too . More than half of Andorra 's population lives in the tiny parish of Andorra , which includes Escaldes . Each of the remaining five parishes ? Canillo , Encamp , Ordino , La Massana , and Sant Julia ? has only from 400 to 700 inhabitants . Down in the valley near Andorra town the climate is mild . and the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . On the slopes and in the high villages the winter snow falls heavily , piling up to 15 or 20 feet . But around Escaldes more than a foot of snow is rare . Trout and other game fish abound in the streams and lakes that line the countryside , and high on the mountain crags Andorrans hunt the izard , or Pyrenean chamois . Everywhere are ancient chapels , solid stone structures which serve both as shrines and as refuges for wayfarers caught in a storm . " There is tranquillity here , " the one-armed teacher of Andorra 's French school told us . Educated at the Sorbonne and long a resident of Paris , he had returned to his native valley as soon as a post was offered . Education is not compulsory , but Andorra 's children are about equally divided among the three free school systems , operated by the French , the Spanish , and the Church . Schools are one-room , one-teacher affairs , instructing children of all grades up to the age of 14 . Those who wish to study further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by the beneficent mountains , even Andorra is not immune from world catastrophe . In 1933 hard times resulted in a minor upheaval when young Andorrans sought a political solution to their problems of unemployment , low prices for contraband , and the falling off of tourist travel . After an hour 's agitation at a meeting of the Council General they won the right of universal male suffrage . Backed by the French , this reform was instituted despite vigorous opposition from the Bishop of Seo de Urgel . It lasted until 1941 , when the representative of Marshal Petain joined the Bishop to rescind the law and reinstitute the old system under which only the cap de casa can vote ( page 268 ) . Since then , despite the restoration of democracy in France , there has been no agitation for a return to this reform . " When everybody is fed , " a councilor said . " there are no politics here and nobody cares about the government . " Nevertheless , as Andorrans gathered in their cafes to play their traditional card games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . Raised from their former peasant standards by an artificial and temporary political situation , they were frightened by the prospect of a return to normalcy . Yet this seemed bound to come with the reopening . last year , of the frontier between France and Spain to commerce . " Our wives are used to nylon stockings , fine clothes , and perfumes , " the Andorran worried aloud . " How can we ask them to return to the old life ? " Andorra 's leading citizens had great hopes of solving this problem by turning their country into a tourist mecca , with both winter and summer seasons . Plans had been made to keep the road from France open all year . Golf courses were projected for the valleys and ski tows for the mountainsides , although many peasants objected that the cattle would be frightened by such unusual apparitions . Already new hotels were going up . They were building mostly in Escaldes , which has the added attraction of the thermal baths . But they were building also in Encamp , in Ordino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown and purplish-gray stone of the mountains . The Bishop of Seo de Urgel has long expressed his opposition to the erection of gambling casinos or dance halls in the country . But this did not discomfit the planners . They know that Andorra 's chief attraction will always be its quaintness , its distance and isolation from the world , the purple beauty of its mountains , and the serenity of its lonely forests and lakes . They do not intend to stain the splendor of clear and breath-taking Andorran nights by a neon-lighted landscape . And when the fever of the boom cools , the planners believe , a sane prosperity will once again make Andorra what it was in the olden days an unchanging island of simplicity and a refuge for those who seek peace .  |
