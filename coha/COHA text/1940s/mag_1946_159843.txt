THE CONDEMNED PLAYGROUND ( 287 pp. ) - Cyril Connolly-Macmillan ( $2.75 ) . <P> A critic , aphorist and editor of parts , Cyril Connolly is the latest fashion in bitter elegance in English letters , as his friend George Orwell is the latest fashion in common sense . Connolly 's touch of Irish divination and curiosity has given him a greater range than other amateurs of the 18th Century manner . His published pieces yield the vivid image of an Old Etonian still alive and kicking amid the European rubble , somberly turning the pages of psychiatric journals , reaching for the odes of Horace , and composing , with a groan , clever paragraphs to keep his modern anguish under classic control . <P> In The Condemned Playground , Connolly has collected a sheaf of critical studies , parodies , travel notes and pronouncements dating from 1927 to 1943 . They appeared in various London magazines , including his own Horizon . Along with his Enemies of Promise ( 1939 ) and The Unquiet Grave ( 1945 ) , these writings are chiefly valuable in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . They show a humane concern and alertness for the dedicated writer 's lot in a radio-cinema civilization . They are full of bright glances into the writing process : <P> " Ten minutes ' extra thought on the choice of a word , or the position of a stress , may make in the lyric a difference of a thousand years . " <P> " To take a piece of Greek and put it into English without spilling a drop , what pleasurable dexterity ! " <P> " Every critic , however roughly he may seem to wisecrack away the achievements of his enemies , the creators , will sooner or later shyly unlock his playbox . . . . " <P> West Europe , Ltd . Connolly 's less agreeable qualities include a tone of pettish portentousness into which he falls when writing of philosophical or religious matters that he can taste but can not fathom . At Eton little Cyril preserved a pious air in chapel , though reading his blackbound Petronius instead of the prayer book ; in more adult ways he has continued to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elegance , a weakness for the rare and classy word ( " the barathrum of incompetence " ) , and a neglect which almost seems an aversion for U.S. literature . Connolly 's insularity is profound and perhaps defensive . It is , however , an insularity of European rather than British dimensions . One of the curves that could be plotted through his writing culminates in his stated belief that the future cultural relationship between England and France should be " absolute union . " <P> Another curve , just as clearly obedient to the urgencies of the war , goes from the old familiar evaluations of Joyce and Proust to the athletic conclusion that " they both seem to me very sick men , giant invalids who , in spite of enormous talent , were crippled by the same disease , elephantiasis of the ego . They both attempted titanic tasks , and both failed for lack of the dull but healthy quality without which no masterpiece can be contrived , a sense of proportion . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
