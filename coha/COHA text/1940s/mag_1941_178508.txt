Before he was fairly settled in Santiago 's grey Casa Moneda , Chile 's new Acting President Geronimo Mendez had ? n important visitor . Out of a borrowed Lufthansa plane at Santiago airport one day last week stepped Brazil 's smart , dapper Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha , all primed to talk commercial treaties . He had left Rio expecting to confer with President Pedro Aguirre Cerda , had learned of Don Tinto 's temporary retirement ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) while en route . <P> Though the treaties themselves were not particularly important , it seemed likely that the first act of Acting President Mendez ' official life might be very important indeed . Minister Aranha ( whose name means " spider " in Portuguese ) was openly rumored to be spinning a web . On his way to Chile he had stopped in Buenos Aires , and one guess was that behind the screen of unimportant business he was trying to weave Argentina and Chile together with his own country into an A.B.C . bloc . Lending substance to this guess was the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Banco do Brasil to the Banco Central de Chile . <P> If Minister Aranha was planning to dicker , he has a good man to talk to . Chile 's new Acting President Mendez has earned himself a notable reputation as a peacemaker and conciliator . When he entered national politics last year the squat , sallow , middle-aged doctor from Coquim-bo was nicknamed Don Geronimo el Anonimo . Recently he emerged from anonymity to the leadership of the turbulent Radical Party . He had not been a member of the Cabinet until last week when Don Tinto boosted him to the Ministry of the Interior so that he would be next in Presidential succession . <P> As Acting President , Don Anonimo will have full opportunity to exercise his ability as a compromiser and political pacifier . Don Tinto 's Popular Front Government , of which he is now the head , has been the victim of a tug of war between the Radicals and Socialists . Radical leaders are jockeying for the pole position in the next ( 1944 ) Presidential campaign . The Communists are lying ominously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army are waiting sharp-eyed for any crack in the Front .
