With an overabundance of wild game threatening U.S. crops and grazing lands ( TIME , March 1 ) , WPB took action : it released additional ammunition for farmers and ranchers . Ruled WPB : farmers and ranchers who apply to dealers before Oct. 1 will be allowed ( in addition to their present quotas ) 100 rounds of .22-caliber cartridges , 20 rounds of other rifle and pistol ammunition , 25 rounds of shotgun shells . Only qualification : they must certify they intend to use it to kill pests .
