Albert Guigui arrived half-starved from France . To the Fighting French in London , he brought assurance of the support of the once-powerful French trade-union movement . When he met the London press , he looked like an unkind caricature of Charlie Chaplin . <P> Long-haired , tiny-mustached M. Guigui read a prepared statement on French labor 's resistance to Germany 's manhunt for manpower . Then a London Daily Herald reporter asked : " To what extent do the French people distrust De Gaulle 's Bonapartist tendencies ? " <P> The reporter had posed a familiar question about General Charles de Gaulle 's Rightist connections ( which have worried some , pleased others ) . But it transformed M. Guigui into a dynamo of sudden eloquence . <P> " I have only been here a few days , " he said , " and I have been reading your press , particularly on French political matters . It seems you do n't quite understand what it means to be occupied by the Boche . I hope-in fact I am sure-you never will , but French politics today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we back the man we 're most certain is going to do it . You should sit as I have for two years around tables plotting with Socialists , Communists , priests , extreme Rightists , extreme Leftists , employers , workers , all friends together with one aim-France 's liberation !
