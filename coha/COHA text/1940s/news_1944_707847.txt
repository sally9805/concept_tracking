txt President Roosevelt today characterized the forthcoming United Nations onslaught against Nazidominated Europe , which he said flatly would occur this Summer , as more than an invasion ; in his words , it is a war of liberation . While avoiding all discussion of military phases of the planning , except for re-emphasizing the imminence of the invasion , Mr. Roosevelt outlined to a news conference some of the phases of planning that characterize the greater aspect of the operation . This planning is going along awfully well , he said . When a reporter asked whether the President considered the Soviet Union an active and satisfactory collaborator in the broader task of planning for the liberation of Europe , he replied quickly with the word " absolutely . " These were the high points in a homily such as Mr. Roosevelt has delivered infrequently since the war began . He addressed himself to an inquiry whether there was // any phase of invasion preparations that he felt he could discuss . His remarks held special significance since he made them only a few hours after Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said that our , work of preparation for peace ' probably was ahead of that of any other Government . Mr. Roosevelt said that he had ' taken his new title for the invasionfrom an editorial in a local paper ( The Washington Post , May ' 13 ) and that he felt that libera-i tion was much more expressive than invasion . The action In Europe , he went on , will occur some time this sum-1 mer , and all plans have been laid on that basis . These plans , he added , necessarily involve much more than military preparation , and he made a sharp contrast with studies already undertaken or progressing and the comparable work in 1918 . It was only in 1918 , he recalled , that a study of post-war problems was begun at President Wilson 's instance by Col. E. M. House , Mr. Wilson 's confidential adviser . When Mr. Wilson left for Europe to attend the peace conference in Paris , some of the reports still were tied in bundles and undigested . Thus the other war President and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all the information in the world but likewise practically no concerted plans . By contrast , Mr. Roosevelt said , we have held the Hot Springs conference on relief and the International Labor conference in Philadelphia , and will convene a conference on monetary problems in July . We are taking up tile major problems of the post-war world and talking them over . We are making far greater progress in this . war than in the last , he remarked , concluding , we are going along awfully well . First Draft Prepared The President recalled the conversations held in Cairo and Teheran when , he said , we talked things over carefully . Many problems , he added , have been reduced to a first draft of conclusions , but he said he would no more make public the first draft of such conclusions than release the first draft of one of his speeches . He told reporters that they might see perhaps the seventh or eighth drafts of the conclusions . But , he added with a laugh , the first draft probably would horrify you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought our work of planning the organization of peace was probably ahead of any other Government , particularly in the field of preparation . It is a complicated and difficult matter , he added , and we have taken into consideration many suggestions from many quarters . The Secretary said that he was proceeding with consideration of the various views expressed in his meetings with members of the subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee set up to confer with him . Mr. Hull said we were moving as fast as the exceedingly complicated situation permitted us to move in view of the seriousness of the undertakings . He added with emphasis that the State Department would be glad to listen to anybody who cared to exhibit as many details as possible of his own views . Mr. Hull indicated , in response to inquiries about suggestions made yesterday by Anthony Eden , British Foreign Secretary , that the Allies form an international organization before the war ends , that we were moving slowly on such phases of study as call for serious caution as we go forward .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
