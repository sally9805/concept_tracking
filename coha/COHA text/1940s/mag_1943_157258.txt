When Republicans won their thumping victory in Michigan last November they pushed out every single Democrat except Highway Commissioner G. Donald Kennedy , whose office was not at stake until the 1944 election . Democrats nursed their wounds and thought hard : if the Highway Commissioner were a good politicker , maybe-with the fat patronage in that office-he could help Democrats beat their way back to power . Only stumbling block : Commissioner Kennedy was no vote getter . <P> Obligingly , Democrat Kennedy resigned just before year 's end , forcing the election of a successor in next month 's off-year election . Democrats planned to run popular Murray D. Van Wagoner , who was Highway Commissioner for seven years until he jumped to the Governor 's chair in 1941 , led the Democratic ticket last November although he failed of reelection . <P> Republicans were not asleep . This week the G.O.P.-dominated State Legislature was all set to pass a bill abolishing the office of Highway Commissioner .                   @ @
