George Price ( who drew that series of levitated men , floating up near the ceiling ) has published a new book of cartoons . His latest collection is called Who 's In Charge Here ? ( Farrar &; Rinehart ; $2.50 ) , and its first printing of 28,500 was already sold out last week . The work includes no supernaturally levitated figures , but in one drawing an echelon of six flying fish completes a bank-turn above their tank in a pet store . The proprietor explains to a customer : " We do n't sell them singly , Madam . It breaks up the formation . " <P> Who 's In Charge Here ? contains altogether 159 of the delicate lunacies , the scenes of bizarre domestic confusion exquisitely rendered with a crow quill pen which have made The New Yorker 's George Price one of the most popular of U.S. comic artists . One industrious hobby ist is shown completing a parlor-sized steam engine right in the parlor it is sized to fit . His wife wanly observes : " Some times I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another character , the father of a crowded and bewildered family , is at last able to explain to them the curio which has long adorned their mantelpiece - " Professor Caswell tells me this damn thing happens to be a Ubangi symbol of fertility . " Another woebegone figure , a chicken farmer , is discovering the literal truth of the description on his chicken feed , " Lay or Bust . " The stubborn hens are exploding all over the place . There is an angry hound who , with a great ripping of one pants leg , yanks a man into a room where two ladies are seated ( " I divorced him years ago , but our retriever keeps bringing him back " ) . And there are two contestants glaring at each other from corners stacked with magazines ( " They 're seeing who can collect the National Geographic for the longest time without a break " ) . <P> He Looks Like His Work . <P> Slim , 42-year-old George Price looks most like one of his own harassed , slack-jowled characters when he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint trying to get their wacky crankinesses into line . Small-mustached , small and quick of eye , he looks normally like the art director of a small advertising agency . He was one once . Before that he inspected solder connections for General Electric . <P> Born in Coytesville , N.J. , Price grew up near the late , famed water-colorist and graphic artist " Pop " Hart , and attributes his earliest and soundest inspiration to that master of the homely subject . Price has never been to art school . For his cartooning guidance he uses models , a big collection of his own candid sketches - and memory . He prefers the last . <P> Price lives with his wife , three sons and a notable collection of personally refinished antiques , in an old Dutch house in Tenafly , NJ . The improbable pieces of furniture which clutter up some of his cartoons are often clearly visible in the neighborhood of Tenafly . Price thinks that Who 's In Charge Here may not be as strong a book as his first and favorite , Good Humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , few of Price 's admirers will be disappointed .
