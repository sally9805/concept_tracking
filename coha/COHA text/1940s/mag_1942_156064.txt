They are packing up their Egyptian mummies and stowing them away in dark vaults . They are dismantling their dinosaur skeletons and hiding them again in the earth . They are locking dead cockroaches in safes . They have rented a bank to safeguard their Indian wampum . In all the great science museums along the U.S. coasts , curators are busy as Noahs , threatened by the flood of war . <P> In Washington the Smithsonian Institution is shipping 57,200 insects to a secret cache . Why all the fuss over a tattered bug on a rusty pin ? Or a frowsy bird skin ? A pickled fish ? Because these are the type specimens-the original catches from which the species was first scientifically described and defined . Like the platinum-iridium bar in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Svres on which the meter is engraved , each specimen is the standard against which other members of the species and new varieties are measured . <P> A new insect pest , for example , must first be compared and classified before it can be efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify , have appeared in some species since the type specimen was first chosen , a century or two ago . And , though any curator can catch a Musca domestica ( or housefly ) in his own soup , he would probably give his right ear to have the original type . Among other items selected for bomb-sheltering from the Smithsonian collection ( valued at $300,000,000 but irreplaceable , says one of its officers , at three times that figure ) : <P> &gt; Specimens of such extinct creatures as the great auk , the Labrador duck , the sea mink ; and the only Townsend 's bunting ( a bird ) ever found in hand or in bush . <P> &gt; The jade Tuxtla statuette from Mexico , earliest ( 98 B.C. ) dated monument of the New World . <P> &gt; The first patented typewriter and the first letter written on it ; remains of Morse 's telegraph and Bell 's telephone ; the log of the Savannah , first steamship to cross the Atlantic . <P> &gt; The original star-spangled banner which inspired Anthem-Writer Francis Scott Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to risk staying in Washington ; so will many another object . It would be too heroic a task to bottle , bundle , crate and ship even a large fraction of the Smithsonian 's 1,000,000 fish , its 1,750,000 plants , its 510,000 historical relics . ( Only 5% of this material is displayed for the museum 's 2,500,000 yearly visitors . ) A Smithsonian zoologist last week estimated that the alcohol required to preserve the chosen animals for the duration would be enough to provide the entire Japanese army with a 24-hour spree . <P> Manhattan 's great American Museum of Natural History has rented a bank in an unnamed inland spot to store its choicer small fossils , a collection of rare Brazilian birds , type specimens of a pygmy elephant , a West African crocodile , etc . The Museum 's dinosaur collection , world 's best , is not being hurried to safety . " The dinosaurs have already withstood a 200,000,000 year blackout , " said a fossil expert , " and they ought to survive the war . Besides , if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again .
