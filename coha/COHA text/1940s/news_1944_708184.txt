txt Merchant Seamen Want Books Men in the merchant marine rarely have a chance to read the classics , textbooks or mystery stories unless kind friends donate the volumes . Good libraries are few and far between in sailor town , or on the long jetties where the tankers load . The books that are aboard ships are cherished ; lent as a sign of good friendship , and returned at once . Dog-eared they may be ; the covers worn shabby , but they stack up as the sailors ' only relaxation , against the landsmen 's movies , theatres and radio shows . So if anyone has any books to donate , think of the pleasure they will give and send them along to the Conrad Library , Seamen 's Church Institute , 25 South Street . They will be put on our ships and those of the United Nations and we will be grateful to you . FRANK LASKIER . New York , Not . 1 . 1944.                  @ @ @
