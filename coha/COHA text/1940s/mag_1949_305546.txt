Russia 's rubber-stamp parliament , the Supreme Soviet , met last week in the great assembly hall of the Kremlin . At Stalin 's right hand as he entered the hall was V. M. Molotov , who a week before had been " released " as Minister of Foreign Affairs . With Stalin , too , was A. I. Mikoyan who had been released as Minister of Foreign Trade . The three together were cheered . Also present , in a government box off to the side , was the new Foreign Minister , Andrei Vishinsky . <P> The arrangements buttressed the theory that Molotov and Mikoyan had not been demoted.
