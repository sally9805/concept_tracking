In some ways , it is the strangest medical school in the world . Many of the students are only one generation removed from cannibalism . They are Fijians , Maoris ( from New Zealand ) , Samoans , natives of the Solomon , Cook , New Hebrides , Tonga , Gilbert and Ellice Islands , and a few East Indians . <P> Only requirement for the Central Medical School , at Suva in the Fiji Islands , is the equivalent of a good U.S. high-school education . Students are given four years of anatomy and surgery . One thing students find hard to unlearn : their fear of native witch doctors . <P> N.M.P. Y. M.D. The Suva degree is N.M.P.-Native Medical Practitioner . With it goes a Government salary and the right to practice within the Western Pacific Islands . Many N.M.P.s are so good that Europeans prefer them to white doctors ( in the islands there are about 20 white doctors , 200 N.M.P.s for 1,000,000 people ) . But N.M.P.s ' chief job is to care for their own people . Native diseases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirochete ) , malaria and blackwater fever , filariasis ( worm infestation which frequently ends as elephantiasis ) . The imported diseases are often worse : diphtheria , gonorrhea , tuberculosis , leprosy , measles ( which is often fatal to South Pacific natives who have not yet acquired immunity ) . The N.M.P.s vaccinate , fight mosquitoes , teach latrine building , operate for elephantiasis , give quinine , deliver babies . The slow increase of native populations on most Western Pacific Islands is largely due to their efforts . <P> From Makeshift to McGusty . The Suva Medical School began back in the 1880s with verbal instruction ( no textbooks , no laboratories ) by the British Medical Officer at Fiji . For the first 40 years it was only a makeshift . In 1928 , bulky , energetic Dr. Sylvester Maxwell Lambert , who spent 20 years in the South Pacific for the Rockefeller Foundation , persuaded the Foundation to help . In 1929 , the Suva School dedicated a new dormitory and mess hall . Enrollment was increased from 16 to 40 , extended to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were added . In 1940 a European nurse started a nurses ' school . <P> Since Dr. Lambert 's retirement in 1939 . Dr. Victor William Tighe McGusty , director of Fiji 's medical services , has had complete charge of the school . Rockefeller support , no longer needed , has been withdrawn . The regular teachers are British-paid Colonial Medical Service doctors . <P> Last week came news that : 1 ) the Central Medical School has increased its students to 76 , including eight dental students ; 2 ) there are 100 native nurses in training ; 3 ) the Fijian Government now proposes an overall health plan for all the islands , with a base hospital at Suva served by air ambulances from the other islands .
