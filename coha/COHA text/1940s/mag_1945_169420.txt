Chinese traffic is a cacophonous confusion . Rickshas , passenger wheelbarrows , pedestrians with bound feet , pigs , dogs , chickens , ducks , sedan chairs , porters shouldering loads on swaying bamboo poles , buffalo and pony carts , busses , trucks , automobiles , jeeps move , when they succeed in moving at all , to the left in China 's streets . Last week the Chinese press undertook to get all this confusion moving to the right . <P> Tradition was invoked . Said Hsin Ming Wan Pao : In the old days when sedan chairs met on a path , the coolies shouted : " Yu pien chou ! - Keep to the right ! " In Manchu days , Shih Chieh Jih Pao noted , all officials entered the Imperial court on the right-hand side . Said the official Chung Yang Jih Pao : " Keeping to the left is not our ancient system . ... In the old Chinese dictionary . . . right meant high , good , strength . . . . The right occupation is the high occupation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenience , unrighteousness , debasement ; the left way means the evil way , to be left toward each other means to be contradictory . Our ancestors believed the right side was the proper side , therefore changing traffic to the right would mean gaining face for our ancestors . " <P> In a more practical vein , the Chung Yang Jih Pao added that nine out of ten U.S. cars brought to China will be left there after the war , and all these cars are built for right-hand driving .
