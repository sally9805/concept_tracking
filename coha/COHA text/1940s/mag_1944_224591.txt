For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places . ... " <P> They knelt on the hard , stone floor as Bishop Karl Morgan Block intoned : <P> " Oh , Almighty God . . . we commend to Thy care all engaged in the great invasion , that being armed with Thy defense , they may be preserved in all perils , and do their duty in honor and glory . " <P> The service ended with a silence for individual prayer . <P> All over the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mayor Fiorello H.
