txt Producing figures to show that his oil company had sold no oil , directly or indirectly , to Japan since 1938 , Edwin W. Pauley demanded an apology today from Senator Tobey of New Hampshire , his principal prosecutor before the Senate Naval Affairs Committee , for statements that have " come as close as he dares in charging me with treason . " Mr. Pauley had testified last week that his company , the Petrol Corporation , had sold no oil to Japan directly , and today he introduced a telegram from the company treasurer stating that on Mr. Pauley 's orders the last sale to brokers that was resold to Japan was made on June 25 , 1938 . " Forty-two months before Pearl Harbor , two Years before our own State Department imposed any export controls over the shipment of oil to Japan , I ordered my company to stop any sales  --  even through brokers  --  which would be destined for shipment to Japan , " said Mr. Pauley , demanding a public apology from Mr. Tobey for " the unjustifiable smear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // Massachusetts , that he " would take under advisement " the Senator 's suggestion that if the committee cleared him on his oil record but ruled he was otherwise unsuitable , he should as " a patriotic lAmerican " request President Truman to withdraw his nomination to be Under-Secretary of the Navy . The appointee told reporters after the hearing , however , that his intention not to request withdrawal of the nomination was unaltered , and that he had merely given a courteous reply to Mr. Saltonstall . President Truman likewise told his press conference today that his position remained unchanged . Mr. Tobey remained silent while Mr. Pauley testified today , but Senator Brewster of Maine en gaged in a heated dispute with Senator Tydings of Maryland , Mr.1 Pauley 's principal defender , over what Mr. Pauley had previously said in discussing sales to Japan by the Petrol Corporation and his efforts in the summer of 1941 to induce the State Department to impose an oil embargo . Mr. Tydings contended that Mr. Pauley had made it plain earlier that sales by the Petrol Corporation were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and criticized Mr. Tobey 's statement to Mr. Pauley last week that " you sounded a warning with one voice , and at the same time , in 1941 , you implemented Japan 's supplies of oil , as a potential enemy , by supplying her with oil . " Mr. Brewster , however , said that it was Mr. Pauley who had supplied the answers to the questions , and that the nominee had been unfair to himself in his replies last week . When the hearing began this morning , Mr. Pauley immediately ' requested permission of Senator Walsh of Massachusetts , the com- ' 1 mittee chairman , to correct the record . The value of the oil from Petrol Corporation that eventually reached Japan totaled $860,537 between 1931 and 1938 , he said , adding that besides stopping sales by his own company , he offered his services in 1940 to Secretary Ickes to help mobilize the national oil resources . " In June , 1941 , six months before Pearl Harbor , " Mr. Pauley continued , " I warned the President and Secretary Ickes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies and urged armed force if necessary to stop her . In August and September of 1941 I was in Europe doing everything I could , despite bomb raids and bullets , to aid ? in securing oil supplies and tanker transportation for Britain and this country . " Those are the facts of my record to be balanced against Senator Tobey 's vile charges . " In view of that record , which is based not on hearsay or supposition or imagination or even politics , I now publicly ask Senator Tobey , as a matter of plain decency and fair dealing , to make to me a public apology for the unjustifiable smear . " I want to stand on the record of my action taken almost four . years before Pearl Harbor  --  a rec ord in which I glory . " Mr. Tobey spoke only once during Mr. Pauley 's testimony , to ask him if he had not testified at the start of the hearings that he had sold oil to Japan . Mr. Pauley said " yes . " Mr. Tydings and Mr. Pauley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American company withholding its products from Japan before an embargo was imposed by the State Department . Senator Magnuson , Democrat , of Washington , remarked that he knew of two smaller oil companies , besides Mr. Pauley 's , that had refused to sell oil to Japan , but that all the larger oil concerns continued to do so until the State Department announced its policy .
