The all-industry National Association of Broadcasters met last week in its 19th annual convention at St. Louis ' Jefferson Hotel . And before the week was out radio was decisively split into two rival segments - big NBC and CBS opposed by Mutual Broadcasting System . Mutual had endorsed the Federal Communications Commission 's sweeping antimonopoly decrees ( TIME , May 12 ) and cracked the solid network front by signing a sudden armistice with ASCAP . <P> When N.A.B. 's board met Mutual 's challenge by endorsing everything President Neville Miller had said about FCC and Mutual 's treaty with ASCAP , Mutual 's three principal members-Manhattan 's WOR , the Chicago Tribune 's WGN and California 's Don Lee network-resigned N.A.B. membership . Mutual withdrew from the N.A.B. board . <P> Blue Blue ? Even before sessions ended , network men were back on their business beats seeing agents and sponsors , watching for first trade trends after the FCC decrees . NBC was expected to fight the decrees to the end . But if NBC and CBS found no relief in court or Congress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> NBC 's lesser Blue network , likely to be sold or partitioned as a result of one FCC decree , answered jubilantly that it had just landed a new program sponsored by General Electric Co . To his staff , Blue 's vice president in charge of sales Edgar Kobak memoed : " Who 's blue-not the Blue . " <P> For months the industry has had a pretty good idea that FCC would tell NBC to get rid of Blue . Plenty of people have tried to buy Blue , such as ex-District of Columbia Commissioner George Edward Allen , and even more have been said to have tried , such as Tommy Corcoran ; but with all radio in flux , all such attempts have come to nothing . Radiomen guessed the likeliest turn at Blue would be no sale to outside interests , but independent status for the network as a separate corporation , with its stock going to R.C.A. 's present shareholders . <P> No Blues were noticeable around Mutual . MBS , theoretically a non-profit-making organization which lacks any real central executive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire charges themselves ) , is in position to meet the rigorous new network limitations imposed by FCC . If , as the decrees in effect ordain , all stations are made mutual , and any station may buy any station 's programs , MBS will be on a par with the other chains . <P> Last week , MBS signed up next October 's worldseries baseball broadcasts ( sponsor : Gillette Safety Razor Co . ) . If the FCC order goes into effect as scheduled , MBS will be able to buy time for the event on any station that wants to sell it . It may be the first big event of its kind to go on the air under the new regulations .
