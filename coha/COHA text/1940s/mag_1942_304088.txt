We shall not see , nor the generation which follows us , the triumph of the America we are building . <P> The U.S. was rambunctiously bursting its boundaries to the West when South America 's " Great Liberator , " Simon Bolivar , wrote these words in 1822 . Latin American countries all had grandiose ideas , a few had paper constitutions , many had military despots . <P> Last week foreign ministers of 21 republics representing 300,000,000 Americans opened consultative sessions , and a triumph-one that could at last vindicate Bolivar 's Pan Americanism-was within their grasp . <P> The formal end in view was a hemisphere-wide rupture , diplomatic and commercial , with the Axis countries . But the triumph might be far greater than that : at Rio de Janeiro the Americas had a good chance of being forged into an America . <P> Eyes on the Argentine . From a speaker 's podium banked with orchids , Brazil 's suave ; nimble-witted Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha stepped on to the floor to greet various delegates at the opening session . But when Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerly , Oswaldo Aranha hurried forward to shake hands , pat his shoulder , and chat warmly . For Argentina 's Ruiz Guiaz was the man who might wreck the Conference . He was the man to watch . <P> A moment later cheers from the crowds outside heralded the arrival of U.S. delegates led by Under Secretary Sumner Welles , who walked in , poker-faced , managing despite midsummer heat and a double-breasted blue suit , to look as cool as a glass of mat . The applause which greeted him was real . For the first time in the long history of Pan-American conferences , delegates , influenced by a common fear of Axis aggression and the past nine years of friendly U.S. relations , seemed to share a feeling that this time the U.S. was not a hypocritical boss but a Good Neighbor who had been attacked . Sumner Welles took a seat on the opposite side of the hall from Seor Ruiz Guiaz . <P> Brazil 's President Getulio Vargas opened the Conference with a speech calling for " the most solid and powerful alliance of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . " Seor Ruiz Guiaz began to fidget . <P> Sumner Welles stepped to the podium . In a long and carefully worded resume of Axis plans , promises and attacks , Sumner Welles explained the U.S. position . Mr. Welles gave figures on U.S. armament production : " 45,000 military airplanes in the coming year ; some 45,000 tanks ; 600 merchant ships . ... " Seor Ruiz Guiaz ran his finger around his collar . <P> Dismissing a diplomat 's usual generalities , Mr. Welles spoke specifically of 218,600 tons of tin plate allocated for Latin America , new allocations of " 20 essential agricultural and industrial chemicals , " besides farm equipment , iron and steel products . When he spoke of the " shibboleth of classic neutrality , " Seor Ruiz Guiaz wiped his face with his handkerchief . When the Under Secretary concluded with a ringing declaration that democratic ideals " will yet triumph , " Seor Ruiz Guiaz fanned himself , being careful to use a scratch pad and not a copy ( translated into Spanish ) of Mr. Welles 's speech .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
