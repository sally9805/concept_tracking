txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** is trite , now , to say that no one is going to shoot Santa Claus but the thought and the hope that it may be true comforts Congress these days . When the soldiers drop their guns they will come home with the politically far more lethal weapon of the ballot in their hands . So politicians and legislators are tumbling over themselves to do everything in their power to provide for the servicemen from the boot camp on . Their dreams are troubled by the fear that they may fail . It is not because the men now , in the service have made demands that the politicians have the jit ters . Whatever ideas the boys in the bombers or the foxholes may have about what the country should do for them when they come back , the job they are doing is too grim and urgent to give time for demanding this and that of Congress . What politicians are afraid of is the power the servicemen will have when they come home . The future of every politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the armed forces . They know it and they are scared . All-Out Programs Their fears , however , have made them bold . In consequence programs which leave the timid and the contemplative a little breathless are being put forward . The fundamental patriotism of their sponsors must be granted with the same sincerity that the political considerations involved are recognized . Some of these proposals have reached the legislative stage . Others are moving that way rapidly . Before Congress at this time are the mustering-out pay and the soldier-vote bills . A proposal for an educational program for veterans is in committee . The matter of adjusted compensation , or bonus , is not yet in legislative form but efforts to work it into the mustering-out pay bill are expected . All these are measures designed to , bring all veterans ' benefits for this war up-to-date instead of waiting until the fighting ends as was the case in most veterans ' issues after the last war . Suggested for the consideration of Congress , also , are the demobilization and re-employment proposals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as contained in the budget message President Roosevelt sent to Congress last week . Mustering-Out Pay The mustering-out pay bill gave the first demonstration of the desire of the politicians to do right by the servicemen and thus lay up political treasure against a parlous future . The 387-to-nothing vote by which a bill providing a $100-to-$300 pay schedule passed the House and the celerity with which the Senate rejected this House reduction of its own 8200-to500 schedule , sending the bill to conference , were not only noteworthy examples of the unity and speed with which Congress can function when its heart is in its work but an augury that when the veterans come home and hang up their stockings , the Congressional Santa Claus will see that they do not go empty . The fact that some 1,400,000 who already have been discharged from military service , hundreds of thousands of whom have found self-supporting or even lucrative employment in a booming wartime economy , were included in the provisions of the bill as well as the men who may come back from the combat areas after months or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impractical Congressional bounty or to shrewd political determination not to overlook a chance to make a friend in any subsequent election . The mustering-out pay bill has been described as the hors d'oeuvres of a. protracted feast at the public table to which those who are fighting this war are to be invited . It unquestionably is a part of a long'range program to take care of those who have risked their lives for their country and with that objective there is virtually no disagreement among politicians . They quarrel only over the richness of the dishes that are included on the menu . The soldiers ' vote bill , however , is a one-shot measure . It is for this year 's elections . The soldiers will be home , according to prevalent opinion , in time for the next elections ? at least for the 1948 Presidential contest . The sole issue , therefore , is the Presidency in 1944 . Maneuvers on Vote Bill Consequently the maneuvering that is going on hits straight at the heart of political considerations very vital to politicians of high and low degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front of the right to vote . The contest is over the auspices under which he shall be permitted to cast his ballots . The Republicans are apprehensive of the entrenched influence of the Administration . Consequently they are in favor of a commission plan of conducting the balloting and they want the States , not the Federal Government , to count the votes . Many of the Southern Democrats genuinely fear that the Federal Government , if it is allowed to supervise the soldier voting and count the votes , will get its hands on the election machinery of the States . Control of this machinery keeps them in power and they are fighting tooth and nail to keep that control in their own hands . The Administration , on the other hand , is well aware that in State elections the current trend is toward the Republicans . Its leaders in Congress , consequently , have fought strenuously for the advantage they believe would accrue to their cause if the machinery of soldier voting were entirely in Federal control . At this writing it appears that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive blanket authority to cast their ballots under Federal Government auspices but the States will count the votes . That will not satisfy everybody but it will give the politicians on both sides a chance to claim that they are the true friends of the soldiers they are concerned over . Power in the Future What the politicians and officeholders are up against is the fact that the biggest armed force in the history of the world will be coming back and its members reentering the political life of the country . It will have voting power and running power . It can supply the candidates and the votes to elect them . Furthermore , they will be over the heads of the politicians of today as long as these politicians are in politics . The soldiers are mostly young men . The politicians and officeholders are getting old . If they want to stay in office and control the political machinery they must , as long as they live , stay on the right side of the voting veterans . So what can a politician do but play politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislate for the welfare and happiness of the soldier  --  the voting soldier ?
