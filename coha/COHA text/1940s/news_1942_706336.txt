txt POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS , rather than merit . will determine the ultimate fate of legislation for a flat limit in war contract profits . The Treasury opposes the pending profitslimiting Vinson bill , considering it discriminatory . It regards corporation income taxes ? normal . surtax and excess profits  --  as an effective and much more equitable method of preventing unreasonable war profits . The issue has been poured , as sweetening , Into demands for labor controls . The White House is under pressure for a decision on labor policy and it would be difficult . politically , to call for limits on salaries and wages without limiting profits ? ? ? A SALES TAX is in the bag . according to its Ways and Means Committee advocates . Chairman Doughton has suggested to Congressional tax experts that they be ready to supply a workable sales tax plan after current hearings are closed and the $7 billion revenue program reaches the behind-closed-doors stage . Sales tax boosters contend the present federal tax base is not broad enough to support the revenue yield sought by the Treasury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden . This may compel the Treasury to counter with a proposal for lowering individual income tax exemptions , now $750 for single . $1,500 for married persons . The department would prefer reduced exemptions to a sales tax as a means of broadening the base . ? HEARINGS THIS WEEK are devoted to three of the most controversial questions raised by the Treasury program : ( 1 , Industrial depletion allowances ; ( 21 mandatory joint returns for individuals ; ( 3i tax exempt state and local securities . Committee sentiment on these issues is fairly clear . " Percentage depletion " of natural resource industries will be continued . A committee majority believes that a gain of $80 million revenue that would result from abandonment of the present depletion basis ' would not compensate for the unsettlement that would result in such vital war industries as oil and mining . As a compromise . present depletion percentages may be reduced slightly . The committee strongly savors mandator " joint rot:urns , but not the ** reccmamendation for special treatment of earned incomes of husbands and wives . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sonic members will vote to throw the whole thing out . Majority of the committee opposes the Treasury recommendation for taxing interest on outstanding state and local bonds . The division is close on the related issue of taxing interest on future issues The Treasury has to win votes to get either , and it faces a strong lobby ? officials from the home towns of members ? ON CORPORATION TAXES . the committee is not getting much of the type of information it wants . There is doubt that industry can shoulder the 55 , , normal and surtax rates and excess profits taxes running up to 75%. as proposed by the Treasury . and still operate at maximum . A hope that executives of some major companies engaged in the war effort would come in and show them just how they would be affected by the proposed taxes has been expressed by several committee members . ? THE GREAT AMERICAN LOTTERY , tax i experts ' slang for the capital stock tax and its side-kick , the declared value excess profits tax , would be abolished under Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , must make a " declaration of value " and I pay annually a capital stock tax of $1.25 on each 51.000 of that value . To ensure that declared values are not too low , profits above 10% on that stated value are taxed at 6.6% . A 13.2% rate applies on the excess over 15% . Business always has held that these levies actually involve a three-year guess on economic conditions and have no place in the taxation scheme . With the Treasury now agreeing , their elimination seems assured . It would involve only moderate savings for corporations . Elimination of these two taxes would mean more net income subject to other let , es . Average savings would probably aniount to about 30% of the taxes now to be repealed . Large concerns might salvage around 12% . But there would be a notable saving in executive headaches . ? SINKING FUNDS , already a difficult problem for some companies , will loom as an even greater threat should the corporation tax rates suggested by the Treasury become law . One case in point , fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings of around $100,000 . It has a 5500.000 debt , with sinking fund requirements of 550,000 annually If the Treasury tax plan goes through , the corporation 's officials estimate that it will have a tax bill of $56,000 . This means the company will have to draw on working capital , or borrow , to meet the sinking fund , to say nothing of state income levies . Dividends would become an academic question . ?
