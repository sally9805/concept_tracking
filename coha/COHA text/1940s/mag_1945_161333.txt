THE WIND IS RISING-Jules Romains-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Last fall in Mexico City , his place of exile , Jules Romains wrote finis to Men of Good Will , his column-of-elephants novel of French life between 1908 and 1933 . In addition to breaking the century 's longdistance fiction record , Men of Good Will has taken almost 15 years to write and required three indexes for a cast of 400 characters , ranging from scrubwomen to Cabinet Ministers . <P> Many U.S. critics have hailed Author Remains ' jumbo panorama with awe . Wrote Critic Clifton Fadiman who has been awed all along : " When the little ones ask , ' Grandfather , what did you do before the revolution ? ' perhaps the only answer many of us will be able to make will be , ' I was a contemporary of Jules Romains . ' " <P> For such admirers , the appearance of The Wind Is Rising , the twelfth volume in Author Romains ' series , * is an event . <P> Even less faithful readers , whose wrinkles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Remains ' characters , are likely to regard the closing volumes of the opus with the kind of intimate regret they feel for their own receding hairlines . But late-arrival readers who stroll in on the latest 559 pages will find that , though they may miss the average novel 's cosy intimacy , they can easily learn to enjoy a cast of characters whose past is already in the public library . <P> The Bad Omens . The world of The Wind Is Rising is France in 1927 and 1928 . Author Remains focuses on it like a man with two cameras-one for overall pan shots , the other for intimate closeups . After laying out the racy boulevards and teeming suburbs of Paris ( as seen by a financier in a hovering plane ) , Author Remains dives down to the corner of a little tearoom for a close-up of a plump Parisian mother fretting over her daughter 's newly modish knee-high skirt . <P> But , as in all the volumes of Men of Good Will , earth and heaven , ideals and reality , are tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters whose aim in life is to better the world . And in The Wind Is Rising , for the first time , the youthful idealism of Author Romains ' men of good will is beginning to shiver in the cold draft of political affairs . As they enter middle age , they begin dimly to see bad omens . Chief among these omens is what Author Remains calls " the rise of gangs and the gang spirit . " <P> Author Remains ' young Parisians are sick to death of old-fashioned morals and politics ; they are desperately bored with " the vice of talking endlessly about principles and programs and rules of membership . " Their new slogan is " Action First . " It does n't much matter what is done so long as one is able to " do something . " <P> The men who sense this popular state of mind , and pounce on it , are the little French Hitlers . Like Hitler , they draw followers from all classes : disillusioned Communists , bored bourgeoisie , students .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
