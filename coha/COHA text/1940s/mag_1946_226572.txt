Can a company be monopolistic even though it does not exclude competition ? Last week the U.S. Supreme Court said yes . In a unanimous decision which greatly broadened the definition of monopoly , the Court upheld the conviction of the Big Three cigaret companies ( American , Reynolds , Liggett &; Myers ) and 13 top executives on antitrust charges . <P> The Big Three had contended that no monopoly existed . Reason : during the period covered by the indictment , competitors had increased their share of the cigaret market . But the court ruled that the mere presence of competition did not mean that there was no monopoly , as long as the defendants had conspired to get or keep the power to exclude competition and intended to use that power . <P> There was no direct documentary evidence to prove the existence of a conspiracy . But there was circumstantial evidence . Examples : the companies raised their prices simultaneously ; their tobacco buyers did not bid against each other . <P> Now the Big Three and the individual defendants will have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to believe that this would loosen the hold of the Big Three on the cigaret industry .
