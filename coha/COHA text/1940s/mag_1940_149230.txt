Aug. 15 was the date set by Adolf Hitler for the completion of his conquest of Great Britain . Last week , as that date approached , Britain 's Over-Seas League planned a monster Aug. 15 tea party in London for His Majesty 's forces from overseas . Before the week was out Britons were certain that Adolf Hitler had decided to crash the party . Huge German air assaults lasting from dawn to dusk began ; 400 or 500 Nazi raiders came over Britain every day ; no hour was without its dogfight . Finally , after holding it back for several hours , the British censor released a dispatch reporting that heavy explosions , believed to be caused by shells , not bombs , had occurred on the southeast coast-presumably the work of Nazi guns across the Channel . <P> First big Nazi air attack began on Aug. 8 near Dover . Before daybreak a flotilla of Nazi motor torpedo boats darted into a Channel convoy of 20 small coastal ships , sank three . The convoy continued westward down the Channel . About 9 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them , swooped out of the morning sun . Some of the ships were towing barrage balloons which the Germans had to shoot down before they could dive-bomb . Anti-aircraft fire and squadrons of angry British Spitfires and Hurricanes hurtled up from the British coast . The sky spun crazily with dogfights , plummeting wrecks , cripples smoking off for home . At noon an even larger formation of Germans struck again at the convoy , and between 4 and 5 p.m. yet another . Not less than 400 planes of the Luftwaffe were counted during the successive attacks . When R. A. F. added up its score it claimed 61 sure kills ( a record ) to only 16 British planes lost . The Admiralty said only two of the convoyed ships were lost by bombing , in addition to the three torpedoed . Germany 's claim for all seas that day ( probably unreliable* ) was 28 ships sunk or struck , 49 British planes shot down , twelve German planes lost . German pilots said they wrecked Dover 's balloon barrage . <P> Willard Garfield Weston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so excited reading the news ticker at the House of Commons that he promised 100,000 ( $400,000 ) to Lord Beaverbrook 's Ministry for Aircraft Production , to replace that day 's plane losses . Prime Minister Churchill conveyed the War Cabinet 's special compliments to R. A. F. <P> For two days afterwards German planes ranged widely over the British Isles on scattered raids in small formations . They said they smashed the runway at the Bristol airport , the Pobjoy airplane-engine works at Rochester , an explosives factory at Faversham , docks and shipyards at Newcastle , Sheerness , Chatham . On the third day they staged another big show , beginning at 7:30 a.m. , on Dover 's repaired balloon barrage .
