Anyone with plain horse sense would know that it would n't do for two big-name races like the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness to be run the same afternoon . But for 38 years the season 's two biggest college track meets-Iowa 's Drake Relays and Philadelphia 's Penn Relays-have been run the same days . <P> Everybody seemed happy about the arrangement but the track coaches , who sometimes want to be in both places at the same time , and sometimes do what the Illinois coach did last week . He sent 14 of his athletes to Philadelphia , 19 to Des Moines . <P> Mostly Texans . At Des Moines , where 2,236 competed in track events , there was a race every six minutes . There was never a moment when sprinters and quarter-milers were not wiggling in &; out of ankle-length sweat suits , or busily flexing leg muscles . In the old days , one of the great attractions was Knute Rockne , who showed up with the Notre Dame track team to see the fun and play cards with cronies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction ; on field , the attraction was Texas ' powerful contingent . <P> Bill Martineson , a 21-year-old ex-marine now at Baylor , took the 100-yard dash in a photo finish ; little Jerry Thompson of the University of Texas won the twomile . One record to fall in two days of competition was broken by long-legged Harrison Dillard , Negro hurdler from Ohio 's Baldwin-Wallace . His time for the 120-yard high hurdles : 0:14.1 . <P> Mostly McKenley . In Philadelphia , a spindle-legged Jamaican named Herb McKenley stood out among the 3,000 contestants . McKenley has broken the indoor 300 and outdoor 440-yard records , is hopefully touted as the greatest quarter-miler since Ben Eastman . <P> The first day , in a University of Illinois uniform , he helped his team win two relays . Then McKenley ripped off a 0:47.8 quarter to give his team a lead on a third relay event . Says his coach , Leo Johnson : " He 's streamlined . . . and when he runs , his long nose high in the air , he looks like modern design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
