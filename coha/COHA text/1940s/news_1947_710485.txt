txt RED CROSS CAMP , Va. , June ** Capital airliner that crashed on a Blue Ridge mountainside last night hit with such force and burned so fiercely that the bodies of many of the fifty victims may never be fully ' iden- ' tified . The big plane slashed a swath through trees and then smashed itself and its human cargo to bits on a granite outcropping . A grim scene greets the searcher breaking his way through undergrowth so thick that nothing is visible until he steps out of the brush into the little clearing created by the fire from the crash itself . Dominating the setting is the great tail section of the DC-4 plane , charred but still upright . A little way ahead lies the burned main body of the plane , with most of the passengers in or near the wreckage . Scattered on both sides lie the possessions they kept closest to them in their last flight  --  brief cases , women 's handbags , notebooks , a few items of clothing , mostly charred . Still farther ahead , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown clear . They are among the least mutilated . The body of a 10-month-old baby , Judith Christine Bryan , was among the first found . That of her mother , Mrs. Martha Helen Bryan of Indianapolis , Ind. , and Norfolk , Va. , was not immediately identified . Dr. Ludwig Lederer , airline physician , one of the earliest arrivals at the scene , estimated that " about twenty " of the bodies had escaped the fire and the tearing force of the crash to such an extent that they could be readily identified . He said about five were so charred he doubted that they could ever be named . Other workers ' estimates // of the number mutilated beyond recognition ran higher . The crash scene itself is so isolated and so rough that searching crews said a three-mile carry by stretcher-bearers on foot might be necessary to bring the bodies out . First arrivals reached the spot by climbing up the mountliin which the plane hit near its crest . That route , however , is so rugged that rescue crews are considering a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 300- or 400 yards away , and then carry them on foot or by horse another two and a half to three miles down the Georgiato-Maine Appalachian trail for hikers which runs along the crest . At the end of that carry , jeeps can meet the bearers and take over their grim burdens . Not even the nimble wartime vehicles can traverse the last two and a half to three miles even on the  --  trail . The shorter uphill route is perhaps less than two miles from a point that can be reached by jeep from this rescue headquarters set up by the Red Cross . But the first half to three-quarters of a mile is marshland and the rest is an uphill grind through dense brush , and over ravines , with no vestige of trail . The whole rescue ? iperation has been severely hampered by steady rani that has soaked searchers and made the rough footing still more treacherous .

The charred clearing is visible from a mile or so away on the other side of a valley , but is lost to sight as soon as searchers , heading toward it , drop below the line of the dense growth surrounding it . The granite outcrop on which the airliner disintegrated is the only one seen for miles around .
