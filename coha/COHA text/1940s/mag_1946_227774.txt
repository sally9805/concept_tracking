Art and the Commissioner <P> Sirs : <P> You recently published in TIME Jan. 14 a squib indicating that I had been " righteously rude " and had thundered at " a small-statured victim . " <P> The facts , which are not even dimly reflected in your characteristically snappy piece , are these : <P> A radio show ( national hookup ) gave a veteran soldier and amateur sculptor some clay , told him to make a statue of his wife , and notified all and sundry listeners that this work , encased in sort of permanent coating , would be shipped to New York to be conspicuously placed in its park system . <P> I received a telegram and shipping bill saying that the statue was about to arrive . My letter , not given to the press , said that the statue was unacceptable , and if dumped on the City would be used as fill in a reclamation project . The whole thing was a cheap advertising stunt on the part of the radio program , and a feeble but expensive practical joke by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , the statue was mutilated when it arrived , the head having been broken off the body . No doubt we might have said nothing and have embarrassed the express company by refusing to accept the statue when it arrived , thus creating just the kind of argument the stunt program wanted . <P> What would the editors of TIME have done about it , had they been public officials ? <P> ROBERT MOSES Commissioner Department of Parks New York City <P> Just what Commissioner Moses did . <P> <P> Tinker 's Dam(n) <P> Sirs : <P> Why do you . . . misuse the expression " tinker 's dam " by spelling it " tinker 's damn " TIME , Jan. 7 ? ... The latter expression means nothing . A tinker 's dam was really a dam made of clay , which the traveling tinkers used to surround a spot on a pan or kettle to keep the solder from spreading or running until it cooled , while the utensil was being repaired . As soon as the solder cooled , the dam was thrown away as useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam " to denote something having no value . . . <P> H. E. HARLEY Oskaloosa , Iowa <P> Dam interesting , but a " baseless conjecture , " according to the Oxford English Dictionary. - ED . <P> <P> Talking Back to " Captain Mac " <P> Sirs : <P> Apropos the idea of WAVE Director Mildred Helen ( " Captain Mac " ) McAfee Horton , regarding liberal education and the Navy TIME , Jan. 14 , I take exception . <P> It was my experience , as a pharmacist 's mate and ex-instructor of college history , to find that those people who were best able to adjust themselves to the difficulties of life in the service were not those who had a broad educational background , but rather , those who did n't know any better . . . . <P> The only advantages of regimentation . . . are in the offices of the gold braid . . . . Ask an enlisted WAVE who has a college degree from Wellesley what she thinks ! <P> WILLIAM E. SAWYER Clarkson College of Technology Potsdam , N.Y . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . contradicts herself . <P> . . People do not develop individuality by having . . . the unimportant things decided for them - and who is " Captain Mac " or anyone else to determine what is important and what is not ?
