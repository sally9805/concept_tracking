The plump , periwigged sightseer was too excited to sleep ; Edward Gibbon spent his first night in Rome waiting for dawn . When at last it came , Historian Gibbon recalled later , " I trod with lofty step the ruins of the Forum : each memorable spot where Romulus stood , or Cicero spoke , or Caesar fell , was at once present to my eye . " Last week visitors to Detroit 's Institute of Arts could see what Gibbon saw , as painted by his 18th Century contempo rary , Giovanni Paolo Pannini . The institute had just acquired Pannini 's splendid , solemn View of the Colosseum ( see cut ) and View of the Forum . <P> Born in Piacenza ( in North Italy ) in 1691 , Pannini went to Rome at 26 to learn figure painting in the style of Salvatore Rosa . After classes , he would stroll out from the Eternal City for long looks at the ruins which ringed it like a crum bling shell . Tumbling , ivied walls in scribed with ancient names and victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants in the grass , and marble steps descending into the sod inspired the " Views " for which Pannini became famous . Perhaps his the spaciousness and sparkle of Canaletto and Guardi , whose pictorial celebrations of declining Venice were equally in demand . But for nostalgic elegance Pannini 's Roman Views rivaled anything Venice could produce . Without Pannini , wrote art critic Herman Voss , " a branch of art which is charming in itself would have been deprived of real perfection . " <P> The French Ambassador to Rome , Cardinal de Polignac , was the first to take Pannini under his wing . He commissioned the grateful painter to portray him standing in St. Peter 's . Later Pannini painted Charles III of Spain in the same setting . Sometimes , even after his reputation was assured , the artist would not refuse to turn an honest penny by decorating a villa , or whipping up cardboard clouds , fountains and triumphal arches for a sumptuous private fete . But apart from these somewhat theatrical preoccupations , most of Pannini 's 74 years were spent among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peopled incongruously with tiny , ineffectual figures dressed in the gay fashions of his own time . <P> It took Gibbon 's imagination to flood Pannini 's wide , quiet ruins with the roaring tide of history : " As I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol , while the barefooted friars were singing Vespers in the Temple of Jupiter . . . the idea of writing the decline and fall of the City first started to my mind . " * <P> <P> *Gibbon was off to an inaccurate start : the monks were singing in the Temple of Juno .
