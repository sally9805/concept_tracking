The U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics last week released some good news about aircraft production and deliveries : <P> Last July 1 , the Navy had 2,172 good , bad and indifferent airplanes . May 1 , the Navy had 3,476 planes . <P> About 600 of the new planes were combat types . The rest were essential trainers . <P> Even more encouraging than the total increase was the rate of deliveries . In the first four months of 1940 , the Navy got 79 new planes . In the last four months , it received 464 . Deliveries during the first four months of this year : 996. * <P> Most surprising , most heartening fact of all was the number bought with money appropriated for the current fiscal year and delivered so far in that year : 735 . <P> This total represented a great achievement by the aircraft industry and by Rear Admiral John Henry ( " Jack " ) Towers , Chief the Bureau of Aeronautics . In the previous fiscal year , the Navy received only 225 airplanes . <P> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big bombers for the U.S. and Great Britain . A contract with Ford Motor Co. to make four-motored Consolidated bombers was in negotiation . Lockheed , Boeing , Douglas will also expand their capacity . Getting machine tools , materials , labor for this belated bomber program is bound to be difficult . At best , the expected rate of bomber production ( 500 a month ) can hardly be attained before mid-1942 . But the need for quantity production of high-load , long-range bombers had at last been recognized , and something was being done to get the planes . <P> <P> * Because of crashes and worn-out planes , the net increase was less than the total deliveries .
