Astronomers get most of their information by studying and analyzing the light of the bright stars . They know almost nothing about the smaller bodies in distant space which are not self-luminous , i.e. , planets , meteors , comets . But they suspect a great deal and are forever looking for proof . Last week , in Science magazine , Russian-born Astronomer Otto Struve , head of the observatories of Chicago and Texas Universities , described some delicate observations that allowed him to spot tiny meteors 250 light years ( about 1,500,000,000,000,000 miles ) away . <P> The brilliant red star Antares ( 450 times the diameter of the sun ) in the constellation of Scorpio is a " double " star . Antares has a comparatively faint blue " companion " which is so close that it is almost impossible to photograph by itself . Irregularities in the earth 's atmosphere make the images of the two stars dance around , forming " tremor discs " of light which overlap on the photographic plate during a long exposure . <P> On certain nights when the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremor discs " become smaller and can be separated . Astronomer Struve watched his chances , and waited for seven years . Last month , McDonald Observatory at Fort Davis , Tex. , had a wonderfully " steady " night . Struve trained the 82-inch reflecting telescope on the Companion of Antares . The image of the Companion trembled hardly at all . In a few rare minutes , he was able to coax it separately into a spectrograph and photograph its spectrum under almost ideal conditions without interference from the brilliant red light of nearby Antares . <P> A study of the spectro-photographs showed Struve several faint lines - which did not come from the Companion itself , but from space around it . Using the exact technique of spectroscopy , he proved that the lines were made by light waves characteristic of iron . <P> What was iron doing in cold space many million miles away from the nearest star ? Struve concluded that both stars , Antares and Companion , must be surrounded by a vast swarm , of meteors , like the iron-nickel meteors which bombard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as wide as the diameter of the sun ( 865,000 miles ) . They may be attracted mainly by the powerful gravitation of massive Antares . But they show up on Astronomer Struve 's spectroscope because intense ultraviolet rays from the hot , blue Companion make them glow with telltale light .
