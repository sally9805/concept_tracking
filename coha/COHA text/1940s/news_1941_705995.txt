txt Aid for Prisoners ' Families Asked For many years friends of the Prison Association of New York have made it possible for us to provide Thanksgiving dinners for mothers , wives and children of men in prison . We hope to do likewise this year . We often hear it said " I feel more sorry for mothers and children at home than for the men in prison , and I should like to do something for them ! " Thanksgiving is a special opportunity to do this . We hope that interested readers will feel that they can give a portion of the needed money . These gifts will help us to bring happiness and new hope to these unfortunate families who are deserving of a little holiday joy . Whatever money is contributed will be used solely for food . Checks should be drawn to C. C. Auchincloss , Treasurer , 135 East Fifteenth Street . E. R. CASS , General Secretary , Prison Association . New York , Nov. 5 , 1941.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
