During its harried 18-month career the Army Air Forces glider program has found the winds of public and official esteem as tricky as the thermal air currents over a mountain peak . Like many another new weapon , the glider was first overlooked , then overdramatized , later overdisparaged . <P> As a result , when the Army recently disclosed that it had temporarily suspended primary glider-pilot training , some conclusion-jumpers assumed that the whole glider program was being quietly washed out . Actually , the Army had done some realistic figuring on how many transport planes it could get to tow its gliders this year , and how many airborne infantry men could be made ready to fly in them . <P> This week its decision could be told : it is now concentrating on advanced and combat training of pilots already in hand . <P> Main combat training center , opened last month , is Bowman Field , Louisville , where advanced pilots will go through a 21-week course aimed to make them " proficient killers , " i.e. , ground fighters as well as airmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking with Army warrant officers ; some are lieutenants or captains . <P> They have had little or no training in fighting procedure , will get it now on a leg-breaking obstacle course , forced marches of 20 miles in five hours , tactical exercises running 48 hours without sleep . Other phases : small arms , infantry tactics , knife wielding , judo and " dirty " fighting . <P> Report from Crete . Off to a belated start in October 1941 , the U.S. glider program was forced into being by public and military outcry after the German air conquest of Crete ; British opinion also demanded a big glider force . Later reports on Crete cooled this enthusiasm so far as the military was concerned ; it appeared that Nazi paratroops and transport planes had done the real damage while their gliders had suffered brutal losses ( best estimate : 50% ) . U.S. officers now think the Germans misused their gliders , flying them directly onto British airfields and strong points instead of landing troops near by with room enough to organize an infantry attack . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Barringer , who was lost in a bomber over the Caribbean last January . Last week the Army called in a civilian expert , Richard C. du Pont ( of the Delaware Du Ponts ) , pioneer sailplane pilot , to take full charge of glider production and training . <P> Thousands of his craft are already in service , from two-seater trainers to troop carriers . Standard CG-4A glider , worked out by the Army and Waco Aircraft , is a burly , 3,600-lb. flying boxcar that carries 15 men , or an armed jeep , or a 105-mm. howitzer to battle . Three can be towed by a single C-47 ( military DC-3 ) transport . <P> The Army will train about 100,000 airborne troops this year ; one airborne division , the 82nd , is nearing combat pitch now . They are trained to fight alongside ground-bound outfits when gliders are not needed . <P> But the pilots who will carry them on airborne invasions are a greater problem . Their craft are strictly weapons of opportunity , may be used a few times , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep these pilots fit for action , once training has been completed , is still an Air Forces problem .
