A sudden , mighty 70-mile-an-hour March wind roared across the prairies of the Northwest one night last week . It swept cars from the highway , sent drivers , blinded by snow and dust , blundering into ditches . In Fargo , N. Dak. the temperature dropped 14 in 15 minutes . <P> Herman Treichel abandoned his car , led his wife and two children to their home . Near exhaustion from bucking the breathtaking wind , he fought his way back to the car and lifted out his six-year-old son . When Treichel got him home , the child was frozen to death . A Northern Pacific locomotive groped into Pembina , N. Dak . The crew discovered they had struck Mike Howry 's daughter , had been dragging her body along on the pilot . Searchers found the frozen body of the girl 's sister near Mike 's home . The storm 's toll : at least 68 dead .
