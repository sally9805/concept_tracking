In California 727 Poles discovered a thing called happiness ; and that children were meant to laugh . There was food , kindness and soap . The 727 , wards of Poland 's Government in Exile , found the barracks of Camp Santa Anita littered and marred by resentful Japanese , who had stayed there en route to relocation centers . To the Poles , fleeing horror since 1939 , the dreary camp was a dream castle full of the miracles of plumbing . In gay groups the children crowded around the toilets , excitedly flushed them again &; again &; again . <P> On their way ( via Russia , Persia , India ) to a haven near Mexico City , these people still had fear in their nerves and panic in their hearts . The first night , not a light glimmered in their barracks until U.S. officers convinced them , after much persuasion , that they need not black out . Then , after the lights had gone on reluctantly , one by one , a transport airliner passed overhead ; the lights vanished as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed out of the barracks , panic-stricken because they could find no bomb shelters . <P> For six days they were guests of the U.S. Army in California . More than 300 children in the group gulped anything edible , fell in love with U.S. Army band music and seven Walt Disney pictures , got 350 pairs of shoes from the good people of Los Angeles , respectfully saluted the U.S. flag with the only salute they knew-the Nazis ' outstretched right arm . <P> Soldiers , serving the refugees in mess line , had no trouble cleaning the place . The Poles indulged in orgies of water and soap ( 1,600 cakes of soap disappeared in four days ) , scrubbed barracks clean as a hospital , did n't discard enough food to cover more than the bottom of one garbage can a day . <P> At sunrise , every morning , the refugees heard Mass under the eucalyptus trees . For the priest ( no one in the group owned more clothes than he wore ) soldiers found vestments at Monrovia and Pasadena . <P> The group left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita , a baby was born .
