Millions of churchgoing men and women are holding interdenominational meetings in united support of the spiritual revival so apparent in our land . Interdenominational gatherings and accomplishments are growing rapidly in the religious side of our wartime life . This is a sign of the same broader spiritual quality that I have seen expanding among our troops . To our men overseas war is not a triumphant thing . As always during trouble , the overwhelming puzzle of survival finally comes to men 's minds . What is it that takes men suddenly and spares others standing within inches , who are saved , no one knows why , and who live to go home and to be with their families and to know once more the simple things of life ? How difficult it is for our men and their loved ones at home to see any pattern in life when they can see no selection in death , no choosing or weighing , no care or mercy , no blessing that can be understood ! To any person who believes in God , faith tells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its blessing . But in war one finds it hard to keep that thought . The will of God seeks its own answer under each man 's eyes overseas today , just as it does at home . It is easy to say that the renewed consciousness of religion in its broadest aspects is only a temporary phenomenon due to the perils and anxieties of war . " War always does this , " I have heard many people say . But I believe that those who feel that way miss the tempo of our people as I see it here on my return home , and of our men as I have seen it overseas , New and gigantic ? and vastly mysterious ? forces have injected themselves into ' every contemplation about this war . We are living as much in a new psychological day as in a new war . This war is as new in a metaphysical sense as in its weapons . And every element has put new emphasis t on the unknown and the unfathomable , As one result , I am convinced , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual smallness in more nearly true proportions . And the natural result is a greater humility , a greater sense of credence in the unfathomable , and a consequent drawing closer to God . In the last war the perils were as great , but the conditioning of our men ? the impact of the war on their minds and contemplation ? was totally different . Our men were , for the most part , drilled to march and shoot . They were trench-bound and mud-bound . In this war , flying and fighting in the stratosphere , looking to one another like men from Mars , watching the fantastic trails of iced vapor twirling in their wake , knowing they are being guided by radar impulses , which surpass any normal understanding , and realizing that countless factors beyond their comprehension are operating in the stillness or the fury on all sides of them , all men acquire a new recognition of the unfathomable . Diving under the sea , listening even to the strange voices of fish never before seen by man , hearing propellers turning many miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses around unseen rocks , shoals , and derelicts , speaking across the surface to a friendly ship with such ease and in such mystery ? all this conditions any man for a wider acceptance of the supernatural . " I simply ca n't understand it , " the boys in the battle zones say . " I simply ca n't understand it . " In the midst of all this the spiritual idea becomes the key of a long enigma . Spiritual contemplation is the simplifier . In the turning to the spiritual the mysterious grows clearer , the confused more plain ; what is complicated tends to stimulate this and to open the door wider to faith . And in the vast bewilderments of this day we and our men overseas , more than we realize , are turning to faith . This reappraisal of our own limitations , our own grain-of-sand place in a staggering universe , has been gradual . But to deny it real permanence is to rebuke the best hope our country has that some basic good may emerge within us in some compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if liberty is to be saved , it will be only by an expansion of the spiritual roots of our people . It will be by the faith of individuals who believe that God intends men to be free but also to be earnest in respect to the spiritual qualities of our nation . Cleverness does not see what meekness sees ; cynicism in families or enterprises or government is blind where faith is not blind at all . Since long before the war we have been living in an age of agitation , pushed and hauled , made to think we had only to think , and growing constantly  | less sure of the eternal truths . We have been the victims of our own intellectuals , for their material plans have so outnumbered their spiritual ideas that we have been smothered by the false assumption that we could not starve if only e had food . This sophisticated estimate of our national life seems to have put a brittle veneer over the true virtues of our national mind and hid these virtues falsea from our view . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news : he thousands on strike compared to the millions who remain quietly at work ; the problem of young people emphasized . n the drama , and sadness of juvenile delinquency , which ignores a thousand times more children than it describes ; the Intemperance of many speeches given by public servants and pleasing to special groups but displeasing and regretted by so many others . The growth of church ttendance and the spiritual revival among our men overseas , reported by haplains everywhere , is , I am convinced , such closer to the real temper of Americans everywhere today . OUR people are prayerful , our men li overseas newly impressed . Our cynics notwithstanding , the real forces pro- 1 ressing in our land and among our troops abroad are the forces for good . And throughout the world nothing is plainer Tian that sympathy with tyranny or with ar may be long in years but that its : ears are numbered . We are advancing n our spiritual life although we who live t this moment are seeing our day in sorrow . The time lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - self . War and peace resolve themselves into a mercury of development . Our better understanding of God is closer : =ow than ever before . The interest of the world is not in the glory of this war . Beyond victory , it is peace , on a scale and with an anxiety ) r attainment beyond anything in the annals of man . The work of the world is devoted to guns and death . The thought of the world is on food and peace . The spiritual quality of man already is truggling to catch up with the scientific enius of the few . That idea itself is epochal . The fact that it is so distinct is the commanding : act . There is no good now enjoyed by Society , including Christianity itself , that as not at one time as problematical and visionary as this . It will happen . It is happening . It now has become so distinct in our country and among our men overseas as to be the feature of this war .  |        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
