Murtagh , recommending such action . The Murtagh report , sent by the Mayor to Thomas F. Farrell , chairman of the Housing Authority since July 1 , charged that Mr. Keller 's association with the owners of thirteen parcels of property acquired by the Authority in connection with its rehabilitation program was inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties . The acquisitions in question were made before Mr. Farrell became chairman of the Authority and began to reorganize the agency . The Murtagh report found that the matter of selecting property for acquisition and rehabilitation was not handled competently by the Authority prior to July 1 .

The Silversteins and Shapolsky , according to the report , paid a total of $9,411 in cash for the eight properties involved , as compared with the total of $73,097 awarded by the Supreme Court .

" The Silversteins , the report declared , are now under indictment on twenty-nine counts charging first-degree arson , second-degree forgery and first-degree perjury . The indictment resulted from fires at 51 Cannon Street , one of the properties inspected and approved by Mr. Keller .
