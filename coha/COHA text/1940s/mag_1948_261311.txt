They were nothing but punks-callow , sullen , foul-mouthed youths . Tuberculous , bespectacled Johnny West was 22 ; he had a thin , bony body , a big nose , a girl 's mouth , and a mind as weak and erratic as a bat 's . Stocky , thick-lipped Robert Daniels was 24 ; there was a look of dull , animal vigor about him and he loved flashy clothes . But he had a psychopathic impulsiveness , an inability to consider consequences . <P> They met in Ohio 's gloomy , overcrowded Mansfield Reformatory . After they were paroled , they joined forces , accumulated an arsenal and stole a 1947 Pontiac . <P> One night early this month they walked drunkenly into a Columbus tavern , yanked out automatic pistols and took $800 in cash and checks from the till . Half an hour later they walked into another bar and began shooting . They killed the owner , wounded a woman customer , jubilantly scooped up another $400 . <P> " This Is a Stickup . " Then they were seized with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill some reformatory guards ? At 1:30 one morning last week they parked their car below the home of the reformatory 's farm superintendent , a burly , middle-aged man named John E. Niebel . They rang the doorbell . <P> When Niebel looked out , Daniels politely asked permission to use the telephone . Then he stepped inside , pulled his pistol , snarled : " This is a stickup . " While West covered the superintendent , Daniels went upstairs , got Niebel 's dumpy wife and his plump , redheaded 22-year-old daughter Phyllis out of bed . The two killers gloated over their frightened victims like vicious children ; demanded that Niebel order a guard named " Red " Harris to come to the house . <P> Niebel refused . The pair ordered the big farmer and the two white-faced women outside and into the car , told them to take off their clothes . The automobile moved off through the darkness , finally pulled up beside a cornfield . Daniels forced the Niebels to walk out among the rustling stalks . " Kneel down , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . West shot Mrs. Niebel in the stomach . His pistol jammed . Daniels shot her in the head . He fired twice more , and Niebel and his daughter toppled over , dying . The two gunmen walked back to their car and drove away . <P> " I 'll Take Care of Him . " The next evening Johnny West began asserting himself . He forced a sedan to the side of the road in the hope of getting false identification and a new getaway car . He leaped out , looked in at a man and woman , said : " You 're going too fast-give me your driver 's license . " The driver , a farmer named James Smith , refused . Johnny West pulled a pistol , shot him through the head . <P> As the killers roared away , still without a new car , they began quarreling bitterly . Daniels , suddenly fearful , railed against West 's wild stupidity . But West was still snarling with braggadocio a few minutes later when they spotted a perfect getaway car-a big Dodge haulaway truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees near the town of Tiffin . The truck driver was asleep . West said : " I 'll take care of him , " and yanked out his pistol again .
