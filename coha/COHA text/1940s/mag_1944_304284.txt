Without firing a shot or uttering one cuss word ( in public ) , the Marine Corps won another notable campaign . Last week the Navy announced that several of its new carriers would be manned by Marine airmen . Their prime mission : support of Marine ground troops in assaults on Pacific beachheads . <P> Although the carriers are baby flattops ( CVEs ) and not big , slick beauties of the Essex class , the Navy 's announcement quieted the Marine air arm 's long clamor for a share in carrier-based flying . Before the war a few Marine outfits had been carrier-based , but by Pearl Harbor they were all flying from land airdromes ; and that was where the Navy left them . <P> Even before Jap air power was finally liquidated in the South Pacific and the war moved to the west , most Marine air outfits found themselves hunting for vanishing game . Life got to be dull and morale flagged . <P> In Washington 's Navy Building , the marines ' clamor for carriers grew . The chorus leader : stubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation . His best refrain : Marine airmen were better qualified to blast the way for their shipmates than flyers of any other service . <P> Louis Woods had gone back to the Pacific ( to be commander of the fourth air wing there ) when the Navy finally handed down its decision , but everything was ready . Promptly the Marine Corps announced that its seafaring air group commander was barrel-chested , 44-year-old Colonel Albert D. Cooley , veteran of Bougainville . Colonel Cooley will never become an admiral : the Marine carriers will be manned and commanded by Navymen . But he will boss a potent striking force : several squadrons of gull-winged , bomb-bearing Vought Corsairs , the first to be put in carrier service . This week his pilots were hard at work at carrier training at a California base , hoped to be ready for sea duty soon .
