Winston Churchill , like most Britons , has done a lot of thinking about the Nazi invasion that may be World War II 's last battle . One thing he does not want to see when that time comes is the helpless confusion that clogged France 's roads , paved the way for German victory last year . Mr. Churchill 's thoughts this week crystallized in a foreword to a leaflet , Beating the Invader , telling 46,000,000 Britons how to behave when and if the Nazis come . <P> Church bells will ring out in warning when the first German troops land on British soil . From radio loudspeakers , from sound trucks racing through the streets , voices will boom , telling Britain 's people what to do . " Give all help you can to our troops , " said the pamphlet . " Do not tell the enemy anything . Do not give him anything . ... If small parties are going about threatening persons or property . . . and they come your way , you have the right of every man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <P> Wrote Winston Churchill in his foreword : " Where the enemy lands , or tries to land , there will be most violent fighting . . . . The fewer civilians . . . in these areas the better . . . . So if you are advised by authority to leave the place where you live , it is your duty to go elsewhere . . . . When the attack begins it will be too late to go . ... Your duty then will be to stay where you are . <P> " You will have to get into the safest place you can find and stay there until the battle is over . . . . This also applies to people inland if a considerable number of parachutists . . . are landed . . . . Above all , they must not cumber the roads . . . . It may easily be some weeks before the invader has been totally destroyed . . . . "                @ @ @ @ @
