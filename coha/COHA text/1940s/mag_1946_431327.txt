 | VETERANS WAnt to be Citizens Condensed from Harper 's N. A. Pelcovits SPECTER is beginning to haunt America ? the little guy with the Golden Eagle badge in his lapel . Showered with fulsome praise by welcoming committees , wooed by every aspirant to public office , and assured that " nothing is too good for our boys , " the veteran has discovered that though the country loves him it does n't quite know what to do with him . Conscious of the tremendous political implications of an electorate exercising ten million Golden Eagle votes , Congress has begun to nibble at the edges of the problem . A grab bag of benefits under the GI Bill of Rights and other piecemeal measures is being doled out . Promises of future bonuses , naively written into the Readjustment Act of 1944 , indicate that the men on Capitol Hill have learned nothing . The best they have So far offered is a new paint job ft the old jalopy , model 1920 . What is fundamentally wrong with our approach to the veteran problem is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ten million individual problems of " readjustment " ; tha each man can be individually ca joled , put off , bribed and somehow - squeezed back into civilian life . The veteran is a displaced person not an unadjusted one , and that i the essence of the problem . The problem is not that of treating the disabled , soothing the neurotic , o giving guidance to problem children and doles to deserving but under privileged paupers . Those are special problems , requiring special consideration . But the general " veteran problem " is that of re-establishing the most vigorous , the most progressive , the most promising section of out population . The old-style plan of palliatives , pensions and promised bonuses will no longer meet veterans ' needs . That is an inescapable conclusion for anv-  | one who has been close to our citizen-soldier during the war years . The veteran sees himself starting civilian life with two strikes against him in the matter of housing , credit in a new community , and debts , and above all in finding a decent job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . And the enemies of democracy ' know it . The would-be Fuhrers are well aware that during the next year a struggle for the soul and vote of the ex-GI will ensue . Capitalizing on his uneasiness and resentment , his initial feeling of being an out ' lander among civilians , they are bidding for his support . The most notorious of these organizations are Gerald L. K. Smith 's " Nationalist Veterans of World War II , " Father Coughlin 's " St. Sebastian 's Brigade , " Joe McWilliams ' " Service Men 's Reconstruction Plan , " and Edward James Smythe 's " Protestant War Veterans . " Their aim is to set the veteran against various sections of the civilian community , feed his resentment ( whispering campaigns of " You 've been played for a sucker again " have come to the ears of this writer ) , promise exclusive rights to better jobs and bigger bonuses ? then use his strength for self-aggrandizement . The struggle for the veteran is now on and the stakes are the highest for which American politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance of the policy of hodgepodge benefits and " veterans ' preferences " which will , at best , create a body of pensioners , unproductive and segregated ; or a plan whereby the veteran is first set on his feet , then totally integrated into the American community of civilians . But how about the widespread view ( not so widespread among the veterans ! ) that the GI Bill of Rights is the most generous and balanced program for veterans in the world ? It may shake the American public to learn that Canada 's mustering-out grants are more liberal than ours and that the Service Men 's Readjustment Act ( GI Bill ) is one of the most lopsided pieces of legislation ever to pass through a Congressional committee . Upon separation , the new civilian receives a maximum cash grant of $300 , if he has served overseas , $200 if he has seen only domestic service . Contrary to rumor , few GIs were able to save much in three to five years of service . Yet it is deemed fitting and proper to throw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 on top of his savings . This to cover the re-establishment of a home , a new wardrobe , furniture , back taxes and enough of a reserve to cover a period of job-hunting . A veteran is even required to pay taxes on income earned while in combat . Special tax law provisions at present do no more than postpone the day of reckoning . Debt is inevitably the first strike against the veteran . Item two in the current program is the re-employment provision of the Selective Service Act . It guarantees the returning service man his  | old job for a year with accrued seniority . Rosy as this sounds , it is a policy based on the dangerous proposition of " veteran preference , " either forcing an ex-service man on an employer who does n't want him or displacing another worker . And this highly touted benefit covers no more than a quarter of returning GIs . With new skills and a broadened outlook , the majority of our new civilians are looking for more promising opportunities than those they left behind . Of 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 22 percent indicated a desire to return to former jobs . The third major plank in the program includes pensions , hospitalization and disability allowances . This is the classic stamping ground of the old-line veteran organizations ; it is principally as proxy for pensioners that they have justified themselves . But these matters , as the Baruch Report on veterans ' administration demonstrated , are not properly part of a veterans ' plan at all ! The disabled veteran is a special charge on the cost of war . Medical and disability services should be divorced from the general administration of veterans ' affairs . STRIPPED of its hospitalization provisions , the GI ? Bill of Rights parades three types of benefits which make up its claim to fame : ( I ) unemployment compensation , called readjustment allowances ; ( 2 ) loans for homes , farms and businesses ; ' , ' 3 ) education aids . Do these add up to a plan for veterans ? Unemployment compensation at the rate of Sao a week for a maximum of 52 weeks is paid a totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he earns over $3 is subtracted from his weekly allowance . Some such provision certainly should be made , but it should not be part of a plan for veterans . It is a social security measure in which all Americans should share in a period of reconversion , unemployment or personal hardship . But how about the loan which the Government gives the veteran ? Contrary to popular impression , the GI Bill did not set up a Government lending agency for veterans . It merely states that when a veteran , within two years of discharge , negotiates a loan for the purpose of building a home , purchasing a farm , or starting a business , the Veterans ' Administration will guarantee to the lender up to 50 percent of the amount borrowed , but in no case will the amount guaranteed exceed $4000 . Interest on the loan must be no higher than four percent . Simple enough , but in practice the security needed has been so hedged about with severe credit requirements that less than Ioo , 000 veterans had availed themselves of loan assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran with good credit standing in his community can negotiate a commercial loan more easily without Government guarantee . The feature of the GI Bill which  | provides for assistance in completing interrupted educations exhibits bold end constructive thinking . And therein lies its danger , as Chancellor lutchins of Chicago University has pointed out . Any veteran whose education was interrupted by military service of at least 90 days is entitled to one to four years of free schooling . Those under 25 years of age when they donned a uniform are automatically eligible for full benefits , while older service men are restricted to one year 's training unless they prove bona fide interruption of their education . Up to $50o in tuition and fees for each academic year is paid to any approved institution chosen by the veteran . In addition , a subsistence allowance of $65 a month ( $75-$90 for those with dependents ) is granted . This phase of the veterans ' program is achieving excellent results . ' loo excellent , alas ! Veterans educated and uneducated , with or without aptitude , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to education as " the best deal . " Thus , the one imaginative , well-administered section of the current program loses its meaning because it is part of an unbalanced whole . SucH is the current program . It is not an integrated plan for welcoming back into civilian society those who should be its most productive and most honored members . Is such a plan possible ? I am firmly convinced that it is . I n the most incisive document published on this problem , the much neglected Baruch Report of September 1945 , we discover two general principles which can serve as the starting point . ( I ) Guard against the danger of setting the veteran off from the rest of the nation , even as a privileged minority . What is good for the whole American people is good for the veteran . ( 2 ) a program for veterans must be divorced from a program for the disabled . The latter require the continuous , loving care of the nation . Given the goal of restoring the returning soldier and sailor to the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . Its cost would not be excessive , considering the importance of solving the veterans ' problem . The Principle of the Clean Slate . Indebtedness is the first bugaboo of the new civilian . All taxes on earned income which became due during military service should be wiped out . All debts to the federal government not exceeding $I000 should be written off upon completion of two years of military service or of any period of service overseas during time of war . Declare a moratorium on all other veteran indebtedness for one year following discharge . The Start in Life Bonus . The time for a bonus is during the veteran 's period of re-establishment and not as an unemployed civilian of 1956 . It should be adequate , reasonable and final . Let us call it a rehabilitation grant . It would be in addition to the present mustering-out pay ( adequate  | for personal clothing and immediate expenses ) and would provide funds for furnishing a home and re-equipping the veteran for a job . The amount : $io for each month 's domestic service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exceed $750 . It would be granted on the understanding that no future bonus could be anticipated . The Veteran Period . It is not until a veteran has a job and a home that his restoration to the community is complete . During the period of reestablishment an expanded and streamlined Veterans ' Administration should be responsible for his welfare and guidance . While undergoing counseling and training , or job hunting , the discharged soldier and sailor would sign a veterans ' payroll entitling him to $ioo a month ( plus $2o for each dependent ) for not exceeding one year . The stipend would be his in full dignity and would not be regarded as unemployment compensation or a dole . Veterans ' RFC . America , which can afford to bolster business through the Reconstruction ' Finance Corporation , can not afford to risk less on its veterans . A simplified , broadened system of veterans ' reconstruction loans should be instituted . Ninety percent of the loan should be guaranteed ( as the California plan provides ) and the period of application extended to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While pursuing his benefits and seeking guidance , the vetera now shuttles between the Veteran Administration , the Selective Serv , ice Board , the USES office and a dozen other agencies . The Veterans ' Administration , with its local offices , should take over all these service ; and act as a clearinghouse . The Principle of No Preference , Having taken advantage of all the services , benefits and guidance out lined above , the veteran would then be on his own , like any other citizen . There would be no further nonsense about veteran preference . Introduced into civilian life on a sound basis , the veteran will prove himself capable of competing with the best of the rest . He constitutes the most vigorous and promising section of . the population . The Principle of E Pluribu.s Unuzn . So far this plan has left out the most important problem facing the veteran ? getting a civilian job . This has been omitted advisedly , for it has no part in a strictly veterans ' program . Job guidance , yes ; job training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . Again the Baruch Report speaks wisely : " Jobs for veterans are inseparable from those for the rest of the population . " And the veterans themselves are increasingly conscious of this . Is America ready to accept such a plan ? If orderly reconversion is to be achieved , something like it must be adopted .
