In the years before Munich Sir Walter Citrine , beaver-eyed , baby-faced boss of the British trade unions , was called a Red-hater . He visited the Soviet Union in 1935 , wrote a chilly book called I Search for Truth in Russia . Late in 1941 , when the Germans were pressing against the western suburbs and the U.S. was not yet in the war , Sir Walter went again to Moscow . He went with a smile , but his hosts remembered and they were chilly . Back in London , he found the faces of the resisting Russians unforgettable . He wrote of the heroic Red Army , the magnificent sacrifices . <P> When Sir Walter arrived in Moscow last week the papers called him " Tovarish . " Theatergoers stood up to cheer when they saw Trade Union Chief Shvernik steer him into a box to watch a performance of Tolstoy 's Anna Karenina . <P> Sympathy . Sir Walter had a tough assignment . The Russians knew it and were sympathetic . He had to try to sell a makeshift compromise instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed and Sir Walter had promoted . The compromise : that the Anglo-Russian Trade Union Committee continue , that the Anglo-A.F. of L. Trade Union Committee continue , that the British carry such messages as may be necessary between A.F. of L. officials and the Russians . Sir Walter had visited the U.S. in February , found the A.F. of L. , with which the British have long had fraternal relations , still adamantly against direct dealings with Russians . He found the C.I.O. cool toward relations with the Russians , cold toward joining an A.F. of L. - dominated committee . Before he returns to London this time , Sir Walter will know whether his patient trotting back &; forth has sufficed to keep open the way toward eventual direct three-way collaboration . <P> The long view explains Anglo-Russian attempts to maintain cordial trade-union relations in spite of their failure to interest U.S. trade unionists . A new international federation of labor is in the cards for the postwar years . Sir Walter , like many another Briton and many a Russian official , hopes for a three-way arrangement at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure at least a two-way understanding . <P> Symptoms . The gropings toward labor unity were symptomatic of other attempts to secure Anglo-American-Russian postwar collaboration . Said cautious U.S. Ambassador William Standley in Moscow last week : " Postwar cooperation is absolutely essential if we are to win the peace . " <P> Said youthful , straight-talking Senator Joe Ball of Minnesota : " All the nations are working on two types of peace plan : one based on the assumption that the U.S. will cooperate to organize and preserve peace ; the other on the assumption that while the U.S. may give lip service it will not really do anything to help it along . . . . England will have no alternative but to make arrangements with the Soviets unless this country comes out firmly for cooperation . "
