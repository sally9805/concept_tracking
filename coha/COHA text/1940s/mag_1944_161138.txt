At Goose Bay , Labrador , one day last week Lieut . Colonel Bert Raymond John ( " Fish " ) Hassell . C.O. of the Air Transport Command base there , stood on the mile-long runway , waved goodbye to another batch of bombers headed over Greenland 's icecap for Europe . Said he : " There they go , doing what I did n't do . " <P> In 1928 " Fish " Hassell , then a barnstormer , tried to show that it was easier to fly to Europe via the North Atlantic route than any other way . He borrowed money at his home-town bank in Rockford , Ill. , took off in a Stinson single-engine monoplane . He refueled in Ontario , headed for Greenland . He made it , but not where he had planned , and was forced to land on the icecap . He walked out , leaving his wrecked plane behind him . Two months ago an Army pilot spotted an old crate sitting on the icecap . He circled and took pictures . " Fish " identified his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perpetual glacier had failed to swallow Hassell 's plane .
