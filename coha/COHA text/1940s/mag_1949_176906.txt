The Toscanini-trained musicians of the NBC Symphony Orchestra blinked , then stared : Was it Frank Sinatra ? At first glance , the boyish-looking , new guest conductor was a dead ringer for Frankie : wispy , wire-thin , sallow-cheeked and dark-haired . But when 28-year-old Guido Cantelli stepped to the podium and rapped his baton , the jokes stopped . By the time Guido had driven them through bar-by-bar rehearsals of Hindemith and Haydn without looking at a score-gesturing and singing fa-sol-la-tis to make up for his lack of English-musicians were murmuring about " terrific talent . " <P> Cried one hoarse but happy observer-Arturo Toscanini-as he shuffled from his aisle-seat listening post in Studio 8H : " Now here is a conductor-a good conductor . " Last week , after Guido had finished his first NBC Symphony concert , listeners agreed . <P> Arturo Toscanini had dug up many an obscure piece of Italian music , but this was the first time in many a year he had unearthed a new Italian conductor-one who " conducts like I do , " which means with precision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Guido when he arrived in Italy for a visit last spring . He had slipped quietly in on a rehearsal in Milan , where his friend Violinist Nathan Milstein was rehearsing the Brahms Violin Concerto with the La Scala orchestra , and had been so impressed with the work of its Conductor Cantelli that he came back for a second time , then for the concert . Toscanini decided that Guido had been born to conduct . <P> If not born to it , Guido certainly got an early start . His bandmaster father let him conduct his band from a table top at the age of five . At 20 , when he had graduated from Milan 's Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory , he conducted at the Teatro Coccia at Novara-a theater that the young Toscanini had inaugurated in 1889 . <P> During the war Guido was drafted into the Italian army , was later packed off by the Germans to a labor camp in Frankfurt . When he got home , he weighed only 80 pounds . Now married and heavier , quick-humored Guido is delighted with his chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bashful about his performance . Said he last week : " With this orchestra , there is no impassable level . If I could only express myself in English , I think I could get more from them . "
