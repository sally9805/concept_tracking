THE main road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is cut by Arab-held territory in the neighborhood of Latrun . It is here that the Jews built their " Burma Road " during the fighting before the first truce , going out at night with shovels and bulldozers to hack and blast a way through the rough growth and over rocky hills and wadies , exchanging tools for guns to fight off raids , and in a few weeks of incredible effort making a passable road , detouring Latrun , over which light convoys could carry supplies in comparative safety . The Burma Road saved Jerusalem . When I traveled it , the chief hazard was dust , dust axle-deep , rising in opaque clouds around every vehicle . People riding in closed cars covered their faces with handkerchiefs and their heads with scarves to keep a fraction of the dust out of eyes and nose and throat . I traveled in Moshe Pearlman 's jeep , open to the sky ! I even drove the jeep over part of the Burma Road , feeling as I would if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mother looking on . He did not flinch , but he took the wheel over the toughest stretch . Bartley Crum shared the jeep for most of the trip and agreed that it was the only way to see and feel the Burma Road . At the various road-blocks along the way our passes were carefully checked by Israeli guards . Going back next day , we were stopped at a new place . After a lot of argument between Pearlman and several young soldiers , two of them , a boy and girl , climbed aboard and rode with us into Tel Aviv . Later Pearlman told me they were Palmach youngsters who wanted a lift to town ; that was all . The road-block was a bluff , he was dead sure ; also he was n't supposed to carry unauthorized passengers , but he decided not to make an issue of it . Privately I wondered what he could have done about it if he had wanted to be sticky ; rank he had , but the Palmach , commando unit of the Haganah , is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest fighting , lost the best of its members  --  and has a lusty assurance and pride that are difficult to counter . THE Eden Hotel is the way it always was  --  neat , mod -- est , quiet ; it has nice bed-sitting-rooms . And baths . I peeled off my clothes , stiff with sweat and dust . In the bathroom was a pail , two-thirds full , and a dipper . That was the water ration for all purposes for twenty-four hours . The mind is always less imaginative than the body . I knew all about the shortage of water in Jerusalem ; I had just by-passed the Arab-held pumping station ; I had even talked with a young soldier-engineer December 25 , 1948 whose job was to wrestle with the inadequate , improvised substitute system , but the partly filled pail in my bathroom was what really made Jerusalem 's siege take on substance . I squandered perhaps three cups of water on removing the Burma Road from my face and ears and let it go at that . The streets of Jerusalem were almost empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the sniping and shelling from Arab positions in the Old City and on the hills outside . When we drove over to call on Dr. Bernard Joseph , the military governor , I asked hun about it . He grinned . " There 's shelling and sniping , yes , " he said . " But nobody pays any attention to it . Wait until sundown and you 'll see . This is the Sabbath . " After sundown the city came suddenly to life ; the streets were flooded with people , a few shops opened , and I felt foolish . Nobody who has lived through the siege is afraid of bullets . Dr. Joseph is tough , efficient , intelligent , remarkably farsighted . His story of the battle of Jerusalem , from inside , was very different from even the best newspaper accounts . For the first time I got a sense of the city 's isolation during the siege , especially in the terrible weeks before the Burma Road was built , when no food convoys got through and the water ration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cut off not only from the world but from Tel Aviv , and to this day its people are sure that no one outside understands what the city went through . Perhaps it will be put under international rule , as the United Nations has decided , but I can testify that the feeling of the people toward such an arrangement will be one of bitter indignation . To them Jerusalem is more than the ancient capital and symbol of Judaism ; it is the city they fought for , and held under fire , through many weeks of hunger and thirst and in-. tense self-discipline . Joseph knew what would happen before it began ; in February he ordered the city 's cisterns cleaned , filled , and sealed . This meant that when the road was cut and the pumps at Latrun were taken by the Arabs , a small auxiliary supply of water was available . Even while the British were still in ostensible control , a Jewish administration already had the situation in hand . Unfortunately , the Jews had to operate against British opposition ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective to prevent Arab assaults , bombings , and the waylaying of convoys . When the British pulled out of Jerusalem on May 14 , they deliberately left their administrative apparatus in chaos , physically destroying records , even postage stamps , and turning over as much material and power as possible to the Arab Legion operating as " police . " That smooth " transition " under U. N. control , planned at Lake Success , was effectively sabotaged on the ground by the Mandatory Power . Despite all this , Joseph and his colleagues and the 719 Jewish forces in Jerusalem held the New City , although they were unable to relieve the handful of Jews trapped in the Old City . When their ammunition gave out , these men surrendered to the Legion ; by that time the whole Jewish quarter with its ancient synagogues a ri d monuments had been pounded to rubble by Arab shells and mortars . In the New City Bernard Joseph , appointed military governor , put into effect a system of rationing that insured every living creature an equal share of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discipline of the people and proud of the controls he established . Because of the courage of Jerusalem 's defenders  --  including the men who built the Burma Road  --  the city survived . But only by a hair . W ITH Pearlman and Sternberg of the press office , we visited various fronts  --  though in fact the whole area is a front . One of the most interesting is Em Karem , a magnificent hilltop position taken by the Israelis during their rapid advance after the first truce . It was the recapture of this hill that gave the Jewish army command of a wide corridor on either side of the Burma Road , establishing for the first time relatively safe communications . We ate a regular army meal in the huge monastery ( monasteries crown almost every height in the neighborhood of Jerusalem ) that now shelters the Israeli forces stationed there . The food was well-cooked , plentiful , and terribly heavy . Walking with the commander toward a lookout post at the edge of the hill , I wandered a few feet off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back sharply , and I realized for the first time that we were being steered along a narrow path somewhat protected from Arab bullets . When we reached the lookout post he showed us the Arab positions . They hold every commanding height around the city , except for this one . Below us sheltered by the hill was the village of Ein Karem , one of the loveliest Arab villages near Jerusalem . When the Israelis drove out the Arab forces , most of the people fled , but a few were still living in the courtyard of the old Franciscan church that stands on the spot where John the Baptist is supposed to have been born . The genial Spanish priest who welcomed us talked freely to Bartley Crum about the behavior of the Jews . He said the soldiers had been orderly and respectful ; the holy 720 The NATION sites had been placed out of bounds ; the houses abandoned by the Arabs had been locked and an Israeli custodian appointed to protect the villagers who remained . As we walked through the courtyard an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking her fist and gesturing toward the door of her house . Sternberg speaks Arabic well . The woman dragged him into the house and pointed upstairs . There a young woman stood , leaning over the rail ; she shouted too . " It 's a complaint against an Israeli soldier , " Sternberg told me ; he looked troubled . From the fierce indignation I could imagine nothing less serious than rape . Finally Sternberg spoke to the women in a calm voice , nodded his head , and we left . " In heaven 's name , what ? " I asked ; the incident seemed an ominous epilogue to the priest 's reassurances . " They say the lid of their primus stove has disappeared ; they believe an Israeli took it . I told them I would inquire , and if it was true I 'd try to get it back . " I must have looked astonished . " That 's the way they always are , " he said . " They are very poor . It means something to them . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back fast . The commander gave our driver explicit instructions . " The road is completely exposed to sniping from ? to ? , " he said . " We watched you as you came up . You drove slowly and one car followed right after the other . Arab snipers seldom hit the first car ; they 're apt to aim short . But the second often gets it . Keep apart and move right along . " It was almost dusk when I reached Notre Dame . This monstrous block of masonry Is a French hospice which stands just across the street from the New Gate of the Old City . We had reached it on foot by a devious route to avoid snipers , for it faces Arab-held areas on two sides . Notre game is the chief Israeli strong point inside Jerusalem . Its upper windows are gun emplacements and observation posts ; its floors are connected by ladders through rough openings made for the purpose , its thick stone walls serve as fortifications . A young officer led me through the great echoing chapel , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposition of men and equipment . At some points we talked normally ; at others he warned me to walk quietly and not speak because Arab troops held the building directly across the court and would start shooting or lobbing mortars over if they heard voices . We came into a hallway that ended in a gaping hole where a shell had torn away the entire corner of the building ; one could walk out into the open as if the hall were a porch . But when I started to do so the officer grabbed my arm . " That 's in full view of the Arab post , " he whispered . Down below in the huge basement library of Notre Dame , used as a mess by the Israeli troops , two French truce observers sat at a table industriously making notes . Nobody paid any attention to them . What , I wondered , came of this daily chronicle of falling shells and mortars ? The young Frenchmen conferred and scribbled in the dim light . And out beyond the walls , a few feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ? frequently at truce observers . The authority of the United Nations did not seem very impressive in the basement of Notre Dame . TOWARD morning I became conscious of the thud of gun fire . It was n't loud . It sounded dull and remote and almost harmless . I listened as I would to distant thunder . It stopped and I went back to sleep , but when I wakened again it was to the same sound . A friend met me , after an early cup of coffee , to take me to Hadassah 's two hospitals in the city . " You heard the firing ? " I asked . " It was n't much , " he said , " about as usual . " He brushed it off . We went first to the French convent where a complete emergency hospital had been fitted out below ground . It was used during active shelling and heavy raids . Smiling nuns greeted us and expressed their pleasure at being able to help the Israelis by giving space and shelter . It took courage to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs had driven out the defenders . We walked across the courtyard and a nun pointed to a three-inch shell , half buried in the paving . " Do n't touch it , " she said . " It did n't explode but it might . It hit only a couple of hours ago . " She was perfectly calm . The other hospital is above ground and in regular use . The physician in charge took particular pains to show us every detail because my companion was a famous South African plastic surgeon who had come to Israel to offer his services to the army . Though much of the equipment was improvised , the hospital was well supplied and beautifully kept . As we went through the big waiting-room on our way out , the street door opened and several people hobbled in , bandaged and bloody . Nurses took them to a far corner where a couple of operating tables were ready . They began peeling off bandages and torn clothing . Two stretchers were carried in ; on them lay old women , bleeding badly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face gray . The doctor in charge looked at us and shook his head . More came on foot , a boy and an old man helped in by friends . Each was hurried off for emergency treatment . " Where are they from ? " asked the surgeon . The doctor shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't know . Katamon , perhaps . This morning 's shelling . Obviously they 're from a workers ' quarter , but it might have been anywhere . " I made myself look again at the moaning woman , the red coming through her apron , her head moving feebly from side to side . The sound of gunfire , distant and abstract in my hotel room , translated itself sharply into blood and the death of old working people. ,
