The San Francisco conference has only one job-to draft a charter for a postwar organization of " peace-loving states . " Unlike Versailles after World War I , it is not a peace conference ; that will come later . Such matters as Poland may come up at San Francisco , but they are not the primary business of the conference . <P> Its primary business is to consider and complete the outline of a world charter drawn up last fall by representatives of the U.S. , the Soviet Union and Great Britain at Dumbarton Oaks , a private estate in Washington . China also signed the Dumbarton Oaks proposals , but they are the Big Three 's work . Originally incomplete , even as an outline , Dumbarton Oaks now includes additions agreed on at Yalta by Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin , and others ( filling out the sketchy world court section ) prepared in Washington by a committee of jurists . <P> The main emphasis of Dumbarton Oaks , including its amendments , is on the structure of a world organization , rather than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates rests largely on power-the power of the U.S. , Russia , Britain . In this structure : <P> The General Assembly , out of deference to world opinion , is given top billing , but it is definitely second in power and importance to the Security Council . <P> As projected at Dumbarton Oaks , the Assembly is to be an international forum , not a world legislature . Every member of the organization is to be automatically a member of the Assembly , free to " discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security " and to make recommendations on such matters as disarmament . But if the Assembly wants action taken , it must appeal to the Security Council . <P> The Assembly admits new members to the organization , suspends or expels offending members , and elects the important Secretary-General , the chief administrative officer . But all these actions require the " recommendation of the Security Council . " <P> In four other respects , the Assembly stands on its own feet : it approves the budgets of the organization , elects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen members of the Economic and Social Council , supervises subsidiary social and economic agencies , and promotes cooperation in " political , economic and social fields " - without interference from the Security Council . <P> In the Assembly each state has one vote , subject to possible changes , caused by Russia 's demand for three votes . <P> The Security Council has eleven members . Five of them-the U.S. , Russia , Britain , France , and China-have permanent seats . The other six memberships are elective and temporary . <P> The drafters of Dumbarton Oaks frankly proposed that the Council , rather than the Assembly , should have " primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security . " The Council may ( not must ) " investigate any dispute , or any situation which may lead to international friction " ; but all members promise to seek a solution of disputes through negotiation , mediation , judicial settlement , or ' ' other peaceful means . " The main job of the Council is to press the parties to settle disputes by themselves . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into action .
