When he played master of ceremonies on a quiz show last season , Groucho Marx worked a radio wonder by winning the prized Peabody Award as the best comedian on the air . This week he worked another one . After Variety had reported that giveaways are giving way to " entertainment without the gimmicks , " Groucho sold his radio giveaway , You Bet Your Life ( Wed . 9 p.m . E.S.T. , CBS ) , to a new sponsor ( De Soto ) for five years starting Jan. 1 . <P> The Marxian formula is simple , scriptless , and enormously successful . Each couple of contestants ( three for each half-hour show ) is given $20 and a chance to bet on their answers to questions in a given field . Quizmaster Groucho perches on a stool by the microphone , and chats with them between questions . He encourages them to tell their life stories , and as they talk , he festoons the impromptu dialogue with strings of rapid-fire gags , or simply guides his victims into verbal traps and lets them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " says Marx , carefully flicking cigar ashes on his grey slacks . " They talk a lot . And the older women talk more than the younger ones . They make great contestants , but I 'd hate to be married to one of them . " * <P> Incorrigible Punster Marx often uses the double play on words-no matter how obvious it is-to make his misanthropic points ( " I used to think a dowry was where you got milk-until I got married . I got milked plenty then " ) . He can affect poor hearing if it will make a gag go : once he pretended to think a woman described herself as a " monster " instead of a " spinster " ( " Oh well , " he said , winding up the whole discussion , " there is n't a great deal of difference " ) . <P> After the breakup of the stage &; screen team of the Marx Brothers ( The Coconuts , Animal Crackers , A Night at the Opera ) , Groucho was on &; off radio for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Then Producer John Guedel saw him ad lib for ten minutes on a network show when Bob Hope accidentally dropped his script . Shortly thereafter Guedel put Groucho into You Bet Your Life . He still has some qualms : " Having Groucho as emcee of a quiz show is like using a Cadillac to haul coal . " <P> But Groucho likes it fine . " In the old days they almost threw me off the air if I deviated from the script , " he says . " I had to sign a written pledge that I would read only what was before me . But now I 'm doing what comes naturally . It 's like stealing money $3,000 a week to get paid for this . " <P> <P> * Groucho , 54 , has been married to second wife Kay Dittig , 27 , for four years .
