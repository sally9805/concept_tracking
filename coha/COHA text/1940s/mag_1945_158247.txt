In a London studio , TIME Correspondents Dennis Scanlan and Hans Kahle listened intently to a recording of Adolf Hitler 's New Year 's speech . Certain phrases they played over &; over , or compared with similar phrases in recordings of other Hitler speeches . They were sleuthing in sound , trying to unravel a mystery that had the British press agog : was this New Year 's orator really Adolf Hitler ? <P> In long passages the voice flowed on , flat and didactic , as if it were weak and being nursed along : " The National Socialist State - our 2,000-year-old civilization - can neither be replaced by Bolshevism nor by democratic-p'utocratic ideology . . . . This nation . . . and its leading men are unshakable in their will and unswerving in their fanatical determination to fight this war to a successful conclusion . . . . " <P> The recording was stopped . Another ( a 1942 speech ) was put on . There were the same old phrases , the same bombast , the same guttural sarcasm . There could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonized perfectly . There was only one difference : Hitler 's 1945 voice lacked the fire of three years ago , but the fury remained . <P> The record scratched on : <P> " I know , meine Volksgenossen " - there was the nasal Austrian accent- " I know , meine Volksgenossen , what this war is demanding of you . ... I , more than anybody else , know . ... I also know that German towns will again rise from the ruins . . . more beautiful than ever . . . . " <P> An echo quavered in the recording-a half-second acoustic echo , revealing to expert ears that this speech had been delivered in an acoustically treated room . It could not have been pieced together from scraps of other speeches . And there was other evidence : references to such recent events , a continuity in thought : <P> " The year 1944 . . . proved once and for all that the bourgeois social order was no longer in a position to defy the storms of the present or the gales of tomorrow . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . To hold the opinion that this upsurging of peoples can be met by proletarian-democratic compromises is childish . . . . " <P> And the peroration , though not as full-throated as in the past , had the high hypnotic timbre ; <P> " I am at present speaking less frequently , not because I do not want to speak . . . but because my work leaves little time for speeches . ... I have not been sleeping . ... I promise solemnly to the Almighty that the hour will strike when victory will come to the Greater German Reich . " <P> This was the old shrill cry ; it was unmistakably Hitler .
