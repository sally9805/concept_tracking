txt Giant Static on Dodger Radios Giant fans can chalk up a big black mark against their sportsmanship after the disgraceful incident staged at the Polo Grounds on Monday night when the service benefit game was halted in the ninth inning . All who listened over the radio were amazed at the continued booing during the playing of the national anthem . Had the Giants been ahead at the end of the eighth and Brooklyn had lost , it would have been different , of course . And yet the fans knew the rules . A Brooklyn-St . Louis game was called at 9:10 o'clock one night last week . Every Brooklyn fan regretted winning a game this way . But it was the Giant adherents who booed while " The Star-Spangled Banner " was being played , and no Giant fan can ever live down the disgrace embodied in that episode . A Dome FAN . Brooklyn , Aug. 5 , 1942 . Editorial Note : It was all a. mistake and it is n't going to happen again .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
