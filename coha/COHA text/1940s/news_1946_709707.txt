txt Exploration of the atom  --  that elusive wisp of matter  --  will be organized here in what is planned to be one the nation 's most exhaustive re-of searches into the composition of material energy . Natural scientists of the universities and colleges of the eastern seaboard and adjoining inland areas soon will be invited to participate in the studies , according to Dr. George B. Pegram , Dean of Columbia University graduate facilities . Collective Action . With its objective the ultimate betterment of the human race , an atomic research center under sponsorship of eastern universities with Government co-operation will be established on Long Island . Although the sponsoring universities are Columbia , Harvard , Cornell , Yale , Princeton , Johns Hopkins , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the University of Pennsylvania , and the University of Rochester , this was for purposes of incorporation only . " The sponsors have no intention of restricting research to their own staffs . We want all the universities and colleges of our Atlantic area to help in this work , " Dr. Pegram said . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge , Tenn. , the University of Chicago , and the University of California at Berkeley . " We may overlap somewhat with the others , but there is so much work to be done , this is not likely . " according to Dr. Pegram . Purposes of the New York center will be to engage in fundamental studies in the nature of matter for the ultimate gain of the race . " We want to expand our knowledge of the atom . We want to find how matter reacts , " Dr. Pegram declared . Full publicity will attend the program in the nature of regular reports . Although the United States Government is strongly concerned in the research , most of the work will be done by civilian members of university staffs . It is hoped that universities and colleges will want to send their researchists here to help in this undertaking . Dr. Pegram stressed the difficulties experienced by the Government in securing scientific personnel on a civil-service basis . Pure Research Research in the realm of physics will not occupy the full attention of the researchists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies will be carried on . In the main , however , the secret of material energy which has been the goal of natural scientists for centuries , . remains their chief target . Fundamentally the center will carry on what is known as " pure research . " At the moment organization of the center is still being carried on . For that reason the physical plant has not been wholly planned . There is a possibility a cyclotron similar to the University of California 's great machirz in the Berkeley Hills would be constructed here . But this is not decided . " We will have a chain reaction pile  --  controlled nonexplosives " Dr. Pegram said . The first was established at the University of Chicago in 1942 . Incorporation of the center has been done under the name , " Associated Universities , Inc . " These being the nine sponsors . " Someone had to get the project going , " said Dr. Pegram , who was chairman of the incorporating committee . Offices will be at Columbia .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
