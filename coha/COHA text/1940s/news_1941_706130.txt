txt Though the German armies in Russia have not been destroyed , they have failed in their primary objective . This was to destroy the armed forces of the Soviets . They have also failed in their secondary objectives , which were to reach the southern oil fields and to take Moscow before the coming of cold weather . The attempt has cost them dearly . And with this failure added to the entrance of the United States into the war , it must be a dull German who does not wonder whether something has gone wrong . Is this the explanation of the sudden mysterious removal of Field Marshal von Brauchitsch as Commander in Chief of the German Army and the assumption of superior command by the man who describes himself as " the statesman Adolf Hitler " ? Certainly it is possible that Hitler , relying on German confidence in the infallibility of his " inner call " and his " intuition " and the dynamics of his " fanatical will power , " has sought to allay anxiety among his people by taking command himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia against the soldier whose task it was to execute his orders . It is also possible that the suspected rift between the Nazi party and the Army has been widened by the Russian failure and that Hitler does not wholly trust his high command . A third possibility is that Hitler is dreaming dreams of new campaigns which the hardheaded army men are reluctant to attempt to carry out . In any case Hitler has strained the legend of his infallibility pretty far , even for the German people . The year is almost gone , and the Nazi leaders themselves have stopped promising that the war is nearly over . Yet when 1941 began Hitler pledged his countrymen that it would bring victory and an end to all their hardships and privations . In his New Year 's Day proclamation he made the unequivocal statement : " The year 1941 will bring consummation of the greatest victory in our history . " At the end of January , on the anniversary of his assumption of power , he boasted : " The year 1941 will be the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In mid-March , at the annual German Memorial Day services , he promised that the year 1941 would " end what started the year before . " And in mid-April , celebrating his own birthday , he echoed the confidence of Dr. Goebbels that victory was " already as good as assured . " Again , at the outset of the Russian campaign , he promised his people that this would be the decisive battle for the establishment of the " New Order , " and still more recently he assured them that the resistance of Russia " is already broken and will never rise again . " Even the regimented people of Germany must be aware of the obvious inconsistencies between these statements and the recent semi-hysterical wheedling pleas for greater sacrifices on their part , in order to overcome an enemy superior in numbers to , and better equipped than , the hitherto invincible German Army . How long will it be before the German people isolate and identify and destroy Hitler himself as the root-cause of all their suffering ?         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
