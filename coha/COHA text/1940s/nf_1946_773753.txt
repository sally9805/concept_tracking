The open field for the Greek Revival , therefore , lay in places which were just becoming architecture-conscious , or which were just entering on their periods of prosperity like the cities of Ohio and western New York , and in Massachusetts such towns as New Bedford , Worcester , and Nantucket . Nevertheless , even the older cities soon felt the new influence , and those which like Boston were still growing yielded to it entirely . Sympathy for the Greeks in their fight for independence together with Lord Byron 's espousal of their cause gave added impetus and a flood of classical Greek place names like Ithaca , Utica , Syracuse , Athens , Troy , and so forth , deluged New York State and other parts of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents as the removal of the " Elgin Marbles " in 18o1 . In that year Lord Elgin , British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte , obtained permission to remove from the Acropolis of Athens " a few blocks of marble with inscriptions and figures . " With the aid of several hundred men from the fleet and numerous laborers the noble lord proceeded to remove most of the sculptured metopes , frieze , and tympanum of the Parthenon together with part of the front of the Erechtheion and one of the caryatides from the south porch ( which was later replaced with a brunette substitute of terra cotta ) , put them aboard the fleet , and shipped them to the British Museum . This feat received great popular acclaim . Boston , about 1820 , had 43,298 inhabitants , and was just getting into its stride ; it was growing rapidly , many new and important buildings were required , and a new crop of GREEK REVIVAL 2I modern-minded professional architects sprang into being to meet the demand . No more old red brick buildings for them ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger element of the population who were glad to escape from the dogma of the Federalist style , and who fell with delight upon the new ideas . The typical feature of the Greek Revival is the temple front , with its stately columns and dignified pediment . No building in this style can ever go very far wrong , at least in the opinion of the public . Whether it is 183o or 1946 , all building committees like columns . The new and wealthy Episcopal parish of St. Paul 's built a costly new church on Tremont Street in 1819 from designs by Alexander Parris and Solomon Willard . The beautiful Ionic capitals were carved by Willard himself . Sufficient stone was left in the tympanum for a bas-relief of " Paul Before Agrippa , " which still remains unexecuted . The material of the front is Acquia Greek sandstone from Virginia , the same stone that was used for the original part of the Capitol at Washington , which is now painted white . It has an agreeable color , but is not very resistant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's merit is the way it ages ; if that is so , St. Paul 's will rank high , for the years have mellowed its facade into one of the most appealing fronts in the city , although when it was finished the expectations of the proprietors are said to have been disappointed with the simplicity of the design and its unimportant site , and sidewalk critics compared its columns , which were built up in " drums , " to " a collection of grindstones . " It is good to know that in spite of the value of its site for business purposes its preservation seems to be assured for a long time to come . Alexander Parris was the architect of the Quincy Market development , carried out during the years 1824 to 1826 under Mayor Josiah Quincy . It was a remarkable achievement for that time , or any time . The old and picturesque // buildings around the inner harbor were demolished , the docks were filled up , and on the land thus gained a new market district was built , of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central feature . Architecturally the remarkable thing about the operation was its completeness . Not only was the market house itself handsome and so well planned that one hundred and twenty years later it is still useful and practical , but the new and wide streets which surround it were entirely built up with granite buildings of uniform design and height , forming a new quarter of almost European finish . The fact that succeeding perverse generations have mutilated this handsome composition by changing the roof lines and covering the fronts with incongruous signs should not be allowed to detract from the credit of those who saw and carried out the project in a big and truly architectural way . This really splendid new quarter , though built as an enterprise of the city , not only was accomplished without any burden upon the city 's pecuniary resources but contributed large additions to its real and productive property . The regular appearance of the blocks of stores on North and South Market streets was accomplished by requiring purchasers of lots on the new streets to erect within a limited time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whose height and design were to conform to the plan drawn by Alexander Parris . The commodious width of the streets , 65 and Ioz feet respectively , was made possible by applying the principle of excess condemnation by which the city was able to condemn entire estates , reselling what was not needed for the streets , a principle which modern obstructionists frequently try to oppose as illegal . The market house , with its pedimented porticoes at each end , its monolithic columns , and its central dome , is a very fine example of the Greek Revival in its early period . The columns , 20 feet q inches long , are among the earliest examples of the monolithic t ' he in Boston . // This study of nineteenth-century Boston architecture would fail in its purpose if some lessons were not drawn from it , and the lesson of the Quincy Market development is the permanent value of seeing such projects in a big and monu-mental way . Alexander Parris ( 1780 ? 1852 ) 1 was born in Hebron , Maine . His parents early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a carpenter . Like most other architects of his period , he was self-trained , and during his period of apprenticeship he studied Peter Nicholson 's Principles of Architecture . Prior to 1812 he worked in Port-land , Maine , where in 1805 he built the Hunnewell house , of which the drawings are extant . During the War of 1812 he was captain of a company of engineers and was stationed at Plattsburg , New York . In 1816 he designed the David Sears house on Beacon Street , Boston , now the Somerset Club ; the panels on its front were carved by Solomon Willard . This house origi-nally had a pitched roof and only one circular bay , but was enlarged by adding the second bay and top story at a later date . St. Paul 's Church followed in 1819 , and in the years from 1819 to 1829 Parris worked largely with Loammi Baldwin on the dry dock at the Boston Navy Yard and on various sea walls and other works in Boston Harbor . In 1823 he was acting for Charles Bulfinch as superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built the Quincy Market development . Other works of his were the Lyman house at Mt . Vernon and Joy streets , the Marine Hospital in Chelsea , the First Parish Church at Quincy , many houses on Beacon , Summer , and Tremont streets , a number of lighthouses , and part of the Watertown Arsenal . His name is listed in the 1818 directory as " architect and engineer , " and in the 1840 directory as " architect h. rear // 56 Poplar . " In 1 848 he was appointed civil engineer of the Navy Yard at Portsmouth , New Hampshire . After his death , which occurred at Pembroke on June A , 1852 , the Boston Traveler of June 23 , published an obituary containing the following characterization : Eminently endowed by nature with a commanding intellect and a refined taste , he added to them on all occasions an urbanity of manner and integrity of purpose which made him respected in society and esteemed in business . He was too honest and generous to be wealthy . . . and he never had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague on St. Paul 's Church , was the designer of Bunker Hill Monument . The cornerstone was laid by General Lafayette in 1825 ; the monument was completed in 1843 and was dedicated by Daniel Webster . Its obelisk form is , of course , Egyptian , although its construction occurred at the height of the Greek Revival ; this would be difficult to explain , except that there seems to have been a side current in the Egyptian style going on at the same time , possibly due to a notion that Egyptians and Greeks were all about the same anyhow . As a matter of fact , a competition for the design was held , with a prize of $loo , and fifty designs were submitted . A long discussion ensued as to the comparative merits of the column form ( Trajan 's column to be exact ) or the obelisk ; eventually the latter won by a vote of i i to 5 . As is common with architectural competitions the affair had the makings of a controversy , since Robert Mills of South Carolina , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a design in company with Horatio Greenough , the Boston sculptor , and claimed that they originated the obelisk idea . The matter has long since been relegated to oblivion , but apparently Mills 's drawing , which , it seems , " was on a large scale , and finished in oil // colors , with a distant view of Boston in the background , " 2 was never returned to him . This carelessness was certainly discreditable to the trustees , and Mills and Greenough can-not be blamed for their assertion that their design was plagiarized , though after some correspondence they decided to drop the matter . The experience which Mills gained in this affair was doubtless useful to him when he came to de-signing the Washington Monument . In comparison with Bunker Hill , which is 221 feet high and 30 by 30 feet square at the base , the Washington obelisk is 555 feet high and 55 by 55 feet square at the base , somewhat more slender , and with a more sharply pointed cap . Mills was greatly disap-pointed that Congress refused to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both shafts to " stalks of asparagus . " Whatever were the rights and wrongs , Willard was definitely elected architect , and he desired that his services be gratuitous ; the trustees insisted , however , that he receive $1200 for his work . He accepted this , but made a donation of $ i 000 to the fund . James S. Savage was the builder , and the cost of the obelisk itself was $120,000 . As is still often the case in such projects , subscriptions to the building fund lagged after a while , and numerous fairs were held to help it along . At one of these , in 1839 , tradition has it that Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis , a charming , and wealthy widow , sold kisses at five dollars each in aid of the cause . ' The Egyptian style , gloomy and depressing in appearance , was believed to be particularly appropriate to cemetery entrances and jails , the Tombs in New York and the gates of Mount Auburn Cemetery being good examples . A legend persists that the building of Bunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granite // Railway at Quincy , a rail incline which was built to facilitate getting the granite out of the quarries . This track is generally credited with being the first American railroad , though a long way from a class A road of today . It was the Granite Age in this region , and with the excep-tion of the earlier example , St. Paul 's Church , which used sandstone for its columns and pediment , most of the impor-tant Boston buildings of the period were built of it . They certainly constitute an imposing list , if one recalls the Cus-tom House , Quincy Market , the old Merchants ' Exchange on State Street , the Mt . Vernon Church on Ashburton Place ( now the Law School of Boston University ) , the Tremont House , the old Fitchburg Station , the old Court House , and many smaller structures . The general use of granite began in Boston with the build-ing of Bulfinch 's Court House in 1810 . According to Shurt-leff 's history , ' however , a house of granite was built for Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to have been built from granite boulders found in the immediate vicinity . The old Hancock house on Bea-con Hill was built from boulders of Braintree granite in 1.737 , and in 1749 King 's Chapel was built of the same material . ' King 's Chapel was the greatest stone construction job yet undertaken in Boston , if not in English America . The boul-ders , we are told , were broken up by building a fire around them and then letting heavy iron balls fall upon them from a considerable height , which seems a little surprising as less crude methods were already known . As the increasing use of these boulders for steps and foundations led to a fear that the supply would be exhausted , the Quincy Town Meeting levied a fine of ten shillings for each cart load carried away . With these difficulties to contend with , it is not surprising // that King 's Chapel was considered a wonder and people came to see and admire it from far and near . It was universally conceded that not enough stone could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrying of granite began in the early I800 's . The first stone seems to have come from Chelmsford via the Middlesex Canal , which was opened about 1803 . This very handsome granite was used in the Court House , the new South Church , the Hinkley ( Congregational ) house on Beacon Street , the Parkman-Blake houses in Bowdoin Square , and University Hall at Harvard . The Quincy quarries are said to have been opened in 1824 , and those at Cape Ann about the same time . Transportation of the material was an important matter . Deliveries of the Chelmsford stone were made first by the Middlesex Canal and later by rail . Quincy granite came partly by water and partly over the road , and the stone from the Cape Ann quarries was brought in the big sloops , loaded down so that their gunwales were close to the water line , whose great single masts and enormous mainsails used to be familiar sights along the North Shore . The most significant change , however , which was made by the architects who succeeded Bulfinch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Chelmsford granite in courses about a foot high , but in the later buildings one stone would often go the entire height of a window or door , while the delicate old wooden cornices and ornamental work gave way entirely to massive granite . Quincy Market and the Custom House illustrate this feature . The general use of granite , called the noblest of all building stones , continued until around 1900 , when concrete supplanted it for use in foundations and the much cheaper limestones from Indiana replaced it for external use . Its regrettable downfall was also hastened by the demands of labor unions . Once in a while it still stages a come-back , as in the new Post Office Building , the Museum of Fine Arts , and the 2 8 BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH new building of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company , but its cost prevents its more general employ-ment . The name of Solomon Willard is preeminent among the younger group of architects who favored the use of granite . ' His interest in the material led him to abandon his architec-tural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he introduced many new ideas and methods of effi-cient working , somewhat to the dismay of other more con-servative quarrymen . This true artist and all-round genius left the farm at Petersham , Massachusetts , on attaining his majority and came to Boston , where he worked first at wharf building at fifty cents a day , but found time to study geol-ogy , chemistry , anatomy , and French , and to give lessons in drawing from the life in some of his spare evenings . At the end of the first year he had saved enough over his living expenses to be able to lend $200 to his employer . He became and expert carver in both wood and stone , and , in addition to the works mentioned above , he carved figureheads for ships , among them a colossal bust of Washington for the United States 74-gun ship of that name . He visited New York , Baltimore , Richmond , and Washington on two sepa-rate occasions , and returned to settle permanently in Boston in 1818 . His genius early became evident in his invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured . A thousand of his furnaces were sold , and they were used by Bulfinch in the Capitol and White House at Washington . His great work was Bunker Hill Monument , but from 1824 to 1835 he also built the Branch Bank in State Street , the Court House at Dedham , the monument at Concord Bridge , the Franklin Monument along with the fence and gate of the Granary Burying Ground , and the Suffolk // County Court House in Court Square . During this period he found time , in addition , to reconnoiter the route of the Fitchburg Railroad , and design churches in Bangor , Maine , and on Bowdoin Street , Boston . About 183 I he became increasingly interested in the quarrying of granite , and wrote in a letter that his " object in engaging in the stone business was not to make money , but to make experiments in order to remove the obstructions to the extensive use of granite as a building material , and to ascertain the lowest price at which it could be afforded with the common facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy , and during the ensuing ten years furnished the granite for many large buildings , including the Boston Custom House and the New York Merchants ' Exchange , a five-year job which brought in over $400,000 . He was exhiltrated by the difficulties of the current fashion which decreed the use of enormous monolithic columns , and spent much thought in devising improved machinery for their handling and transportation , sometimes speaking slightingly of such porticoes as that of St. Paul 's where the simpler method of building up the columns in drums was employed . Another example of his fondness for large-scale masonry is seen in the retaining wall of the Granary Burying Ground , one of whose stones is thirty-three feet long . Transportation of these huge monoliths was no trifling matter ; for the Boston Court House columns each one required a team of sixty-five yoke of oxen and twelve horses to move it from Quincy to Boston . Tariff disputes with the infant Granite Railway Company ( horse and gravity operated ) , which he claimed had already begun to display monopolistic tendencies , also enlivened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bunker Hill Monument about 2 feet 7 inches high instead of one foot , as recommended by the engineer Loammi Baldwin , and won his point . The Greek Revival was veritably an age of giants ; when we gaze upon // the skyscrapers of the present day we may well reflect upon the spectacular change in the architecture of Boston which a few Quincy quarrymen with primitive machinery made within a few years . Willard turned to farming in 1841 , but agriculture proved not sufficiently exciting , and at the age of sixty he took to building roads with his own hands . His last undertaking , upon which he labored to the day of his death , was a road two or three miles in length , over country so rough , through crags , ledges , swamps , and meadows , that one of the head quarrymen who went over the route with him in advance could not be induced to return over it , saying that it was too dangerous . This work Willard undertook without any idea of reward , but just for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than willing to have their property opened up . He died suddenly in 1861 . At no period of his life did he seem to have any idea of working for personal gain , or accumulating more money than would suffice for his own modest personal needs . A true artist , he seems to have needed no incentive beyond " the joy of the working . " Contemporary accounts describe him as being stout and heavy-set , deliberate in manner , and always walking with a deceptive slow gait which took him over the ground faster and farther than most other people . He was charitable , conscientious , honored and beloved by all , an able architect and a distinguished citizen . The Boston Custom House , designed by Ammi B. Young ( 1800-1874 ) , was the finest production of the Greek Revival in the city , and was said to be the costliest public building of its time . It utilized the temple form , actually with a granite roof and saucer-like granite dome , and its monolithic columns , weighing forty-two tons each , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its completion , it stood as a Custom House should stand , facing the docks ; early picGREEK REVIVAL 3I tures show the bowsprits of ships poking against the win-dows . Its monumental form , with its fine rotunda , was more appropriate for a shrine of some national hero than for an office building , which is what a Custom House really is . Its proportions were excellent , and it seems a pity that so hand-some and costly a building could not have been preserved as a document of the times instead of being used as a mere base for the present tower . When the tower was built , some of the old interior columns were saved and erected in Franklin Park . The original building did not escape contemporary criticism , especially from a writer in the North American Review for April 1844 , who attacked it on several grounds , not so much because it was badly adapted to the uses of an office building , however , as because it was not a good temple . No proper Grecian temple , said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dome . At the request of the architect and the United States Commission-ers , Messrs . Robert G. Shaw , David Henshaw , and Samuel S. Lewis , Mr. W. W. Wheildon came ably to its defense in a pamphlet he called Strictures on an Article in the North American Review entitled " Architecture in the United States . " The discussion must have been fairly spirited , since Mr. Wheildon remarked in his pamphlet that he " would not adopt the indecency of referring the critic to the extensive nomenclature of modern zoology ' for a name , although it would not be difficult to find an animal to which his resem-blance , in some particulars , would be deemed sufficient to entitle him to be classed under the same genus . " Young was made " Federal Architect " in 1842 , succeeding Robert Mills , and became " Supervising Architect " in 1852 ; he held this position at a salary of $3000 per annum until 1862 . He designed Thornton Hall at Dartmouth College , and Reed Hall , for which he was given an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed the Vermont State 3 2 BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH House , for which he received an honorary degree from the University of Vermont . He died in Washington , D.C. It was said of him that " he was one of the most faithful and upright public officers , and his administration of public af-fairs was marked by ability and the strictest integrity . " Boston 's population of 22,000 in 1808 had nearly tripled by 1830 , when it was 61,392 and still growing . New build-ings of every sort , especially hotels , were needed , and in 1828 the cornerstone of a new hotel was laid which was not only the last word in elegance and comfort but " indisputably the first definitely recognized example of the modern first-class hotel . " 8 Previous hostelries had been mere inns or taverns , but the Tremont House stood in a class by itself , and its chaste Grecian facade of white Quincy granite was the pioneer of the long line of magnificent American hotels for which it set the pace . Its list of innovations is amazing and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest passed under its granite Doric portico and ascended a short flight of stairs he found himself , not in the usual barroom , but in a very suave circular lobby whose walls were decorated with Ionic columns " of the order of Philip , " supporting a dome of richly colored stained glass .

Along the front were no less than ten " sumptuously " furnished public rooms lighted by gas and arranged to be thrown to-gether if desired , among them another typical Boston " First , " the first hotel reading room , equipped complete with news-papers , magazines , and " gazeteers .

Not only did the doors to these rooms have locks , but each lock was different . No longer did the guests wash in the kitchen or barroom ; there were bathing rooms in the basement supplied by rain-water cis-terns . The Tremont discarded the usual hotel stable , another new idea ; but perhaps its greatest innovation of all was the range of eight indoor water closets on the main floor in the rear of the lobby which supplanted the out-of-door accom34 BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH modations of earlier hotels . All these comforts were avail-able to the guest for two dollars per day , and the rate in-cluded food which he might select from a menu , instead of taking what was put before him and liking it .

" The exterior was of cut granite and the interior construc-tion , though not fireproof , was thoroughly fire stopped with plaster . ' A circular cupola which figured in the original de-sign was never built . The structure , which was built by a syndicate , cost $ 3 00,000 . It was opened in 1829 , and the last guest passed out through its portals on the third of December 1894 . The building was at once demolished and the present Tremont Building occupies its site . Isaiah Rogers ( 1800-1869 ) , the architect of the Tremont House , was the third and most famous of the notable Greek Revival group of Boston architects , of which Parris and Wil-lard were the others . Like them , he seems to have been largely self-taught , but unlike them he enjoyed a fame and a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts , where his father was a ship-builder.10 At the age of sixteen he left for Boston , where he became apprenticed to a carpenter . In 1820 ? 21 he was in Mobile , Alabama , where he won a competition for a theater , but in 1822 he entered the Boston office of Solomon Willard who was his senior by five years . An affection sprang up between the two men which was so sincere that Rogers later named his son Solomon Willard Rogers . // He started in business for himself in 1826 and built the first Tremont Theater in 1827 , which later was sold to the Baptists and became the first Tremont Temple . The fame of the Tremont House brought him the commission for the Astor House in New York , built during the years 1834 to 1836 , and after 1834 he lived in that city . The Astor House carried elegance , comfort , and plumbing to almost unbeliev-able heights , and Rogers became known as " the father of the American hotel . " Included in the long line of hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which gave to American hotels a standardized character which per-sisted for many decades were the Bangor House at Bangor , Maine , the Exchange Hotel at Richmond , Virginia , the Battle House at Mobile , Alabama , the Charleston Hotel at Charleston , South Carolina , which had a superb Corinthian facade , the St. Charles Hotel at New Orleans , the Galt House at Louisville , Kentucky , and the Maxwell House at Nashville , whose coffee is still reputed to be good to the last drop . The construction of the Maxwell House , started in 1859 , was interrupted by the Civil War and not com-pleted until 1869 , during part of which time it was used as a barracks . In 185o Rogers designed the Burnet House in Cin-cinnati which was called by the Illustrated London News " the best hotel in the world , " and within whose walls Grant and Sherman are said to have planned the March to the Sea . At about that time Rogers moved to Cincinnati , where he lived until his death from a heart attack . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a hand in the construction of the State House at Columbus , Ohio , be-tween 1839 and 1856.11 While living in New York Rogers built the Bank of America , whose facade was later erected at Pine Lodge Park in Methuen , Massachusetts , the Merchants ' Bank , a Dutch Reformed Church ( 1836 ) , and the Astor Place Opera 3 6 BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH House ( 1847 ) . He came into contact and competition with the ablest and most progressive architects of the time . It is noteworthy that he was selected to design the Merchants ' Exchange , which was probably the most important job in the city . In the years 1836 to 1842 he built this beautifully proportioned building , which cost a million dollars and was one of the best buildings ever built in the United States . Solomon Willard supplied the granite for it from his Quincy quarry . Its eighty-foot brick coffered dome would be a notable piece of construction even today . Its fine Ionic colonnade was incorporated in the facade of the National City Bank many years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings in Boston after he had moved away . Among them were the Merchants ' Exchange on State Street ( 1842 ) , which was removed when the present Exchange Building was erected , the original Brazer 's Building and the Suffolk Bank , both also on State Street , the first Masonic Temple , later alluded to , and in 1845 the Howard Athenaeum , still in granite , though Gothic . The new building was leased to a theatrical company in 1845 and was operated by them until February 23 , 1846 , when it was burned . The following year it was rebuilt by Rogers with its massive granite facade . This theater , now the entrenched home of the strip-tease and the delight of gobs and doughboys , began as the home of fashionable drama and opera , and in its prime its somewhat steamboatish horseshoe sparkled with the diamonds and satins of the elite of Boston . William Warren made his first Boston appearance on the opening night of the new theater , and here also genuine Italian opera was first presented in the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . In addition to these distinctions , the I Toward was the first theater in town to have cushioned scats . Amend I 87o , correctly sensing what its public really wanted , // the Howard changed its offerings to vaudeville , and later to what is politely known as " burlesque . " Not the least of its many glorious dates were those on which the young John Lawrence Sullivan , the Roxbury strong boy , first attracted attention on its stage.12 Later the same famous champion and sterling actor nightly took the leading part in the great melo-drama Honest Hearts and Willing Hands before delighted audiences . As its advertising was wont to say , " This theatre has never failed to do its share in Softening the Arteries and Relieving That Tired Feeling , ' and for an even one hundred years now there has been Always Something Doing at the Old Howard . ' " Rogers ' long career inevitably extended into the " Ameri-can Gothic " period , in which style his designs were less suc-cessful . Examples of his Gothic , besides the Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church which still stands in Harvard Square in Cambridge . None of these possessed the grace and dignity of his classical work . From about 1862 to 1865 ( the dates are a little uncertain ) Rogers was supervising architect of the Treasury Depart-ment , and during this time he completed the west wing of the Treasury Building which had been designed by Robert Mills . During the whole of his notable career Rogers ' work was always simple , direct , and characterized by a certain nobility . Robert Mills ( 1781-1855 ) , the designer of the Washington Monument , the Washington Column at Balti-more , the Treasury Building at Washington , and many other important buildings , was the most famous American archi-tect of this period , but much of his work was of a monumen-tal type , which always lends itself to public acclaim . Rogers ' work was more on the commercial side , which is less inter-esting to the public but far more important to a young and // fast-growing nation , and it deserves much wider recognition than it has received ; on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American architecture . Two brick churches of quite similar design were built in Boston twenty years apart , in 1823 and 1843 respectively . The first , the Twelfth Congregational on Chambers Street , was eventually acquired by the Roman Catholics and became St. Joseph 's . The second , on Warrenton Street , served the Scotch Presbyterian denomination until it was abandoned by them , after which , following the primrose path , it became a night club . Each had a front composed of a pediment with wooden Doric columns and wooden cornices , and each , standing as it does in the curve of a street , has considerable impressiveness . On the whole the Greek Revival did not produce so much elaborate residential work in Boston as it did in some other cities , but practically the whole lower part of Beacon Hill and the northerly portion of the South End were built up in a mild form of it . Some of the best work occurred in what became the business district and was torn down to make room for business buildings . Conspicuous evidences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good many remain , with their well-designed patterns of anthemion and honeysuckle , and a still more noticeable feature was the change in the character of the brickwork . The bricks used in the Bulfinch period were small in size , rough in texture , and laid in " Flemish bond , " that is , the facing brick was bonded to the backing by laying every other brick as a " header " projecting back into the interior of the wall . This was possible because the facing and backing brick were of the same size . About 1830 , or perhaps a little earlier , " pressed brick " was introduced , a type of brick a little larger than that used before , and its use for facing became universal . Since the rough backing brick was of a different size , and // the Flemish bond cost more to lay , the facing was run up independently of the backing , to which it was theoretically bonded every six or seven courses , but in practice often much less . I have seen a wall taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This practice sometimes led to disaster , when frost , getting behind the facing , forced it away from the backing and made rebuilding of the entire wall obligatory . This pressed brick , which covers most of Beacon Hill and the South End , gave , along with the discontinuance of wood cornices and doorways , a totally different aspect to the residential sections . The Greek Revival architecture , in spite of its undeniable merit , was essentially a textbook style . The architects could look in their books and select the temple best suited for reproduction in the particular job at hand . The fact that the overhanging porticoes darkened the interiors did not prevent their use on such buildings as the Custom House , which was primarily an office building whose offices needed all the light they could get . The lack of originality which was evident in the temple-fronted buildings did not always extend to the residential work , some of which , like the Dana-Lawrence house on Brattle Street in Cambridge , and many houses around the country , showed a great deal of originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revival lay in country and suburban mansions , of which thousands were built in every direction . There are handsome examples in almost every town of any size , while the remarkable row of temple-front houses on Marginal Street in Chelsea shows what a real-estate operator of the time was able to accomplish . A ramble through the older streets of Roxbury and Charlestown will disclose many fine examples . Two other splendid examples of the granite period , though more strictly engineering works , were the old dry dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard , built by Loammi Baldwin in // the years 1827 to 1833 , and the Beacon Hill Reservoir , built in 1849 as a part of the Cochituate water system and re-moved about 1888 to make room for the State House Ex-tension . The lower , or Derne Street , side , with its vast and gloomy arches , was once named by an able critic ( Mr. Charles A. Cummings ) the best piece of architecture in the city , commendable especially for its simplicity and forthright use of granite.13 The vaults ran far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Piranesi 's than a piece of domestic engineering . The engineers in charge of the new waterworks were W. S. Whitwell for the Eastern Division and E. S. Chesbrough 14 for the Western , with J. B. Jervis of New York as consultant . The reservoir was probably designed under Mr. Whitwell 's direction . It was completed at a cost , exclusive of the land , of $324 , I27 . The builders were Charles G. Chase and Samuel Farwell . " This reservoir consisted of a sort of pan of water fifteen feet and eight inches deep which was supported on massive granite arches . It was almost square , but not quite so , being , like most buildings in downtown Boston , mildly trapezoidal in shape , approximately 190 by 206 feet in size . All this granite work was carefully laid in hydraulic cement . The walls were constructed of split face granite with a hammered granite cornice . Loammi Baldwin ( 1780-1838 ) , 16 though an engineer rather than an architect , was so closely connected with the growth of the city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Woburn , Massachusetts , the son of the Colo-nel Loammi Baldwin who originated the Baldwin apple and planned the Middlesex canal . He was educated at Westford // Academy and Harvard College , from which he graduated in 1800 . He read law for three years under Timothy Bigelow of Groton , a pursuit which did not prove sufficiently engrossing to prevent him from building in 1802 the town 's first fire engine with its equipment of leather hose , which was still in use in 1884 . He was admitted to the bar and practiced in Cambridge for three years . In 1807 he visited Europe , and on his return opened a civil engineering office in Charlestown . In 1814 he worked on Fort Strong on Belmont Hill in East Boston on the site of the present Brophy Memorial Park , and in 1819 he succeeded Uriah Cotting as engineer of the Mill Dam . In 1817 ? 182o he was engaged on public works in Virginia . From 1821 to 1825 he was employed upon the Union Canal in Pennsylvania , and then returned to Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bunker Hill Monument , and was also surveying a route for a proposed canal from Boston to the Hudson River , a project which involved a tunnel at the exact location of the future Hoosac Tunnel . In 1826 he made a report on a proposed tidal dam at Beverly Bridge . From 1827 to 1834 he was building the dry docks at the Charlestown and Norfolk Navy Yards . The inadequate machinery available made these operations extremely vexatious ; for example , the pile drivers were operated by treadmills , which the men objected to as being derogatory to free labor . Baldwin was the author of many other reports on various engineering matters . He has been called the " father of civil engineering in America . " Looking back from a hundred years later , it seems as if , with the coming of the Greek Revival , Boston shed its provincial attitude , put on its first long pants , and began to assume the airs of a metropolis . The breadth of scale of the new style , the nobility of the moldings as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of the pillared porticoes of such buildings as Sr. Paul 's Church and // the Custom House must have been an inspiration to the people , encouraging them to such civic ventures as the great Quincy Market development , the new railroads , the leveling of Fort Hill , and all the other improvements which dated from this era . AMERICAN GOTHIC CHAPTER IV EVERYTHING comes to an end , and by the late 1830 's the Greek Revival was threatened by the shadow of the American Gothic , a rival whose popularity swept the country much as its predecessor had twenty years before . It had the advantage of being cheaper , for while granite continued as the popular stone for building , it was now used in a rustic or rock-face form instead of having the finely-cut surface used in earlier buildings . Probably the most impressive building of this type in Boston was the old Fitchburg Railroad Station , built in 1847 , whose massive battlemented towers dominated Causeway Street with an air of imperishable permanence . Like its successor , the present North Station , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remembered as the scene of the Jenny Lind concerts , managed by P. T. Barnum in 185o . It is difficult to understand how a hard-boiled railroad corporation came to build so romantic a structure , which was nevertheless regarded as one of the most imposing in the United States . The railroad 's directors were evidently confident of the future , for in 1847 the road 's entire rolling stock consisted of three six-wheeled locomotives , six eight-wheeled locomotives , fifteen passenger cars , and " enough freight cars to equal altogether 212 fourwheeled cars . " George M. Dexter was the architect of the station and Joseph William Coburn , Nelson Curtis , and Sears &; Fitch were the builders . The gilded effigy of an early locomotive which was placed upon its facade was saved when the building was demolished and is now in the Railroad Museum at the Harvard Business School . The reason for the importation of the Gothic style into America is not so clear as that of the Greek Revival . It // must have come from England , where , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the romantic novels of Sir Walter Scott . It flourished there in a rather cheap form , often with much trivial ornamentation , false battlements and jigsaw work on the outside and lathand-plaster vaulting within . John Ruskin fulminated against it , the particular butt of his indignation being " Strawberry Hill , " built by Sir Horace Walpole . There is no doubt , however , that the fickle public taste was beginning to tire of the grandeur and formality of the temple form , and yearned for the coziness and domesticity which the Gothic style implied . " Sunnyside , " Washington Irving 's home on the Hudson , was widely illustrated , and may have exerted an influence in this direction . More than to Irving 's house , however , the vogue of this style , which might well be called the " Romantic Revival , " was probably due to the efforts of Andrew Jackson Downing ( 1815-1852 ) of New York , a landscape gardener and architect whose enthusiasm for horticulture and a more informal type of house building led him to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many woodcuts of cozy English gabled cottages , equipped with latticed windows , oriel bays , and elaborate verge boards , became very popular and exerted a wide influence . Sophisticated modernists profess to be horrified at these designs , but when one compares their homelike and comfortable atmosphere with the contents of present-day " home-building " magazines , one is inclined to wonder in which direction the much vaunted " American Way of Life " has progressed since they were made . Downing visited England , where he met Calvert Vaux , who came to America ; together they were successful in attracting public interest to the subject of landscape gardening and to the matter of the inauguration and proper design of public park systems for cities . Downing died while helping to save lives on board the Hudson River steamboat // Henry Clay , which caught fire while engaged in a race with another boat . ' Owing , presumably , to a growing feeling that the Gothic style in any form was more appropriate for worship than the old meetinghouse type , quite a number of churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-face granite walls , battlemented towers , and plaster-vaulted ceilings . The former Lyman Beecher Congregational Church on Bowdoin Street , so called on account of the ministrations of that emi-nent divine , is now used by the Cowley Fathers under the name of the Church of St. John the Evangelist . It is said to have been designed by Solomon Willard in 1830 and ex-cepting some interior changes still remains intact , together with the near-by First Methodist Episcopal Church on Tem-ple Street , but most of the others have vanished . The old Trinity Church ( 1828 ) on Summer Street , designed by George W. Brimmer and destroyed in the great fire of 1872 , was of this type ; and another , the Bowdoin Square Baptist Church , stood in Bowdoin Square on the site of the present Telephone Building . The architect of this church was Rich-ard Bond , who also designed Gore Hall at Harvard , now demolished . The cornerstone was laid April 9 , 1840 ; its cost , including furniture and organ , was $42,462.2 Along with the adjoining buildings , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seemed to re-semble some of Ernest George 's English water colors , espe-cially as seen looking in from Cambridge Street . The church of St. Peter and St. Paul on Broadway in South Boston was built in 1844 ? 45 and burned three years later . It was rebuilt and in more recent years it was enlarged and the tower redesigned , probably by Gridley Bryant . An-other example was the rough granite building with castellated // towers built in 183o by Isaiah Rogers on the corner of Tremont Street and Temple Place , and used successively as the Masonic Temple , United States Court House , and the R. H. Stearns Company 's store . A. Bronson Alcott 's famous school was located in the upper story of this building . The architects of these pseudo-Gothic buildings had no textbooks to follow , and the architecture of most of them had little to recommend them to posterity , aside from their value as historical documents ; but what was probably the first , if Bulfinch 's Gothic church in Federal Street ( 1809 ) is excepted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains on Dorchester Street , South Boston . This is St. Augustine 's Chapel ( really pronounced Saint ' Gustin 's ) , built about 182o by Bishop Cheverus primarily to provide a consecrated resting place for the remains of Father Matignon , who had been interred in the Granary Burying Ground . Father Anthony Matignon , once a professor in the College of Navarre and a virtual exile from the France of the Revolution , began his work as a priest in Boston in 1792 . Four years later , at his invitation , came that other French exile , John Cheverus , who in 181 o was consecrated as the first Catholic Bishop of Boston . It is known that Charles Bulfinch was a warm admirer of the good Bishop , who , it is said , lived in one room and chopped his own wood , and one may wonder if the little brick chapel with its pointed windows and thick slate roof may not have been the result of an interchange of ideas about the churches of the Bishop 's native France . There is no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaded by enormous trees , in the old stone-walled churchyard with its ivyand myrtle-covered graves " Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap , " the most Old-World scene anywhere in the city . The mossy tombstones bear the names of the earliest Irish immigrants who left their loved homes in Limerick // and Sligo , Galway and Donegal , Killarney , Kilkenny , and Clare , to come in crowded sailing ships " with sufferings be-hind them and uncertainties before " as Professor William M. Warren has so well put it in his story of this church . ' He adds , and if you rest your thought for a moment on some of these chiseled dates , you can read between the lines the touching stories of whole families in which the children of the famine years had died soon after the trials of their ocean voyage , or the grandfather and grandmother , brought here in advanced age , had survived the change but a brief time and had been laid to rest in a land whose plenty had been their lure . The Gothic period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well defined like that of the Greek Revival . Enthusiasm for the style had begun to wane in the 185o 's , and even in the 184o 's , before an " American " interlude , but the Gothic was con-tinued in one way or another , especially in domestic and church architecture ; and in the North Italian form , which I shall come to later , it ran well up to the eighties . Mention must be made here of certain other Gothic buildings such as the " new " Masonic Temple , seven stories high , built in 1867 at the corner of Tremont and Boylston Streets from designs by Merrill G. Wheelock , on the site of an earlier building of the order , burned in 1864 . The granite facades of this build-ing gave precedence to Masonic symbolism rather than archi-tectural correctness . The large amount of wood used in buildings of this type , and especially the flimsy lath-and-plaster vaulted ceilings with their numerous concealed spaces , led to a great many fires ; it is miraculous that still greater loss of life did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own fiery end in the 1890 's . One of the quaintest examples of this Romantic period was // the wooden clothing store , with its pinnacles and stepped gables , " the famous Oak Hall in North Street " whose " ... numbers over the door , Thirty-two and Thirty-four , " were long familiar to many a Boston urchin . Another and much better phase of Gothic began when Richard Upjohn , a young and talented English architect , came to Boston in 1834 and worked for five years with Alexander Parris before leaving for New York , where he built the beautiful Trinity Church , at the head of Wall Street , and became the most famous church architect in the country . He founded a distinguished family architectural dynasty which has continued through father , son , and grandson to this day . By the time of the Civil War , " Roxbury pudding stone " had come into general use for churches , so it was natural for this stone to be used for the Cathedral of the Holy Cross , designed by P. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in 1867 . This church is 300 feet long and 90 feet wide . The design contemplated lofty stone spires which were never built . The entrance arch is said to be built of bricks taken from the ruins of the famous Ursuline Convent in Charlestown which was burned by an antiCatholic mob in 1834 . Keeley is reputed to have built five hundred churches , among them that of the Immaculate Conception on Harrison Avenue . Numerous very English dwellings in the Gothic style were built during this period , more especially in the country . A good example in Brookline , which then was rural , is the old stone Lawrence mansion on Ivy Street . Chelsea , then a pretty village , possessed , near the end of the bridge , a marvelous example of the wooden tracery type , complete with leaded windows and carved verge boards , only needing Rollo with Thanny and Uncle George and the good dog // Dash to complete the scene . I was fortunate in securing a good photograph of this house before it was finally altered and ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's architecture . In its early form it was imperfectly understood , and even in its later more sophisticated phases it was a thing apart from the daily life of the people , something which sprang from books rather than any native feeling . PLAIN AMERICAN CHAPTER V THE BOSTON of the thirties and forties was changing . While it was still a great port with its piers crowded with foreign and coastwise shipping , its maritime business was beginning to gravitate toward New York ; a new industry , cotton spinning , was coming in ; Boston capital was starting the new cities of Lawrence , Lowell , and others ; railroads were proving successful and new lines were projected in all directions . Donald McKay was building his clippers at East Boston . Antislavery discussions were becoming bitter . Whittier was writing his stirring ballads , Longfellow his Evangeline . New England was flowering . In other parts of the country Edgar Allan Poe was still living ; Robert Salmon was painting his marines ; Hiram Powers was showing his marble statue of the Greek Slave ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , Stephen C. Foster was writing his songs and ballads of the real America . European nations were overthrowing feudalism , and the great famines in Ireland were preparing the way for the immigration which was later to influence Boston so profoundly . Perhaps commercial prosperity was responsible for the more modern school of architectural thought which began to appear around 1850 , typified by the Tremont Temple of 1853 ( the building owned by this church was burned successively in 1852 , 1879 , and about 1905 ) , and the Public Library on Boylston Street , built in 1858 by C. F. Kirby . This well-designed building , like the Athenaeum , gained in impressiveness by being set back from the street line and by the handsome stone balustrade at the sidewalk . Public buildings in this style were marked by large round-arched windows in the upper story , surmounted by a heavy cornice ; PLAIN AMERICAN 5I the flat roof and cornice were the principal and often the only marked features of other buildings , of which the old American House on Hanover Street might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to ridicule by critics , but at least it was indigenous , not copied from foreign models , and has more right than any other to be considered as a true American style . Its guiding principle was to follow the problem in its simplest interpretation . It was absolutely functional , and if architects had continued with it a style might have developed which would have been as American as a Red Indian . It was closely related to the " Italian Villa " style which set the pace for numerous country and suburban houses , but not many of these houses seem to have been built in the city proper . The Boston Museum , owned by Moses Kimball and designed by Hammatt Billings in 1846 , which stood on the present site of the Kimball Building , was another notable example . It had an imposing granite front 164 feet long , surmounted with a heavy cornice and adorned with long iron balconies and three rows of gas jets in white globes . It was especially noted architecturally for its remarkable whitepillared foyer known as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first-floor row of shops , which was filled with glass cases of stuffed birds , animals , and other specimens of natural history . The collection also included an exhibition of waxworks , among them P. T. Barnum 's famous " Feejee Mermaid " and such historical and cultural scenes as " The Murder of Miss McCrea , " " Scene in the Cabin of a Vessel Captured by Pirates , " " The Three Stages of Intemperance , " and " The Last Supper . " The Museum part of it was a hangover from a previous institution farther up the street , and the theater itself was at first called a " Lecture Hall " in order to remove any objections serious-minded patrons might have about theater-going . The Museum 's first regular dramatic company was established in 1843 and its success was so // marked that the " new " building was erected , costing a quarter of a million . William Warren joined the company in 1847 , and Mrs. J. R. Vincent , for whom the Vincent Club was named , became a member in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a member in 1861 , and remained until 1886 . Charles Barron joined the company in 1868 . Later members of the company whose names remain in the memory of many living Bostonians were Kate Ryan , Miriam O'Leary , Sadie Martinot , Jack Mason , and William J. Le Moyne , while among the visiting stars were Mme. Modjeska , Fanny Davenport , Lester Wallack , Lawrence Barrett , Sol Smith Russell , Edwin Booth the elder and son , and many others . The theater habitually ran a season of Shakespearean plays and old comedies such as the School for Scandal , The Rivals , She Stoops to Conquer , and others which were rightly considered as distinctly educational and seemed to put it in a class with the Athenaeum and the Lowell Lectures . It had its lighter side , however , and the names of a few of its productions are worth repeating , if only to revive a feeling of nostalgia for bygone days . Such were Little Lord Fauntleroy , Colleen Bawn , Hands Across the Sea , Harbor Lights , London Assurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Fatal Card , and Diplomacy . In 1878 it was the first theater in America to produce Pinafore . It closed in 1893 with Shore Acres . Among its well-known directors were R. M. Field and E. F. Keach . In its later years the Museum boasted a curtain painted by I. M. Gaugengigl , a well-known Boston artist . Not only was it notable architecturally , but it had a perfectly good air-conditioning system , one of the first in the country , operated by a gas engine which changed the air every four minutes , warming it by steam in winter and passing it over ice in summer . As a worthy Boston institution , only the Transcript was comparable to it . // Hammatt Billings , the architect of the Boston Museum , was also an artist and illustrator of books . He designed the remarkable ornate organ case in the old Boston Music Hall , the main building of Wellesley College , and the Pilgrim Monument at Plymouth , of which he wrote that " it was in-tended to be the grandest work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Beacon Street , with its Italian-ate facade of brown Paterson sandstone , was built in 1847 from designs by Edward C. Cabot , who was assisted in its construction by George M. Dexter . Cabot , a member of the well-known Boston family , was a man of great ability and good judgment , but practically without architectural training . Today , like Wendell Willkie , he would be called a " natural . " He was engaged in raising sheep on a farm in Vermont when he heard that the trustees were opening a competition for the plans , and he resolved to enter it . A pe-culiar circumstance is said to have decided the contest in his favor ; 2 the plot to be used was sharply indented at the south-east corner by a triangular projection of the Granary Bury-ing Ground , containing some graves which could not be dis-turbed . The other competitors followed the angular indenta-tion , which caused awkward projections into the interior all the way up through the building . This meant nothing to young Cabot who , " with boldness and aristocratic uncon-cern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , simply carried the rear wall straight across , making a segmen-tal arched niche in the basement to accommodate the graves . This device was good enough for the trustees , who forth-with awarded him the work . The arch is plainly visible from Tremont Street . The setback from the street , with the stone balustraded fence , adds a great deal to the building 's appearance , much of which would be lost if it had been // crowded onto the sidewalk . This matter of setbacks is of the greatest importance in city buildings , as every architect knows , but it is practically impossible to make a building committee agree to give up a foot of land for the purpose . Cabot also , in association with Jonathan Preston , built the Boston Theater in 1854 from a design by A. Noury , who won the first prize of $500 in a competition . ' This theater stood approximately on the site of the Keith Memorial The-ater . It was the largest theater in Boston , seating 3000 per-sons , and the horseshoe interior was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dress circle , " the " fam-ily circle , " and the " gallery . " The stage was 67 feet deep , the proscenium 48 feet 6 inches wide , the height to the fly-floor was 66 feet , and the depth below the stage 30 feet ? certainly imposing dimensions for any theater . There was a self-supporting grand staircase and a " Grand Promenade Saloon " 26 feet high . It was the home of Grand Opera in Boston and usually maintained one or more traveling stock com-panies which produced plays first brought out on its own stage . The theater was also a favorite place for grand balls , such as those given for the Prince of Wales and the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia , and also that in aid of the Sanitary Commission during the Civil War . On these occasions the auditorium was floored over , as was the custom at the Paris Opera . Before planning this theater Cabot spent a year abroad and made an intensive study of La Scala in Milan . When this theater was torn down in 1926 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-story wooden house with a pitched slate roof under the grand stair-case and foyer , which had been enclosed and left when the theater was built and forgotten by all but a few . There would seem to be the makings of a good mystery story in this inci-dent . ' However , it would be only fair to say that the house // was used for offices by members of the theater staff , who were aware of its existence . Cabot was born in Boston in 1818 and died in 1901 . In his childhood and youth he was in frail health , with the result that , instead of going to college , he left to engage in sheep raising in Illinois for several years , after which he returned to follow the same occupation in Vermont . During the Civil War he was for some months lieutenant colonel of the 44th Massachusetts Infantry . He built , in association with F. W. Chandler , Arthur G. Everett , and Samuel W. Mead , numer-ous country houses in the rambling and picturesque style of the period , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins University in Baltimore . After retiring from practice he became an accomplished water colorist . His work was distinguished by " delicacy , restraint and schooled originality . " He was president of the Boston Society of Architects for many years , and was held in general esteem and affection . The Boston hotels of the 1850 's , especially the Tremont House , the Revere House ( 1847 ) , the Quincy House ( i 8 19-1929 ) , the Parker House , Young 's Hotel ( 1845 ) , and the United States Hotel ( 184o-1929 ) , were famous the country over for their cuisine , if not for their architecture . Their many-windowed fronts with lofty Grecian porticoes gave them a hospitably welcoming air that is lacking in the in-significant doorways of most of the present-day hotels . The dining rooms of the Revere House , with their Grecian Corin-thian columns , were very handsome and dignified ; the Crys-tal Rooms in Young 's Hotel and the Parker House were nothing short of marvelous and should have been saved as period pieces for the American Wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , the Parker House , the American House ( 1835 ) , and the Adams House ( 1846 ) , along with Young 's Hotel and the Fifth Avenue // Hotel in New York . All these hotels had long lists of distinguished guests , perhaps topped by that of the Revere House whose register bore the names of Jenny Lind , Presidents Fillmore , Pierce , Johnson , and Grant , Generals Sherman and Sheridan , the Prince of Wales , the Grand Duke Alexis , King Kalakaua , the Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil , Christine Nilsson , Pampa Rosa , and Adelina Patti . At the risk of dwelling too long on the architectural achievements of the " American period , " two more should be mentioned ; first , the old Music Hall ( 1852 ) , designed by George Snell , which was long the home of the Symphony Orchestra , and second , the ranges of massive granite warehouses along the water front and those at the lower end of State Street , known as the State Street Block . These buildings , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other excrescences , have appropriateness , simplicity , and power , and if a vote were taken for the best piece of architecture in the city , the State Street Block would get mine . EXPANSION CHAPTER VI THIS RECORD has now reached through the 1850 's . The city 's population had grown from 61,392 in 1833 to 161,429 in 1855 , and Boston was at a high tide of prosperity ; but the country was on the verge of civil war and had attained the end of an architectural chapter . Before going on , we may note certain facts which were to have an important influence in Boston . The basic and traditional local building material was ( and still is ) red brick ; while for the more important buildings granite , frequently from the Quincy quarries but also from Rockport , Chelmsford , Concord , and elsewhere , had been supreme . Now granite began to have one competitor in the more easily worked brown sandstone from the Connecticut Valley , and , particularly in the case of churches , another in the near-by conglomerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these materials caused a decided change in the appearance of the newer portions of the city . The principal trouble with the brown sandstone , or brownstone , is that it is a stratified material formed by layers of sedimentary deposits which endures well if laid in the wall on its natural bed , that is , in the same position it occupied in the quarry , but when it is laid with the layers vertical ? as it too often was ? the action of frost eventually splits off the layers and ruins its appearance . Many evidences of this are to be seen in the Back Bay . Roxbury pudding stone found its principal use in churches , for which its agreeable color and texture were very appropriate . Its use has been practically terminated , principally because the ledges have been covered with buildings or used for crushed stone . It is a good , sound , and // useful stone , with surfaces which have a remarkable faculty for keeping themselves clean as compared with other stones , which seem to attract dirt and grime . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , is almost unrecognizable , while the pudding-stone churches in the same vicinity are almost as fresh as when they were new . An important factor in the situation was the unbelievable bonanza ( for the building trade , at least ) of the filling in of the Back Bay . From the point of view of those connected with the building industry , this , with the subsequent mass migration of the most affluent part of the community , was a gift straight from heaven . The filling of the Back Bay was an epic which makes a story in itself . In 1814 the first moves were undertaken toward the utilization of the Back Bay , which had lain undisturbed for nearly two hundred years . In that year , the Boston Water Power Company , largely through the efforts of Uriah Cot-ting , ' was granted the right to construct a system of tidal dams which could also be used as toll roads , and to sell the power thus obtained . The inner portion of the Bay was gradually filled in a haphazard way until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities and moved to lay out the newly filled land , forming what is now known as the South End , and appointed a special commit-tee to take charge of the matter . Through the efforts of this committee , the grade was raised to a higher level and the land was handsomely laid out with wide north and south thor-oughfares , Tremont , Washington , and Albany Streets , and Columbus and Harrison Avenues . The cross streets were named for Massachusetts cities and towns , and were varied by numerous green parks and squares which make this sec-tion , about a mile long and three-quarters of a mile wide , still one of the handsomest examples of urban city planning 59 to be found in America . The laying out was done by E. S. Chesbrough and William P. Parrott , engineers , whose names deserve to be remembered . ' Albert T. Minot , a member of the committee , was particularly instrumental in furthering the idea of including the parks and squares in the design . Rear alleys , an innovation then , were provided ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Providence Railroad , were soon built up with comfort-able red brick , bow fronted , mansard roof dwellings , usually with " high stoops " or long flights of brownstone steps 6o BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH flanked by front lawns enclosed by cast iron palings , while here and there could be seen some very interesting cast iron trellis and veranda work . The high stoops were caused by the practice of placing the dining rooms and kitchens in a high basement , leaving the first floor clear for the stately front and back parlors which , all glorious with white marble mantelpieces and stucco cornices , were connected by elab-orate mahogany or walnut folding doors . In these handsome parlors the daughters of the Silas Laphams of the time received their callers , and their elders gave their elaborate parties . A very good example of a South End dwelling which deserves preservation is the brownstone house with a mansard roof still standing on the corner of Washington Street and Worcester Square . It was used for many years as the home of the Central Club , an organization which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South End formed a dignified unit , harmonious in scale , compact physically and socially , with its own hotels ? the St. James , Commonwealth , Hoffman House , and so on ? in the same uniform style of architecture ; with its own schools and churches and its broad av-enues . Columbus Avenue in particular , finished in 1871 , was the city 's proudest thoroughfare , intended to be a second Beacon Street , the entrenched home of wealth and fashion and a model of what any avenue ought to be . The South End also had its own theater district at the junction of Washington and Dover Streets , and for visual entertain-ment in its later years it had something better than any movie , the magnificent cyclorama of the " Battle of Gettysburg " which was housed in a circular building still standing near the corner of Tremont and Montgomery Streets . This splendid picture was painted by Paul Philippoteaux , a French artist , and provided thrilling entertainment for young and // old during several years . The visitor , ascending a dimly lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of a terrific battle with the front wave of Pickett 's charge smashing right in his face against the Federal guns , while behind him artillery reinforcements were tearing up the narrow road and the flames of battle were exploding in every direction . Nothing to equal it has since been seen in Boston . Paul Philippoteaux studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris . In collaboration with his father , Felix Philip-poteaux , who was also an artist , he had already produced the cyclorama of " The Defence of the Fort d'Issy , " which was exhibited in the Champs Elysees for many years . ' Its success induced him to paint several others , the " Taking of Plevna " ( Russo-Turkish War ) and the " Passage of the Balkans , " both exhibited in St. Petersburg , the " Belgian Revolution of 183o , " and the " Attack in the Park , " both exhibited in Brussels . " The Battle of Kars " was shown in Moscow , and the " Battle of Tel-El-Kebir " and the " Derniere Sortie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sketches on the battleground of Gettysburg . He consulted official maps and many participants in the battle , and then returned to Paris where he spent two years in painting his great work . The canvas was 400 feet long and 50 feet high and was inaugurated in Boston December 20 , 1884 . I have given some space to the old South End because its physical layout was not only far in advance of its time but also because few of the newer American cities chose to imitate it . New York , for example , continued to push its monotonous numbered streets northward mile after mile , without alleys and with no relief like the shady little South End squares and ovals , and the new western cities merely imitated New York as they have been doing ever since . // This street plan was another case of Boston 's progressive leadership . With the South End work accomplished it became evident that the remaining portion of the tract would be more valuable for building sites than as a source of tidal power . After much negotiation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston and Rox-bury , and the riparian owners , the Commonwealth in 1857 obtained full power to fill the remaining portion of the Back Bay with clean gravel , to lay out streets , and to sell the lots thus obtained , subject to reservations of certain portions for public or educational uses . Contracts were executed with Goss &; Munson who agreed to take their pay in lots , and the work of filling was promptly started and rapidly pushed along . The gravel was brought in from hills in Needham by the railroads which crossed the area and something like five million square feet of land was created and added to the city . The profits to the Commonwealth from sales of lots were over four million dollars 5 and liberal gifts were made to institutions and to the city . There was much discussion about selling the lots on the water side of Beacon Street . Many people felt that the Commonwealth was too avaricious and the land should have been left open . Copley Square for example as first laid out was only a triangle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some provision had been made for regularizing its architecture as was done in the case of the Quincy Market development , the finest public square in the country might have resulted . Much thought was given to the layout of the new quar-ter , and on the whole it can not be seriously criticized . The line of the Mill Dam , which became Beacon Street , nat-urally fixed the direction of the longitudinal streets ; if this direction could have been inclined a little , more sunlight would have been gained for the northerly fronts of the // buildings without taking too much away from the others , which would have been an advantage . This loss of sunlight was partially overcome by the liberal use of bay windows . Another criticism is that the junction of Commonwealth Avenue with Arlington Street seems rather matterof-fact for so noble a project . A semicircular plaza here would have been very handsome and would have provided a splendid setting for the equestrian statue of Washington , which is now placed inside the Public Garden . In general , however , the layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in Commonwealth Avenue , and now , with the addition of the Esplanade , the Back Bay forms probably the finest urban residential district in America . The layout , for which many studies were made , is credited to Arthur Gilman , the architect of the Arlington Street Church . This new district beyond the railroads , continuing to the river , with its northerly corner securely anchored to the Public Garden and the hereditary aristocracy of Beacon Hill , was too much for the fickle Goddess of Fashion ; without a moment 's flutter of her wings she settled squarely upon it and in no time at all the South End burghers were deserting the homelike houses and the pretty parks and squares for the new Back Bay , and stately brownstone fronts in majestic rows were going up all along the line west from the Public Garden . Churches from the older downtown section followed , along with hotels : first the Brunswick in 1874 by Peabody &; Stearns , and then the Vendome in 188o with its white marble front and truly " sumptuous " interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' masterpiece , The Rise of Silas Lapham , a book whose interest as a story of Victorian times is as real as ever . Boston , however , has not always improved its topographical opportunities , and the development of East Boston and South Boston respectively carry a lesson to city planners // that no matter how carefully a district may be planned the caprice of fashion is an intangible influence which defies all rules . Why the mudflats and mosquitoes of the Back Bay should have seemed more attractive to the rich Bostonians of the 186o 's than the breezy hills of South Boston with their splendid marine views is one of the unsolved questions in Boston 's history . The fickle goddess did indeed alight on these hills for a short time , but she soon departed , not to return . The only answer I can give is that the Lord in His wisdom saved for His poorer and less fashionable children the beautiful area which their wealthier cousins disdained . Although the street plans of both East Boston and South Boston were planned when these tracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination was shown by the surveyors who did the work and not enough land was reserved for parks in either case . There is on Belmont Hill in the southern part of East Boston a handsome square , once the site of Fort Strong , which , had it only been extended to the crest of the bluff would have had a remarkable view over the harbor and might have made a really wonderful promenade , but the opportunity was missed . The layout of the peninsula of South Boston shows no more imagination , although Bulfinch is said to have been concerned in it in 1804 , but the very fine beach development and marine park at City Point , the " Riviera of Boston , " more than make up for the omission as far as recreation ground is concerned . THE FRENCH INFLUENCE CHAPTER VII UP TO THIS POINT the American architectural inspira-tion had been drawn from England , but now a new and more dazzling star appeared in the form of France , whose outstanding achievements in art had never been properly appraised on this side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to French influence is not clear . Historically it may be that the brilliance of the French Court under the third Napoleon and the resounding successes of French arms in Italy and the Crimea had their effect ; at any rate , French fashions in the 186o 's were in the as-cendant . Young architects and painters were beginning to go to the Ecole des Beaux Arts for their training , with the result that during and after the Civil War a new group of architects began to appear with fresh and progressive ideas . The new City Hall on School Street ( 1862 ) was one of the first productions of this era , although the Deacon man-sion on Washington Street , practically a French villa , which was built in 1848 from designs by M. Lemoulnier of Paris , had preceded it by a dozen years . The City Hall 's inspira-tion is very clearly from the Tuileries and new Louvre in Paris , with pavilions of superimposed orders of columns and that popular innovation , the mansard roof , which was to spread over the new land like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Hall in association with Arthur Gilman , was a notable figure at this time . His father , Gridley Bryant , an engineer , had designed the Granite Railway at Quincy , and the younger Gridley , who had been trained in the office of Alexander Parris , enjoyed probably the largest and most lucrative // architectural practice in the city , a fact which did not save him from passing his declining years in the Home for Aged Men which he had himself designed . It would be impossible to enumerate all of his works , and only a few can be mentioned here , but besides the City Hall he designed the addition at the rear of the State House which was removed about the year 1893 to make room for the yellow brick " Brigham " extension . I used to think this addition was the best part of the State House . He also built the City Hospital ( 1864 ) , part of the Parker House , the State 's Prison and the Charles Street jail , the penal institutions on Deer Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its statues of Ceres , Flora , and Pomona by Martin Milmore , the city halls at Lynn and Gloucester , the Old Colony railroad station , a great many schools , and over one hundred buildings in the burnt district after the great fire . There is a rumor that a French draughtsman or associate in Bryant 's office introduced the mansard roof to Boston . Could Lemoulnier , who designed the Deacon house , have been this Frenchman ? And could it have been he who brought the superimposed orders of the new Louvre to Bryant and Gilman 's City Hall ? Bryant 's first achievement was the Broadway Savings Bank Building in South Boston , and a few years later he built what is said to have been the first fireproof building in Boston , the old Registry of Deeds building on Tremont Street . Many of the buildings along Franklin Street and in Winthrop Square were his . He built jails , custom houses , and all sorts of buildings throughout Massachusetts , Maine , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , and in Philadelphia he remodeled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal courts were located . He remodeled the New Hampshire State House and built the State Industrial School at Manchester . He served as local representative of the supervising architect of the Treasury Department under seven // different cabinet officers , and he designed the interiors of the steamers Providence and Bristol , in which he introduced the spacious saloon with galleries and wide stairways , a style hitherto avoided as robbing the frame of needed stiffness . In this work he was one up on Henry Hobson Richardson , who often expressed an unsatisfied desire to design two things , an icehouse and the interior of a steamboat . Bryant was born in Boston in 1816 , a year which was the coldest on record , having frost in every month ; this circum-stance may account for his avowal that he was never warm in his life . He was educated in the public schools and after his training period in Parris ' office opened his own office on the site of the present Sears Building at Court and Washing-ton Streets . He lived quietly , mostly at hotels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never used to-bacco and rarely any alcoholic stimulant . He had cul-tivated tastes , and a strong individuality , and was an en-thusiast in his business . He was surprisingly active and alert , wore a sweeping moustache , and was short and stout with a Napoleonic carriage . He died in 1899 at the age of eighty-three years . ' Bryant 's work was always well balanced , sane , and prac-tical , and carried out with the materials at hand rather than with materials which had to be imported . He was a stabiliz-ing force in an architecturally uncertain age , and it is largely due to his influence that the Back Bay got off to its hand-some start and that the business quarter as well as the pub-lic buildings of the Boston of the sixties and seventies have a dignity unusual in the work of that period . No encyclo-pedia lists him as an important architect , but in a vague and tasteless age he produced some really sane architecture . Giedion , at least , calls him a " great commercial architect . " // The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the City Hall . It was designed in the same style by the supervising architect of the Treasury Department , A. B. Mullett , who also designed the State , War , and Navy Building in Washington and the New York Post Office . The Post Office building was practically all granite , inside and out , and was designated by Bill Nye as " an inconvenient stone quarry . " At any rate it was definitely fireproof , as was proved in the Great Fire when it stopped the conflagration at Milk Street . Its Post Office Square facade was surmounted by two marble statues by Daniel Chester French , of " Commerce " and " Industry " respectively . With the demolition of the Post Office and the Equitable Building the glory of Devonshire Street departed . Their elaborate granite rustications , arches , and superimposed applied " orders " gave an impression of magnificence which their more costly modern successors utterly fail to convey , and the pedestrian , whose bosom as he passed them used to swell with the thought that he was a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion whatever . There may be a thought here for the professors who urge starkly modernistic design on the pupils of the architectural schools . When the new North Station was built all this costly government architecture went to fill in the Charles River , where it may yet be discovered and treasured by some future wondering archaeologist . In 1859 the Arlington Street Church was built of brown sandstone by Arthur Gilman , or possibly the firm of Bryant and Gilman . It was the first church to be built on the new land , and perhaps the first of brownstone . Its graceful spire and noble interior reflect London precedent , more like St. Martin's-in-the-Fields , I think , than any of Wren 's churches , and it is certainly one of the best architectural ornaments of the city . Its interior seems Georgian , but Gilman stated // that its motif was drawn from that of the Church of Sta . An-nunziata at Genoa . Arthur Gilman 4 was one of the first Boston architects after Bulfinch to take up his profession without a pre-liminary apprenticeship in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1821 and attended Trinity College , which he left in 184o to travel abroad . After his return he was connected with the Back Bay filling project and is said to have been the designer of the Back Bay street layout . He was associated with Gridley J. F. Bryant on the Boston City Hall . In May 1867 he was employed with Edward Hale Kendall to make plans for the New York State Capitol which were not accepted , but on August 14 of that year he , with Thomas Fuller , was appointed to make another plan which was approved and accepted by the governor ; the building was started , to be later finished by H. H. Richardson . From 1868 on he made his headquar-ters in New York where , with George B. Post as consultant , he built the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway , the first office building in New York , it is said , to have elevators . After the great fire of 1872 he built the Boston Equitable Building on Milk Street , whose details showed a more so-phisticated taste than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1869 to 18.71 he built St. John 's Episcopal Church at Clifton , Staten Island . He disliked classic revivals and called the United States Capitol and Boston State House " those flaunting and meretricious edifices , " and termed Stu-art and Revett 's famous work The Antiquities of Athens " that inexhaustible quarry of bad taste . " He praised Pugin and approved the Gothic , but reserved his enthusiasm , ap-parently , for the Italian Renaissance . His own work , how-ever , seemed to be strongly influenced by the superimposed " Orders " of the French Second Empire work on the new 1 // Louvre . King 's Dictionary speaks of him as " the famous wit and bon vivant . " He died in 1882 . In 1866 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built its stately Rogers Building on Boylston Street , designed by William G. Preston , who is said to have made the plans in Paris . This famous structure , now only a memory , was ap-proached by a great flight of granite steps , which through years of roosting by the undergraduates became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in song and story . I could never see why the M. I. T. Corporation , when the school finally departed for Cambridge , could not have saved these steps and had them incorporated in the new plant ; but probably that would have been considered an unworthy bit of sentiment for an engineering school . The building of the New England Museum of Natural History ( 1863 ) was also designed by William G. Preston . The harmony of these two buildings set a fine example of regularity in civic architecture which unfortunately was not generally followed . Both of these buildings displayed very correct examples of the Corinthian order according to the Italian architect Vignola , which was a great convenience to the students of the architectural school and probably exerted considerable influence on their later work . The Boston Skating Rink , located near the corner of Tremont and Lenox Streets and built in 1868 , was a good example of the " General Grant " style of architecture prev-alent at this time . Newspaper accounts called . it the most " stylish " establishment of its kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square feet , it accommodated between fifteen and sixteen thousand persons . Apparently the own-ers were the first to introduce into this country the new in-vention of artificial ice . On September 23 , 1868 , the rink was opened with a grand promenade concert which was attended by four or five thousand people . One week later // a section of the wall over loo feet long collapsed because the foundations were insecure . It was an hour when only workmen were present ; one was killed and two others in-jured . The Boston Post of September 30 , 1868 , describes the accident . The Public Garden project had its inception in 1824 after the town had repurchased the land from the ropewalk own-ers . From then until about 185o the tract was neglected . It was known as " the marsh at the foot of the Common , " and was used principally as a dump . Its appearance was so bad that a determined effort was made to have the city sell the land for house lots . Better counsel prevailed , however , and in 1859 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public forever and the work of constructing the present beautiful Public Garden was begun . Accord-ing to Shurtleff 's history , the architect who designed it was George F. Meacham , who won the commission in a com-petition sponsored by the Board of Aldermen in 186o.6 In the same year a project was sponsored by some of the most distinguished citizens for building in the Garden a " Con-servatory of Art , Science and Historical Relics , " designed by William Waud , but this danger was averted . Since then the Garden has been let alone , and with the growth of its trees has become a splendid example of Victorian park design at its best . By 1871 the downtown business district had been solidly built up with splendid business blocks six stories or more in height , often faced with granite or cast iron , which gave the area an aspect of almost impregnable security . A well-drilled fire department of 21 steam fire engines , I1 horse hose companies , and 7 hook-and-ladder companies which could be promptly summoned by the " electric fire alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in Chicago that year could not happen here . 7 2 BOSTON AFTER BULFINCH But the fatal defects in this scheme of things were invisible . Only a very few of these magnificent buildings were fireproof . Many had wood-lined elevator shafts and stairways and many more were crowned by wooden mansard roofs , with wooden eaves and cornices . Furthermore , the water mains were small in bore and often choked with rust . For old hand-engine days they might have sufficed , but they were totally inadequate for the drafts made upon them by the new and powerful steamers . Everything was running smoothly and the city was never more prosperous than it was at seven o'clock on the evening of November 9 , 187 2 . Beginning at that hour , fire in one wild night wiped out half or more of the downtown district . Starting in a wooden elevator shaft , the fire roared up to the roof of the building at the corner of Summer and Kingston Streets and , before anything could be done , spread to the adjoining buildings . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five or six stories but were then surmounted with those wooden mansard roofs along which the flames spread with uncontrollable rapidity . The hygroscopic moisture in the supposedly fireproof granite fronts expanded and split the stone into fragments , while the cast iron plating of some of the prouder buildings buckled and curled . It was a lesson in fireproof construction learned the hard way . As such things go it was a beneficent fire , for comparatively few lives were lost , few homes were burned , few noteworthy historical monuments were destroyed , the insurance was paid , and the way was cleared for building a better city . The popular legend that the fire started in a hoop-skirt factory and spread because all the fire department horses were sick with epizootic is only partially true . It is a fact that a manufacturer of hoop skirts , corsets , and bustles occupied the third floor of the building in whose basement the fire started , but the early spread of the flames was caused // mainly by delay in turning in the alarm , and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the Great Fire a number of streets in the burned district were widened , some awkward intersections were improved , and some open spaces such as Post Office Square were created ; but no replanning in the grand manner was undertaken nor was it particularly needed . It is true that in some instances more liberal widenings would have helped the present automobile congestion , but the widened streets have on the whole served their purpose fairly well for seventy years . Rebuilding began so promptly and continued so rapidly that in a few years hardly any traces of the fire remained . The example of the value of absolutely fireproof construction which was given by the new Post Office building in stopping the fire at the corner of Milk and Devonshire Streets went practically unheeded , however , and Boston still tolerates too many downtown buildings of second-class construction . The finest of the new buildings in the burned district , and the highest , was probably that of the Equitable Life Insurance Company on Milk Street ( I 873-1875 ) , by Arthur Gilman , torn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The high mansard roof , to which my father sometimes took me , had an observation deck with a fine view of the city and harbor , and a pole with a black ball which dropped precisely at noon . Two buildings still standing on Post Office Square , but now ( 1945 ) in process of demolition , that of the New York Life Insurance Company , by Peabody and Stearns , and the old New England Mutual by N. J. Bradlee , were undoubtedly the next best . All these were , allegedly at least , in the French Renaissance style . The fine white marble clock tower of the " New York Life " building was usually copied by students of the architectural schools whenever a tower problem was given them . Nathaniel J. Bradlee was a contemporary of Bryant 's who // also enjoyed a very large practice , but one which consisted more of commercial than public buildings . He was born in 1829 at i Avon Place , graduated at Chauncy Hall School in 1846 , and entered the office of George M. Dexter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some five hundred buildings in Boston alone . The old Boston &; Maine Station in Haymarket Square and the State Lunatic Asylum at Danvers were products of his office . In 1869 he was employed by the city to superintend the moving of the Hotel Pelham which occupied the site of the present Little Building . This building covered 5800 square feet and was estimated to weigh 10,000 tons . As an example of Brad-lee 's thoroughness , he personally pasted paper over every crack which existed before the moving was begun . The job was completely successful in every way . Bradlee 's good judgment and business acumen caused him to be in demand as a director in many large banks and corporations , as well as president of several . He died December 17 , 1888 , on a train en route to Bellows Falls , Vermont. ? One more building of the French Renaissance type should be brought to mind : the Boston and Lowell Railroad Station on Causeway Street ( 1871 ) by E. A. P. Newcomb . ' In the old Grand Central manner it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the quality which has become rare of actually looking like a railroad station instead of a department store . It possessed a lofty and handsome con-course elaborately finished in oak and floored with marble which was equal in impressiveness to that of any other rail-road terminal in the country . VICTORIAN GOTHIC CHAPTER VIII I REMARKED awhile back that the history of Gothic in Boston was not well defined . During the 187o 's there were three schools of Gothic thought : first , the Straight Gothic , which we might call the Upjohn manner ; second , the type which became known as Victorian Gothic ; and lastly a style based on the teachings of John Ruskin , which for want of a better name might be called " North Italian . " The first was good honest English Gothic , usually done in Roxbury pudding stone with trimmings and edgings of sandstone . The First Church , on the corner of Berkeley and Marlborough Streets , built in 1886 by Ware and Van Brunt , will serve to illustrate this type . A considerable number of churches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another very beautiful example is the Central Congregational Church on Berkeley and Newbury Streets , by R. M. Upjohn . The Church of the Advent , built in 1878 by John H. Sturgis and Charles Brigham , is a variant of this style , being built of red brick in a manner recalling some of the Gothic work in Holland . Of the second type , the most resounding example is Memorial Hall at Harvard , by Ware and Van Brunt , dedicated in 1874 . Harvard has not properly appreciated this monument in recent years , but no matter if it is out of date , I still claim that it has its points . Just prior to the World War I , Harvard imported a French professor of architecture , of the standard type , black-bearded , long-coated , and entirely new to America . It is said that President Lowell invited him for a tour of the college and they started out together through the Yard , Lowell proudly pointing out the cherished square brick boxes , Hollis , Stoughton , and // the rest , Duquesne bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic , " " c'est charmant , " etc. , and Lowell dreading the moment when they should come to Memorial Hall . Finally they turned a corner and Memorial appeared , all its pinnacles shining in the sun , and the gilt clock striking like a band coming up the street . Duquesne stopped short , gesticulated , and exclaimed , " Ah , voila quelque chose " ? " Ah , there , at last , you have something ! " Memorial Hall is rather alone in its class , however , for most of the Victorian Gothic is as dull as dishwater . The old Boston and Providence Railroad Station in Park Square , built in the 187o 's by Peabody and Stearns , was one notable exception , for it was a really fine and actually comfortable station , with a noble lobby and a good restaurant . It was one of the few demolished Boston buildings which obtained an " obituary . " At the time of its passing , the Transcript 's " Nomad " wrote of it as follows : The Providence station had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show building of the Back Bay . It was the most Bostonian railway station that ever was erected or ever will be erected . Its gentle English Gothic exterior , its finely proportioned clock tower , its graceful facade , were the pride of our town , and the atmosphere of elegant social intercourse that pervaded its waiting rooms , its exclusive barber shop and even its refined wash rooms , was wonderful . If so soon it was to be done for , we can only wonder what it was begun for . For a time its 850-foot train shed was the largest in the whole world . And it was built to serve the business of a railroad only forty-four miles long . The exclusive atmosphere of which the " Nomad " speaks probably resulted from the fact that the main line handled most of the New York traffic while the road 's only branch ran to the genteel suburb of Dedham . Its atmosphere , but not its architecture , had a rival to a certain extent in the old Boston &; Albany station on Kneeland Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sunny waitVICTORIAN // ing room was furnished with numerous rocking chairs and three large fireplaces . Those who assert that Americans are growing soft should compare these comforts with a railroad waiting room of today . The third type of Gothic , that resulting from the influence of John Ruskin , was notably represented by the New Old South Church and the old Art Museum , which stood on the site of the Copley Plaza Hotel . Ruskin 's works had wide circulation among the cognoscenti , and Charles Eliot Norton was one of his close friends . The Gothic of North Italy , with its polychrome decoration , was Ruskin 's favorite style , so it is not surprising that the young firm of Cummings and Sears should have adopted it in 1877 for the New Old South . The resulting composition with its lofty campanile was very satisfactory , but did not lead to any very wide imitation , although the same architects built several downtown buildings in black and white marble , some of which remain . The first campanile leaned badly , owing to decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rebuilt in a form about ten feet lower . Some of the stone carving on the exterior of this church is worthy of note . The Hotel Boylston , on the site of the present Hotel Touraine , was another very fine example of the style . The Museum of Fine Arts on Copley Square , by Sturgis and Brigham , was built in 1876 . It was designed along somewhat different lines , rather flamboyant in general effect , and is principally remembered as having been one of the first American buildings to use terra cotta for external decoration . The elaborate panels and other details were manufactured in England , and their use , which caused a sensation at the time , ultimately led to the development of the present great American terra-cotta industry . The demolition of this building did not cause any general regret , although it possessed a certain interest in connection with the early use of terra-cotta ornament . Thomas F. Tallmadge , however , has // good word for it in his very readable Story of Architecture in America . ' He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed arches ; it is distinctly picturesque and Romantic with gables , dormers , and pin-nacles ; and it is distinctly Italian , the influence of Ruskin and his " Stones of Venice . " We can see the fine Italian hand in the alternate courses of white stone and dark brick , in the slender but short col-onettes with their large flowery capitals , in the round terra-cotta medallions with projecting heads from the Ospedale Maggiore in Milan , in the arcades which transport us back to the Piazza San Marco in Venice . An English building with Italian detail , and with hardly enough mistakes to make it entirely American ! With the Art Museum , Library , Trinity Church , and the New Old South assembled in one group , Copley Square became for several years the architectural center of the United States . No other street or city in the country could show such an imposing exhibition of architectural progress . Looking back it is hard to believe that such a distinguished group was , except for the Library , contemporaneous with the inanities of the Centennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be produced in America . Certainly nothing to equal it in variety and daring has appeared since , and the square , even with the changes which have been made , is still a notable compendium of American architecture . William Robert Ware ( 1832 ? 1915 ) was a very important figure in the architectural world during the last third of the century . He was born in Cambridge , ' educated at Exeter and Harvard ( ' 52 ) , and studied in the offices of E. C. Cabot and R. M. Hunt . In partnership with Henry Van Brunt he built the First Church in Boston , the old Union Station in Worcester , the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge , // Memorial Hall at Harvard , the Harvard Medical School on Boylston Street , now a part of Boston University , and other buildings . In 1863 ? 1865 he established an atelier and in 1865 he was asked to take charge of the architectural school of the newly founded Massachusetts Institute of Technology . As a preliminary he made a trip to Europe and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaux Arts where he had been a pupil of Vaudremer . Letang , the first of a long line of French architectural teachers to come to America , was tall , dark , spare , feverishly energetic , a true product of the Latin Quarter , who enjoyed the enthusiastic devotion of his pupils and exercised a wide influence on American design for many years as students flocked to the new architectural school from all parts of the country . With all his enthusiasm and lovable nature , Letang could only teach what he himself had learned from Vaudremer , his patron , but he brought to America the first exciting whiff of the air of the ateliers , the Latin Quarter , and la vie de Boheme , and led many of his students to go to Paris to try it for themselves . The rigid rules of the Boston engineering school , which insisted on closing the rooms at 415 in the afternoon , were a sore trial to the Paris-bred Bohemian , who would work all night rather than stop on a problem . He never became really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an embodiment of the Spirit of Architecture itself . A tablet to his memory was later placed by them in the courtyard of the Public Library . Ware , after having firmly established the Beaux-Arts system of education in Boston , was called to New York in 1881 to start an architectural school at the School of Mines of Columbia College . He taught there until his retirement in 1903 . He can be called the founder of American architectural education . ROMANESQUE CHAPTER IX I HAVE already said that the coming of the Greek Revival was like an epidemic . If that was so , the arrival of the Romanesque was nothing short of a blitz , and its timing was perfect . The Civil War was over , and in spite of the panic of ' 73 prosperity of the most blatant kind had returned . People were tired of mansard roof inanities and were looking for a change , no matter what , and the more violent the better . Art was now to have its innings . Henry Hobson Richardson ( 1838 ? 1886 ) was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father was a wealthy cotton broker . The family planned to send him to West Point , but he was rejected because he stuttered . He went to Cambridge and entered Harvard with the class of ' 59 . Contemporary accounts describe him as " handsome , slim and popular . " To his delight , for he had decided to study architecture , his family sent him to Paris in the summer of 1859 and a year later he was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux Arts . Here again , according to reports , he had plenty of money and was handsome and popular . With the coming of the Civil War , however , his remittances became spasmodic . It was impossible for him to go to New Orleans , so he came to Boston early in 1862 , but he returned to Paris in March of that year , where he worked with the architect Labrouste and later with J. J. Hittorff on his railroad station work . Hittorff , incidentally , was the architect of the Gare du Nord , a building familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Richardson returned to the United States and opened an office in New York . There he won competitions for a Unitarian Church in Springfield // and an Episcopal Church in West Medford , whose designs followed the Beaux-Arts manner with a Gothic tinge . But with his first Boston job , which he won in a competition , he swung into a style based on the massive Romanesque work in Southern France . This building , the new Brattle Square Church , was irreverently called the " Church of the Holy Bean Blowers " from the trumpeting angels on Bartholdi 's carved frieze around its square tower . The building of Trinity Church on Copley Square gave him an adequate opportunity to exercise his brilliant talents . This church is a radical departure from the conventional precedent , its plan being a Greek instead of a Latin cross , and the general composition is a very striking assembly of details from varying sources . The great central tower , for example , is an adaptation and enlargement of the central tower of the old Romanesque cathedral of Salamanca ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Auvergne , that of the town of Issoire in particular ; and the west portals are from the churches of Arles and St. Gilles in Provence . Richardson explained that his reason for adopting this type was the fact that the church fronted on three streets , and a spire placed in the usual loca-tion would present a satisfactory appearance from only one of them , whereas the pyramidal form of the central tower design would be good from all sides . ' This tower , which weighs nineteen million pounds , is carried on four great granite piers . The builders were Norcross Brothers of Worcester . One writer on architecture considers the four greatest modern churches to be the Cathedral of Ste. Marie Majeure at Marseilles , the Westminster Roman Catholic Cathedral in London , St. John the Divine in New York , and Trinity Church in Boston . ' // The fame of this spectacular design spread rapidly , and Richardson 's services were at once in demand all over the East and North . New York City was cool to the new gospel , but upstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson both to complete the new State Capitol , which had been started by Arthur Gilman and Thomas Fuller , and to design the Albany City Hall . Pittsburgh and Chicago millionaires wore a path to the door of his office , which by now he had established in a remote section of Brookline . Hundreds of imitators followed , and the entire country was smothered under a flood of gloomy and heavy public and private buildings of all sorts which lasted until the dawn of another era , after the Chicago Fair of 1893 . Henry Hobson Richardson died in 1886 , only fortyeight years old . Although it must be noted that the comparatively simple works of the self-taught Bulfinch have long outlasted in the public estimation the more sophisticated productions of Richardson , it can be said that he not only gave the city of Boston a temporary leadership in architectural affairs but did a tremendous service in causing American architectural design to break away from its fetters of stodgy classicism into a freer atmosphere , which if still eclectic was at least open-minded , and in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with his style was its medievalism . It ignored the teachings of modern progress in matters of planning , sunlight , air , and fire-resisting construction , and created defects which nullified its benefits to a great extent , discredited the profession in the minds of the public , and brought about the early abandonment of the style . According to the account of his life by Talbot F. Hamlin in the Dictionary of American Biography he lived well and " was noted for his capacity for champagne , love of laughter and extraordinary gusto . " He had " an amazingly sensitive feeling for the true dualities of building maROMANESQUE 8 3 terials . " During his Boston years he was " famous , sought after and prosperous . " Richardson also designed in New England , mostly for the Boston and Albany Railroad , a delightful series of suburban railroad stations whose spreading roofs and long platform coverings provided a novel and pleasing inspiration , and several public libraries which are picturesque and interesting , though on the whole less successful . His most noteworthy productions after Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall Field Store in Chicago . In Boston he built the romantically gabled and dormered Ames warehouse on Bedford and Kingston Streets , whose frowning rough stone facade and pitch-pine interior went up in smoke in the great fire of November 1889 . In Chicago and Washington he also built important houses , a little on the heavy side , but full of interest . To Harvard he contributed the Law School ( Austin Hall ) and Sever Hall , of which the former is frankly Richardsonian while in the latter he seems to have made an obvious and quite successful attempt to conform in some degree to his surroundings . A by-product of his influence , and there were many , was the First Spiritual Temple , the elaborate granite and brownstone building on Exeter and Newbury Streets , designed for Marcellus J. Ayer by Hartwell and Richardson as a meetingplace for the Spiritualist denomination and now better known as the Exeter Theater . While this building has the outward trappings of Richardson 's Romanesque , it somehow fails to embody its spirit , as do most of the productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the i 88o 's by the serio-comic episode of the " Queen Anne " style which for a decade or so disturbed the peace of mind of the architects who were already unduly excited by the Romanesque interhide . The origin of this episode was somewhat doubtful . // Some ascribed it to William Morris , an English disciple of John Ruskin and an apostle of the True and Beautiful in all the arts , who seems to have advocated a return to the rugged and honest , even if slightly rough , craftsmanship of our peasant ancestors . Charles Locke Eastlake , an English architect , wrote in 1873 a book called Hints on Household Taste which recommended the use of chamfers , incised discs , and decorations of broken wheat stalks , cattail reeds , spin-dly balusters , and mantelpieces full of cubbyholes and lit-tle mirrors . Some masterpieces of this style by Boston architects were proudly adorned by a window in their overmantels . Some English architects , Norman Shaw and others , fell into step and put out exciting designs in half-timber and " rough-cast " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dormers . The style became fashion-able in America and had a considerable vogue , but actually its sham half-timberwork and shingle imitations of Tudor manor houses constituted an orgy of architectural dishon-esty . The decorations and lingo of the style were satirized by Gilbert and Sullivan in the operetta Patience , to the great amusement of the public . The productions of the " Queen Anne " period were at their worst in country houses , but a good many city houses can be seen in the 188o areas of the Back Bay and along Huntington Avenue , among them numerous optimistic at-tempts to marry the Queen Anne to the Romanesque . The life of the Queen Anne episode was short , however , and the sway of the Renaissance was to last for many years , into the twentieth century . The building of the Boston Art Club at 150 Newbury Street , designed by William Ralph Emerson , is an example of an attempt of the time to carry out country house ( and very English ) architecture in a city building . According to Bacon 's Guide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded prizes . In the structure as built " the best features of all six plans were combined . " Huntington Avenue , loo feet wide , laid out in 1872 , followed Columbus and Commonwealth Avenues as the third great outlet from the heart of the city to the west and south , and its destiny was different from that of either of the others . Buildings were slow in coming to it at first , but around 1881 the Charitable Mechanics Association built its Exposition Building on the Avenue , followed soon after by that of the New England Manufacturers ' and Mechanics Association , nearly opposite . The first of these , designed by William C. Preston , is still standing . It is a serious piece of architecture , up to date in its time , and still impressive . The red brick facades are decorated with medallions and ornaments of red terra cotta , and the open trusses of Georgia pine over the main hall are really splendid pieces of construction . The second had a less successful career and after a few years became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it was burned with serious loss of life . Other buildings on Huntington Avenue which have been demolished were the Children 's Hospital , built in 1882 , and the large Hotel Oxford , which stood on the south side , next to the bridge , but until its awakening in the i 88o 's the roadway led between empty lots , filled with gravel and enclosed with wooden fences . Both Columbus and Commonwealth Avenues were built up with private houses considerably above the average of the time in luxury and size , but Huntington Avenue came into popularity at a moment when " French flats " were the last word , particularly for medium-priced habitations , and it was rapidly built up with apartment houses of the fouror sometimes five-story " walk-up " type of building , often regrettably the products of real-estate offices rather than // those of architects . This moment also happened to coincide with the confusion caused by the impact of the " Queen Anne " movement upon the still only slightly understood Romanesque , with the result that the avenue 's architecture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the restful , if slightly soporific , regularity of Columbus Avenue on the one hand , nor the ambitious variety of Commonwealth Avenue on the other . It is quite possible to believe , however , that the architectural future of Huntington Avenue , as an institutional thoroughfare , may greatly surpass its past . The Mission Church on Tremont Street , Roxbury , completed in 1878 , is said to have been designed by Schickel and Ditmars . It is definitely one of the most important landmarks in the city . It reflects the French idea at the time of the Romanesque style and is similar in many ways to the wellknown Eglise de Montrouge on the Avenue du Maine in Paris . In a way it was a precursor of the growing influence of the Ecole des Beaux Arts on American architecture . The two handsome spires , which form a striking feature of the district , were added in 1909 by F. Joseph Untersee . RENAISSANCE CHAPTER X // is presented by the architecture of the Back Bay as building progressed westerly from Arlington Street . Owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformity of the South End architecture was not repeated here . More architects and more of their clients visited Europe and returned with ideas and yearnings to copy the facades and motifs they had seen abroad . The narrow-fronted twenty-five-foot lots were a severe handicap to any sort of regularity or any feeling of the grand manner , but in spite of this difficulty there are some pleasing , even if accidental , vistas , as , for example , the view of the west side of Dartmouth Street from Copley Square and certain sections of the Arlington-Berkeley block on Commonwealth Avenue . This block on all the westbound streets , as well as Arlington Street , consists mostly of mansard-roofed brownstone houses , usually of quite regular architecture , with doorways which largely follow the " Orders " as set forth by the treatises of Vignola . The result , if not inspiring , is dignified and handsome and was helped by the fact that often several houses were built together of uniform design . The Vignola-type designs were mixed with some of palpable Beaux-Arts origin , of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . Westward from this general locality no particular rule or principle was followed , and French chateaux , Greek Revival mansions , and Boston " Colonial " align themselves with impartial tolerance beside such distinctly New Yorkese facades as that of McKim 's Algonquin Club . George A. Clough , who for a time during the seventies and eighties occupied the position of city architect , produced a // number of creditable municipal buildings , of which his schools were the most notable . His masterpiece in this direction was probably the English High and Latin School on Montgomery Street , which is still in constant use and is a good building today . In plan it reflects his studies of the latest European ideas of the time . As the result of a competition he was appointed architect of the Suffolk County Court House on Pemberton Square , built in 1888-89 , whose floor layout was also in advance of its time , though its exterior design was less successful . The dome which was originally planned was never built . Clough was a native of Blue Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discussed the progress of Boston architecture from Bulfinch to Richardson . That period , as far as Boston architects were concerned , was completed about 188o , a date which a certain critic asserted also marked the final completion of Boston ; but its termination was accompanied by one of the most dramatic events in the history of American architecture , and one whose true proportions are not often realized . Trinity had just been finished and the architectural world was ringing with its praise . Richardson was in the full bloom of his young renown . Architects from all over the country came to see his buildings and returned home resolved to imitate them . New York City alone remained skeptical . At this juncture the city of Boston determined to build a new Public Library across Copley Square from Trinity which would be the library of the country , without question . The city 's existing collection of books was already world famous ; it deserved a notable building , and the choice of an architect was a serious matter . Richardson , a local man but nationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A political interlude caused the temporary appointment of another architect , and work from his plans was actually started // when the trustees got their breath , brushed him aside , and appointed McKim , Mead and White of New York . This meant a good deal more than merely appointing an architect from another city , for McKim actually had strong Boston connections ; it meant a revolt against the Romanesque and a direct challenge to the cult of medievalism . The New York firm , after early experiments in picturesque designing , had swung quite definitely to a style based upon the Renaissance palaces of Rome , in which they found inexhaustible inspiration , but it was a style diametrically opposed to Richardson 's ideas . The Library , superbly designed , beautifully built , an aristocrat among buildings , and unquestionably a masterpiece of American architecture , experienced a success as resounding as that of its rival . Sixty years later , suave , confident , and dignified , it faces Trinity across the square , still brusque and swaggering but conscious of defeat . Anything may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion oscillates with an increasingly rapid tempo , and a shattered world may yet revert to the dark ages of the Romanesque as an escape from the machines of modernism , as it did once before ; in that case , the now neglected Richardson may again come into his own ; but McKim 's appointment for the Library was the beginning of an era which is not yet finished . In the years when the Library was new , and before people had lost their interest and had begun to think of it as just another dingy old granite building , it used to be said that it was a copy of the Bibliotheque Ste. Genevieve in Paris and that McKim really deserved little credit for its design . Today probably very few people care enough about the matter to look up a photograph of the handsome building which Labrouste erected in 843 on the north side of the Place du Pantheon . It is true that a marked similarity exists between the two designs , so great that there can be no doubt that McKlln 's inspiration did come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second story with its row of arched windows extending its entire length , which is the dominating feature in both designs , is evidence enough . Beyond this point , however , the similarity vanishes , for all the details and the entire architectural style are different . McKim 's details are Roman Renaissance while those of Labrouste are what is known as " Neo-Grecque , " which is the name the French gave to their own version of the Greek Revival , for it was not in the Gallic temperament to handle any style as the English did , much less to swallow any foreign style whole without adding a flavor of its own . English and American architects tried to see who could make the most exact copies of antique Grecian models , but in the hands of the French masters the same models appeared equipped with an entire set of new details which , while still indubitably Greek in feeling , certainly never came from Stuart and Revett . In the courtyard of the Library the column capitals in the arcade are palpably copies of those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall treatment above the arcade is Roman , but McKim did not hesitate to use Early Florentine consoles for the balcony , or any other detail which seemed to him to be appropriate ; the general effect was the main thing in his eyes , and any one will agree that he attained his objective . Copy or not , he produced something which two generations later remains one of the noblest buildings in the country . When it was built , the Library was covered with a roof of dark red Italian tiles which was surmounted by a handsome copper " cheneau " or cresting . In recent years this roof leaked so badly that the tiles had to be removed along with the " cheneau " and replaced with gypsum plank covered with ordinary black tar paper . It may be fervently hoped that now the war is over a way will be found to replace the original handsome roof , though this writer doubts if two local citizens in a hundred have noticed the change , RENAISSANCE 9 I or ever look at the building anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of visitors . The Library has also suffered from decay of the wooden piling which supports it , probably because of the lowering of the water level in the ground caused perhaps by the subway which runs along the building 's northern side and perhaps by change of water level in the Basin . This situation has been corrected as far as the Library is concerned , but it is one which is affecting , and probably will in the future increasingly affect , a great many more Back Bay buildings . With all the intention in the world of creating a masterpiece of architecture the city again fell short of completing the accessories , and the square in front of the Library still remains unfinished . McKim 's conception , as shown by his drawing published at the time , was a finely paved and welllighted plaza , broken only by a monumental fountain in the center , which would be an extremely simple and dignified treatment . Many designs for improving Copley Square have been put forward , ranging from sunken gardens to parking spaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the Library itself . Fortunately a beneficent providence , as in the case of the Conservatory in the Public Garden , has so far protected the city from the execution of any of these projects , and the removal of the diagonal car tracks now leaves the square open to a dignified treatment . Charles Follen McKim ( 1847-1909 ) , the architect of the Library , was born at Isabella Furnace , Chester County , Pennsylvania . After preliminary studies at the Lawrence Scientific School he entered the Atelier Daumet in Paris , where he remained from 1867 to 1870 . When war appeared imminent between Germany and France he returned to the United States and entered the New York office of Gambrill and Richardson , which was then engaged on the preliminary studies for Trinity Church in Boston . In 1878 and 1879 he associated William Rutherford Mead and Stanford White // with himself , forming the firm of McKim , Mead and White , which was destined to become the most important and famous one of its time in America . Its list of commissions was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White as designers was amazing . Their slightest touch seemed to endow the simplest design with a distinction all its own . Their rivals accused them of plagiarizing , and certainly no ancient masterpiece was safe from finding itself , revitalized and reconditioned , standing bravely in some busy American city and seemingly perfectly at home in its new location . Charles Moore , an American writer on architectural subjects and secretary of the commission which replanned a part of the city of Washington , applied to McKim the words of Lowell , " Always he took the coinage of the past and reminted it to suit his own purposes , giving it his own image and superscription . " McKim was unable to imagine one of his compositions as complete without sculpture and painting as constituent parts , equal in importance to the architecture itself , and hence we see the Boston Library a complete whole , glowing with the murals of Abbey , Sargent , and Puvis de Chavannes , and the sculpture of Saint-Gaudens . Other works of the firm in Boston were the Algonquin Club , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the building of the New England Trust Company , Symphony Hall , the Shaw monument , and the former home of the University Club on Beacon Street , now demolished . Of the list of their works in New York and elsewhere samples only can be given here : the Pennsylvania Station and the hotel opposite , the New York University Club , the Century Club , the Library and other buildings of Columbia College ; the Agricultural Building and New York State Building at the World 's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 ; the restoration of the White House in Washington ; and many others . // In the course of the 1800 's Boston accumulated a consid-erable number of statues of various celebrities . At first , most of these were of the frock-coat and baggy-trouser type , but later several examples of more interesting subjects ap-peared , some of which are still admired . Among these , the equestrian statue of Washington in the Public Garden is easily first in popularity . The sculptor , Thomas Ball ( 1819 ? 191 I ) , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign and fancy painter . " He made several visits to Florence and passed a good deal of time there , but never became Italianized . The " Washington " which he modeled in plaster occupied his time for over three years , but ten years elapsed before it was finally unveiled on July 3 , 1869.1 It was the first equestrian statue in Boston and the fourth in the United States . The only serious criticism it has had was by Wendell Phillips , an irrepressible critic , who made a number of derogatory remarks about it and much preferred Rimmer 's " Alexander Hamilton " which stands farther up Commonwealth Avenue . Ball 's statue is dignified but not dramatic , and in that respect undoubtedly portrays the General better than some other statues . It personifies the successful commander , confidently surveying the field , rather than the hero receiving the plaudits of the multitude . The total cost of the statue and pedestal , which was designed by Hammatt Billings , was $42,442 . Of this sum $ I o , 000 was appropriated by the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball was also the creator of the " Emancipation Group , " the original of which was erected in the city of Washington in 1875 . The replica in Park Square was presented to the city by Moses Kimball in 1877 . Every cent of the $17,000 which the original group cost was contributed by freed men and women . This group , of which present-day Bostonians seem barely conscious , is called by Lorado Taft " one of the // inspired works of American sculpture ; a great theme expressed with emotion by an artist of intelligence and sympathy , who felt what he was doing . " Ball in his autobiography says that while modeling the group in Florence he could not find a good enough model for the figure of the nude slave , so by an arrangement of mirrors on each side of him he worked in a kneeling position and was his own model . The original was cast in the Royal Foundry of Herr von Muller in Munich . Another important but not very well-known work of Ball 's is the Washington monument which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Searles and stands there in the public square . It is well worth a visit . In addition to his talents as a sculptor , Ball was a good painter , musician , and singer , as well as the possessor of a good deal of mechanical skill . Few men have had a more interesting and varied life . The Brewer Fountain on the Common gives a touch of Paris to the shady locality where it stands . It is a bronze replica of a fountain designed by Lienard of that city and was presented to the city of Boston by Gardner Brewer in 1868 . The figures at the base depict Neptune , Amphitrite , Acis , and Galatea . The design received the gold medal at the Paris Exposition in 1855 . It is a graceful object and needs only a freer use of water . In the closing years of the century a group of sculptors developed in Boston whose work was largely , but by no means entirely , architectural . Possibly the architect H. H. Richardson , who used a great deal of carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this development , but the use of such ornament increased and became widespread . John Evans , a Welshman , and himself a carver of no mean ability , became a prominent contractor for carved work and several talented carvers were employed upon his enterprises . Among these the names of Mora , // Cairns , and Milne should not be forgotten , while that of John Kirchmeyer , a really great artist who specialized in ecclesiastical work , will long be held in affectionate remembrance . " Boston , " remarked Leslie 's Weekly in its issue of December 17 , 1896 , " is always funny , but sometimes it is funnier than others . " The particular incident which provoked its mirth on this occasion was the curious brainstorm which was afflicting the intelligentsia of the city over the pregnant question of the " limitations of art versus the morality of beauty . " Charles F. McKim , the designer of the Library , looked upon his finished work and found it good . Only one thing was lacking to complete the picture , and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick MacMonnies , had just completed a delightful bronze figure of a nude dancing girl holding an infant on her left arm while with her right hand she dangled a bunch of grapes in front of his laughing face . The whole composition was gay , charming , and innocent . McKim bought it for $25,000 and offered it to the trustees as a gift , never guessing what a Pandora 's box he had opened . The art commission was supplied with photographs to examine before the arrival of the statue and handed down a decision that " the idealizing of a woman dancing in a drinking revelry was inappropriate for a Library , " though beyond the bunch of grapes ? which might have signified grape nuts or grape juice ? there was no suggestion of alcoholic intoxication . When the statue was set in place , however , they had another look , and reversed their decision , saying this time that " it was an incident in the entire decoration and a joyous feature in an otherwise austere surrounding . " But the damage had been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnatory letters , and " the more vulgar of the // preachers howled in indignation . " 2 Worse yet , a hushed rumor went around that the model who had posed for the statue was , in the words of the newspapers , none other than " the notorious Sarah Brown , " though why such an epithet should be applied to that hard-working and obliging Pari-sienne was not made clear . Supporters of the statue brought forward photographs to prove that the actual model was the virtuous but anonymous Mlle. Beatrice W  --  of Paris , to whose figure no one could possibly object , even for a Library . Dazed by the clamor , the trustees gave in ; McKim with-drew his offer ; and the Bacchante sadly traveled back to New York where she now stands unnoticed in the Metropolitan Museum . A replica , equally unnoticed , is in the Garden Court of the Boston Art Museum , and another in the Luxem-bourg Gardens in Paris , unless the Germans have stolen it . The excited Back Bay spinsters and the noisy preachers have calmed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-mains empty ; and the gay little statue of a dancing girl with a baby on her arm and " just a drappie in her ee " has be-come an almost forgotten legend of the Mauve Decade . THE STEEL FRAME CHAPTER XI THE SUCCESSIVE advents of the Greek Revival , the Gothic , and the Romanesque failed to exhaust the architec-tural surprises of the Victorian Age . As the century neared its end another innovation appeared , this time not a mere matter of transient architectural style but one which was to revolutionize the art of building , change the sky lines of American cities , and at last transform European contempt for our architecture into sincere , if grudging , admiration . The steel frame , or " skeleton " method of construction for multi-story buildings was invented in Chicago about 1884 by Major W. L. B. Jenney of that city , according to a reli-able authority . ' Hitherto such buildings had been con-structed with floors resting on bearing walls of solid masonry , a method which constituted a severe limitation to height since so much wall thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-story building as to make it unpractical . By the new method the walls of each story were carried on shelf angles at that story , and the entire construction was borne on columns , at first of cast iron but soon of steel , the whole resulting in great reduction of weight as well as increase in floor space . Chicago , the birthplace of skeleton construc-tion , contained a group of enthusiastic young architects who saw in the new principle the germ of a new architecture based on - vertical rather than horizontal lines and expressing the building 's structural skeleton . They proceeded to develop a series of designs of which many were interesting and some quite beautiful . Louis H. Sullivan , born in Boston in 1856 , a rebellious and // talented spirit , was their unquestioned leader and his name is still held in architectural reverence . Although his followers in the eastern cities were few , his life is a part of the story of steel-frame architecture . New York , which in the nineties had become the leader of architectural style , was slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timehonored cornice , which was appropriate to ordinary buildings , became unmanageable when a height of fifteen or twenty stories was passed , and did not seem to have any idea how to get rid of it . Likewise , New York architects felt that the tremendous weight of such buildings had to be expressed by massive rustications or arches at the base , although the weight was actually carried by invisible steel uprights , and they worried about the appearance of such a mass apparently resting on nothing more substantial than sheets of plate glass . To all this Sullivan replied that , since with the new type of construction a building was very little , if any , heavier at the base than the top , he would put the lightest and most delicate ornamentation , in the design of which he was a master , at the bottom where people could see it , and from it his piers , which were only just thick enough to encase the steel columns , would fly aloft to finish in a delicate and airy cornice . The plaster classicism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1893 was a sore trial to him , but he had a chance to reply to it with his very beautiful and original Transportation Building , which was a veritable milestone in American architectural history . Sullivan studied for a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he was restive under the conventional tutelage of Ware and Letang . He went to Philadelphia , thence to Chicago , and from there to Paris in 1874 , where he performed the incredible feat of passing the entrance examinations for the Ecole des Beaux Arts in French with only six weeks ' preparation . Here again he chafed at scholasticism , and the next year found him back in Chicago , where in i 88o THE STEEL FRAME gq he became a partner in an old established firm which soon changed its name to Adler &; Sullivan . This firm had many large commissions , including the Auditorium . With all this success , however , Sullivan 's fame has been that of a prophet and teacher rather than a practitioner , and the best exponents of his theories , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " have been others who took his ideas less seriously , like Cass Gilbert who effortlessly tossed off the Woolworth Building in New York , almost , as one might say , with one hand , while with the other he produced traditional classic . Sullivan died in 1924 , regarded by some as a failure , but if failure he was , which this writer doubts , his failure was greater than the success of many others and his efforts and ideas are built imperishably into the fabric of architecture in America . In Boston , in the decade of the eighties , the igo-foot Ames Building was the city 's only skyscraper . Built at the corner of Washington and Court Streets , by Shepley , Rutan and Coolidge , the immediate successors of Henry Hobson Richardson , it has walls which at the base are four feet thick . Its two street fronts , handsomely treated in a commercial version of the Romanesque , are practically invisible above the fourth or fifth stories because of the narrowness of the streets , while the exceedingly prominent party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion that party walls are invisible is not confined to this building or to Boston , but has persisted everywhere practically to the present time . The first steel-frame office building in Boston was probably either 7 Water Street by Clarence H. Blackall or the Brazer Building on State Street by Cass Gilbert . These two were quickly followed by a multitude of others . Few , if any , Boston architects were mach impressed by the new Chicago architectural gospel for office-huilding design ; they gener-
