If sleuthing doctors are right , chemists may soon know how to make penicillin synthetically-and penicillin is desperately scarce . This speculation popped out of a report to the American Chemical Society , in which Manhattan 's Drs . Gustav J. Martin and C. Virginia Fisher observed that penicillin seems to act much like the acridine group of drugs which deprive bacteria of oxygen . The doctors even guessed that penicillin may turn out to be a member of this group which can be manufactured easily . <P> The acridines were the wonder drugs of World War I-but the doctors did not know it . When they were introduced in 1917 , surgeons were prejudiced against using chemicals in wounds , because the wound antiseptics then in use were too caustic . But World War II doctors have taken up the acridines again . Last year Major G. A. G.Mitchell and Lieut . Colonel G. A. H. Buttle of the Royal Army Medical Corps used proflavine , now the most popular acridine , on 80 serious wounds in North Africa , reported in the Lancet that " proflavine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other drug . . . so far tried . " ( They had already tried sulfa drugs . ) <P> Drs . Martin and Fisher also talked about a new extract of penicillium mold , penicillin B ( the original penicillin must henceforth be called penicillin A ) . Penicillin B 's attack is exactly opposite to A's-it supplies bacteria with too much oxygen . The two should never be used together , as they might cancel each other out . Researchers at St. Louis University who isolated the new penicillin B claim that it is ten times as effective as penicillin A , but even rarer .
