Socialized medicine-or anything that even looks or smells like socialized medicine-gives the American Medical Association chills &; fever . Last week in St. Louis ( see above ) A.M.A. officials were running a temperature . Harry Truman , pledged to compulsory national health insurance , had unexpectedly won the election-with a Democratic Congress . What should A.M.A. do ? " <P> First , A.M.A. 's policy-making House of Delegates turned down a proposal for a nonprofit national health insurance company . The plan was recommended by the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Commissions , headed by Dr. Paul Ramsey Hawley . The idea was to issue policies covering hospital and medical bills on a nationwide scale , which would allow big businesses to sign one contract covering all employees , no matter where they work . The plan would give more people better medical care , and thus probably lessen agitation for compulsory insurance . But A.M.A. said no : the whole thing looked like socialism , it called for too much centralization and too much interference with doctors by laymen . <P> Then A.M.A. 's rulers voted to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy in the organization 's 100 years . The $3,500,000 would be spent on a campaign of " education " to tell people the advantages of the " American system " of medical care . Federal Security Administrator Oscar R. Ewing says that the " education " will be A.M.A. " lobbying " against Government health insurance .
