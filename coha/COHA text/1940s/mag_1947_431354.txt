 | Mr. Secretary Marshall Condensed from Collier 's John Hersey Author of " A Bell for Adana " and " Hiroshima " ONCE when General George Catlett Marshall was Chief of Staff , working too hard , he remarked to a member of his Family , " A job I 'd like to have is Secretary of State . I could then move out to our place at Leesburg and just spend a few hours a day in Washington . That would be a nice rest . " Times have changed since then . The job of Secretary of State has become , next to the Presidency , the most demanding of all Government posts . An ideal Secretary of State , in these days of peripatetic and wearying conferences , would have a mind combining the powers of Albert Einstein , Benjamin Franklin and the International Business Machines ' Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator ; and a body blending the merits of Glenn Davis and Methuselah . The next best thing , at the moment , seems to be General Marshall , whose mind and body at 66 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The General has always taken zealous care of his body . As a young man he was a skillful athlete , played on the VMI football team for two years , and was named All-Southern tackle . While Chief of Staff , Marshall got up before 6:3o every morning , rode his horse along the Potomac for half an hour , and was at the office at 7:30 . Marshall is a great admirer of Benjamin Franklin , and he takes quite literally his advice about sufficient sleep and temperance in all things . He never smokes and has aways been a careful drinker .  | The General 's temperament and the nature of his mind have enhanced his health . His brain seems to consist of a number of vaults , in each of which are numerous files . When he is done with business in one vault , he slams its door shut , and opens another . This faculty makes him able to concentrate everything on his immediate job , and leaves him almost completely free of worry about things he has finished . Once he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall has a memory that awes most of the men with whom he works . When he was Chief of Staff , he never carried notes into hearings of Congressional Appropriations and Military Affairs Committees , and yet he frequently ( and casually ) amazed Congressmen by saying things like : " The total requirement for semiautomatic rifles is 240,559 , of which there are 167 , - 789 on hand and on order , leaving a remaining requirement of 72,770 . " He apparently throws out of his mind all things which are neither useful nor pleasurable to him . This remarkable economy of mind partly accounts for the immense amount of work he can do . During the war he kept track of an astounding number of details , concerning not only our own armed forces but also those of our enemies . Discussing the distribution of 53 Japanese divisions across the home islands , he pointed to a spot on his map and said : . " This outfit is designated as an armored division , but right now it 's just three brigades of tanks ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest talent as executive in charge of the U. S. Army was his ability to reduce masses of detail to their essential meaning , then make up his mind on the broad issues involved . This knack of synthesis has been , and will be , of great value to him in arriving at decisions in the diplomatic field . But it is inevitable , since politics and diplomacy are new terrain for him , that his broad decisions can be only as good as the many details given him by subordinates . A tendency to look ahead has helped the General to anticipate trouble . His amazing command of details at Congressional hearings was not simply a feat of memory . About a week before each hearing , he conferred with his Congressional liaison officer , Major General Wilton B. Persons , and a number of assistants . Together they listed the sticklers he was liable to have thrust at him ; General Marshall then studied the pertinent facts gathered by his staff . Similarly , just after his return from China , he timed his important forswearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have hindered his work . Reporters greeted him on the station platform with questions about his plans for the State Department ; all wanted to ask about the Presidency , but none thought the time was yet propitious . " Any more questions ? " the General finally asked . " If not ,  | I 've something I 'd like to say . " And he surprised everyone with his nowfamous declaration . ' FOR MUCH of the placidity with which he has been able to carry on his work , General Marshall has to thank the thoughtfulness and understanding of Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall , his second wife . His first wife died in 1927 . Katherine Marshall , a gracious , sensitive , capable lady , helped her husband immensely in the war years by maintaining an efficient , quiet house . She never knew how many guests the General might bring home to lunch . The General 's secretary phoned her when he left his office , and by the time he arrived home , everything was arranged and unruffled , as if the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings she walked with him , arranged canoeing parties , listened when he wanted to talk out a tough decision , or ? more heroic ? let him alone when he did n't want to talk . Perhaps Secretary Marshall would be in a stronger position in the encounters ahead of him if he were more of a student of economics and politics . But he is , at least , a technician in human relations . He studies the men with whom he works , and those with whom he negotiates , almost as hard as he studies the issues under debate . The best way , therefore , to estimate how he will fit into the complicated human equations of peace conferences is to inquire what sort of human being he himself is . In Washington he has a reputation for being a trifle stiff and forbidding . He has never had a nickname since , at 16 , he left Uniontown , Pa. , where he was called " Flicker . " Unlike General Eisenhower , whom many subordinates call " Ike , " Marshall has kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is only a handful of men in the Army who call him " George " ? and they are long-standing friends , like Major General Philip B. Peyton , who roomed with Marshall at VMI . President Roosevelt , who was the first-namingest man in Washington , always called him " General . " The Secretary is , however , capable of deep friendships , and the fact that he is reserved makes these intimacies seem all the deeper . During the war , for instance , he developed a great liking and respect for another reserved man , Field Marshal Sir John Dill , the former Chief of the Imperial General Staff , who represented Britain on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . He formed close friendships with Henry L. Stimson , James F. Byrnes and Harry S. Truman .  | Before he died , Field Marshal Dill paid General Marshall a compliment that touched on the quality which , above all others , has earned the General his great reputation . " All the British authorities who come in contact with him , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives and whatever action he recommends have no object other than to advance the common cause . " Nobody has ever been able to find personal motives in any big thing he has done . On Marshall 's 63rd birthday , General Arnold rigged a surprise party for him . Secretary of War Stimson , another close friend , made this toast : " As a result of my experience during a somewhat long life , I have become accustomed to placing the various holders of public office in one of two categories ? first , those who are thinking primarily of what they can do for the job which they hold , and second , those who are thinking primarily of what the job can do for them . I think that General Marshall stands at the very top of the first list . . . one of the most selfless public officials I have ever known . " Secretary Marshall 's integrity and his ability to earn such close friends will be much more important to him in his present job than it was in the Army . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a matter of intensely personal teamwork . One of the first things he did when he returned from Nanking to Washington was to ask some of his subordinates what they thought he had done wrong in China . They told him . Unlike many public figures , who wrestle with each other for footage of newsprint , Marshall fights shy of publicity . One reporter , who followed him all over China for nearly half a year , wound up with exactly three words authorized for quotation ? the situation is " serious and critical . " As Secretary of State he is obliged to say more for the press , but he chooses his subjects very carefully , and sticks to them . " No publicity will do me no harm , but some publicity will do me no good , " he once said . The Secretary has a reputation for being considerate of others . Whenever he returned from an inspection tour of a front , he telephoned scores of Army wives to report on their husbands . He often gave lifts in his plane to GIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his subordinates in great measure ? exactly so long as they do a good job . He can not abide mediocrity , and some high-ranking officers feel that his intolerance of error has ruined a few careers . ( The same officers hastily add that this intolerance has been a sharp spur to themselves in their own careers . ) Clearly the greatest problem that Marshall inherited with the State Department is that of maintaining friendly relations with Russia . Three incidents in the record of his contacts with the Russians suggest that he will not lack courage to do whatever he considers correct and just ;  | and that he will treat the Russians to the same candor that has become his norm in dealing with Americans . The first of these occurred in 1942 , when Molotov visited Washington to plead for a second front . President Roosevelt was agreeing in principle , but putting the Russians off with general answers . General Marshall told Molotov exactly why there could be no invasion then : Ships were lacking . He told how many ships it would take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molotov that the Russians were costing us sorely in shipping on the Murmansk run . He spoke bluntly , and several times he asked that both Russian and American interpreters should translate what he said , so that there could be no mistaking his words . He settled the discussion . The second incident took place in China last year . There was some question as to how the Russians , who had obtained certain rights in the port of Dairen , in lower Manchuria , would react to a United States consular officer in Dairen . Instead of asking the Russians and inviting a negative answer , General Marshall put a consul on a naval vessel and sent him there . The Russians made no objection . The third event was also in China . Shortly before the General 's return home , he told Soviet Ambassador Apollon A. Petrov , with absolute frankness , that he considered the reactionaries in the Central Government just as responsible as the Cornmunists for the failure of Kuomin- tang-Communist negotiations . Any mental reservations Petrov may have had must have been dispelled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said exactly the same thing . MARSHALL 'S politics are rooted in early American history . He has read widely in the lives and records of the founding fathers , and can quote the Federalist papers by the yard . In his study of history , he always looks for the force that brings a balance between extremes , for the middle-ofthe-road factor . He believes that more careful study of its own history would help to keep this country on a course of moderation , compromise and peace . The new Secretary of State rather indignantly denies that the Army is trying to take over the country 's foreign affairs . He says , first of all , that he neither wanted nor invited the toughest job of his life when he thought his work was all done . He cites the record of the Army in trying to extricate itself from civil affairs , especially in Italy . He believes firmly that the civilian branches of the Government should always dominate the military . More importantly , the General has considered the differences between the military and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military affairs are relatively rigid ; decisions stick . But foreign policies shift and grow , as the General learned in China , and the words  | of the signed covenants stretch and twist around and will not rest . It will take a long time to determine whether Marshall will be able to put his understanding of these things into practice , since for half a century he has trained himself in the rigidities , the forthrightness , the manliness , the unequivocality of military life . His straightforwardness , honesty , candor and good will may not always be answered in kind by his foreign opposite numbers . The obedience and loyalty he demands of his subordinates may not always be granted him . But he knows what he is up against . " In diplomacy , " he points out , " you never can tell what a man is thinking . He smiles at you and kicks you in the stomach at the same time . " Different men have various reasons for their belief that the General will make a good Secretary of State , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talents . Harry Truman went on record , while President Roosevelt was still alive , with his opinion that Marshall was " the greatest living American . " Winston Churchill , in spite of Marshall 's intransigent opposition to the Prime Minister 's " soft underbelly of Europe " strategy , called him " the true organizer of victory . " Navy men praise him ; men who were senior to him in the Army , but whom he outstripped , say they liked working under their ex-junior 's command ; the most cynical newspapermen respect him . There is not a single individual in the capital who has been willing to backbite the General publicly , and Washington is not famous for such restraint . This eminence of his reputation is probably the greatest single disadvantage that Marshall has . The praise which is so amply due him has , after much repetition , given the public the impression that he may employ some kind of personal magic to bring peace singlehanded . His behavior since assuming office has shown that no one knows better than he does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly job . He also realizes ? and this is the key to the way he may be expected to run his country 's foreign affairs ? that the men with whom he has to deal are just human , too . Marshall has wanted for several years to retire to the quiet of his five-acre estate in Leesburg , Va . Twice ? when he was asked to go to China , and when he accepted his present job ? he has postponed his retirement . He is intelligent enough to realize that , no matter how alert his mind , how strong his body , and how good his will , it would be almost impossible for him to wind up his work as a diplomat ? work for which he had not spent every moment of his adult life training himself , as he had for his military career ? as neatly and famously as he had wound up his soldiering . If history thanks him for anything it will be too late for him to get any fun out of it . It is the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final job .
