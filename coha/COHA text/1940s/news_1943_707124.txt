The dramatic story of the surrender has many episodes : How a German general wept ; how another sweated as an American lieutenant gave him General Grant 's famous terms , " unconditional surrender " ; how the commander of the veteran American First Armored Division , who conducted the negotiations , told Major Gen. Omar N. Bradley , the corps commander , that he would just as soon " knock hell out of them by tonight " as accept a surrender . It was at 9:50 A. M. yesterday , after the First Armored Division had split their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Gen.

" The American divisional commander sent some of his men , the highest ' ranking of whom was a colonel , back with the German officers . Meanwhile , on a wind-swept hill two miles southeast of Perryville , a car with a Red Cross // ENEMY GETS TASTE OF TOTAL DEFEAT // taped to its front climbed the slope from the road girdling Lake Bizerte . A short , exhausted man got out . . He wore gray-green field dress , with the emblem of the Africa Corps sewn on the left  --  sleeve and the gold-braided epaulettes of a major general . An Iron Cross of a high class hung around his neck . He was Major Gen. Willibald Borowietz , commander of the German Fifteenth Armored Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered to the British Seventh Armored Division . He walked 150 feet through a wheat field toward a tent where an armored force .. ommander stood , the two silver stars of an American major general shining on his shoulders .

The American returned the salute and the German announced : " I have come to surrender . " " Do you understand that the surrender must be unconditional ? " The German nodded assent . " That 's all , " the American snapped . ' Colonel Martin Eder , who arrived with General Borowietz , gave up in the same manner .

Lieutenant Klein repeated the " unc ) nditional surrender " ultimatum . Later he told reporters that he had given General Krause twenty minutes to decide . General Krause agreed to the terms and this information was transmitted to our armored commander , who telephoned to General Bradley : " I can knock hell out of them by dark . " General Bradley laughed and said : " Accept the surrender . " General Krause drove back with the Americans and his own staff . On the way , enemy troops were observed burning equipment .

The other Germans sat in their cars , smoking nervously until they had been transferred to the officers ' prisoner enclosure , where they were fed on steak , potatoes , spinach and coffee . Major Clifford Curtis of Auburndale , Mass. , set out with a German officer on the dangerous job of notifying all the enemy units of thecessation of hostilities . They had nothing from which to make a white flag except a piece of old mattress and a tree branch , which they placed at the front of their car . At 11:40 A. M. the " ceasefire " order was given .
