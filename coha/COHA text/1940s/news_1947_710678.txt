txt The City Council adopted yesterday , 16 votes to 3 , a series of three bills to establish municipal controls over rents and evictions and provide penalties up to ninety days in jail and $500 fines for violations . A message of necessity from Mayor O'Dwyer , certifying the urgency of the housing situation here , made it possible for the council to pass the bills yesterday without the seven-day wait for consideration of amendments that had been added while the bills were in the Committee on General Welfare . The bills as adopted include all-the amendments made to them in the last . two weeks . Mayor O'Dwyer said last night that the Board of Estimate would hold a public hearing before voting on the measures . This means that the measures *ill not become law until Sept. 8 , or possibly later . The Mayor said that the board at its meeting tomorrow would set the date for a public hearing . After the board passes the bills the Mayor must give five days ' notice of his own public hearing , after which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Majority Leader , who sponsored the bills , defended them against attacks by some members , whose criticisms ranged from a charge that the rent measures were " socialistic " to doubt as to their constitutionality and objection to the cost to the city of enforcement . Mr. Sharkey said the bills were emergency measures , designed to " plug up the ho ) . es in the Federal rent laws , " and would probably be superseded after six months by the state rent-control law . He argued that any watering-down of the measures , as sought by real estate spokesmen and some others , would weaken their intent , which was to prevent evictions on a large scale during the housing shortage . Edward Rager , the only Council member to vote against all three bills , branded them " a step toward nationalization of housing . " " This is another step in the march of new evils led by Mr. Sharkey to ** on his socialistic hut well-camouflaged doctrines , which were also advanced by the New Deal , " said Mr. Rager . Councilmen Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the first of the Sharkey bills which sets up five barriers against eviction of tenants . Mr. Isaacs . who had been defeated in two attempts to amend the measure , said he was voting against it because " this bill puts New York in a straitjacket , with regard to commercial construction , far stronger than any legislation we ever had in Washington . in the state , or in this city . " Mr. Isaacs ' amendment would have permitted a landlord to evict tenants from a dwelling that he wished to tear down to make room for a shop , theatre or other commercial structure . It would have required , however , that he offer to every such family " a vacant apartment ready for occupancy , at least , ? .. 1. - nparable to the apartment v  --  nich the tenant is then occupyat a rental no greater than the rent being then paid by such tenant , and that such vacant apartment shall be in the same general area as the building to be demolished .

Insisting that this city could not afford to halt , even for six months , the construction of theatres , office buildings , lofts and other types of non-residential structures , . Mr. Isaacs said : " I do n't believe every tenant has a vested right in staying where he is , no matter what the purpose of the proposed demolition . There are tenants who are unconscionable and unreasonable , just as there are landlords who are unconscionable and unreasonable . " Mr. Sharkey pointed out:that his bill did not ban the construction of theatres or other non-residential structures . He said all it did was to prevent the eviction of families to make way for such building . " These are not ' forever ' bills , " declared Mr. Sharkey . " These bills are here for perhaps six months . Another agency of government may take over at that time . In the meanwhile , the very meat of this bill is to keep existing dwellings while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voting with Mr. Rager against the other two Sharkey bills were a pair of Queens Councilmen , Alfred J. Phillips and Walter G. . The . Councilmen who supported all three measures were Eugene P. Connolly . Edward A. Cunningham , Benjamin J. Davis Jr. , S. Samuel Di Falco . Louis P. Goldberg . Walter R. Hart , Charles E. Keegan , William M. McCarthy , Thomas J. Mirabile , Ira J. Palestin , Frederick Schick , Edward Vogel , Michael J. Quill and Mr. Sharkey . The constitutionality of the proposed municipal controls over rents and evictions was questioned by Mr. . ' Mr. Sharkey. who said such doubts were not in the province of a legislative body , recalled that even more serious doubts had been expressed about his wartime price control local law . He said that forsier Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia , who favored and signed the Sharkey price control act , remarked at the time that it " did n't have a chance " on the basis of constitutionality . Yet , said Mr. Sharkey , the local law survived all challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down prices in this city . The bill authorizing the City Rent Commission to prosecute violators of the municipal rent laws , which make a criminal offense of violations of the Federal rent law as well , was assailed by Councilman , who said the council was " creating a bureau to delve into every complaint by tenants " and that this might cost the city $500,000 . An appropriation of $100,000 was voted last month for the City Rent Commission to enforce hotel ands rooming house rent controls through next Feb. 28 . Paul L. Ross , commission chairman , has said that a further appropriation would be required to enforce controls on other dwellings as well . Other objections raised in the council were to the provision banning eviction of any tenant by a home purchaser who paid less than 25 per cent of the assessed valuation or sales price , whichever was greater , in cash , and the provision outlawing evictions from cooperative apartments unless at least 80 per cent of the tenants in such buildings agreed to the cooperative venture . Mr. Isaacs argued this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would penalize some legitimate cooperative purchasers " This bill will not keep anyone from buying a house on a down payment of 10 or 15 per cent , " said Mr. Sharkey. - " All it will do is prevent such a purchaser from evicting a family . That is necessary because there have been too many phoney sales just to put people out in. the street . " Mr. Sharkey said the strictest limitations on cooperatives were necessary because " this has developed into the worst racket of all for putting pressure on tenants to pay higher rents or evicting them .
