U.S. businessmen got good news . Boss Robert H. Hinckley , Czar of Contract Settlement , noted in his first report to Congress that $21 billion in war contracts have already been canceled without jamming up production ( $65 billion in war contracts are still outstanding ) . <P> Last week Czar Hinckley made things even smoother . He put into operation a single cancellation system for both Army &; Navy , and gave officers greater authority to make spot settlements of small contracts . Come V-E day , Hinckley predicted , another $20 billion of the contracts will be canceled . He expects speedy settlement of these-the War Department is now paying off on canceled contracts on an average of 45 days after bills are filed .
