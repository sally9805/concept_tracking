Beyond the din of jeep-ridden Algiers , in the airy Moorish hall of the foremost seminary for colonial jeunes filles , General Charles de Gaulle and his troubled colleagues of the French Committee of National Liberation debated the signs of an approaching catastrophe . <P> The Seed of Despair . Baffling delays seemed to block the path of De Gaulle 's proposed visit to London . The Committee 's message to Washington to find out whether the U.S. planned to have a representative at the London discussions had gone unanswered for nearly two weeks . The U.S. had decided not to participate , but the French had no direct word . <P> There were other irritations . Slick , sleek Jacques Lemaigre-Dubreuil , big-time oilman , banker and part owner of the prewar pro-Fascist Paris Jour , had contrived to slip out of Algiers , turn up in Madrid . With him was Jean Rigaud , long his secretary , fixer and crony and a member of the short-lived Giraud government . The Gaullists suspected that Allied officials had supplied the passes and transportation , that a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared . <P> At the end of a long , sharp session , and just one day before its first birthday , the Committee picked up the solemn request of the Assembly , made three weeks before , and formally declared itself to be the Provisional Government of the French Republic . Many Committeemen had previously opposed the change ; only the barbs from London and Washington goaded them into making it now . The gauntlet was down ; Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill would have to decide whether to pick it up , try to kick it aside , or ignore it . <P> The Price of Despair . From Algiers came a vivid indictment of Washington 's policy of limited , insufficient recognition ( all hands blamed President Roosevelt more than Prime Minister Churchill ) . Cabled New York Timesman Harold Callender , who used to defend the State Department 's attitude toward De Gaulle : <P> " The French situation , as judged here , could hardly be more tragic or bear greater forebodings of further tragedies to come . <P> " The French Committee is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view - and puzzlement at the Allies ' attitude , which is believed here to result from an incredible lack of comprehension of French problems . . . . <P> " Elaborate plans for France devised by members of the Committee have been shelved pending clarity from the Allied side . For those plans all hinge on Allied action in both the military and the economic spheres , and the French just do not know what action in either sphere is going to be . Such indications as they have only intensify their misgivings , which approach desperation . . . . Neither in London nor in Washington , to judge by all evidence available here , is there anything like an adequate appreciation of the plight of France . " <P> On with Despair ? Washington stood pat . A correspondent summed up the State Department view : <P> " The only questions the U.S. wants to discuss with De Gaulle are those relating to the provisional civil administration of France , and General Eisenhower is already empowered to handle them . When De Gaulle gets to London he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
