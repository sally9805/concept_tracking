 | trouble and expense of spreading a dragnet to apprehend the fiend . A flock of New York 's Finest are no doubt right this minute combing the Casbah from top to bottom . " Maggie gingerly got to her feet somewhat like a camel , one end at a time . After several exploratory pokes , she evidently decided she could navigate under her own power and came over beside me at the window . The sunlight made her hair shine . I was going to miss that , too . She took my arm and very gently led me to the couch and pushed me down on it . She stood in front of me with arms folded and just looked at me . I resented being treated like a mongoloid . " Now you listen to me for a minute , " she began . " You 've been having one hell of a fine time working yourself up to a good second act curtain and it 's all a lot of nonsense . " " That 's all right for you to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up and she pushed me back down again . I considered swatting her . " But that 's the point , " she went on . " You did n't kill that old battle-axe , did you ? Or did you ? " " Of course not , but . . . " " Then as far as I can see all you did was not tell somebody you found her murdered , if she was murdered , which I doubt . It might have been an accident . " " I took the book away . " " That 's another thing . Why ever did you do that ? " " Well , it had my name on it and your name on it and that would have meant that we were there , and there you are . " " So what ? I was n't there . " Then her eyes got very round and she suddenly bent over as if to kiss me , but midway she yelped from the reminders that she was n't quite capable of such action yet . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 're wonderful . Let 's have another drink . " And we did and I began to feel  | better . It 's nice being thought a gentleman capable of shielding someone from something . We got all the pillows from the chairs and couch and put them on the floor and lay down with our drinks . " Now then , " I said , after we were comfortable . " What were you about to be all stern about a minute ago ? " " It 's all really too simple . You 've done all the wrong things so far just because you 're a ham at heart and you felt you had to pad your part . Anybody but an actor would have given a yell and , when people started to come running , said look what I found ' but not you , you little Hamlet you . . . Oh no . . . Well , anyway you 've done it and that 's that . As it stands now we 've got two choices . You can call up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How you are going to alibi taking that filthy book I have no idea . " " What 's the other choice ? " I asked . " If I do that it will mean a lot of explaining . I 'm liable for attempting to obstruct justice or concealing evidence , or something . " " Then we could just assume that you did put your gloves back on or someone messed up your prints after you left , and then we could burn the Youth and Beauty Book to a crisp and cast the ashes off the Triboro Bridge . " That sounded good so far . " And then what ? " " Then we 'll just say no more about it . " " Oh , fine . But do n't forget the book was open on her desk and the heavy of the piece might have seen our names as well as one Bobby LeB. , whoever the hell he is . " " Then I think a bit of dialogue with Mr. LeB. is clearly indicated . Very subtle-like . . . underplayed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't even know who he is , much less where he lives . " " Then maybe it 's all in the Youth and Beauty Book . Practically everything else is , God knows . Get it up ! " I got it up . The dried blood did n't make the job any  | more appetizing . Nellie had not been the most efficient person in the world , and the book had , on the whole , somewhat the aspect of a sheaf of used Kleenex . Slips of paper with phone numbers and random addresses were stuck all through ; some empty envelopes and dull looking bills , even her bank book . After a couple of hours we had to give up the search for Bobby LeB. ' s address , though , as Maggie pointed out , we certainly discovered a lot of unmarried actors and actresses whom we never suspected before , answering to the same phone numbers . The only information we could discover about Mr. LeB. was that the last year he had several appointments with Nellie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as Bobby LeB. or once or twice simply B. B. which we took to mean our boy . I got interested in her bank book . Nellie was doing a great deal better financially than either of us would have imagined . You would have gathered from her looks that what money she did have she made selling shoestrings and gum , along with Apple Annie , in theatre lobbies . But according to her bank book she was almost in the surtax brackets . Every month for the last year there was a five-hundred dollar lump deposit in addition to littler ones during the month . My nose began to twitch as I pointed this out to Maggie . " Obviously blackmail . " She was not impressed . " Oh , really ! It was a sad day for the world when you discovered circulating libraries . " " But how else can you explain it ? You know she did n't cast that many shows . " " Maybe she had an income . Maybe she had property . People do get five hundred dollars a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain everything . Why she was  | murdered . " " Here we go again . Timmy , look me in the eye . " I did . " Do you really believe all that junk ? " " No , I guess not . Not really . " " Then that 's all right . Otherwise I might start worrying . " I stuffed the bank book back in the Youth and Beauty Book and tossed it on the floor . " Well , what do we do now ? " " I know a man who used to be in Naval Intelligence during the war . I 'll bet he could help us . We could certainly use a little intelligence around here . Do you want me to call him up ? " " Let me try first before we send for the fleet , " I said . " Well , I only wanted to be helpful . Have you eaten ? " " No . Have you ? " " I 'm starved . Let 's go to Sardi 's for lunch . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The murderer always returns to the scene of his crime . " My pal ! " " Well , why not ? You 've done all the wrong things so far . One more could n't make much difference . We can drop in at Nellie 's office casual-like and you can get a quick swipe at that doorknob , and we can pitch that damned book in a corner of her office and just forget all about it . " I helped her up off the floor . " Okay . What can we lose ? " She went into the bedroom to dress while I had another drink , but it did n't help much . I started to get depressed all over again . I took my drink and leaned against the bedroom door . " You know , Maggie , if you cut down on your drinking and got more sleep you 'd be a good-looking girl . Somebody might even marry you again . " " Why , thank you , darling . But who ? And why the  | overwhelming flattery . What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair and looked at me in the mirror . For some reason I felt a little embarrassed . " It just seems kind of pointless all this nipping about , frittering around in the theatre . Where does it get you ? " She swiveled around from her dressing table . " What about you ? " " Never mind about me . Besides , I ca n't do anything else . The theatre 's all I know . " " You did all right in the army . People told me . I asked . " " Oh , the army . That 's different . Latch on to a good sergeant and you ca n't miss . " " It 's none of my business , I know , " Maggie said earnestly . " But do you mean to just keep on like this .. . you know what I mean . . . sort of . . . I mean , not ever . . . well , you know what I mean . . . . " She finished lamely , strangely shy for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . And no , of course I did n't mean to keep on like this . I was a man with a plan . A three-year plan . Operation Hollywood . I wanted to be an actor ! So I made a bargain with myself while waiting in a cigarette camp near Le Havre to be shipped home . Three years to get a good part on Broadway or back to the salt mines . It all seemed so simple  --  in Le Havre . Who gets all the best parts in New York ? Movie actors . Okay , so get to be a movie actor . How ? Well , first you 've got to be seen in the right places  --  get a little publicity ? that 's the magic  --  publicity . And in the right places you 'll meet the right people who 'll maybe give you a small part and then maybe your picture in the paper and  --  bingo ! ? a screen test and a contract . Six months on the coast and six months in New York for a play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking will be hanging up beside yours . That was thirty-five months ago and gives you a rough idea how punchy you can get after four years in the army .  | Four weeks more and Operation Hollywood would end with a whimper and with it my chance for the big money . But a bargain 's a bargain . I hope I had n't forgotten how to pilot a bulldozer . There was no point in telling all this to Maggie  --  now . If things had only worked out differently . . . . " Timmy , what is the matter with you ? " " What ? Oh , nothing . Just indulging in a little wishful thinking . " " What about ? " " Hoping I 'm not going to spend the rest of my all too brief life running away from a murder rap . " " Oh . " Maggie turned back to the mirror and finished her face . I went over to the closet and got out her mink coat and helped her on with it . I wrapped my arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed someone to hang on to . I buried my face in the shoulder of her coat . It was cool and faintly perfumed . She reached up and patted my cheek . " Now stop worrying . Everything 's going to be all right . " While I was out in the hall putting on my coat she brought the Youth and Beauty Book . " Here , " she handed it to me . " You ought to be able to drop it in a corner easily while you 're messing up your fingerprints . " " I expect so . " I stuck it in my breast pocket . " But you know as well as I do that , fingerprints or no , eventually they 're going to find out I was in Nellie 's office this morning . " " Nonsense . " " It is n't nonsense . They always do . " " How ? " " I do n't know , but they always do . One leaves spoors or something . "  | " Does one ? How awful . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't prove I did n't , when it comes right down to it . " " Then by all means we must find out who did do it . " It seemed so simple the way she said it .  | I LOOKED at my watch as we pulled up in front of Sardi 's . Only four hours since I had been here before and it seemed like four years . The meter said eighty cents and Maggie gave me a dollar which I gave to the driver in one of those " Tinker to Evers to Chance " things , and we got out . The sidewalk in front of Sardi 's is strictly Actors ' Equity property . From ten in the morning till one at night you can always find one standing there . Musicians have their own Wailing Wall around Fiftieth Street somewhere ; vaudevillians in front of the Palace ; the radio people , a sheltered lot , have theirs on the third floor of NBC or CBS on Madison . Models are around Grand Central and Park , but actors are loyal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in full force today , and it did n't take long for Maggie and me to find out that Nellie had been discovered . Just about my most unfavorite actor in the world would have to have the pleasure of telling us what we already knew only too well . He spied us standing by the curb and came rushing over . Ted Kent is his name , or at least that is what he uses . I suppose the basic reason I do n't like him is very simple ; he always gets all the parts I want and when you get right down to it , that 's the main reason most actors do n't like other actors they do n't like . Ted is about my height , maybe a couple of inches shorter  | without his trick **29;771;TOOLONG shoes and is a perfect example of a successful Operation Hollywood . The right people , the publicity , the small part , the screen test and the Hollywood contract . Only they did n't pick up his option so he headed straight back to Broadway with quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that part that will shoot him back to the coast again . As he greeted us , he gave me a very small hello , which was all right by me , and Maggie a very big kiss  --  which was n't . " Maggie , darling . Have you heard ? " Ile was a darling boy , too . " Nellie is dead ! " And he sort of stood back on one foot and waited for us to take it big . We must have both felt it was better to play dumb and we did what was obviously expected . " No ! " said Maggie . " Who did it ? " Ted gave her what I thought was a funny look and said , " But , darling , nobody did it . She just collapsed . Heart , I expect . " " Are you sure ? " I said . " What do you mean , am I sure ? Of course I 'm sure . Heart failure , I think , or drunk  --  you know she drank like a fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her desk , you know . " I admitted I did know . " And she died . File and forget , I say . " He practically giggled at that one . Maggie and I looked at each other . I think my sigh of relief must have reached the East River . " How do you know ? " Maybe he was n't straight on his facts . Maybe this was all just a trick by the police to find out who really did it . When you 've convinced yourself that you are a key witness in a murder scene it 's a little disconcerting to be told that it is n't a murder at all and just a simple case of alcohol or heart failure . I ca n't say I was sorry that it was turning out this way , but I 'm afraid the ham in me was feeling cheated as if I had been fired from a show before it even started rehearsals .  | Ted tried to wither me with a look , but I do n't wither very easy by guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here asking questions and having a big time . They 're still up in her office now waiting for the meat wagon . " You could tell in his day he 'd been in some pretty lousy shows , too . A couple of other people joined our clump attracted by Ted 's over loud voice which was the idea and , goosed up by a bigger audience , Ted really put out . " Libby Drew found her . . . she was just dropping in making the rounds and saw her lying on her desk , blood all over the place running over the floor . . . " " But . . . " I started to interrupt but Maggie silenced me with a stiff poke in the ribs . Ted chose to ignore my attempted interruption and went merrily on , practically drooling at the mouth . " Of course , you know Libby , sly puss that she is . . . did she make with the screams and bring everybody running as anyone else would do it ? " He answered himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the main floor ; probably pulled her dress off one shoulder , put eyeshadow under her eyes and staggered all the way across the street into Sardi 's and announced it like a messenger in Macbeth . What a performance ! Nothing like it since the Cherry sisters . I was having lunch with Terry and Lawrence . . . They 're doing a new show and there 's the dream part for me . . . " " O.K. , O.K. , " I said . " Cut to the finish . " He gave me a nasty look but went on with his story . . . . " Well , you can imagine what a stir there was . The place was jammed to the ears . Vincent Sardi called the police right away , and every one tore out and up to her office . And sure enough there she was dead as a door nail . What a crush in that little office . Every one was there . Stanley and Brock and Cheryl and George . . . " " Spare us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Well , after a while the police came and all of us except Libby had to leave . " A policeman wandered about muttering for the crowd to break it up and move along , but after a while gave it up as a bad job because you ca n't break up a crowd of actors . They just shift into other groupings . Ted took off his hat , held it in his teeth and pulled out a wave was arranged to his satisfaction he wiped off the comb , stuck it back in his pocket , carefully replaced his hat and kissed Maggie on the cheek again . " Well , darling , I 've got to fly . Let 's have lunch one day . I 'll call you . Be sure and see the morning papers , I think my picture 's in them . Of course Libby hogged most of them . But the lad from the Brooklyn Eagle was very nice . Remembered me from my last picture with Paramount . ' Bye now . " And he was off down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I vomit . " I took Maggie 's arm and led her into Sardi's.  | SARDI 'S restaurant is really just one big room divided by some chest-high partitions with benches or , in the chi-chier places , I expect they would be called banquettes . All the woodwork is dark brown and the chairs and benches are covered with dark leather and the walls are shingled with caricatures of well-known theatrical people . Needless to say , one of me is not included . New ones are added from time to time , I suppose , though I do n't know where they find room to hang them , unless it 's the Ladies ' Room . It was almost empty when Maggie and I came in . Just a few people scattered around starting the five o'clock jump a little early . Just like we had been doing all day . We sat down and ordered drinks . Maggie shed her mink and pulled off her hat . I lit her a cigarette . She took a deep drag , blew it out and slumped back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling definitely let down and very , very tired . " Anyway it was fun while it lasted , " Maggie smiled at me . " You know I feel kind of sorry for the old gal . Heart failure . I did n't know she had a weak heart . I did n't even suspect she had a heart for that matter . " " I do n't think it was heart failure . " " Oh , Timmy , now do n't start that murder game again . You 'd think someone had broken your bicycle or something . So you 're not a wanted man . . . you 're still young  | . . . there 's still something to live for . . . if you 're real good and eat your broccoli you may find another body one day . " " All the same , did you ever step on a nail when you were a kid ? " " No , I 've never enjoyed that sort of thing . " " Well , I have lots of times and with my full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch . " " You can scarcely compare the bottom of your foot with Nellie 's right mammary gland , after all . " " There 's not that much difference . " " Well , dear , you ought to know . " " Oh , shut up . " Then I remembered what Ted Kent had said . " Still , one way to find out  --  I might ask Libby Drew what the police thought when they found Nellie . " " Knowing Libby , if it would help get her picture in the paper , I 'm surprised she did n't confess to doing in Nellie herself . " I nudged Maggie as the front door swung open and Henry Frobisher walked in . We watched him as he slowly came across the room and sat down at a wall table , two away from us . I 'd been wondering about him , off and on , all afternoon . Frobisher had billing in the Youth and Beauty Book , too . An appointment with Nellie at threethirty this afternoon . It was now about four-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just coming from it . I 'd put Frobisher at around fifty-five and , although it had started creeping back , he was by no means a scratchbait boy yet . Maybe it was the sun-lamp tan , or , maybe , his eyebrows bleached out more than his brown hair which was greying at the proper places ; anyway , his eyebrows blended strangely into his high forehead and made his face look naked . His newest show , A Kiss Thrown In , starring Louise Randall , had been in rehearsal for two weeks and I  | could n't tell whether it was going badly , or whether Nellie 's death had upset him . No matter what caused it , I have never seen a man look so tired and still move . He sat back , ordered a drink , and looked around the room . His gaze finally hit us and he gave us a vague smile . But I was n't going to waste any chances to talk to any producers , even if he did n't have anything for me in his present show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nellie ? " I said across two tables . " Yes , tragic , tragic . " He seemed to be looking right through me . " I did n't know she had a weak heart , did you ? " " No . No , I did n't . " He looked at Maggie . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Lanson . " " Good afternoon , Mr. Frobisher . How 's the show going ? " " Still pretty rough . We 're doing a bit of rewriting . " Maggie did n't need a job and I did . I wanted to be in on the conversation . " Mr. Frobisher , you knew Nellie pretty well , did n't you ? I mean , she cast most of your shows and all that . " " Yes , I 've known Nellie for a good many years , fine woman . " Well then , " I leaned toward him , " can you think of any enemies she might have had ? " " Enemies ? " He looked a little startled at that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost green . " Good Heavens no , what makes you ask that ? " " Do n't mind hint , Mr. Frobisher . " Maggie pulled me gently back against the wall . " He 's been in so many mysteries , he 's trying to make one out of this . " Mr. Frobisher picked up his drink and came over and sat down on the bench next to me . " I do n't understand what you mean . Do you think she was killed ? Murdered ? "  | I had been thinking that to myself ever since I had found her , but now that someone else said it it sounded a little foolish . Something in Frobisher 's manner of asking it , his soft , rather clipped voice , seemed to make my even having thought it vulgar and very corny . " No , I guess not . " I finally admitted . " But did you ever step on a nail when you were a kid ? " The moment I said it I felt ridiculous . " No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it 's been a long time since I was a kid . " Wistful is the word , I think , for the smile that followed . " But what has my not having stepped on a nail got to do with Nellie ? " " Well , you know that thing she fell on , the desk spindle . . . it was n't much larger than a good sized nail . " " You seem to know a good deal about it . " I could feel my face starting to redden , so I took a quick gulp of my old-fashioned . " Oh , I 've been going to see Nellie for about ten years , and that office has n't changed a speck of dust in all that time . " " But I still do n't see why you think she was murdered . " Maggie was getting bored and she started shrugging on her coat . Frobisher and I helped her . " It 's pure frustration , Mr. Frobisher . Nellie called him in about a job this morning , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got it . Which reminds me . We ought to send flowers . Do you know where the funeral 's going to be ? " " Why yes , I find myself rather in charge . Tomorrow , three o'clock , the Henderson Funeral Home . " He turned to me . " I 'd appreciate it if you would be a pallbearer and help get the casket to the station . Her niece is coming up from Hopkinsville , Kentucky , to take the body back there for burial . " I said I 'd be glad to . As a matter of fact , I was very  | flattered that he had asked me . " If you were a friend of hers , Mrs. Lanson , perhaps you 'd like to come , too ? " " Thank you , " said Maggie . " I would , very much . " She stood up . " Well , goodbye , Mr. Frobisher , and good luck on your show . " I left money for the drinks and tip on the table making a mental note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with us . " Goodbye , Mrs. Lanson , and thank you . " He looked at me . " Goodbye . " I got my hat and coat from Renee and it was n't till we got out on Forty-fourth Street , that I realized that in spite of my blue-shirt lead performance , Mr. Frobisher did n't even know my name .  | 6 MAGGIE really need n't have been in such a hurry to leave even if her plaster was itching . After all , it was n't every day I got the chance to have a drink with a producer and she should n't have blatted out that I had an appointment with Nellie that morning and I told her so . " I 'm dreadfully sorry , angel , but you were rather tiresome about it . All that nail rigmarole . Besides , my bottom hurts like blazes . " We started walking toward Broadway , and I began to feel ashamed of myself . Actually , what difference did it make to me ? I had missed out on a job . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help feeling there was something fishy about it . It must have been all because of that damned Bobby LeB . I tried to explain this to Maggie . " Then for Heaven 's sake find him and get it out of your system . You wo n't be happy till you do . It ought n't to be too difficult . Equity could tell you how many LeB. ' s there are , if he 's an actor and I ca n't imagine anyone willingly setting foot in Nellie 's rats ' nest unless he were . Incidentally , with all your starry-eye-making at Frobisher , we forgot to eat . Let 's go into Valgreen 's . " As we tried to weave through the mob of bobby-sox autograph hunters waiting for the Paramount performers to come out of the stage door , one of the more unappetizing ones disengaged herself from the rest of the covey , saun-  | tered over , and stood right in front of me shoving a grimy autograph book and pen in my face . She wore the usual year-round uniform ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , will you ? " she commanded . " And make it To Bertha Oliphant with love . " ' " Why do you want my autograph ? " I asked . " I 'm not famous . " " You 're an actor , are n't you ? " " Yes . " " Well , Rome was n't built in a day . Sign here . " Pleased , I signed with protestations of undying love to Bertha Oliphant . " Jeeze , thanks , " she said when she read my love note . " That 's swell . " She started to go back . " Do n't you want mine , too ? " asked Maggie . " What for ? " asked Bertha . " I 'm an actress , " said Maggie . " Do n't give me that stuff , lady . And paper costs money . " What makes you think I 'm not an actress ? " " Listen , lady , " said Bertha patiently , " It 's the mink . If you 're an actress and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know you . " This put Maggie in her place . " But why did you want my autograph ? " I asked . " You do n't know me . " " Well , I 'll tell you , I 'm different , see . I 'm what you might call a speculator . Them other jerks over there ... , " she tossed her head in the direction of the other autograph hounds , " they just get people already famous . " She sniffed contemptously . " I think you got ta look ahead . How do I know , some day you might amount to something . " Do you stop everybody that comes along this street ? " I asked her . I was starting to get an idea . " Of course not . Only people who look like they 're gon na be something . "  | " Thank you , I 'm sure , " said Maggie . " You 're doin ' all right , kid , " said Bertha eyeing the mink . " Were you here this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Could you let me see the ones you collected this morning ? " " What for ? " Bertha asked suspiciously . " You want to buy some ? If you 're in the market I got some exclusives , home . " " I want to see if somebody passed by about eleven o'clock . " " What 's the name ? Lots of people passed here . " " Bobby LeB. , " I said , " I do n't know his last name , just LeB . " " Why , Timmy , are n't you clever , " said Maggie . " It 's just a chance . " But Bertha squelched it . " Nope . No Bobby LeB. ' s this morning . Never heard of him . " " Can I see your book anyway ? " " I tell you I ai n't got no Bobby LeB. , or whatever the hell his name is so you 're just wasting my time .

The third sheet down , however , was blank with an inky smear across it as though a pen had been dug into it . I asked Bertha what that was for . " Oh , that lousy rat . Damn near ruined my fountain pen . New one , too . " " What did he do ? " " Oh , he got snotty when I asked him to sign . Wish I 'd belted him . " She looked like she was just the girl that could do it . " Do you remember what he looked like ? " I practically  | had on my two-visored cap and a meerschaum . " Sure I do . Never forget him .

You have to know about things like that . I ca n't tell you exactly . Oh ? oh ... here comes Charlie . " She snatched back the book and was off in hot pursuit . We started again for Walgreen 's . Perhaps I was getting somewhere . The time was right . . . , " Honestly , Tim , " Maggie looked at me admiringly , you amaze me . " I amaze myself , sometimes , " I said modestly for what I considered a tasty bit of sleuthing . A murderer would be nasty about signing his name . " But it 's so silly . In the first place this Bobby may not look like an actor at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's perfectly asinine to expect that rude little girl would ask him for his autograph . " " Just because she did n't want yours is no reason . . " " What 's more , there are at least three other ways he could have gone ; west towards Eighth Avenue , through Shubert Alley , and on the other side of this street . I+ or that matter he might have taken a taxi . " I was n't feeling quite so pleased with myself now . " Maggie , do you honestly believe it is all as simple as they say ? Heart failure ? "  | " I do n't believe anything about it , one way or the other . It 's none of my affair nor , actually , is it yours , now . I always thought playing Private Eye would be sheer heaven .

That 's perfectly harmless , but leave that other stuff to the boys who ca n't dance divinely , or you 'll get in trouble . " And she was so right !  | IN WALGREEN 'S there was just the usual crowd of civilians . It was way past even the most leisurely lunch time for actors . No matter how good you were at it , you could n't nurse an egg salad sandwich and chocolate malted till almost four-thirty . I ordered a ham and cheese and coffee , and Maggie had a tuna fish salad and coffee . We just sat there until the plates came sliding up . I always meant to find out how they manage to get two slices out of one leaf of lettuce . It was n't till I started eating that I realized how hungry I was so I ordered another of the same . After we finished I reached for a cigarette and felt the tickets that Nick Stein had given me . " Would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is it a real show or some more of your passes ? " She 'd been with me before and was naturally a little suspicious . " That new Lucille Blake thing . Not supposed to be too bad . " " Oh , I do n't think so . Not tonight . I still feel a little strange and you must admit that this has been a rather hectic day . First that damn doorknob and then you rushing in and confessing to a murder . Why do n't you ask your precious Bobby LeB. to go ? " " Not a bad idea if I knew where to find him . Might take Libby Drew and find out what she knows . "  | " She 'd be thrilled to death . Which reminds me I did n't pay for the drinks . " She reached into her purse and put some money in my hand . I did n't see how much it was . " Here , take this and pay for them , will you ? You can pay me back from the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you so intent on playing Dick Tracy ? " " I still owe you some . " But I did n't try to give it back . " Yes , dear , I know , but do n't let it keep you awake nights . It does n't me . Call me in the morning and let me know what Libby does for you ... in solving your precious little mystery , I mean . " She patted my cheek . " But do n't forget Nellie 's funeral in the afternoon . She 'll give a better show dead than Lucille Blake alive . " And knowing an exit line when she says one , Maggie walked out of the drugstore pulling on her gloves . A nice girl . Has sense , too , though you generally overlook it when she starts being vague ; but this afternoon she was n't vague at all . I knew she was right . It was silly , I suppose , getting myself mixed up in this Nellie thing . Maybe I was just bored . I felt bored a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . Hell , I might as well finish it up now that I had started . Call up Libby and see if she wanted to go to the theatre tonight . I gathered the checks and walked over to the cashiers . It was then that I looked at the money Maggie had put in my hand . Two fifty-dollar bills . . . enough to last me for a month , if I was very careful . The cashier gave me some nickels with the change , so I went down to the deserted basement and telephoned Libby . She was delighted to go to the theatre with me and would meet me at Louis Bergen 's bar at eight-fifteen , and I 'd better get the Bronx Home News or some such paper tomorrow , she might have her picture in it . I told her I would and hung up . The clock on the wall said it was only about ten minutes  | to five . . . a lot sure had happened in one day . That 's what comes of getting up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over to Equity before it closed , and then I could ride home on the Fifth Avenue bus , and maybe catch a nap before meeting Libby . The old brownstone on West Forty-seventh Street where Equity has its offices is something right out of Charles Addams and the only reason I ever go there is to advise them of a change in my address or see if the bond is posted for that turkey I may get a walk-on in . I climbed the creaky stairs up to the third floor information section where they have all the addresses . The fussy little old lady in charge behind the wire fence was just getting ready to go . She was alone her handmaidens must have jumped the gun . With a great deal of pursing of lips , she finally consented to ask me what I wanted . " Yiss ? And what is it you require ? " " It 's kind of silly , " I said . " But I 'm trying to locate someone , but I only know his first name and last initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having none of it . " Are you an Equity member ? " " Yes , for eight years . My name is Tim Briscoe . " This seemed to mean something to her . " Briscoe . . . Briscoe ? Oh , yes . Someone just asked for your address and phone number not half an hour ago . " " Who was it ? Do you remember ? " " Certainly . It was clear Henry Frobisher . Such a fine man , a real gentleman . I was with him in Bless You , Darling . Perhaps you saw it ? " I had n't . She preened herself and patted her back hair in place . " Of course , it was just a tiny part , the party scene in the second act . I wore purple and ecru lace . Dear Henry was so kind about the part being so small , but I do think it better to have a small part with a first rate management than a lead with some fly-by-night , do n't you ? " I heartily agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me ? And I thought  | he did n't even know my name . I wondered if it was too late to call him . No , he did n't look like he was going back to his office when we left him . Anyway , Kendall Thayer was at the Casbah and he was pretty good about taking messages for me . " And was n't that tragic about his son ? " Purple and Ecru Lace was still rolling along . " His son ? " I was n't paying much attention , trying to puzzle out why he should want my phone number . " Being killed in the war . Such a blow to dear Mr. Frobisher . An only son , too . I met him once , you know . " " No , I did n't know . " And I did n't want to know . I just wanted to get Bobby 's address and beat it home and find out if Frobisher had called and if so why . But Tootsie , here , was determined to take me down Memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . So well mannered . Mr. Frobisher brought him to rehearsal . Such a tragedy . Were you in the service , too ? " I admitted I was . " Mr. Frobisher 's son was killed in action . In Normandie , I believe , " she said accusingly . Well , my God , Tootsie , I 'm sorry . I apologize . I did not mean to offend you . I know I 'm not lovely or very well-mannered , and my father ca n't give you a job in purple and ecru lace , but please do n't make me feel guilty just being alive . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. . . . Mrs. .. . " " Tuckerman . Mrs. Tuckerman . Of course my stage name was Marianne Rice , but then . . . " " Yes , well , Mrs. Tuckerman , I 'm really in rather a hurry . . . " " Oh , yiss , of course , " she said coldly , all efficiency again . " Now who was it you wanted to locate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her what I knew and she flew to the files . " We have a Robert LeBor , but he is in Hollywood now . Would he be the one ? " " No , I should n't think so . Any others ? "  | " There 's a Robin LeBaron . . . but of course he 's dead , poor soul , so I should scarcely think he would be the one you are after , would you ? " " Scarcely . Is that all ? " " Yiss , that is all . Are you quite sure he is a member of Actors ' Equity ? " " No . . . not exactly . " " Well , really , Mr. Briscoe . " Angrily she took her coat from a cupboard and started to put it on . " Can you suggest any other place I might look ? You 've been so kind and helpful perhaps you might know some other place . " That thawed her out a little . She paused for a second . " Is your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost positive of that . " " There are still , you know , other organizations . Professional organizations ; AFRA , Screen Actors Guild , Chorus Equity , and , I believe , those night club entertainers have some sort of an organization , too . " I had n't thought of that possibility . My thanks were slightly overdone , but she must receive a kind word so seldom that by the time I had escorted her down to the street and said goodbye I was pretty sure I could play gin rummy with those address cards from now on . There must be someone I knew who was a member of those other unions , and I could get them to check for me . It was such a long shot that there did n't seem to be any particular need for secrecy . And if questioned , I could always say I found a watch or a ring with an inscription , " Ever thine , Bobby LeB. , " or some such . And Mr. Frobisher wanted my phone number . Money in my pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I ask ? Things were certainly looking up .  | 8 I GOT OFF the bus at Washington Square and walked to the Casbah . Kendall Thayer was sitting in my room when I opened the door , calmly reading all my old letters I do n't particularly like people reading my mail and told him so . " My dear boy , these are as nothing . " He was n't the slightest bit ruffled at being caught in the act . " If you like I 'll show you some of my fan mail . . . show you what real passion is . " He tossed mine back in the bureau drawer . " ' These are all just amateurs ... no finesse , no imagination . " " Its just too damn bad about that , and get the hell out of here and stay out , and if I ever catch you in here again I 'll knock your ears off . " I was getting very angry . " Calm yourself my boy . Wounded vanity that is all . Besides , you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say so ? " I took off my coat and hat and threw them on the bed . Kendall immediately snatched up my hat and handed it back to me . " Say , what 's the idea ? " I had a good mind to punch him , old as he was . " Do n't you know that it is bad luck to put a hat on a bed ? " " Never mind that . " But I took the hat and threw it on the shelf in the closet . " What about those calls ? " He handed me a slip of paper .  | " That 's how I happened to come across your letters , looking for a piece of paper . " I did n't say anything , but looked at the slip . Mr. Frobisher and Mrs. Lanson , both , wanted me to call them as soon as I got in . And Diana , the woman I had been out with last night , had called . . . no message . " I trust that means you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pack of cigarettes when I was getting one for myself . I did n't feel so annoyed with him now so I let him get away with it . " But his show 's already in rehearsal . " " There 's many a slip before opening night . Fine man Mr. Frobisher . I remember when I was with him in Star a Light . . . I was just back from the coast . . . I had a scene . " I quickly shut off this scrapbook browsing . I 'd heard it all before . Kendall had a memory like a library , and with that memory . . . " Kendall , did you ever hear of anyone named Bobby LeB. ? " " Bobby LeBee ? What a curious name .. . No , I 'm sure I should remember it if I had . " " LeB. is just the initials of his last name : l.e. - capital B. " " There was a Robert LeBor who 's a director in pictures now . Just an assistant director when I knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he 's in Hollywood . Any others ? " " Well a Robin LeBaron died several years ago . I never knew him personally , though I think he was considered quite good . Of course I was on the coast at the time . " I could have saved myself a trip to Equity if I 'd thought of Kendall first . " No , I know about those two . Any others . " He seemed to be poking about in that rye-soaked brain for another one but he could n't quite make it . " It seems to me there was another one somewhere along the line . . . I 'm not very good on names . " He was doing  | all right . " But I never forget a face . I ca n't quite seem to place him . It 's a rather unusual name . Now let me see . . . " Well , do n't strain yourself and beat it now , I want to make some calls . But if you remember , let me know . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead ? " His reaction was a momentary expression of definite pleasure before he could pull that old saggy face into the proper grimace of sadness . Why is it old people are glad when other people die ? Or is it just actors ? " Why , no . . . I did n't know . I have n't been out of the house all day . " He evidently forgot the trip to the liquor store for whiskey with the two bucks I had given him this morning . " Was she dead when you got there ? " That startled me . " When I got where ? " " Why I thought you told me you had an appointment with her this morning . " I did n't remember telling him anything of the kind , but I may have . This morning I was n't playing it so cozy . Still it did give me a start . " Did I ? Well , I was wrong . It was somebody else . " " Sure . I probably just misunderstood you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played together , you know . She was with me in Front Page Stuff . " " No , I did n't know . " It had never even occurred to me she 'd been an actress . " What was she like ? " " A brilliant comedienne . I remember we had one scene together . I was playing Lord Washburn . . . pearl grey cutaway . She mistook me for the butler  --  very amusing . That scene took all the notices . I think I still have them if you would care to look at them . Mr. Frobisher was stage manager then , you know . " I had n't known that either . But , like agents , producers do n't spring full-fledged out of sea foam . " What happened to Nellie ? Why did she stop acting if  | she was so hot ? " " Another great tragedy of the theatre . " Presumably he meant he was the first . " She was a singer , and , I believe , she strained her vocal chords or something , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , scram , will you , Kendall ? I told you I 've got to phone . " I started looking up Frobisher 's number in the phone book . Kendall strode majestically to the door , which , in my cheese-box , takes some doing . He rested one hand on the doorcasing and gave me burning stare No. 6A with all the stops out . " I go , " Pause . " I go to return anon . " " Yeah , yeah , okay . " I began dialing Frobisher 's number . Kendall relaxed . " You would n't , perchance , have a couple more fish swimming around loose , would you ? " " No , I would n't . " I made a mistake in the number and had to start over again . " Get the hell out , will you ? " I threw the telephone book at him , but he closed the door too soon and it just hit the door and slapped to the floor . A clipped British accent finally allowed me to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briscoe . You asked me to call you ? " " Oh , yes , Tim . I wondered if you would be available for a part in a show I have in rehearsal ? " How available can you get ? " I believe so , Mr. Frobisher . Of course , I have a couple of things on the fire . . . " " It 's a small part in the last act . I 've had someone rehearsing it for two weeks , but I 'm afraid he is n't working out . Frankly , you just stand around and look attractive until it 's time to wind up the plot , but you 'll have a few good lines and they take doing . The part pays a hundred and a quarter . Would you be interested ? " " What do I wear ? " If I was going to have to buy a  | new suit , maybe I could get more money . " Just a dinner jacket . You can supply that , ca n't you ? " " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know this is rushing things a bit , but we open in less than a fortnight . How about it ? " " I 'd be glad to , Mr. Frobisher . " There did n't seem to be much point arguing about money . He could get hundreds of actors who would jump at the chance to be in a Frobisher show for minimum . " Fine . It 's settled then . Eleven tomorrow morning at the Lyceum Theatre and I 've made an appointment for you at Hans Trindler 's studio for publicity photographs at nine , if that 's convenient . " Convenient ? Trindler was only the best photographer in the business . " That 's perfectly convenient , sir . " " Good . I 'll see you at the Lyceum tomorrow at eleven . " He started to hang up . " Oh , Mr. Frobisher . There 's just one thing , if you do n't mind my asking . How did you happen to pick me ? " " Yesterday at Sardi 's . You see , it does pay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooling him at all . " And I thought you did n't even know my name . " He chuckled . " As a matter of fact I did n't , I asked Renee . " God bless Renee the hatcheck girl . I 'd have to give her a bigger tip from now on . " I 'll see that you get your contract in the next few days . Goodbye . " That 's the way it goes . You beat your brains out banging on agents ' and producers ' doors and what do you get ? Nothing . But you happen to have a drink in a bar at a certain time and you end up with a job at a hundred and a quarter per  --  or that 's what I told myself . As I furiously dialed Maggie 's number to tell her the good news , I really believed I had been offered that part because Mr. Frobisher thought I would look attractive standing around until it was time to wind up the plot . Well , part of that was true .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . " " You , too ? " " Frobisher you mean ? " " Lyceum Theatre , eleven tomorrow . You , too ? " " Yes , is n't it marvelous ? " I said . " I just ca n't believe it . " " And Trindler is taking my picture tomorrow morning for the show . " " He 's already got some of me on file , but promise me you 'll give me one of you . " " I promise . " " Frobisher said I was only a small part in the last act . " " Me , too . I wear a dinner jacket and look attractive . " " A cinch . I 'm having a fitting at Chez Ernest tomorrow at ten for my dress . Jenny Pittenger is doing the sets and supervising the clothes . I hope I get something good . " " Chez Ernest ? " I said . " But that was in the book and Nellie . . . " " Now , Tim , let 's not start that again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not particularly . Ernest usually does Frobisher shows . It 's a break getting my dress there . I like his stuff . " " Maggie , do you mind if I go with you tomorrow ? " " Darling , I did n't know you went in for that sort of thing . " " I 'd just like to find out something . " " If it were to keep me company , I 'd adore it , but not if you 're going crawling around people with a magnifying glass . " " I promise not to goose a single goose . " " Well , all right , " she said reluctantly . " Meet me there at ten . " " What about tonight ? Let 's celebrate . " " Have n't you a date with Libby ? " " I 'll break it . "  | " Oh , I do n't think so , darling . I 'd better get a good night 's sleep . I must look ravishing tomorrow . Do n't forget you promised me a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She hung up , and I got undressed even though I knew I would n't be able to sleep . I wished now I had n't bothered to call up Libby , but I was too excited at having a job to stay in all evening by myself , so what the hell . There was a knock on the door just as I got all my clothes off and flopped on the bed . It was Kendall again with a fistful of clippings . " Here are the notices of Front Page Stuff I promised you . All the interesting parts are underlined . " I knew without looking that the interesting parts were all concerned with the brilliant portrayal of one Kendall Thayer replete with pearl grey cutaway . " Thanks . Just throw them on the dresser and close the door softly on this exit . Make believe you 're Madame X. " Kendall looked a little hurt , but closed the door softly . I stretched out feeling just like Little Jack Horner with a plum on every finger . Being an actor can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have a job . But when you have n't ? Brother , it 's hell .  | 9 IT WAS seven forty-five when I woke up . In twenty minutes I had showered , shaved and was on my way to the subway . I hit an express on Fourteenth Street and again Life was good to me . It was n't till around Twentyeighth Street that I remembered that I had n't locked my door because Kendall had n't given me back my keys . Not that I had anything of value in my room except the telephone , but the inhabitants of the Casbah can never resist making long distance calls on a hot , free phone . This time I 'd just have to take a chance till I got to Bergen 's and could phone Kendall or the Mad Swede to lock it . Bergen 's Bar is a hole in the wall on Forty-fifth Street just off Eighth Avenue . Like a railroad car with a long bar running down the left , stopping only for the men 's room which is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line down the right side checkered with tablecloths , a few haphazardly framed photographs of some of the customers past and present , and , of course , a juke box . I was fifteen minutes late . Libby was already there sitting at the first table , right next to the juke box , with another girl . Even though Nick had given me three tickets , it annoyed me to see that she had someone else with her . When you ask a girl to go to the theatre , you do n't expect her to drag along a friend . I 've pulled that  | same trick too many times myself to enjoy being played for a sucker . She did n't know the seats were free although with me I suppose she 'd be a fool to think otherwise . And I was n't too anxious to have an audience while I tried to pump Libby . She says she comes from a good family in Columbus , where her father makes paper boxes and sent her to Bennington , and she 's never gotten over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long on the sides and bangs in front and does n't use any make-up but eyeshadow which , for some obscure reason , she wears under her eyes . I happen to know her clothes are expensive , but she goes in for lumpy suits which look as though they were woven out of old spinach . Her friend was n't any more appetizing than Libby , though I must say she was better dressed in what Maggie always calls " the basic sack . " She also reeked of an earlier vintage Bennington , when Katharine Hepburn was the dream girl ; and was still sporting that scarlet , square mouth without any clip in the upper lip that Miss II . started , but had sense enough to change . The moment I got a load of the two of them , I started trying to figure out how to cut the evening short . Libby greeted me like a spaniel and obviously expected to be kissed , so I did . She introduced me to her friend who turned out to be named Margo Shaw . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a Margo after the first glimpse . They were drinking brandy . I settled for a rye and water and told them to hold everything , I had to phone . I dialed the Casbah 's instead of my own number and luckily Kendall answered . " Kendall , this is Tim . Why the hell did n't you give me my keys back ? " " I 'm profoundly sorry , Tim , but the simple truth of the matter is that I forgot . I 'll go lock your door right this minute . "  | " Yeah , do that . And keep out of my drawers , too . I 'll pick up the keys from you when I get back . You 'll be in about midnight ? " " Most assuredly . " " Okay , then take off . " I hung up and went back to the girls . We had about fifteen minutes till curtain and I could n't waste any time . Old square-mouth did n't show any signs of blowing so I gave Libby a big smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me all about it . " She did n't even bother to ask why I wanted to know or what I meant . Obviously it must be about Nellie as that was the only important thing that had happened to her since she had discovered eye-shadow . A swig of brandy and she was off . " Well , it was the most amazing thing . I 've just been telling Margo all about it . " She turned to Margo . " Darling , you do n't mind hearing it all again , do you ? " As if square-mouth had any choice other than to walk out . " Of course not , Libby . I think it 's the most exciting thing I 've ever heard . You were so brave . I mean if something like that had happened to me I do n't know what I 'd have . . . " " Okay , okay , " I said . " What happened ? " " I 'm trying to tell you , Tim . " More brandy , then , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and remind her of our dinner date . And when I got to the office . . . " " What time was this ? " I interrupted . " Oh , it must have been a little after eleven . " At least , Nellie had n't been cooling off too long . " And the door was closed and I knocked , but , of course , there was n't any answer . The light was on and I tried the door because I thought I might leave her a note on her desk . It was open so I went in . . . " She gave a five-beat pause for effect , another swig of brandy , and to pull some hair out of her mouth that had swung in . " And what do you suppose I saw ? " I allowed as how I could n't imagine . " It was  | Nellie ! " she said in a great rush of triumph . " Lying across her desk in a welter of blood . . . a welter . " Okay , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribble a welter , let her . " There she was lying in a welter of blood . " " You said that . Then what happened ? " " Then everything went white . " It could n't be black like with anybody else  --  with her it was white . " And the next thing I knew I was screaming in Sardi 's . Whatever do you suppose made me do that ? " Margo answered her , " Shock , I suppose . You said everything went white . " " Yes , that must have been it , " agreed Libby . " Shock . " She lowered her eyes and her white eyelids looked very strange against the smudge of black under them  --  almost blind . " Okay , take it from there . " " Well , everyone rushed back up with me . And after a while , the police and press came and they made everyone clear out . All except me , " she added proudly . " What had happened to Nellie ? " " Oh , after they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaned up the place a little . And then the doctor came and they took her away in a basket . " " What did the doctor say when he examined her ? " I hated having to get all the dope second-hand . " He said it looked like she 'd fainted or passed out , there was an empty gin bottle right in the desk  --  you know Nellie  --  and she 'd fallen across her desk on that filing thing . You know , the one she always had on her desk . " I said I knew . " Just happened to hit a vital spot and struck her heart and killed her , he guessed , without an autopsy . " " They did n't think there was anything fishy about it ? " " No . Why should they ? " " I mean did they go around spraying powder on things . You know , fingerprints ? "  | " I do n't think so , but they might have while I was being photographed . I kind of hoped there 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , did n't they even look for clues ? " asked Margo . Libby thought a moment . " I do n't think so , but then , I was so busy with the photographers . . . " Well , I 'd had it . I was just as wrong as before and really worse than Libby . She 'd only made an audition of Nellie 's death and I 'd tried to build it up to a whole three-. act melodrama . It was time for the curtain to go up so I went over to the bar and gave Patsy the money for the drinks , making the annoying discovery that Libby and Margo had had four brandies . What she told me was n't worth it . I came back and helped them on with their coats . " Would you like to go to the theatre with us , Margo ? " What the hell , I might just as well ask her . It would n't make much difference one way or the other . " Oh , no . I could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well . I 've three tickets , anyway . I 'd just have to turn one back . " " Well , if you 'll let me pay for it , I 'd love to . " " Oh , no I could n't . " Me trying to be the shy type . " Please let Inc . After all , you bought the drinks , and I really barged in on Libby . It would n't be fair if I did n't . " " Well , " I said , I hoped hesitantly . Four bucks would be almost clear profit  --  except for the drinks . She reached into her bag and pulled out a five dollar bill and handed it to me . " There , we 're even . You can buy me another drink when your show opens . " " Show ? " I said . " What show ? " " But are n't you in the new Frobisher show ? " She turned to Libby . " Darling , I thought you told me he was in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " said Libby . " It 's all over town about , you and Maggie Lanson . What 's the matter ? You think it 's bad luck to talk about it ? " " But , my God . I just found out myself an hour ago . Talk about small towns knowing everything about you . " " I wonder if they 've set the understudies yet , " said Libby . " You know , that might be a job for you , Margo . I 'm too young for Randall , but you ought to be about right . " " Oh , no , " said Margo modestly . " I could n't do that . " " Why not ? " asked Libby . " You told me you wanted to get into the theatre and you might as well start somewhere . Tim will introduce you to Frobisher , wo n't you , Tim ? It 's worth a try . " " Now wait a minute , " I said . " I have n't even started to rehearse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Come around after I 've passed my five days , and I 'll see what I can do . " It did n't hurt to say that much . I certainly did n't intend to bother Frobisher with stage-struck women I hardly knew , even provided I did get the job . " That 's a date , Margo . " Libby was persistent for her friends if nothing else . " Now do n't forget , Tim . " I said I would n't , but I fully intended to . She glanced at her watch . " Say , we 'd better get going or we 'll be late . Have you finished paying for the drinks , Tim ? " I told her I had . " Oh , that reminds me . Something I forgot to tell you . Clues . About Nellie , I mean . " " Clues , " I said . " What clues ? " " Asking you about the bill for the drinks must have made me think of it . Free association I guess you 'd call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ( lid find some money down Nellie 's bazoom , if you could call that clues . " " Why , darling , " said Square-mouth . " How thrilling . You did n't tell me that . "  | " I just remembered it . " " Money ? " I asked . " How much money ? " " It was just some she was going to pay a bill with . It was there too . " " What was it for ? " " Two hundred and seventy-five dollars for a dress from Chez Ernest . " Chez Ernest was in the Youth and Beauty Book . An appointment that morning . " Did you see the bill ? Was it made out to Nellie ? " " Oh , yes . I saw it and it was . " That did n't mean much either . You do n't kill people for intending to pay their bills . " Well , come on or we 'll be late . " We were late , but after five minutes of the show I knew it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a movie . Lucille Blake 's latest tumbril was a high comedy . You can always tell , if there 's a terrace in the back of the set . Nick Stein had done well on the seats , and when they 're free it is n't considered cricket to walk out and you 're supposed to clap a lot at the end , so I got ready to sit through it . I started thinking over what Libby had said , which , God knows , was n't much . Nellie was certainly getting fancy in her old age laying out two hundred and seventyfive bucks for a new dress . I nudged Libby who , still keeping an eye on the stage , twisted an ear in my direction . " Do you remember ever seeing Nellie in any other dress but that old moss job she always wore ? " " What ? " she whispered and I repeated it . " No , I do n't think I have . Is n't Miss Blake divine ? " Miss Blake was n't divine . She was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination that you felt she must have some of her own money in the show  --  which she had . I was relieved when it was over .  | We put Margo in a cab and I started walking Libby over to Madison where she lived . " Timmy , I hope you did n't mind too much about Margo barging in like that ? " " Who is she ? I 've never seen her around before . She go to Bennington with you ? " " No , she 's a friend of Ted Kent 's , I think . He introduced me to her this afternoon . " Any friend of Ted Kent 's is no friend of mine . " She 's just been divorced or something and wants to act . I think she might do for Randall 's understudy and it would n't hurt you to introduce her to Frobisher . " " But I keep telling you , I have n't started work myself yet . " " You 're just being superstitious and , besides , you promised . She is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tryouts for the Equity Library shows , you know , those things they 're putting on so agents and people can see you , and Vince Wagner offered her Rosalind in As You Like It the minute she walked into the room . But like a dope she said she was n't ready for Shakespeare yet even though that was the lead . Vince , the louse , said I was n't the type . " " I see no reason to encourage frustrated females to take to the theatre as a cure for divorce . " " I do n't see why she 's any different from Maggie . " " Well , you better take another look and besides it 's none of your God damned business about Maggie . " " You do n't need to snap my head off . " " I 'm sorry , Libby , but I 've had a bad day . " " I 'm sorry , too . I did n't mean to say that about Maggie . " We reached her hotel . " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margo be jealous ? " " You can go to hell . " She ran into the lobby . I bought the next morning 's News and Mirror in the subway station and inside was a story about Nellie with  | a completely unrecognizable cut of her that must have been all of fifteen years old . The stories in both the papers were about the same . Death was accidental as a result of falling on the spindle . . . alcohol had been found in her brain and she was known to have been susceptible to heart attacks . Nothing I did n't already know . But what did puzzle me was that the time of death was set between eight and nine-thirty A.M. Nellie had never in her life been known to be in her office before ten o'clock at the very earliest and what 's more she was warm when I took her pulse and the blood was still oozing out of her . I learned enough about blood in the army to know there was something screwy somewhere . Who was kidding who ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door of the Casbah . Jan , Helga the housekeeper 's little boy , was sitting on the hall stairs playing with something in his hand . I could n't see what it was . There were n't any messages for me in the pigeon holes just inside the door so I started upstairs . " Hello , Jan . What have you got there ? " Jan looked at me gravely . He was about four years old and one of the most angelic-looking children I 've ever seen . And one of the dirtiest . He held out a cupped hand to me and I started to shake it thinking that was what he wanted . The moment I closed my hand over his tiny one he let out a terrific scream which scared the pants off of me . I let go in a hurry . " What 's the matter , Jan . I was n't going to hurt you ? " His scream stopped just as suddenly as it began and he started groping around on the floor as though he 'd dropped something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him search , but I could n't sec anything . " What is it Jan ? What did you lose ? " " Nana , " he said feverishly groping around on the floor . " You made me drop Nana . " I could n't see anything that looked like a Nana even allowing for baby talk .  | " Who is Nana ? " Suddenly he smiled and very gently he put his cupped hand , knuckles down , on the floor and then very carefully raised it up for me to see . " Nana . She 's my friend . " His grimy little hand was absolutely empty . I began to feel a tickle at the back of my neck . He slowly moved his hand to his chest and started to pet nothing with his other about five inches from his cupped one , the way you might pet a baby rabbit . I took it that Nana was very , very small . " Is n't it a little late for you and Nana to be up ? " I could play along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " he replied solemnly , not missing a stroke on Nana . Helga frequently had friends , and since she lived in only one room , renting all the rest , it appeared that Jan and Nana would have a long , long play together if I knew Helga . " Well , good night , Jan . " I started up the stairs . " Say good-night to Nana , " he said holding up his palm again . I dutifully said good night to Nana and went on upstairs , shaking my head . I knocked on Kendall 's room to get my key , but no answer . And the bum had promised he 'd be in when I got back . I tried my door and sure enough he had had sense enough to lock it . No telling where the old lush would be trying to promote drinks now , so I called down for Jan and he came trotting up the stairs , both hands empty this time . " What did you do with Nana , Jan ? " He smiled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She apparently could be turned on and off at will . " Listen , Jan . My door is locked and I have n't got my key . Would you go ask your mother for the pass key ? " He just stood there . " Have you got that ? Pass key . " " Mummy would be mad at Jan . " I did n't intend to sit on the stairs all night too , friend or no friend .  | " No , she wo n't , Jan . Mummy will understand . Tell her it 's for Tim . She 'll give it to you . " Jan shook his head violently . " I 'll give you ten cents . " His face lit up at that . " Jan knows where Mummy keeps other key . " " What other key ? " " Gim me ten cents . " He was learning fast . I handed him the dime and he took off like Moody 's goose down the stairs . In a few seconds he was back and presented me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mummy give it to you ? " He smiled his little smile . " Secret . " The key fit and I opened my door and gave the key back to him and he ran downstairs again . I wondered if Jan or Nana knew how to make long distance phone calls .  | 10 ERNEST , the owner of that elegantly exclusive grey and smoky-mirrored dress shop , Chez Ernest , used to be a shiny-haired night club dancer until he got a little short in the wind and started to bloat . His one-of-a-kind designs are sort of a cross between Valentina and Adrian  --  line and texture in what I always thought were remarkably dirty colors . I 've never seen one of his things , outside of black or whites , that had an honest-to-God normal color in it . The greens look like verdigris on an old roof and the yellows and reds something he 's found out behind a hospital . But the women love it and think he shrieks with chic . At ten the next morning , after my sitting with Trindler the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , through a partly open door , I could hear Jenny Pittenger 's foghorn voice , so I went in . Maggie and Jenny and Ernest were draped around the floor of Ernest 's office like a bunch of bung-hole buddies looking at huge water color dress sketches spread out on the carpet . There were coffee cups beside them and Ernest handed me one as soon as I came in . I took off my coat and hat and threw them on a couch and joined the others on the floor . " Good for you , darling . " Maggie smiled at me . " Did n't think you 'd make it . How were the photographs ? " " If the amount of fussing with lights means anything ,  | they should be sensational . " I said hello to Jenny and Ernest . " My God ! " Jenny stared at me through her thick hornrimmed glasses . " Little Sir Horror ! What the hell are you doing up at this hour ? Thought you were strictly an evening artist . " " Frobisher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ? I 'm replacing someone in this new little turkey you 're working on . " " Well , things are bad all over . " And Jenny went back to shuffling sketches . She was one of the rudest people in the world , but you could n't be mad at her . She was n't nasty , she just had the embarrassing habit of saying what she thought . I first met Jenny about eight years ago when I was an usher at her wedding . She 'd been almost pretty then , at least pretty enough to get married because her family did n't have any money , but her marriage did n't take so she had a career instead of babies . She was a good designer too , and had gotten to be top-flight the hard way . After staffing for years with Mielziner , during the war she started getting jobs on her own when most of the established scene designers were playing camouflage in the army . With a snort Jenny tossed the sketches aside . " Look Ernie , my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reach down in that marsupial pouch of yours and get up something decent . This elderly blonde angel on my left is supposed to be attractive , not Electra 's understudy . " " But darling Jenny , those are the best I have . " He began picking up the scattered sketches . He held one at arm 's length . " What 's the matter with this one ? " " If you do n't know , dearie , I 'm not going to tell you . Come on now , break out the ones you 've been saving for Hope Hampton . We 're your pals , see ? Come on , give . " " But , Jenny , that 's all I have . " " Then there 's only one thing to do . Get out your little  | drawing pad , Mazurka , and create . " I could see this was n't going to help me complete my mission so I got up and wandered around the office . " Ernie , where do you keep copies . . . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " screamed Ernie . Jenny roared . " I 'm sorry . I mean where do you keep sketches of dresses you 've done recently . Or do n't you make one for every dress ? " " Of course I do , " Ernie said over his shoulder . " They 're in that portfolio by the desk . " He started slashing at an enormous sketch pad with a soft pencil . I found the portfolio and leafed through the sketches . There were hundreds , but , fortunately , on the back they all had the names of the clients who had bought them , and Nellie 's name was on the back of four . So it was true . Yet , when did Nellie ever wear them ? Three of the four were mostly a peculiar shade of dirty magenta that set my teeth on edge . I pulled out one of the sketches and carried it over to Maggie . " Look , Maggie . What about this one ? Do n't you think this would be nice ? " She took one look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her and she reluctantly picked up the cue . " Well , yes . Look , Jenny . What 's the matter with this one ? " " Crap ! " said Jenny , but she began to study it too . " Still if you like it , Mag . After all , you 're going to wear it , I would n't , but it 's not too bad with the set . " " Bad with the set or good with the set , " said Ernie . " Maggie , my darling , you are not going to wear that dress . That model has been sold and I do n't copy my own models . I leave that to others , " he said loftily . " It 's just too damned bad about you , " said Jenny . " That 's the one we 're going to have . Who got it anyway ? " She turned over the sheet and read the name on the back . " Nellie Brant ? Not that old flesh peddler ? Thought she  | was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Timmy , " said Maggie before I even opened my mouth . " Does n't prove what ? " asked Jenny suspiciously . " Oh , nothing , " I said . " Maggie and I just had a little bet . " " Is that really whom this was for , Ernie ? " asked Maggie . " You 're not just making it up ? " " If you let a bag like that wear this little job , " said Jenny , " you 're dumber than I thought . What did she want  --  a stylish dress to be buried in ? " Ernie snatched the sketch away from Jenny and popped it back into the portfolio . " It so happens it was for her niece . " " What does she look like , Ernie ? " I asked . " I 've never met her . She lives in a one-night-stand called Hopkinsville , Kentucky , and I 've done several things for her in the last couple of years . " " Kind of letting the bars down , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the mail order business yet . Do send me a catalogue . They 're so handy . " This stung him . " As a rule I build my models on the client , but Nellie is an old friend and I made an exception . " " Do you do it from measurements ? " asked Jenny sweetly . " Or do you just add water ? " " It so happens she is a perfect model size . " He eyed Jenny 's bulk . " Which of course you would n't know anything about . " Jenny slapped him on the back . " Okay , two-step . You win . " After a good deal of name calling a sketch and samples were finally decided on . A sulphur yellow and what was called " greige " was it . Maggie put her foot down on any dirty reds or greens and I backed her up . Ernie promised it would be finished in time for the opening in Wilmington . " See that it is. " said Jenny darkly . " Or else ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old miser , and now hows about a drink ? " Ernie pushed a button and a bar appeared out of the wall . " Come on kiddies , let 's get stinking . " " We 've got to be at rehearsal in fifteen minutes . " said Maggie . " Some other time . Call me and let 's have lunch . " " I 'll do that . " Jenny poured herself a generous belt . We said goodbye to Ernie and left him looking apprehensively at Jenny who had already started on her second drink . I waited till we flagged a cab before I asked Maggie what she thought of the sketches I had discovered . " Under that moss of Nellie 's must have beaten a heart of gold , " was her comment . " But two hundred and seventy-five per , just for a niece . Does that sound like Nellie ? " " Do n't tell me you 're trying to find something sinister in that ? " " But can you see those scabby reds and poison greens in the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little weaknesses . " But it still did n't seem in character for Nellie who had been the hardest woman with a dollar I 'd ever met . No matter how many plays you have been in before , you always get a few butterflies at your first rehearsal of a new one . You take off your hat very carefully so you wo n't mess up your hair and you wonder if your shoes are shined enough and your trousers are s till pressed and you keep wiping off the palms of your hands so they wo n't be like wet fish when you shake hands with people . The Lyceum Theatre stage door is on Forty-sixth Street although the entrance to the theatre itself is on Fortyfifth . Maggie and I did n't say anything as I helped her out of the cab and opened the stage door . We walked down a narrow hall and I opened the door leading on to the stage proper and we tiptoed in . The set  | from the show that was still playing at the Lyceum was up and the rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the back of the set , stepping over cables and dodging props . It was very dark , just a few leaks from the big , bare work light hanging in the middle of the stage . We groped around to the proscenium arch and looked in . Frobisher was sitting on a chair in front of the footlights directing a scene . He saw us and motioned us to wait . I wanted a cigarette , but no one else seemed to be smoking and some theatres are stuffy about it backstage . In a couple of minutes Frobisher told the cast to take a break and came out to us . We shook hands and I was glad mine were comparatively dry . He was still looking tired , but everyone gets nervy as opening night creeps up . He 'd probably been up every night helping with the rewriting . He said how glad he was to see us and asked us to come with him while he introduced us to the rest of the company . Just before we followed him out on the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good cast Frobisher had assembled . Small , only ten counting Maggie and me , but you knew who all of them were , if not personally , at least by name . Miss Randall , the lead , had been starred for years . Paul Showers who played her husband was on loan from Hollywood and none of them was working for coffee and cakes . I wondered how much the actor I had replaced got . I began to wish I had held out for a hundred and fifty , but it was too late now . At least I would n't have to pay any commission . It was odd to think that if Nellie was n't dead I would be giving her five per cent every week . She had agented all the others . Frobisher started right in with the last act and since the play had been in rehearsal for two weeks , even though our parts were small , Maggie and I had a lot of catching up to do . It was three o'clock before we realized it and  | Frobisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for the rest of the afternoon , but an evening rehearsal would be held at his Sutton Place apartment promptly at seven-thirty . Greg Moulton , the stage manager , told Maggie and me that from now on , Mr. Frobisher wanted us to attend every rehearsal because there might be some skipping back and forth in the acts . There was still half an hour before the ceremony so Maggie and I walked up Broadway to the Henderson Funeral Home at Sixty-eighth Street where the services were to be held . We stopped off for a couple of snorts on the way and as it turned out , almost everyone else at the funeral had had the same idea .  | 11 WHEN we got to the Funeral Home , except for the fact that it was Sixty-eighth Street instead of Fortyfourth , the crowd looked like the sidewalk in front of Sardi 's at rush hour . I expect Nellie would have been pleased at such a good house . Kendall Thayer was there in fine fettle and his courtly bow aimed in my general direction almost threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny poured out . She , from the looks of her , had just this minute left Ernie and his sliding bar . " Darlings ! " she screamed when she saw us . " Is n't this heaven ? All this crush makes me feel like a bud again , " and she promptly collapsed against Maggie . Between the two of us , we managed to keep her from slumping into the gutter . The crowd was jamming the doors and just ahead of us were Ted Kent , Libby and old square-mouth Margo . I certainly did n't want to sit with those three and if we went in now we might have to . I was still feeling a little guilty about charging Margo for that ticket the other night and , also , I did n't want to give her a chance to remind me of that understudy job again . " Let 's wait a minute , Maggie . " " But I ca n't hold Jenny up much longer . " Maggie complained . We propped Jenny against the wall and lit  | cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the crowd get in first too , and they elbowed their way out on the sidewalk again and , of course , could n't help seeing us . Ted darlinged Maggie and , much to my annoyance , kissed her . Libby just pretended I did n't exist . She was sore , I guess , about my crack the other night . But not old square-mouth Margo . To my astonishment she threw her arms around me and kissed me . Maybe she was just doing it to make Ted mad for the way he kissed Maggie , but whatever her motives , it was one of the busiest kisses I have ever been on the other end of . It startled me so I almost jumped . I thought Maggie was too taken up with Ted to notice , she was standing with her back to me , but without stopping her conversation with Ted , she reached in her purse and pulled out a handkerchief and put it in my hand . There was n't anything else to do but shamefacedly wipe the lipstick off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been wrong about Libby and Margo being an item . " I had such a good time the other night , " Margo said . " I do hope you 'll forgive me for barging in like that on you and Libby . " " That 's okay , " I said . Just then Jenny started sliding down the wall to the sidewalk . Now that Ted was here he might as well work . " Help me get Jenny inside , will you Ted ? If we can get her set somewhere she ought to be okay . " He took her other arm and we started to lift her up . Jenny opened one bleary eye . " Whassa matter ? " " Come on . Stand up Jenny . " I said . " We 're going inside . " " Whaffor ? " " You remember Nellie 's funeral ? " She struggled to her feet . " Oh yes . Got ta see Nellie 's dress . "  | " What 's the matter with her ? " asked Ted . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen of the blood suckers in Ernie 's stylish dress . " " It is n't Nellie 's dress , " I explained patiently . " It 's her niece 's . " " Then got ta see ole Nellie 's niece in Ernie 's stylish dress . " At last she was vertical and the five of us got her inside where another drunk latched on to our happy little band . Kendall Thayer . This was getting to be too much of a good thing and I was all for ( lumping Jenny and grabbing Maggie and getting the hell out , but Kendall was demanding introductions to the three girls and there was n't much I could do . I know from experience that when Kendall starts trotting out that roguish matinee-idol routine you have no choice . He must have had a breath like a serpent for Margo unto whom , luckily for Maggie , he fastened first , made no bones about the way she felt and held her handkerchief up to her nose the whole time he was talking to us . We managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was twenty years since I had been to a real sitdown funeral . I did n't like it then and the minute I sat down , I wished I was somewhere else . The organ music and the smell of flowers banked around the coffin brought back things I did n't particularly want brought back . I must admit Nellie 's friends had done well by her . There seemed to be a great many flowers . The casket was in front of a little altar and a minister or preacher . . . anyway , a man in vestments , was standing by it . The chapel was packed with people . Nellie was playing to S.R.O . and most of the audience acted as though they had just stopped by from a cocktail party . After you got used to the smell of flowers you started noticing the alcohol base like a cheap perfume . Kendall had found a seat well up front not far from Frobisher . The whole thing seemed more like an Equity meeting with a sprinkling of  | producers and agents , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupor . I thought it better to let her snore than to wake her up and take a chance on her that way . Maggie was getting tight . I could tell by the way she kept pushing her hair back across her face . It 's a gesture I know well and means that she is well on the way . The drinks we 'd had on the way were beginning to hit me too and I could n't focus very clearly on what was going on . I remember the minister getting up and mumbling something and the next thing I knew Kendall was standing beside him . He seemed to have taken over and there was no chance to avoid hearing those resonant tones . He was giving a performance . Not being awfully up on my funerals maybe it was considered a yes thing to have some of the audience get up and say a few well chosen words like Brutus in the one time I had a fling in Shakespeare . But it did n't seem quite right . Kendall was actually starting out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut . The minister looked too startled to do anything about it and Kendall did as neat a job of upstaging as I have ever seen . " Friends , Producers , Equity Members . " He was taking it big . " I come not only to praise Nellie , but to bury her . " He brushed away a tear , undoubtedly pure alcohol . " We are saying farewell to , not only a great friend , a great little agent , but a great artist as well . I remember when she was with me in Front Page Stuff , such brilliance ! such charm ! such vitality ! Perhaps some of you remember that unforgettable table scene we had together . I was playing Lord Washburn and she mistook me for the butler . That scene took all the notices as perhaps you recall . In playing that scene for forty weeks we found the true theatre and I knew I was right in turning my back on the Hollywood gold where I had been so long as a star with Fox Films . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | sit dumbly . . . now they started to titter . Jenny pulled herself up out of her slump and peered around like a walrus looking for fish . " Crap " she snorted and immediately went back to sleep . People were laughing now , and Mr. Frobisher somehow guided Kendall back to his seat and once more the startled minister began , but it was too late to get back the audience 's attention . Everyone started talking among themselves and a few people actually got up and went over to talk to friends standing at the back . The minister doggedly kept going . He had so many sides to his part and he was determined to say them regardless . I was feeling embarrassed and tried to shush a few of the noisier ones , but no one paid any attention to me . I hoped the minister would be through or give up pretty soon . Maggie and I stood up . I was feeling none too steady . " Maggie , " I said . " Let 's go . " " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . . . . " Under the circumstances that seemed the only thing we could do . It would take a half pound block of TNT to budge her . " You follow me . I 'll run interference for you . " We had almost broken through the line of scrimmage and made the door when Kendall clipped me from behind . " Tim . . . Tim . . . I want to talk to you . " Well , I did n't want to talk to old serpent's-breath again . Now or ever . " Go on . Beat it , Kendall . I 've got nothing to say to you after that performance you just gave . " I savagely jerked my arm out of his fingers . " Blow ! " " But , Tim , this is important . " I almost hit him . " Beat it , I tell you . " Maggie and I started up again and this time I was blocked head on by Ted Kent . " I was looking for you , Tim . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chapel .  | " Hey , wait a minute , " I called after him . " I 'm on what ? " " You dope . You 're supposed to help tote Nellie 's barge . " And then I remembered that Frobisher had asked me to be a pallbearer and I could n't very well not , under the circumstances . " I 've got to go bear a pall , " I told Maggie . " See you at your place afterwards . " I elbowed my way down the aisle and grabbed one of the silver casket handles . Ted , Mr. Frobisher and some other juveniles around town were already spotted at the other handles . Someone started to sing " For She 's a Jolly Good Fellow " but was quickly discouraged . That was too much even for this crowd . The minister with one horrified look disappeared through a little door . Jenny came staggering up , flailing her arms just as Mr. Frobisher gave the signal and we hoisted the casket . Alive , Nellie was no featherweight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the sweat breaking out on my forehead . A glance at the other pallbearers told me they were n't having any better time of it than I was . The rest of the audience filed out into the street after us . We managed to ease the casket into the waiting hearse . Mr. Frobisher said we would ride to the station in his car which was parked right behind the hearse . After we had run back into the chapel and grabbed our coats and hats , we started to pile into the car . I got in first . Sitting over in the corner of the back seat was a girl , dressed in black , crying noisily into a sodden handkerchief . Mr. Frobisher got in after me . Ted sat up front with the chauffeur and another juvenile and the other two drew the jump seats . I had the sensation that any minute the crowd would begin throwing rice and old shoes at us . " Gentlemen , " said Mr. Frobisher . " I 'd like to present Miss Mary Ellen Taylor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great burst of sobs as he spieled off our  | names . " I think they were all the most horrid people I ever heard of . " She was slightly muffled by the handkerchief mashed against her face . Frobisher tried to comfort her , but she would have none of it . " Carryin ' on like that with poor old Aunt Nellie lyin ' right there . " The accent was pure " Uncle Tom . " " I hope something awful happens to every one of them . " And that terrible old man that did all that talkin ' . Did n't he know he was n't supposed to do that ? " Kendall Thayer . " I do believe some of those people were drunk . " This grim thought sent her into even louder sobs . I still could n't get it straight . " Are you really Nellie 's niece ? I mean her only niece ? " A red-rimmed eye glared at me around the grey handkerchief . " ' Course I am . The only kin poor old Aunt Nellie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most generous aunt in creation " ? and off she was again . The rumpled black suit and dusty felt hat she was wearing would have sent Ernie screaming for a burnt feather . I gave up ! It was getting hot in the car and I must have dozed off , for when I came to we were parked outside the baggage room at Penn Station . The pallbearers bore Nellie once more , into the baggage-room , and since there did n't seem to be anything else to do , we got back in the car , smoked , and waited for Mr. Frobisher who , with Miss Taylor , was arranging for tickets . None of us said very much . Juveniles , as a rule , do n't have much in common , and Ted and I , who certainly could n't be called juveniles , did n't even bother to try . While we waited , I tried to figure out the angles , but I did n't get anywhere . Nellie could n't have had a second niece , or , if she did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no particular point in lying to me about it . Something was strictly not on the up and up !  | 12 WHEN I got to Maggie 's apartment , she was just getting ready to take a bath and opened the door in a great white bathrobe with her hair pinned up on top of her head . She looked about sixteen . " What took you so long ? " " I was seeing Nellie home . Mr. Frobisher dropped me off here . " " My , my . Are n't we coming up in the world ? Did he buy your dinner for you too ? " " No . But it might interest you to know he offered to . " " I 'm that impressed . Well , call up Schrafft 's and have them send something over with lots of coffee . We 've got to be in shape for rehearsal tonight . Why do n't you lie down while I take my bath , then you can have one too . You could probably use one after that shindig . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , are n't they ? " She headed for the bathroom . I followed her into the bedroom and stripped down to my shorts and lay on her bed . She started splashing around in the bathtub . Clouds of steam were coming out the door . " If the bath salts get you down , " she called . " Just open a window . I need some after that . " She started to close the door . Her bath salts even matched her perfume . So that 's how she did it . It smelled warm and steamy and good .  | " Leave the door open . I want to talk . " She did and I could hear her getting in the tub . I lay back and looked at the ceiling . " I met Nellie 's niece , " I said finally . " Really ? What was she like . " " A flower of the ole Sooth . And she would never wear one of Ernie 's dresses either . I 'll bet anything in the world on that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nieces . Maybe Nellie had one a little more glamorous tucked away somewhere . " " I 'm all the kith and kin Poah li'l Ole Aunt Nellie had in this great big horrid world . And I quote li'l Missy Mary Ellen Taylor . Now will you admit it ? " " I 'll admit nothing of the kind and what 's more I 'm bored with the whole business . Have you ordered dinner yet ? " I told her I had n't . " Well , do it then . It takes forever to get here . We have n't got all night , you know . " The water was gurgling out of the tub . I reached for the ' phone by her bed . " What 's the number ? " " Volunteer something . For God 's sake look it up . " " Where do you keep the book ? " " Oh never mind , I 'll do it . You were just waiting for me to anyway . " She came out of the bathroom tying the cord of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever known . Go ahead , the bathroom 's all yours . " She sat on the side of the bed and pulled the telephone book out from a little cupboard in the bedside table . " I know , if it had been a snake it would have bit me . " She started thumbing through the directory . Little beads of moisture still clung to her face . Her forehead was wrinkled with concentration . I reached up and smoothed it out with my thumb . " Oh , stop it . Now you made me lose my place . U comes before S or after ? I never can remember . " I pulled out the pin that held the pile of hair up and  | it tumbled down around her shoulders . Part of it fell in front of her eyes and she pushed it aside with an irritated gesture . I shoved the telephone book out of her hands and pulled her back on the bed and kissed her . She did n't react one way or the other . I let her go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started looking through it again . I felt a little annoyed . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Well , why so coy ? " " I 'm not being coy . " " Well , you 're certainly trying to be something . " " I 'm not trying to be anything at all , but I just do n't like you feeling that you have to earn that hundred bucks with me . Save your energy , you may need it when the hundred 's gone . " " That 's a hell of a thing to say . " I sat up on the other side of the bed . " You know it 's true . " " Of all the snide remarks ! What 's gotten into you lately , you 've been acting funny for the last three days ? " " I 've been acting funny ! What about you with all this hocus-pocus about Nellie ? You do n't realize how dull it is . It may have been amusing at first , but to keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you ought to go see a doctor . . . I mean it , seriously . I do n't think you 've got all your buttons . First , this Nellie fixation and now getting in a pet just because I do n't happen to want to play footie with you . " " Well , you can take your lousy hundred bucks and you know what you can do with it . " I started to get up . " I know , I know . If you had your pants on you 'd fling the money in my face . But you have n't got your pants on and , as a matter of fact , you look damn silly standing there trying to be wounded dignity in your underwear .  | Now be a good boy and go take your bath and I 'll order some food and let 's forget all about it . You can even use some of my bath salts . " " Thank you , I 'm sure . " I stalked into the bathroom as well as you can stalk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposely not think about what Maggie had said and , for spite , I used a lot of her bath salts and got out of the tub smelling to high heaven and feeling wonderful and hungry as a horse . Maggie was dressed when I came back to the bedroom and was finishing putting on her face . " I 'm sorry I was such a louse , " I said . " I 'm sorry too . It 's none of my damn business what you do . " " That was n't why I wanted to kiss you , though . " The door buzzer buzzed . " There 's the food . Now hurry up and get dressed . We have n't got much time . " I got dressed and when I came into the living room she had opened all the cartons and set the table with china from the kitchenette . The table was in front of the couch and she had lit the fire in the little white marble fireplace . It was nice and the food was good ; no whipped cream which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cigarette when we were finished . I lit mine and we settled back on the couch . There were still fifteen minutes before we had to leave for Sutton Place . I felt contented and tried a smoke ring without much luck . " Timmy . " " Un-huh . " I was concentrating on another smoke ring . " Why do n't you try being respectable ? " " What do you mean , respectable ? I resent that . " " You know what I mean . You ca n't keep on this way forever . " " What way ? " I knew perfectly well what she meant . " Well , all this helling around . Your looks wo n't last forever . "  | " I intend to grow old gracefully , distinguished like Lewis Stone . " " What if your hair falls out ? " " Boyer 's not doing so bad . Why all this sudden interest in my follicles ? Are you getting to that age where you want to do Good Works and reform me ? What about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already had a life of sorts ; now I 'm just waiting around . " " What for ? " " Not for anything special . . . just waiting . But I 've got some money . . . at least I do n't have to worry about that . I know you do . " " Maybe I 'll get a picture contract . You never can tell . " " Do n't you think if you were going to get one you 'd have had it before now ? You 've been around for ten years . " They 're just waiting for me to mellow . " I did n't like any part of this conversation . It was all right for me to ask myself these things , but not for other people . " You 're waiting , I 'm waiting . At least I know what I 'm waiting for . Now let 's talk about something else . IIow did we get on this gruesome subject , anyway ? " I poured out the last of the coffee . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you going to marry Diana ? " she asked suddenly . " Good God , no . Whatever made you think of that ? " " I do n't know . It might be a good idea . " " Well , in the first place she has n't asked me . " Maggie burst out laughing before I realized how silly what I had said must have sounded . " Maybe she 's the old-fashioned type and wants to be asked . " " That would be a hell of a note , me married to Diana . " " I think it 's a fine idea . . . Why not ? She 's rich , is n't she ? She 's not still married to that dreary poop , is she ? " " No. "  | " Well , then , " she said triumphantly , " there you are ! They do wonderful jobs on teeth out in Hollywood . I still do n't see why with all that money she has n't done something about them before . I believe they file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay . " " And then they stick caps on and you ca n't tell the difference . Of course , I do believe you ca n't eat anything tougher than Clapps Baby Food but she could afford to lose some weight and I 'm sure it would help her skin . " " Never mind about Diana 's skin . " " I know , you found a Rose in No-Man's-Land . " " Do n't be silly . We 've got to get going . It 's a fifteenminute walk . " " Sit back . I 'll blow us to a cab . I 'm fascinated with your life . " " What do you think I am ? An apartment to be done over ? " " I 'm worried about you . If you 're not going to get married , you 've got to get a job . " " I 've got a job . Remember ? And it starts in twenty minutes . " " I mean a real job . " " What sort of a job could I get ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " " that ? Fuller brushes ? " " No , bonds , insurance . People do . " " Other people maybe . . . not me . I would n't be any good at it . " " You might be a G-man . God knows you 're trying hard enough to be , in an amateur way . You could have fearful fun raising merry old hell with the police . Every time someone dies of heart failure you could make a big murder case out of it . " " You still do n't believe anything is fishy about that , do you ? "  | " I know what you 're going to say . Just because we thought we found a sketch of a dress that Ernie said was for Nellie 's niece and it was n't . That does n't prove a thing . Promise me one thing , will you ? It 's for your own good . " " What is it ? " " Promise first . " " Oh , do n't be childish . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " But I really am worried about you , " she continued doggedly . " You 've got a job now , and if you do n't bitch it up it 'll be a decent run and you can get a little ahead . Promise me you 'll forget all about the Nellie thing until at least opening night . Then I do n't care what you do . But I want you to promise me that . I 've never asked you to do anything for me before , but I 've got a feeling you 're talking yourself into a fine little cell at Bloomingdale 's . Promise ? " She was right . I had been a little cracked on the subject . There was n't one tangible thing to prove that Nellie 's death had n't been on the up and up . It could have been a typo in the papers about the time of death . Out of the thousand characters that walk along Forty-fourth Street , one of them did n't want to be bothered with Bertha and her autograph book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkinsville whose train was late for all I knew . Nellie may have just called someone her niece , the way people are called Uncle or Aunt when they really are no relation at all . All my rushing about the last three days did seem pretty pointless and mostly just an effort to justify to myself and Maggie my acting like a road company Hamlet the day I went to call on Nellie . " Okay . I promise . " " Thank you , " said Maggie . " You may kiss me now , if you like . " I liked .  | 13 THE rehearsal that night was very elegant and I felt teddibly , teddibly . Frobisher 's Sutton Place apartment was a duplex and the two-storey living room seemed almost as big as the Lyceum stage . Greg had already pulled the furniture around to make the set . The room was all very Town and Country , grey-green walls and lots of heavy goldish drapes . The original of the Birnbaum cartoon of Frobisher from the New Yorker profile , an uncanny likeness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no eyebrows ? was keeping company on the walls with two Degas and a Lautrec . I should think Birnbaum would be very pleased if he knew . One end of the room had a terrace overlooking the East of River and when they were n't on , most of the cast spent the evening standing out there . It should have been chilly in February , but with the big glass doors open , enough heat came out so that it was as warm as the living room . Little tugs glided by and the great bridge loomed and winked its lights . The Sunshine Biscuit sign was even pretty . Maggie and I , who were out there first , played a little game  --  seeing how many of the cast within a count of ten after they stepped on the terrace , did n't say when they saw the view , " Why it looks just like a backdrop . " Not one of them missed . The living room itself had a " done " look as though  | some scene designer like Jones or Chaney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine Italian hand . Effective and comfortable , but you had a feeling that if you went through one of the doors and turned around , the wall would be plain canvas flats with lashed-together wooden battens on the back . After rehearsal , a butler straight from Lonsdale appeared with drinks and we all sat around for an hour and gossiped about the funeral , other plays , performances and people . It was extremely pleasant . Frobisher was a good host and Miss Randall was amusing about Hollywood and everyone was in a glow of well-being when we got ready to leave . Maggie left with Miss Randall who would share her cab as far as the Gotham where she was stopping . I told them to go on . I was going to take the subway to the Village . I had left my coat and hat on an enormous flat-topped desk which took up one corner of the living room and I went to pick it up . It was certainly an impressive desk . Hollywood could n't do much better . Lots of tooled leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a photograph . I picked up the photograph and looked at it . It was of a woman , hair parted in the middle and drawn severely back over the ears , dark shining eyes in a strong face . " My wife , " said a voice over my shoulder . I turned and Mr. Frobisher himself was standing beside me , smiling at me . " She 's very lovely . I think I must have seen her on the stage . " " No . My wife was never on the stage . " " Really ? But I 'm sure I 've seen her somewhere . " " I think that 's hardly possible . She died thirty years ago in California . " I 'm sorry sir , I did n't know . " Mr. Frobisher took the photograph from me and stared at it for a few moments The breeze from the then put it gently back on the desk . the breeze from the  | open terrace windows ruffled some papers while I was putting on my coat and Mr. Frobisher set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by the curious design . " Do you mind if I look at that , sir ? " " Not at all . " He handed it to me . Wrought in gold and exact in every detail was a miniature stage door . Accurate even to the electric light hooking out at the top . On the base was inscribed : " To Henry Frobisher in grateful appreciation  --  The Stage Door Canteen . " " I know it 's a little late , sir , but I 'd like to add my appreciation for what you did with the Canteen . It was a wonderful thing . " " That 's very kind of you , Tim . I 'm grateful you feel that way . " " And I ca n't tell you , sir , how sorry I was when I heard you lost your son . " It did n't seem possible that pain could surge into a face so quickly . I could have kicked myself for opening my big mouth . Christ . Will I ever learn ? But no . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put in my two cents worth . I have to stand in front of him with all my arms and legs and tell him what a pity it was that his son got blown to bits in Normandie . I might just as well have kicked him in the teeth and been done with it . I clumsily tried to apologize , but I do n't think he even knew when I left . He just stood there , staring at his dead wife 's picture . It was a little after eleven when I , thoroughly ashamed of myself , unlocked the door to the Casbah . There was a message from Kendall in my box to be sure and drop in and see him when I got home . Jan was n't at his usual post on the stairs . Helga must be taking a night off to catch up on her beauty sleep . I climbed the three flights to my room and then decided to see Kendall first . I was n't particularly sleepy and wanted someone to talk to , and also to chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His room is on the same floor and just around the corner from mine . I knocked , but there was n't any answer . I tried the door . It was open and when I stuck my head in the light was on but the room was empty . Oh , well , he 'd probably forgotten all about his note to me and was out trying to promote another drink . Evidently it had been a fairly profitable night in the radio business . His bed had two or three cartons of soap and some breakfast foods on it . I closed the door and walked around the corner to my own room . While I was putting the key in the lock , the door swung part way open . It made me mad , for I distinctly remembered locking it when I left that morning . But something was against it . I shoved it harder and forced it open . I switched on the lights and looked to see what had been holding the door . I took one look and just made the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a man 's body . A shiny pool of blood was seeping under his head . His eyes were closed , but his face was mottled red like a bad birthmark , almost as though he had spilled catsup on it . Near one of his outflung hands was a brown bottle with a bright yellow label and in spite of the bile still in my nose my room smelled like a subway toilet . The body belonged to Kendall Thayer.  | 14 YOU 'D think by this time I would be used to opening doors and finding bodies , but maybe it 's something you never get used to , like opening nights . The smell was the main thing that got me and as I knelt down to take Kendall 's pulse I saw it was caused by what had been in the brown bottle  --  Lysol . There was a faint pulse . What I did from then on is still rather vague . I must have yelled or pounded on the door , for a lot of people , including Helga , who was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the denizens of the Casbah must have heard me . Almost immediately the hall was filled with craning people and a great deal of shoving about . I do n't know yet who sent for the ambulance and the police . Helga must have done it as soon as she looked in and saw that face . She pushed the rest of them away and shut my doer . I managed to pull myself together and between us we picked Kendall up and put him on my bed . I loosened his collar and Helga got a towel and some water from the bathroom and bathed his face . The blotches had been caused by the Lysol . It was all over his face and neck and the skin was red and raw . Mercifully , Kendall was still unconscious . He came to just before the ambulance arrived . I was reading the label on the Lysol bottle trying to find out what you did for the burns , when he started to move . Ile tried to claw at his face , but Ilelga and I held his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth and moaned . I could n't make out at first what he was saying , but it got louder and louder . " My eyes . Oh God , my eyes . My eyes . " He was screaming when the doctor pounded on the door . I opened it and let him in . There was also a medic with a stretcher and a couple of policemen shooing away the crowd . The doctor took one look at Kendall and without a word opened his bag and gave him an injection . The few minutes we waited for the dope to take effect , all three of us had to hold Kendall down to keep him from clawing out his eyes and throwing himself off the bed . His eyes were open and had a milky look , like cataracts . Gradually he quieted down and soon he was lying still , his breath whistling through his swollen lips . The doctor called in the medic and they started spreading some stuff on Kendall 's face . I felt I was going to be sick again so I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while I felt that maybe I was all right and pulled my head back in the room . They had loaded him on the stretcher and were carrying him out the door . A policeman was talking to Helga . With her curlers shaking and the mud on her face already starting to crack , she looked like a badly made-up Topsy . The cop had a notebook and was taking down her name and story . When I heard his voice I was surprised that it was n't Irish . It should have been with his red face and ham-like hands wrestling with the pencil . He looked very tired and his mouth was small and pursy . His voice had a whine in it . " Someone pound on my door and say come quick something happened to Mr. Thayer in Mr. Briscoe 's room , " Helga was saying . " So I come quick . " The cop looked at me . " You Mr. Briscoe ? " I said I was . He asked for my full name and I gave it to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army serial number too . " Well , go on , Mrs. Sorenson . " He glanced at his book  | for the last name . " Then what did you do ? " " I come running up here . I was in bed already . There was poor Mr. Thayer lying on the floor . We picked him up and put him on the bed and I told another tenant to call police and ambulance . " It seemed to me that the policeman ought to begin with me if he was going to question people . After all , it was my room and I had found Kendall , but it seemed to be one person at a time . " He had that Lysol stuff all over his face and I got some water and tried to wipe it off . I hope it was the right thing . And then they come and take him away . " " Has he been your tenant long , Mrs. Sorenson ? This Thayer person . " " Three . . . four years . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , Mr. . . . " He consulted his book again . " Briscoe . How did you happen to find him ? " " Well , " I began . " This is my room and I unlocked the door , only it was n't locked . " " You unlocked the door only it was n't locked . Now just how did you do that ? " I could feel myself getting more and more angry . That seemed ridiculous quibbling to me . He must have known what I meant . " I simply mean I put my key in to unlock it but it was already open and swung in a little way and stopped when it hit Kendall 's body . I pushed it open enough to get through and turned on the lights and saw him lying there . I thought at first he was dead . " " Why did you think he was dead ? " " I do n't know , but he was so still and all , and then that smell . . . " " The Lysol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying on the floor , " I said . " I 'm afraid I got sick . " He gave me an irritating smile . " When I got through being sick I came back and took his pulse and found out he was alive . I do n't remember exactly  | what I did , but I must have yelled . Anyway , I got all those people outside the door up . Then Helga came and we did what she said and they came and took him away and that 's all . " " Any idea how it happened ? " " No . I ca n't understand what he was doing in my room in the first place . I remembered locking my door this morning . " " Mr. Briscoe always keeps his door locked . " Helga nodded a grotesque agreement to my statement . " Very particular . . . " " Where was he when you found him ? " I pointed out the exact place . " His head was in the bloody place there . " " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed it too . It was just in the back of the head . Not much blood . Almost stopped bleeding . " " Now , how could he have got that ? " The policeman looked around the room and his eyes fastened on my dresser . The dresser is about waist-high and has a plate glass top that covers it completely . Ile examined the top of it very carefully and then pointed to one corner above where Kendall had been lying . " Yeah , you can see some blood there . " We looked and there was a little blood on the corner and what looked like a few bits of Kendall 's hair and skin . " This man Thayer drink much ? " " All the time . " Helga was very definite about that . " All the time he drink , drink , drink . He owe me for the rent . He go hungry , but he drink . " " Well , I guess that 's enough . " The policeman put away his pencil and notebook . " The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against that dresser glass and spilled the open bottle of Lysol on himself when he fell . " He e was very pleased with this bit of deducting . " But what was he doing carrying an open bottle of Lysol ? I keep it in the bathroom . " " Oh , so you admit it 's yours ? " I said I did . " How the  | hell should I know what he was doing with it . Maybe he was thirsty and wanted a drink . Some of the smoke these hums drink is n't much better . " " Ile was n't a bum . " I do n't know why I felt called upon to defend what good name Kendall may have had left . " Okay , what do you call it ? " " He was an actor . " " An actor , huh ? What 's the difference ? " I let that one pass . " How did he get in my room , then ? " " You left the door open . The cleaning woman left the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never did , " said Helga indignantly . " There , you see ? " " Look , Mac . What are you trying to make out of this , a murder ? The guy ai n't even dead . They took him to St. Vincent 's on 11th . I 'm just trying to get enough dope for a routine report . Why do n't you go ask him how he got in your room ? " He opened the door . Some of the crowd was still hanging around out in the hall . " Okay , break it up . All over , just a little accident . Break it up . " He went on downstairs . Helga followed him . A couple of the people in the hall wanted to come in my room and hear all about it , but I told them I was sick and shut the door in their faces . I was sick , too . For a minute I thought of going around to St. Vincent 's and seeing Kendall and getting it all straightened out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . The best thing to do would be to run down during the lunch break tomorrow . He 'd be awake then and feeling a lot better and maybe I would too . I mopped up the blood on the floor . The bedspread also had blood on it . I put that in the laundry bag . I even wiped off the dresser corner where he had hit his head , then I undressed and got in bed , but I did n't sleep very well .  | All night long I kept waking up , hearing Kendall screaming , " My eyes . . . . Oh God , my eyes . " And I could see them , white in the red sockets , staring out at me in the dark .  | 15 MY STORY created quite a little sensation at rehearsal at the Lyceum next morning . Mr. Frobisher was late and the rest of the cast was gathered around me and I am sorry to say I was making a big thing of it . " I remember Thayer in the old silents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . He was always a prince and Priscilla Barnes was the gypsy , or he was the gypsy and she was the princess . What a pity ! Do you suppose he 'll be blind ? If any of that stuff got in his eyes I do n't see how he can help it . Poor darling . " Paul Showers had even worked with him in a picture . " It was years ago , I was just a kid extra , but I 'll never forget his insisting on music . Of course those were the days when you could do that sort of thing . He always had a string quartet to get him in the mood . " I had n't realized that poor old Kendall had been quite such a success as he had insisted on telling everyone . Mr. Frobisher came on the stage . " Oh , Frobie , " said Miss Randall . " Sorry , I 'm late , people . " He took off his coat . " Had to O.K. some furniture . " " Frobie , you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were telling about last night that made such a scene at that funeral ? " " Certainly , I 'll never forget it . One of the most disgusting performances I 've seen in some time . "  | " Well , he tried to commit suicide or something in Tim 's apartment last night . " It was strange having that two-by-four cheese box at the Casbah referred to as an apartment . " Is n't that pathetic ! I remember him so well in the silents . " Mr. Frobisher turned to me . " What is she talking about ? " " It 's true , only the police do n't think it was attempted suicide . " " Oh ? " " They think it was just an accident . " " Oh , darling , you did n't tell me you have had the police in and everything . " I thought Miss Randall ' s excitement at that idea was a little ghoulish . " Did they give you a third degree ? " " No . Just asked the usual questions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at noon to see how he is . " Maggie , who had n't opened her mouth all during my monologue about Kendall , said slowly , I ca n't quite see what he would be doing in your room with a bottle of Lysol in the first place . " " That 's what I told the police . " " You must remember he was very drunk at the funeral , " said Mr. Frobisher . " He was undoubtedly still drunk and did n't know what he was doing . " Greg , the stage manager , handed Mr. Frobisher his script and he became very businesslike . " I 'm sorry , children , but we 've got work to do . . . Not even a week before Wilmington , and that third act needs a great deal of polishing . Shall we get started ? And , Tim , when you see Thayer , find out if there is anything I can do . " We took our places for the opening of the third act . " Ready ? " " Curtain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last act now and it was just a question of smoothing-out-business and pointing up . Maggie and I had nothing to do with the plot , and if I  | had been rewriting this show I would have cut us out quicker than a wink . I had told this to Maggie and she said for me to keep my mouth shut and not go around putting peas in people 's ears , whatever that meant . As far as I could see , I simply mixed and poured cocktails and laughed a lot . Maggie , who was supposed to be my wife , had just come down to the country house which explains why I was in a dinner jacket and she was in an afternoon dress . Frobisher had suggested movements a couple of times and the author had changed a word here or there but , aside from that , I was on my own . The same with Maggie . I was worried about it at first because our five days were n't up . But Maggie said not to worry ; that she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a good sign . The author who usually is hell on wheels was an exception to the rule . He was a big radio writer and this show was just a luxury to him . . . time off from the soap operas . He did n't spend much time in the theatre , being vital at the radio studios to see that the housewives got their vicarious thrills in evenly mounting doses . I meant to get to work on him and maybe he could fix it so I could get a couple of shots in his radio stuff , but he was n't around very much and did n't seem particularly interested in me when he was . What progress there was , Maggie seemed to be making . He thought she was very funny , and when she was n't sitting with me they were giggling off in a corner . That did n't make me feel any better , either . In the first place she did n't need the job and in the second place , why did n't he stick to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie insisted on coming with me to St. Vincent 's , which surprised me . " You 'll probably miss your lunch . " " So will you , but we can send out for sandwiches . Besides , I want to see the poor old thing . "  | " Why this sudden interest ? Thought we were only supposed to think happy thoughts until after opening night ? " " Never mind . just say I 've always had a yen to do the Lady With The Lamp . " " Are you sure you do n't want to ask our author along ? He might get some peachy material ? " " Oh , do n't be silly . So that 's what 's been eating you recently ? " " Nothing 's been eating me recently . " St. Vincent 's Hospital was cold and uncomfortable looking from the outside . Even the women 's jail a couple of blocks east is much fancier . A few nurses and doctors were just coming back from coffee at the corner drug store when we arrived . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception desk what I wanted . " Is Mr. Thayer a relative of yours ? " she asked sharply . " Visiting hours are from 1:30 to 2:30 only . " I told her he was n't a relative but a friend , and if I could n't see Mr. Thayer could I see the doctor that attended him ? I did n't have much time . She looked through some card index and made a phone call and told us to wait in the reception room and she would see what she could do . We went in and sat down . There were a few other people in there with us , and Maggie and I spent ten minutes speculating in hushed tones just which of the men were expectant fathers and which of the women were expectant mothers . We decided all the , men looked expectant and none of the women . Presently the woman that had been behind the desk appeared in the door with a doctor and pointed us out to him . He came over and shook hands . He was thin in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect to find in doctors . . . that 's the patients ' characteristic . The cloud of disinfectant that radiated from him reminded me of last night , and I could feel my stomach winding up . We told him  | what we were there for and he led us to a bare little room just behind the reception desk . " Are you Mr. Briscoe , Mr. Timothy Briscoe ? " he asked . His voice was dry and quick . He probably had n't had enough sleep . " The patient was asking for you . " " How is he ? " " Oh , he died this morning . " He need n't have been quite so off-hand about it as though he were trying to show how tough he was . I do n't know what else he could have said , but it was his tone I objected to . " But how ? " I could n't believe it . " What from ? " " Acute alcoholism mostly . And then the shock helped . " " But it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Best thing , really . He was blinded , you know . . . that acid . " " Was he conscious at all ? " " Oh , yes , for a little . That 's how I remember your name . " Well , why did n't you notify me ? I could have been over here in ten minutes . " " In the first place , " he acted as though I was a child of three and not right bright at that , " he did n't think to give us your phone number and , in the second place , we do n't happen to have enough nurses and doctors around this place to go ringing door bells . " I wanted to pop him . Maggie put her hand on my arm . " Did he say anything else , doctor , aside from asking for Mr. Briscoe ? " " He may have , miss . " He did n't take the same tone with Maggie as he did with me . " We were pretty rushed last night in Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had to dope him up again . He was in pretty bad pain . " " Where is he now ? Could we see him ? " I was surprised at all this sudden interest on Maggie 's part .  | " No , they came and got him this morning . At least I think they did . You can check with the girl at the desk . I 'm sorry but I 've got to go now . It was n't so bad . . . he did n't know what had happened . I 'm surprised he lived as long as he did . " He hurried away . We asked at the desk and , after several more phone calls , the woman wrote down the name of an undertaker in Maplewood , N. J. , and also to name of a brother I did n't even know Kendall had , who lived there . We thanked the woman at the desk and left the hospital . " Well , that 's that , " I said . " Timmy , what did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " No , it 's back at the Casbah , " I said . I was puzzled by her question . " Why ? " " Oh nothing . " We walked on a little way . " Are you sure ? " she said suddenly . " Of course I 'm sure . Why would n't it be ? " " I was just wondering . When did you see it last ? " " Why , let me see . " I thought back . The last time I had actually seen it was when I put it in my breast pocket at her apartment . I told her that . " That was the last time I actually saw it . It must still be in my suit in the closet . What are you getting at ? Now do n't tell me you 're getting the bug ! Do you really think this has some connection with Nellie ? " I honestly had n't thought of any connection up until now , which was funny , because before I had thought everything was suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost one . " How long would it take to get to your place ? " " The Casbah ? Just a couple of minutes walk . Why ? " " I 'd like to see if the book is still there . We 've got time . It wo n't matter if we 're a few minutes late . They know we went down to the hospital , or at least that you did . " We did n't say anything while we walked the last two blocks to the Casbah . There did n't seem to be any-  | thing much to say and we needed our breath , for by the time we got there we were almost running . We pounded up the stairs . I was a little ahead of Maggie . My room still had that smell in it even though Helga had cleaned it thoroughly and had left the window open . I threw open the door of my closet and grabbed the gray suit . Maggie had come in by that time and she watched me as I tried the breast pocket first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the Youth and Beauty Book was gone .  | 16 WE STOOD looking at each other , my coat dragging on the floor . " I do n't suppose it could be any place else , could it ? " she said hopefully . " No . " I sat down on the bed and Maggie came and sat beside me . " I have n't worn this suit since then . " I got up and looked in the bottom of the closet but I knew it was n't any use . The book was gone . " Well , " said Maggie . " I 'm on your side now . Where do I sign up ? " " What made you change all of a sudden ? After all that pep talk about me ending up in Bloomingdale 's , this seems to me very sudden . " " It 's that Lysol . I wish I could have seen him , but if it was like you told me , it only means one thing . " " What 's that ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to blind him . " " Oh , God , I ca n't believe that ! The cop assumed it was an accident without any question . " " Have you ever taken a good look at a Lysol bottle ? " " Last night when I was trying to find out what you do . " " Well , it does n't have a very wide mouth , does it ? " " No . So what ? " " So just dropping it , if you fell down , would n't make it pour all over your face , especially your eyes . That 's  | where you said it was mostly , did n't you ? " " Maybe he knew something . " " Why did n't they kill him and be done with it ? Oh , darling , I 'm scared . " She put her head on my shoulder and , to my amazement , started to cry . That was n't like her . I do n't remember her ever having cried before . . . not really . Not the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted up her head . She pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket and started dabbing at her eyes . " Hey , wait a minute . Do n't go all weepy on me . What 's the matter ? " She blew her nose and stuffed my handkerchief in her purse . " Do n't you see , you damn fool ? This is your room . " " A poor thing but mine own . What of it ? " " Maybe that acid was n't meant for that old man at all . Maybe whoever did it thought he was pouring it on your eyes . " She started crying again . My stomach , which was just quieting down after the last whiff of Lysol , went into action again . It had never occurred to me that I might have been clawing at my white eyes on this same bed ; I clamped my eyes shut and put my hands over them . I could almost feel them burning . In a moment I realized how silly I was being . Maggie finished snuffling and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'd better get on back to rehearsal . It 's after one . " I suddenly wanted to get out of this room very badly . " Ready ? " " Is there anything else missing ? " I hurriedly looked in the closet , through the dresser drawers and on the table by the bed . Those and a couple of chairs were my furniture . " No , I do n't think so . At least I ca n't think of anything now . I did n't have time to go through old letters , but there could n't be anything in them that anyone would want . " " No compromising ones ? " Maggie tried to smile . Under  | the circumstances , it was a pretty good attempt . " Not a one . Only . . . " " Only what ? " " Nothing . Come on , let 's go . " Something was hanging around in the back of my mind waiting to be thought of , but it would n't come and we were already late for rehearsal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything until around Herald Square . I had been trying to think of what it was that kept scratching in the back of my brain , and Maggie had been thinking , too , and had come to a conclusion . " Timmy , you 're going to the police . Right after rehearsal . You 're going to see somebody and tell them the whole thing . It 's silly going on like this , and we 're not going to take any more chances . " I 'd thought of that , too . " But what 'll I tell them ? That we do n't think Nellie died of heart failure ? You do agree with me there , do n't you ? " " I 'm not so sure about that , but I do think there is something definitely off-color about this last little episode . " " But the police were the ones that said it was an accident . " " That was just the cop on the beat . They 're not supposed to know anything about things like that . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and rattle doorknobs . But we can look up the nearest precinct in the phone book and go see whoever is in charge . " " Oh , now you 're going with me ? Well , at least that 's some comfort , but I still do n't know what I 'll tell them or what you can expect them to do . They ca n't dig up Nellie . " " Never mind about Nellie . They must have pulled her apart when they had her and if there had been anything strange there , we would have heard about it . But this other thing  --  you 've got something to go on . There must  | be fingerprints and things like that . They 'll know what to do . " " I took care of all the fingerprints , I 'm afraid . I do n't even know where that bottle is now , unless Helga has it , and I wiped the top of my dresser off myself . There was blood on it . " " Well , how did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendall get in , for that matter ? " " The cop was of the opinion that I did n't lock my door , or that Helga left it open when she cleaned it . . . " All at once an idea hit me . " Jan , " I said . " Who 's Jan ? " " Helga 's little boy . He has some pixie friends . IIe knows where she keeps another pass key . Maybe he let Kendall in . He did me the other night when I 'd given my key to Kendall and he forgot to give it back . I 'll see him tonight . " " Take him over to the station with you . " " I 'm not sure that a five year old child is the best witness , but you 're right . I will . Right after rehearsal . " We pulled up in front of the stage door . There were some stage hands standing outside it on the sidewalk , and when we went in we realized that it was Saturday and the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that Mr. Frobisher had left word that the afternoon rehearsal would be at his apartment in case he had neglected to inform the cast , which he had us . We got another cab and beat it over to Sutton Place . With all this rushing about , Maggie was going to have spent all her first week 's salary on cabs alone .  | 17 AS WE WERE taking the elevator up to the apartment , Maggie said that maybe it would be better if we did n't mention all this business to the rest of the company . " There 's no point in getting them all excited . You know how actors are . They 'll want to make a big thing of it and then , if we 're wrong , we 'll feel pretty stupid . " When we got there the butler opened the door and it did n't matter that we were late . They were still on the second act . Frobisher looked up and nodded to us and motioned us to chairs at one end of the room . We sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minute break before starting the third act and everyone came over to us and wanted to know how Kendall was . When we told them he was dead , they were all duly sympathetic . " It 's probably just as well , " said Miss Randall very practically . " It would have been awful to keep on living blinded . " " Has somebody made arrangements for burial ? " said Mr. Frobisher . " I do n't imagine he had any money . " I told them that there was a brother who had taken care of all that already . " Why ever do you suppose he did it ? Did he leave a note ? " Maggie and I looked at each other . We had n't thought of that . I 'd look through his room as soon as I got back unless Helga had beaten me to it . " No , I do n't believe he did . It was just an accident .  | They said at the hospital that it was acute alcoholism as well as shock that did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's really awful , you know . " Paul Showers was looking a little pensive . " You 've no idea how famous he was . They still mention him at the studio . Pictures must have been a lot more fun in those days if you were on top . Now it 's like a factory . Theatre , too , for that matter . Look at this show . Does Louise here demand a string quartet ? " " Maybe it would help my performance if I did . How about it , Frobie ? Would you give it to me ? " She laughed at him . He smiled and shook his head . " And look at her clothes . " Paul was warming up to his subject . " A sweater and skirt with a bandana tied around her head . " Miss Randall certainly did n't look glamorous when she rehearsed . Her nearsighted eyes required thick glasses for reading , which did n't add anything . " Can you see Barbara LaMarr showing up on a set dressed like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara LaMarr ! Bobby LeB. ! Why had n't it occurred to me before ? Bobby was a nickname for Barbara as well as Robert or even Roberta , for that matter . I was one hell of a detective overlooking a thing like that . All at once I realized that the rest of the cast was staring at me . I must have been looking glassy-eyed while I was thinking about the name . Paul was saying , " Do n't you think so , Tim ? " I snapped out of it . " Do n't I think so what ? " " Do n't you think television will take the place of movies ? " I did n't remember how the conversation got around to television . Still , with actors , sooner or later it does , but it must have when I was in my little trance . I said I hoped it would , and then there 'd be more work for everybody than there was now when you could , and they almost did , do every radio show on the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we started the third  | act . It was n't until after we had been through my scene twice that they decided to keep on with the act and I got Maggie out on the terrace and told her about the possibility of Bobby LeB. being a girl . " I do n't see how you can tell the police much about that part of it , do you ? " Maggie said . " It would be a fine thing if you said , I think Nellie was killed by someone named Bobby LeB . Of course , she may be a man or he may be a woman but why do n't you arrest her if you can find out who he is . ' No , if I were you I 'd just stick to Kendall . " " Do you think I ought to mention Nellie 's book then ? If I have n't got it , it would seem pretty feeble asking them to believe that . " " I think you 'll do better if you just pretend that Nellie died the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm worried about and the sooner you get that straightened out the better I 'll feel . " " But suppose they do n't pay any attention and just think I 'm making up the whole thing ? What then ? " " We 'll worry about that when the time comes . " We might just as well have started worrying about it then because they did n't believe one word I told them .  | LIEUTENANT HEFFRAN of the 16th Precinct was very kind and oh , so patient , but it was easy to see that he wished we would stop bothering him with such nonsense and permit him to get back to the more important work of broken store windows and overparked cars . He was heavy and middle aged and had a face more like an automobile salesman than a detective . He kept rustling papers on his desk in the small bleak office the whole time I was talking to him and , occasionally , made notes on the margins . When he did look up at me during my spiel , his blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently he did n't smoke . . . no derby hats . . . and no attention . I finally got through and he sighed and pushed aside his papers and laid his pencil very deliberately on the desk exactly parallel to the sides . He gave it several little pushes to make sure that it was perfectly aligned before he spoke . " But , Mr. Briscoe , I do n't understand exactly what it is you want me to do . " " I want you to find out who poured that acid in Mr. Thayer 's face . That 's all . " " According to Johnstone 's report , and he 's always been a very reliable man , it was simply an accident . These things happen all the time . " " But they do n't happen all the time in my room . " I was getting mad again . I 'd had to work myself up with  | a good deal of prodding from Maggie to get up nerve enough to go to the police in the first place . I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wanted to this time , but when Maggie pointed out that perhaps that acid treatment had been meant for me , it put quite a different light on the situation . Lt. Heffran looked at a piece of paper again . It was , I suppose , Johnstone 's report . " It says that there is a possibility that the maid might have left the door open or you might have forgotten to lock it . " " But I tell you that 's impossible . I know it was locked and no one else could have gotten in , except . . . " I thought of Jan . I had meant to stop by and ask him , but Maggie would n't let me delay that long . She said that if I put it off one minute , I 'd never go to the police at all . " Except what , Mr. Briscoe ? " I had to tell him about Jan having let me in once before . " There you are , you see ? " He positively beamed . " In rooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half the time the same key will open all the doors . " Maggie spoke for the first time . " Then you mean , Lt. Heffran , that you refuse to do anything about it ? " " I do n't mean anything of the sort , dear lady , " he said with a sigh . " I simply do n't understand what it is that you want me to do . " " There must be fingerprints  --  things like that . " " I 'm afraid you overestimate the value of fingerprints in a case like this . Mr. Briscoe has told me himself that there were a great many people in the room and that it has been thoroughly cleaned . " I did n't remember telling him anything of the sort , but I must have . Anyway there was n't any use making an issue out of it because it was true . " Johnstone has already been back there today to make a routine check-up and there seemed to be no indication that he should change his original report . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been anything more than a simple accident , I would be glad to do anything I could . You keep saying that the acid was poured on his face deliberately , but at the same time you ca n't give me any reason for it because he was just a harmless old man , even though Johnstone in his report says that witnesses say he was a confirmed drunk . Johnstone 's theory is that Thayer tried to drink the acid and when he got some in his mouth and it started to burn , he jerked or fell back , hit his head on the dresser or whatever it was and fell down and-the rest of the acid spilled on his face . " And the way he said it , it sounded logical . Only I knew it was n't . " You have told me that he has been in your room before , several times , in fact , to use your telephone . " I guess I must have given him a very complete history , though I did n't remember it clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might suggest some other solution , that 's different . As it stands now there is nothing I can do . " " But something was taken from Mr. Briscoe 's room . A book , " Maggie said . I had n't mentioned the Youth and Beauty Book . We had agreed not to . But now I was glad she had . It might make him see . " A book ? What kind of a book ? Valuable ? " " No , " I said . " Not exactly valuable . Just a notebook . It was in my suit pocket hanging in the closet . " " Well , what was in it ? Anything of importance ? " " No . Just addresses of actors and producers . " To launch into our vague theories about Nellie against this wall of disinterest , just did n't seem worth while . He would n't believe them anyway . " You 're an actor , then , Mr. Briscoe ? " He said the word like it was spelled leper . ' I admitted I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre , too ? " Maggie said she was and even told him that we were rehearsing in a play at the moment . It was as if an asbestos fire curtain  | came down behind his eyes . To pin us down with the word actor ' seemed to satisfy him . " I see , " he said , and started gathering up the papers on his desk . " Well , I 'm afraid that 's all I can do for you . If I were you , I 'd ask the little boy with the key . Perhaps he has your book . Children often steal things and hide them . . . or perhaps you mislaid it . It might be a good idea to look over your room again . I 'm afraid there 's nothing more that I can do for you . Good day . " It was as if he had said , " Go roll your hoop somewhere else , Daddy 's busy . " And we were out in the hall . I do n't know exactly what I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at it from Lt. Heffran 's point of view , then , which I could n't because I was so angry , I might have understood his position a little better . But when , as a last resort , you go to the police , you want the same sort of miracle that used to happen when you went to your mother with a skinned knee . Though Lt. Heffran was scarcely the type who could kiss it and make it well . I 'd keyed myself up to expecting everything and had received absolutely nothing . Well , from here on in I was on my own . Three quick old-fashioneds in the Jumble Shop made us both feel considerably better . " I still think we should have told him about Nellie , " I said . " It 's a good thing you did n't or you 'd have been whisked off to Bellevue before you could say knife ' . " Maggie munched on a pineapple slice . " Did you notice the way he froze up when he found out we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just trying to get publicity like having a fake jewel robbery ? " " There seems to be only one thing to do , " I said . " Yes . Throw rocks at Lt. Heffran . I 'm all for it . " " I do n't mean that . "  | " Oh  --  no you do n't , " said Maggie . " That 's definitely out , do you hear ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Do n't try and pretend . You 're planning to keep right on snooping until you end up pushing up daisies like the other two . I know that look in your eye . You 've done all you can . You 've told the police . If they do n't choose to do anything about it , why , that 's just too bad . " " But someone has to do something about it . I know now I should have told him about Nellie . Without that , you ca n't blame him for treating us the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just ca n't let people get killed and let it go at that . Kendall was a friend of mine . " " That 's not true . He was just an old lush that happened to live in the same house , and that 's no reason now , just because he 's dead , that you have to make out like you were blood brothers and go about avenging him . Besides , what can you do ? " " I can find Bobby LeB. for one thing . " " And then what ? Will you just up to him and say , Pardon me , did you kill old Kendall Thayer by chance ? ' Whoever it is has got that damn book now which you should never have taken in the first place . That must have been what he wanted , so let it go at that . " " But I do n't see what was in that book that was so important . Even if Bobby LeB. did it , the book does n't prove he was there at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afraid of it , why did n't he take it when he could have so easily , instead of waiting till now ? " I thought this over a minute . " Unless he was in too much of a rush and forgot about it then . " " Tim . " Maggie put her finger tips on my lips to stop my talking . " Tim , let 's go to Mexico . " This startled me . " Mexico ? What for ? " " Right away . We can fly down tonight maybe or start out on a train . Let 's go to Mexico . "  | " You 're nuts . I ca n't go to Mexico or any place else and neither can you . We happen to be in a show , in case you have forgotten . " " We can leave . The five days are n't up . Anybody could do those parts . It would n't make the slightest bit of difference . Please , let 's go to Mexico . " " Why , you 're being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take you . " " Now , wait a minute . " " You 'll love it . We can stay in Mexico City for a while , then on to Cuernavaca and Taxco and Acapulco . You 'll look divine in one of those Acapulco diapers . And we can watch the boy dive off the rock at La Quebrada , and you can fish if you like , though I personally do n't care for it , and we can go to Caleta in the morning and Hornos in the afternoon . And get the most terrific tans . They have fresh coconut oil that you slather all over yourself , and you come out the most heavenly tobacco color in no time at all . " There was an urgent tone to her voice that puzzled me . She was n't drunk , at least not that drunk . " I do believe you 're serious . " " Of course I 'm serious . And if you 're thinking about the money , do n't give it another thought . It 's just illgotten gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to me . David has far more than is good for him , and it 's just some more he can take off his income tax , and , anyway , it would n't be so much , and if we got tired of Acapulco , we can hire a car and drive all over . . . maybe down south and see ruins or whatever it is you see down there . What do you say ? " " No , " I said . " Thank you very much I 'm sure , but No . What 's gotten into you all of a sudden ? " " Then you wo n't go ? " " I ca n't . You know that . This is the first decent job either of us has had for months and , although I know the parts are n't much , it 's in a first-rate production and  | you know it 'll run and it 's always easier to get a job when you already have one . Why do you want to leave it now ? Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement she had had in her face when she was doing the Burton Holmes faded and she looked old . Little lines that you generally do n't notice , pinched in the corners of her eyes . Her voice was flat . " It 's just that if you stay around here you 'll keep on snooping , and if you keep on snooping , you 'll find out something that somebody does n't want you to find out , and you 'll get acid thrown in your face . I 'm just scared . I 've got a feeling that everything will be awful if you stick around town , and I do n't want people throwing acid in your eyes . I like your eyes . I like them brown , not white . And it wo n't do any good you 're saying that you wo n't keep on snooping because you will , wo n't you ? " " Yes . " She just stared at me for a minute , then sighed . " I thought so . Well , do n't say I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with . Where do we start ? Where you snoop , there snoop I. " She took a mirror out of her purse and examined her face . Then dabbed at it with some powder and lipstick . " God , I look like an old bat ! No wonder you jilted my dishonorable proposition . I 'll have to go to Lizzie 's Monday and get another recap job . " I paid the check and we went out to the street . " What 's the first step ? " Maggie asked . " The first step is to get you a cab and send you on home . If I am so damned doomed , I 'm not going to have you messing about getting splashed , too . " " Oh , so now it 's chivalry ? Listen , dear , we 're in this thing together . Do n't forget my name was in that book , too . I 've got just as big a check after my name on somebody 's list as you have . Lead on  --  where first ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rehearsal in an hour . I suppose we ought to eat . . . we never seem to get around  | to it these days . But the first thing to do is see if Jan handed out that key to anyone . I ca n't wait for you to meet Jan 's little playmate , Nana . A charming girl six inches high and quite invisible . But just pretend you do n't notice she 's invisible , because Jan 's liable to be sensitive about it . "  | 19 WHEN we reached the Casbah there was a nineteen thirty-four Chevrolet with a New Jersey license plate parked out in front . Jan was n't in his usual place on the stairs , and Helga was n't in her room . And I did n't have any messages in my box . " You might as well wait in my room while I go flush Helga out , " I told Maggie . " She 's around somewhere . " We walked up the stairs to the third floor . The door to Kendall 's room was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked in and there was Helga helping a thin , grey little man stuff Kendall 's belongings into his huge wardrobe trunk . Helga asked me to come in and gave Maggie a sharp appraising look as she followed me . There was n't much room , with the trunk opened in the middle of the floor and the breakfast food and soap piled along the walls . " This here is poor Mr. Thayer 's brother come to get his things . This is Mr. Briscoe . " I held out my hand , but he ignored it and went on emptying the drawers of the bureau into the trunk . " I 'd like to tell you how sorry I am about your brother , Mr. Thayer . " He paused in his work and looked at me . His face was completely colorless . IIe still had his hat on but the bits of hair that showed were almost white . It was impossible to believe this drab little man was Kendall 's brother . His  | eyes were expressionless behind glittery gold rimmed glasses . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just squeezed the words through them like toothpaste . " My name is Slattery and so was his before he changed it . " He threw a handful of dirty socks in the trunk drawer , closed it and opened another one . " That name was n't good enough for him . He had to change it to Kendall Thayer when he got to be an actor . Amos Slattery was n't good enough for him . Well , it 's good enough for him now , " he said , viciously stuffing another handful of clothes into the trunk . " That 's the name that 's going to be on his grave , Amos Slattery . I hope he rests in peace , the son of a bitch . " " You should n't say that about your own brother . " Helga was horrified . " He was a good man . " " He was a no-good drunken bum . That 's what he was . Nothing but trouble since the day he was born . Do you think when he was making all that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save any ? He did not . Spent every damn cent on himself . No insurance . No nothing . Just a lot of crummy clothes and soap and breakfast food and look at these . . . " And he jerked one of the drawers open so violently that it fell out and scattered newspaper clippings and photographs in a messy heap on the floor . Some of them were yellowed around the edges and crumbled when they hit the floor . " Everyone of them telling what a great guy he was . How many bathrooms he had , all about his swimming pool . But who 's got to pay for burying him ? I have . Who 's been keeping him in liquor for the last ten years ? I have . . . And this is what I get . . . dirty clothes and newspaper clippings . He should have poured that acid in him long ago instead of spending all my money for whiskey . " He jabbed the last of the clothes in the trunk and slammed the drawer . He picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upside down and a few more clippings floated to the floor . Then he grabbed some of the soap cartons and filled the drawer  | and put it back in the trunk . I helped him close it . " There , I guess that 's all . " He looked at Helga . " Will you have this expressed to me ? " He wrote the address on a piece of paper and handed it to Helga . " When is the ceremony , Mr. Slattery ? " I said . " Kendall was a friend of mine . I 'd like to be there . " " There is n't going to be any ceremony . " " What do you want me to do with all this food and soap and these paper clippings ? " asked Helga . " Burn them . Throw them away . I do n't care . Send the trunk collect . " Without even nodding goodbye , he rushed out of the room . I could hear him walking down the stairs . None of us said anything till he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam . " Whew ! " said Maggie . " Nice fellow . So full of brotherly love . " " He should n't talk that way about his own brother , " said Helga , shaking her head . " No one should say that about his own brother . . . It 's not nice . " Maggie had picked up some of the spilled clippings and was looking through them . " That policeman come back this morning asking questions , " reported Helga . " He called him a bum , too . It 's not nice to talk that way about people , even if they are dead . " " What sort of questions , Helga ? " I asked . " If anyone heard anything strange . " " And did they ? " " No . Nothing . But it 's not nice to say things like that . He was a good man , Mr. Thayer , even if he did drink . He was a nice man . . . no bum like they say . " " I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maggie handed me a picture cut from Photoplay . It was Kendall standing in front of a huge Spanish house . The kind movie actors used to have  | before they started getting a broad A. He was in a white shirt opened at the neck and white flannel trousers . Even in the direct sunlight you could see how handsome he was . It was a shock when I remembered the Kendall I was used to . . . the cigarette bummer . . . the two buck borrower . . . it did n't seem possible that he had ever looked like that and lived in so fancy a house . She shuffled some more of them . Reviews of pictures and plays . All mention of him was carefully underlined in red pencil . All at once , that thought that had been waiting round to be thought hit me . Those clippings that Kendall had brought in for me to read ! I had n't seen them in my room . I had n't seen them or read them , but they had been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I didn't. remember seeing them there . Helga was starting to clean up the mess , and Maggie was still thumbing through the clippings . I ran back to my room , unlocked the door and looked on the dresser . The clippings were gone . I searched through all the drawers and even the waste basket , but there was no trace of them . I went back to Kendall 's room . " Helga , did you see some of those clippings on my dresser yesterday ? " " Ja . Just like these . " " What did you do with them ? " " I did n't do nothing with them . I leave them there . I do n't take things out of rooms . You know that , Mr. Briscoe . " " Well , maybe Jan did . Where is. he anyway ? " " Oh , no , Mr. Briscoe . Jan would n't do a thing like that . " " Well , he knows where you keep your pass key . He got it for me the other night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where do you keep the pass key ? " " On the shelf in the broom closet , but he does n't know . He 's too little to understand . "  | " Well , where is he ? I 'd like to ask him about the other night . " " I 'll call him , but I know he wo n't know nothing and he would n't do a thing like that . " She yelled out the door for him and , before the echo had died out in the maze of halls , Jan was standing in the doorway looking at us soberly with those incredible eyes . Before Helga could start in , I asked her to let me talk to him alone . I did n't doubt that he had heard everything we had said , and perhaps he would think his mother would punish him . Maggie and I led him to my room and I closed the door . We sat on the bed and Jan leaned against the dresser . His head just came to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it in my hand so Jan could see it . " Now , Jan , here 's a quarter for you if you 'll tell me something . " He held out his grimy hand . " No , first you must tell me something and then you can have it . " He did n't say anything , but just looked at me . " Did you come into my room yesterday and take something out of it ? " He still did n't say anything . " It 's all right if you did , Jan . I 'm not angry with you . I just want you to tell me if you did . " " No. " he said . " Gim me money . " I handed over the quarter . " Well , did you open the door for anyone ? You remember , like you did for me when I had forgotten my key . . . you know , with the secret key ? " He shook his head violently . " Wo n't tell . " " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Promised . " " Promised who , Jan ? Who did you promise not to tell ? " " The Phantom . " Maggie and I looked at each other . She shrugged . " You promised the Phantom you would n't tell you opened my door ? " He did n't say anything . " Did he give  | you money , too ? " Jan nodded . I pulled out a fifty-cent piece . This little third degree was getting expensive . " See this , Jan ? I 'll give you this if you 'll tell . That 's more than the Phantom gave you , was n't it ? " His face lit up at the sight of the money and he reached for it . I held it over his head the way you do a piece of meat for a puppy . " Not until you tell me . " " No , " he said stubbornly . And stuck his hands behind his back . " Nana says it 's all right . " Maggie brushed me out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nana this morning and she said for me to tell you to tell Mr. Briscoe all about the Phantom . " He turned his big eyes on her and opened them even wider . " She did ? " Maggie put her arm around his shoulder . " Honest ? " " Honest , " said Maggie . " So you see it 's all right . Nana would n't tell you it was all right unless it was , would she , Jan ? " He thought this over for a minute . " Last night , " he said finally . " You mean it was last night when the Phantom spoke to you ? " He bobbed his head . " What did the Phantom look like ? Was it a man like Mr. Briscoe or a girl phantom like me ? " He pointed to me . " So it was a man phantom ? What did he look like , Jan ? Did he tell you he was a phantom ? " Jan shook his head . I was getting impatient enough to bat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and tried to force a lover of children smile on my mouth . " Then how did you know he was the Phantom ? " " He had great big green eyes . Great big green eyes like this . " And Jan pushed up the corners of his eyes with his two dirty forefingers , the way you indicate oriental eyes .  | " Do you mean he was a Chinese , Jan ? You know what the Chinese look like , do n't you ? " " He was the Phantom . " Then suddenly it clicked . I 'd remembered Jan was a comic book addict and the Phantom in the comic books always had eyes like . . . exactly like harlequin glasses . I grabbed him by the shoulders and he started to cry . I had to give him the fifty cents before he would shut up and listen to me . " Had you ever seen him before ? " He shook his head . " Did he ask you to open my room specially , or just any room ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you can go . And thank you very much , Jan , and here 's another quarter . " I gave it to him and he ran out . Maggie and I just remained squatting on the floor for a minute after he left . Finally I helped her up . She sat on the bed and I sat down on one of the two chairs . We both knew what the other was thinking and it was n't very pleasant . " That was a neat bit about Nana . Whatever made you think of it ? " I did n't want to say what we were thinking . Not just yet . " Did n't you have imaginary playmates when you were little ? Most children do , particularly if they 're lonely . It must be the same one , must n't it ? " " Yes . Bertha 's pal . The one who did n't want to give her his autograph that morning . " " Do you think that 's enough proof for Lt. Heffran ? " " Just that Bertha did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little kid four years old says that he opened my door for a phantom ? I can hear him laughing now . " " You wo n't consider Mexico ? The offer still goes . " " Thanks , darling , but no . " " I did n't think you would ; I do n't suppose there 's much doubt in your mind either that the gent in the funny  | glasses is Bobby LeB. , is there ? " " Is there in yours ? " " Not very much , I 'm afraid . So it looks as though you 'll never be happy until you find him and get your acid ration . I still do n't see why he had to kill poor old Kendall just to get that book . " " Unless he meant to kill me . " That was a pleasant thought I always came back to and quickly tried to run away from . " But he did n't mean to kill him . Kendall must have recognized him . But even so , what difference would that make ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? " " Maybe he heard Bobby and thought it was me . . . . " " I. " " Okay . Then came in to see I. He 'd left me a note saying that he wanted to see I as soon as I got in . " " But why take the clippings too ? That seems very silly . If you want to take the trouble you can get notices of any show at the library . " " I ca n't understand that part of it either . There must have been something in them . We 'll have to do that . Go to the library and find them . We can do that tomorrow . " It took us thirty-five minutes to get to Sutton Place . The Saturday night traffic did n't seem to care about our rehearsal . Frobisher gave us a very annoyed look as we crept in and sat down in a corner . They had come to the third act and because we were n't there , had skipped the beginning of it and gone on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal and said they would take the act from the beginning . I apologized as best I could and told him about the traffic and he thawed out a little and finally , when the rehearsal ended at eleven , he was quite friendly again . Although it was going to take some time for Greg , the stage manager , to forgive me . They take those things very seriously . I was n't taking it any too lightly either because our five days were n't up  | yet and we could be fired without a cent if Frobisher felt like it . When we were leaving , I managed to be the last one out . Mr. Frobisher had come to the door to say goodbye . I was n't sure how he was going to feel about his less glamorous past being mentioned in front of the rest of the cast so had waited till I was more or less alone with him . " Mr. Frobisher , you were stage manager for one of the shows Thayer was in , were n't you ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my humble beginnings ? Yes , I was . Front Page Stuff , as a matter of fact . Why ? " " Did you ever know anybody connected with that show with a name like Bobby LeB . " He thought a moment . . . his forehead wrinkled . " No , I 'm sorry , but I do n't . It was a long time ago , you must remember , and there are a lot of people in musicals . Stage hands , musicians . . . there might well have been a Bobby LeB. , but I 'm afraid I do n't remember off hand . Why ? Is it very important ? Was he a friend of yours ? " " Not exactly . I have a message for him and , unfortunately , that 's all the name I know . You would n't have any idea how I could find him , would you ? " " No , I 'm afraid not . So much happens to the people in I a show in twelve or thirteen years . They give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . I 'm sorry I ca n't be more helpful . " We said good night . Rehearsal was n't till one o'clock on Sunday so Maggie and I decided to have a nightcap or two before going home . We dropped in " 21 " first , since we both now had jobs , and had a drink at the bar . The place was crowded and , as usual , it depressed me . Everyone seemed so damned successful . You could practically see the money ooze.  | Old light-of-my-life Ted Kent was there , to add to my depression , with Margo . She must have more money than I had thought . Otherwise I knew Ted would n't be sniffing around and that mink coat she had thrown around her tonight looked just as expensive as Maggie 's , a fact of which I am quite sure Maggie was not unconscious . Ted got Lord of the Manor and called us over to his table and for once I was almost glad to see him . I had a job and he did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theatre a job is a job is a job is a job . There was of course the pause while Ted kissed and darlinged Maggie and I gritted my teeth and , out of spite , I almost had a go at Margo but . could n't quite bring myself to it though she I must say seemed all primed . We all sat down and Ted could n't wait for the drinks to finish being ordered before he launched into newest juicy morsel of gossip he 'd unearthed . " Darlings , have you heard about Harry Bruno . . . you know the one that owns that dreadful theatre on Seventh Avenue . " This little darling had n't heard but this little darling knew that theatre quite well having served a very short time in two flops there . " Well , you know he simply ca n't afford to have a hit in that house , he owes so much money and he makes more out of flops . Believe me , he even goes to the out of town openings just to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre shortage he can get away with it . " " But Ted , I do n't understand , " said Margo . " What do you mean he ca n't afford to have a hit ? " Yes she was doing all right . . . she 'd learned how to straight for Ted . Yes , it would n't be long before Ted would be sending out little notes to the columnists saying , " Well-known stage and screen star Ted Kent is blazing with what recently Renovated eyeful ? " and signing someone else 's name . He 's done it before and he can do it again . " I should think every theatre owner would want a hit . " Lay it out for  | him sister . Give him the topper . " But do n't you see , darling . Every show has to pay for the theatre two weeks in advance and if it 's a flop and does n't run two weeks then Harry can keep the money and get another show in right away and that show has to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's awful , " said Margo . " Do n't you Tim ? " But Ted was n't going to let me get into his act . " Well , anyway , Ed Dell , you know , the critic , hates Larry 's guts and thought he 'd fix him but good . He knew Harry needed twelve thousand bucks right or he 'd lose the theatre and the only way he could get that much money in the time he had was to have three quick flops . Well , he got two all right and the third one was a stinker too , but Ed gave it a rave notice in his paper , thinking that would make it run long enough to put harry out of business and it would have , too . Only guess what Harry did ? " " What , Ted ? " said Margo breathlessly . " I ca n't imagine . " Here was my chance . " So Harry took the rave notice , " I said before Ted could stop me . " And went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of Ed 's rave notice and lived happily ever after . " Ted , I am glad to say , was livid . " I think after that , Tim , " said Maggie , " the least we can do is leave . " She got up and I helped her on with her coat . " Libby told me about their offering you that part in the Equity Library show , Margo , " I said . Ted was still sulking " I think you 'd have gotten more experience from that than understudying . " " Oh that was just Libby 's idea and even if I did want to act I 'm certainly not ready for Ibsen yet . Can you imagine me as Nora in A Doll 's House ? " " Libby said it was Rosalind in As You Like It . I should  | think you 'd be a good type for that . " " Oh , you know Libby , how vague she is . It was A Doll 's House and I 'm certainly not up to that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Ted . That was a feeble effort to get back at me . He knew it was more than a walk-on . " It 's shaping up . " He was n't going to get any change out of me . " When do you open ? " " Wilmington , Friday . " " I might run up and catch it if I can . I 've always liked Randall 's work , but I 'm surprised in her position she could n't make Frobie get someone better to play opposite her than Paul Showers . " Some one like Ted Kent , no doubt . I knew what the next line would be . It always is . " They offered it to me , but I could n't let Terry and Lawrence down . What 's Showers doing back here anyway ? Did n't they pick up his option ? " " Just slumming like the rest of us . " " Well , good luck . Carry your spear pretty . I 'll try and remember , but if 1 forget , consider yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do that little thing . " I bought back my coat and hat from the checkroom and we hit Fifty-second Street , but not soon enough . The fair Diana was just getting out of a taxi . I toyed with the idea of pretending I was one of the little Negro boy hitching post statues that decorated the front but it was too late . She had seen me . The look and nod I got were reserved exclusively for brass monkeys . Well , that 's done it . You 've had it , chum . It 's going to take a great deal of explaining to get back on her Christmas list . But what do you know ? Suddenly I realized I did n't care . To hell with that . I 'd jumped through Diana 's rather peculiar hoops for the last time . " What are you laughing about ? " asked Maggie while we were waiting for a cab .  | " I had n't realized I was laughing . " " Well you were . It sounded nice . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it . " Well , " said Maggie breathlessly . " You should do that more often too . "  | AS I started to climb the Casbah stairs , I remembered that I wanted to ask Ilelga to let me in Kendall 's room to see if he had anything there that might suggest why he got the acid facial  --  there was just a chance , not much of one , but I did n't want to overlook any bets . I knocked at Helga 's door and waited . Nothing happened so this time I pounded . After a moment she asked who was there and I told her and said it was important that I see her . I had to wait a couple of more minutes until she finally unlocked and opened the door just wide enough for her to slip out into the hall and closed it quickly after her . I did n't have to wonder why . She had a silk kimono clutched around her and as far as I could see nothing else . " What you want , Tim ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Helga , but it 's important . I want to look through Kendall 's room . " " It 's empty . All cleaned up . Everything . " So that was no good . " But Ilelga , did n't you find anything when you were cleaning it up ? Something that might give an idea about what he was doing that night . A magazine he was reading . . . or a paper ? " " Why you want to know ? " she asked suspiciously . " Because I want to find out how he was killed . " " Policeman said it was accident . " " I know he did , but I just want to find out how the  | accident happened . He was my friend , Helga . " She looked at me for a moment then did a quick flick around the door and almost immediately reappeared , still without letting me get a glimpse into her room . She handed me a piece of notepaper with some writing on it . " This was on the floor . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his brother . " I recognized Kendall 's florid handwriting . It was the beginning of a letter ; Friday Dear Bobby , " Can such things be and overcome us like a summer 's cloud without our special wonder ? " My wants are few and it will unquestionably be to your advantage to revive old memories . " Wilt thou at Ninny 's tomb meet me straightway ? " Say , three o'clock Monday . I was amused to see . . . . and it stopped there . I tried to keep my voice calm . " Let me have this for a couple of days , Helga . I 'll give it back . " " What you want it for ? You wo n't get me in trouble ? " " No . I promise . " Then I thought of something . " Helga , listen , this is important . Was there an envelope with this . Think carefully . " " No , that was all and I ought to send it to his brother . " " But , Helga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother does n't care a damn about him . You heard him . " " He should n't have said that about his own brother . He was no bum like he said . " " Of course he was n't . Thanks , Helga . " Before she could say anything else I ran up the stairs . I went into my room , locked the door and sat down on the bed . Three more readings of the letter did n't tell me anything new , but it was written to Bobby and in my little world there was only one Bobby I was interested  | in and I was positive this was written to that one , Bobby LeB . I did n't recognize the quotations , but then I would n't . There did n't seem to be much doubt that Ninny 's tomb referred to either Nellie 's office or the funeral parlor . Maybe Maggie would know . I phoned her and she 'd just gotten in . I told her about the letter . For some reason 1 almost whispered it over the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? Ninny 's tomb is from Midsummer Night 's Dream , " she said rather superciliously , I thought . " The Pyramus and Thisby scene . " " How in the world did you know that ? " " We did it at college and , I might add I was ravishing as Titania , but I do n't know the other quote . What do you suppose it means ? " " I hoped you 'd know . " " But are you sure this Bobby is the one we want . There are lots of Bobbys in the world , you know . " " Only one I 'm interested in . " " Well , take care of yourself , my darling . Sweet Shakespearean dreams . " " Maggie , have breakfast with me tomorrow morning ? " " But it 's Sunday . " " The Brevoort then . Ten o'clock . That 'll give us time to go by the library before rehearsal . " " The library ? " " Do n't you remember ? To look up the Front Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ten o'clock , Brevoort . " " Okay . Well good night . " " Good night . " I started to hang up . " Oh , say , Timmy . . . " " Yes ? " " If I were you , I 'd lock my window and put a chair under my door . "  | " Do n't worry about me , " I laughed . " I can take care of myself . Good night . " But feeling like a damn fool , I ( lid lock my window and I did put the chair under my door .  | OF COURSE it never occurred to either of us to telephone first to make sure , so we did n't find out till we got all the way up to the Public Library that the back newspaper file department is closed on Sunday . " A pretty how-do-you-do ! Now what ? " said Maggie . " Go back to the Brevoort and have me watch you stuff yourself some more ? " We were standing in front of the information desk feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking books out under their arms . Those departments were still functioning on Sunday  --  and there were books that had , at least , the casts of all the plays , if not the reviews . That might help some . Like those Burns Mantle Best Plays of things . Maggie had mentioned them only the other night . Maggie sighed and obediently followed me up to those caverns where you get books . After duly looking it up on index cards and filling out the little slip , we waited in another enormous room until our number flashed on the indicator and we were presented with Best Plays of 1934 . Seeing the titles of the best plays brought 1934 back with a rush . The theatre was all very glamorous then . I had seen all the plays listed as best , too . Dodsworth and Ah Wilderness and The Shining Hour and The Green Bay Tree and Mary of Scotland . I was afraid A Kiss Thrown In would seem pretty pallid by comparison .  | Sure enough , listed in the back was Front Page Stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendall was there and Nellie and then at the bottom where the " also among those present " were grouped together , one name came whirling up at me . Instead of calling it the chorus , the boys and girls in Front Page Stuff were classified " Headliners and Featurettes , " pretty fancy , that . There among the names of the six Headliners was the baby we 'd been looking for . The last five letters of a six letter word beginning with B. Robert LeBranch . I felt the library light up like a pin ball machine . " Now , at least we know his name , " I whispered to Maggie . " All we 've got to do is find him . Chorus Equity 'll be sure to know . Have you got a pencil ? " " What for ? " " I want to copy down the rest of the cast . " " Do n't be silly . I 'm a taxpayer , " said Maggie and she took the page and ripped it out of the book . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get going . If we 're late again we are both definitely out of a job . " She handed me the page . I furtively stuck it in my pocket . " Maggie , you should n't do that , " I said . " I always do . You wanted those names , did n't you ? Come on . " We left  --  I expecting any minute a guard would tap me on the shoulder and beckon me to follow him to some dim vault in the public library where they do awful things to people who tear pages out of Best Plays of 1934 . " You ca n't take books out of the reference room , can you ? " she said when we were safely through the turnstiles and out on the steps . I admitted you could n't . " Well then , we 're late now and would be a great deal later if you 'd written all that stuff out . Do n't make such a thing of it . " We beat it for the Lyceum . It did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill other people or throw acid in their face , but people did n't tear pages out of library books .  | The rehearsal seemed endless . We were having straight run-throughs now , but Greg insisted that we stand by the entire time which seemed rather pointless to me , but he said those were Mr. Frobisher 's orders , so I did n't quibble . During the first and second act I went out to the pay telephone in the hall and tried to find some of the Front Page Stuff cast in the phone book . A few of the principals were listed but I figured they 'd be the least likely to remember a member of a chorus 14 years ago . The principals speak only to themselves and sometimes not even that . The bit players ignore each other and try to talk to the principals , and no one ever speaks to the chorus except possibly the baritone or the comic who tries to make every one of the chorus girls before the show closes and , more often than not , succeeds , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible to his charms . On an off chance I even called Chorus Equity , but there was no answer . Only one of the Headliners and Featurettes was listed , which , considering it was 14 years ago that the show played , was not too surprising . The single exception was a Peter Peters who had a dance studio on West Twenty-third Street . The life span of a chorus boy or girl is comparatively short . The girls , I suppose , manage to marry someone and can leave off their girdles for good , but I never can figure out what happens to superannuated chorus boys as a rule . Mr. Peters apparently opened a ( lance studio . But the rest of them must get into a final Off-To-Buffalo and just keep going , or else get in the road company of the Student Prince . I dialed Mr. Peter Peters ' number and he miraculously not only answered the phone but was the same one that had been a Headliner . " Yeah , " said the soft rather high voice of Mr. Peters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You trying to collect dues for something ? You 're a little late , bud . " " No , " I said , " I 'm just trying to find someone else  | who was in it and you 're the only one I could find with a phone . " " My God , that was ages ago . Who you trying to find ? " " A Mr. Robert LeBranch . Do you remember him ? " There was a long pause . Finally . . . " What do you want him for ? " " I 'm from out of town and wanted to look him up . " " Who 'd you say this was calling ? " I gave him the name of my character in the show , Dan Kelley . " A friend of his , you say ? " I repeated that I was . " Sorry , fella . I do n't know . Have n't seen him since the show . " " Well , thanks anyway . " I started to hang up . " Wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him again . " Kelley , eh ? Hoofer ? " " No . Just a friend . " " What are you doing tonight ? Why do n't you drop around for a drink ? I can ask around . Might find out something for you . We could have a couple of laughs ? see some sights . " My quest for Mr. LeB. seemed to be widening my circle of acquaintances . " ' Thanks . I might do that . What time ? " " Any time . I 'll be here . You got the address in the book . I live in back of the studio . The later the better , it 'll give me time to ask around . " " Okay , I 'll do that . " " It 's a date . " " Yeah . See you later . Goodbye . " I hung up the receiver and turned to face Maggie 's amused look . " Get him ! " she said . " Got a date with a chorus boy , have you ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his slipper ? " " Oh , shut up . " " What did you find out about our mutual friend Mr. LeBranch ? " " He remembers him . Think I 'll drop over after rehearsal  | and see what he knows . I tell you what I wish you 'd do for me . " " I think he 'd rather you went alone . " " Never mind about him , but tomorrow morning I wish you 'd go to Chorus Equity and find out what you can there . " " I 've got a fitting at Ernie 's tomorrow morning . " " Well , do it before that . And while you 're at Ernie 's find out what else you can about that niece of Nellie 's . I still ca n't get over that . Maybe Ernie was lying . " " Okay , boss . If I 'm good can I have a drink out of the office bottle like a real private eye ? " " We 'd better get back on stage or there wo n't be any bottle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . We went back and rehearsed and sat around and ate and went to Frobisher 's apartment and sat around and rehearsed and then just sat around . Just as we were saying good night , Mr. Frobisher called us over and told us we could forget about the five-day clause . We were in ! I could have kissed him , and Maggie did . Up until that minute I had half expected Greg or Mr. Frobisher to give me the old line about " It has nothing to do with your performance , but the author feels you 're just a little too old for the part , I 'm sure you 'll understand , " and then you say that of course you understand perfectly and it 's quite all right and thank you so much , and you leave with your eyes tight and your mouth set in a death-like grin and you get somewhere alone just as fast as you can and get as drunk as you can afford . But evidently I had become a member of what the ads would call " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks salary . I had a few bubbles in my shoes and decided to skate on over to Twenty-third Street while I still had them . And to celebrate I stopped for a couple of drinks on the way .  | THE PETERS Studio was in a second floor loft over a store selling dress trimmings . The store windows glittered with sequins even in the feeble light of the street lamp . In a little entrance at the side of the trimming store was a pushbutton under a card saying Peters Dancing Studio . I pushed the button and waited . I felt I knew pretty much what to expect . You do n't hang around the theatre for over ten years without getting to know at least one chorus boy . I had imagined from his voice that Peters was going to be typical . But , whatever I was expecting , I was wrong . Peters opened the door and I thought , at first , I had made a mistake . He was a good looking , healthy , practically blue-shirt lead ; curly red hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an open-collared shirt . No rings . No bracelets . If I had n't known he had been in a show 14 years ago I would have guessed his age at about twenty-five . I must do more dancing , maybe I can knock a few years off me . The only thing that gave him away was his voice and his eyes  --  they were both a little too soft , and he had that trick of widening his blue eyes to punctuate his sentences . We shook hands and he said that he had n't expected me to drop in , really , and I said I had n't expected to , really . I followed him upstairs and through a big empty room with a huge mirror on one wall and a battered piano  | with a portable victrola on top of it against another . He lived in the rear of the studio and it was fixed up very comfortably . Long monk 's cloth curtains completely covered the high windows and a studio couch had a monk 's cloth slipcover . A folding screen partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modern , paint-it-yourself bookcases were filled with books and records and the white walls were plastered with photographs , the ever-present glossies , mostly of male dancers with a few of the more angular females of the Martha Graham school , and scattered wrestlers and prize fighters  --  popping their oiled muscles and puffing out their chests . There were also a couple of production flashes of different shows . I began to get hopeful when I saw those . Maybe Bobby LeB. was one of the toothy gents making that stock pose with the top hat , cane and modernistic background that dancers seem to love so . Peters was apparently getting more hopeful too and had broken out a bottle of good scotch . He went behind the screen and got ice and soda and came back with a couple of stiff ones . I sat in an armchair and he arranged himself on the studio couch . I noticed that my drink was about twice as dark as his . Evidently he was under the impression that we were in for a nice , long evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite amusing telling me about it . Most of his pupils were children and all doomed to go through life with their mothers convinced that they were better than Shirley Temple and Margaret O'Brien put together . It was , he admitted , quite a racket . You charge them a tidy sum for the lessons and twice a year you 'd give a recital and the little kiddies would have to sell so many tickets or they could n't be in it . Or , if they were , only as background . A specialty in a Peters recital came high in tickets . Besides that , they would have to buy costumes which was another rake-off for him . All in all , it was a very profitable  | business , but , of course , not very satisfying to the " inner longing , " if I knew what he meant . And I did . He was about to go more deeply into his inner longings when the phone rang . I studied the pictures on the wall while he answered it . I gathered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Peters , and Peters was just as determined that he should n't . " I tell you I wo n't have you coming up here . " He all but stamped his foot . I caught his eyes and he shrugged resignedly . " Yes . . . yes . . . later . . . . No , I tell you it 's simply out of the question , " and he slammed the receiver back on the cradle . " You 'd think people would know when they 're not wanted , would n't you ? " he said . " Mais non . Some people never learn . " He came back and sat down and I asked him about Bobby . It turned out that Peters had n't known him too well . They 'd dressed in the same dressing room with the rest of the Headliners in Front Page Stuff , but he did n't see much of him outside the theatre . " Bobby was more the social type . " Peters said with a double-header widening of those blue eyes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a lousy dancer really . How well did you know him ? " There was a sidewinding look with that one . " Oh , I never knew him at all , really . He 's just a friend of a friend back home that asked me to look him up . " " And where is back home , Mr. Briscoe ? " " Indiana , " I said . I do n't know why . " Evansville , Indiana . I 've never even seen Bobby , you know , and I 'm curious to know what he looks like . Is one of those him ? " I nodded to the wall . Peters got up from the couch and took one picture down and handed it to me . " That 's the Headliners . Of course we were just called that in the show . We were n't a standard act . " He rested his hand on my shoulder as he sat on the arm of my chair and with his other hand he pointed out the third  | man from the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby LeB . His face had about as much expression as one of those animated dolls that hold up placards in cheap store windows . The kind of doll where the eyebrows swivel up and down and the head turns back and forth . The smile was just as frozen and the hair just as painted , black and straight ; the face perfectly smooth , eyebrows sharply arched , but , then , the picture had been taken in stage make-up . You could see the black line around the eyes and the carefully bowed mouths . The Headliners were all about the same height , all dressed in evening clothes and standing one in front of the other with the left leg pointed forward and the left hand holding the elbow of the man in front . The right hand was waving a top hat . Just the usual corny dancer picture . I did n't know whether I would be able to tell that face again if I saw it or not . It might have changed a great deal and with all the goo you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you any idea how I could go about finding him ? " I asked when I had finished looking at the picture . " No . I 'm sorry but I ca n't imagine where you could look . " " Evansville is going to be terribly disappointed . Well , thanks for the drink . I 've got to be going . " I started to get up , but his arm very gently held me back in the chair . " Going ? Going where ? " " I 've got to get an early start in the morning back to Evansville . " I shook his arm off and got up . He did n't try and stop me this time . I did n't particularly want to get on the muscle about it so I pretended I had n't noticed . I put on my coat and hat which I had thrown on a chair when I came in . " But you ca n't go now . I mean , I thought we might make the rounds . I know some amusing places . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to get gay now . "  | " Some other time , " I said . " I 'm tired . I had a busy day . Thanks for the drink . Good night . " He did n't bother to see me to the door so I walked through the studio and let myself out and walked down the stairs and on out to Twenty-third Street . It was n't till I walked half a block that I realized that I had n't been so smart after all . I could n't be sure , but thinking back , I seemed to remember he had called me " Mr. Briscoe " and I had told him my name was " Kelley . " Another thing , the cast in the Burns Mantle collection had listed six names for the Headliners and that picture Peters had shown me had eight little smiling faces all in a row . I could have gone back and knocked his ears off , but that would n't do any particular good except make me feel better . I could n't understand why he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then asked me up . Why that ? If he wanted to lie about it But there 's a lot of things I do n't understand about that little bunch and I gave Mr. Peters up as a bad job . I could see the neon light of an open all night one-arm joint a block west so I went in and had some fried eggs and coffee . The coffee was bad and the eggs had been around much too long and it made me sick to my stomach . I left in a rush and the fresh air and sudden misty rain felt so good , I decided to walk up to the Twenty-eighth Street subway station . I could n't face right away that subway smell and those little piles of wet sawdust the cleaning people plant now and dig later . It says somewhere that there are about eight million people in New York , but you 'd never guess it tonight . At two-thirty , Ninth Avenue was as empty as Twentythird Street had been . About Twenty-sixth Street , I began to get dizzy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs must have been older than I thought . I stopped walking and , in a little alley-way , leaned up against the side of a  | building . I pressed my forehead against the stone and the coolness helped for a moment , but then my mouth started filling with saliva and I simply stood there  --  waiting to be sick . I did n't hear footsteps behind me . I did n't hear anything . I just leaned against the wall with my neck wide open for a rabbit-punch  --  and it came . My forehead ground against the rough stone as I slid down the wall to my knees and keeled over on my back . I choked and vomited . Something kicked me a couple of times in the ribs and I spewed again . I tried to get up , but a hand like a brick slapped against my face and I fell back . There was water in the alley . I could feel the coldness soaking through my clothes . I lay there gasping for breath . My eyes would n't focus ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concious of a couple of looming shapes standing over me silhouetted against a patch of glow between building walls . One of the shapes presently kicked me in the groin . Red searing pain exploded in me and I doubled up , grabbing myself . There was a sharp click and in the dimness I thought I could make out the glitter of a knife blade . I went through all the business of yelling but I could n't be sure any sound came out of my throat at all . One of the shapes had a voice . It said softly , " Hold it , someone 's coming . " A foot crashed on the back of my hands and I was out for the count .  | 23 LIFE saver , " a voice kept saying . " Life Saver . " I tried to open my eyes . The voice kept repeating , " Life Saver . " I wiped my eyes . . . they felt crusty and when I opened them I still could n't see anything . Somebody said " Life Saver " again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back in a puddle . I groped around with my hand . It got wet cement . I tried to move and pain made me stop . I gritted my teeth and forced myself to roll over and struggle to my knees . Then I tried to stand . 1 could do it by inching up the building wall , but when I got to my feet the effort made me lean against the building for a minute or two . I was panting and weak , but my legs held . I took a deep breath . It hurt , but not as if there were ribs broken . I felt of my body . It was wet and covered with slime , but it would still function . To feel for my hat I had to bend over and the rush of blood to my neck almost made me keel over . I had to stand up again until the pounding stopped . " Here 's your hat , mister , " said a voice and my hat was slapped on the top of my head . Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall blindly waiting for it to happen . I had thought I was alone . . . a hit and run . . . but they had come back . I waited for the knife . I was too weak to do anything to stop it . I started to cry . " Come on , " said a man 's voice . " He 's okay now . We ca n't stand around here all night . "  | " But Joey , he 's hurt . " It was the same voice that had given me my hat and it was a woman 's voice . " We got to take him somewhere . " " He 's just a drunk , I tell you . Come on . He 'll be all right . " The tears must have rinsed out my eyes enough , for , at last , I could see a man and woman backed by the faint light from the street , standing in front of me . He took her arm and tried to lead her back to the sidewalk . She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him standing here like this . He 's hurt , Joey . He 's hurt bad . " She moved toward inc . I did n't mean to , but unconciously I scraped along the wall away from her . She stretched out her hand . " For Christ 's sake , do n't touch him . He stinks . You 'll get it all over you . " " Go on if you want to , you jerk , he 's hurt . I 'm not going to leave him here like this . " She stepped closer to me . I did n't back away this time . " What happened to you , mister ? Were they trying to roll you ? We heard them running up the alley . " I managed a feeble croak . " Know who they were ? " " No . I could n't see them . " Still bracing myself against the building , I patted my pocket . My billfold was still there . My watch was still on my wrist . I began to be conscious of the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter . " You coming or are n't you ? " said the man . She ignored him . " Can you walk ? " I tried a couple of steps and almost pitched on my face . She took my arm . " Grab his other arm . We got to find a cop . " The man was carrying a small case like musicians use for trumpets . He changed it to his other hand and felt for a dry place on my arm . Between the two of them I made the street . Ninth Avenue was still deserted . No taxis . No cops . No nothing . " If I could just get a cab , " I said .  | " Fat chance this time of night in this part of town , " said the man . " There 's a subway station a few blocks up , " I said . " I 'm sorry to bother you . I think I can make it okay now , thanks . " " We 're going to find a cop , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right in a couple of minutes . Thanks just the same . " " Well , then , come on . You heard him , " said the man . " You heard him say he 's okay . " " We ca n't leave him like this . They may come back . " I had n't thought of that . Just then I stumbled and the man caught me from falling . He swore under his breath when he grabbed me and I could n't blame him . I was covered with filth . " Look , you people go on . " I was starting to get all swimmy again and I did n't want to vomit in front of them . " I 'll be all right . There 'll be a cab along in a few minutes or a cop or something . " " Well , " said the woman . " If you 're sure . . . . " Footsteps were coming around the corner . " Maybe this is a cop . " But it was n't the reassuring gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman called to him as he was walking towards us . " Say , mister . Have you seen a cop around anywhere ? " " What 's the trouble ? " I started to fade again . It was like the blackout in London where you could n't see anyones ' faces . . . just blurry shapes . We had been talking in that hushed voice you use in blackouts even though guns are slamming a few blocks over . Or maybe it was just the way I was feeling that made the voices seem hushed and far away , like a radio with a bum tube . . . one minute loud and the next so faint you could hardly hear anything . " This drunk just got mugged up the street in an alley , " said my savior with the trumpet case . " We was passing  | by and musta scared them off . You do n't know where there 's a hack stand around here , do you ? " " No . Can he talk ? " " I 'm all right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could just sit down for a couple of minutes I 'd be all right . There 'll be a patrol car or something along in a few minutes . You go on . " " Well , you ca n't sit here , " said the woman . " Why do n't he go to a Turkish bath ? " said the last man . " Sober him up . " " Well , for Christ 's sake let 's get him somewhere , " said the man with the horn angrily . " We ca n't stand around all night ya-ta-taing . Do you know where one is near here ? " " Yeah , not far . I 'll take him . I 'm going that way . " " Is that okay with you ? " the woman asked me . Okay ? It sounded like heaven . Hot water . A place to lie down . I told them so . " Where is it ? " asked the woman ? " Three up and one over . " " That 's right on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to , " said the man . " I can take him okay . " " Give me your horn , Joey , and help him . " And Joey did . I do n't remember much of the three up and one over except that we did n't pass one cab or patrol car or I would have done that instead . But I could n't be sure because I was too busy concentrating on not passing out so they would n't have to carry me completely . As it was we had to stop every little while to give them a rest and the musician got madder and madder . At last I could see a lighted sign up the street . Not neon . Just a bare bulb in front of a painted sign . That was Mecca . That was the Bluebird we 'd been looking for . That was , when we got up to it , the Regal Baths  --  Open  | All Night . " Well , " said the woman . " You 'll be okay now . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I almost started crying again when I thanked the woman and musician . I tried to pay them something but they would n't have it . I could n't say any of the things I felt and of all the things I could have said , the lousy , Limey cliche " It was damn white of you , " was about the stupidest , because when I finally got a look at the faces of my two good Samaritans in the bleak light from the Regal Bath sign , they were as black as the ace of spades . They went on up the street melting into the darkness , and the third Samaritan helped me into the Regal Baths . Inside the front doors , there was a counter on the left with an arched opening in the wire netting that ran from the top of the counter to the ceiling . Hanging behind it was a green-shaded drop light . The circle of light fell on stacks of wire baskets , towels and a man tilted back in a chair in the corner absorbed in of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment what he could find in that breathless magazine to interest him so . He did n't seem quite the type to soak his elbows in halves of lemons , not in his dirty pair of white ducks , T-shirt , grubby sneakers and no socks . But I should have guessed . Just a refined taste in pin-ups . The whole time I stood there he did n't stop staring at a particularly pneumatic underwear ad . Everything in the place , the walls , the counter , the price list for : Baths , Massages , Sleeping Accom. wired to the fencing , even to the man with the magazine , had a 1 film of moisture . Beads of water were forming on the low ceiling and splattering to the linoleum floor in regular pats . The air was warm and humid and was a mixture of familiar smells . . . sweat and soap and alcohol and liniment . I leaned against the counter watching the man staring at the magazine and wondered what to do .  | There was a pay phone on the wall by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could I tell them ? As far as I could tell no bones had been broken and nothing stolen . I could call a cab , but by the time it came and I got back to the Casbah it would be almost five o'clock . Right now all I wanted in life was to lie down and sleep for awhile and not have to make any effort or decisions . I needed a bath and my clothes cleaned but most of all I needed sleep . I pounded on the counter . The T-shirt sat up and his chair fell on its front legs . He peered at me . I had n't seen my face but from his expression it must have been something . " Jeeze , buddy . What hit you ? " He did n't get up . Just stared at me . " I had an accident . What about a room ? " " You look bad , buddy . You ought to see the doe . " " I 'm all right . Have you got a room or not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping his place in the magazine with a spongy-looking finger . He was n't very tall . The overhead light threw shadows under his eyes and nose and emphasized his thinning hair . " What 'd you say ? I 'm kind of hard of hearing . " I shouted my question at him twice before he got it . " Yeah . No room though . Beds . Dormitory-type , see . " " I need a shower too , and can you do something about my clothes ? " " How long you gon na sleep ? " I figured if I slept till nine I 'd have time to get back to the Casbah and change before rehearsal . I told him I wanted a call at nine . " Okay . I can get ' em fixed up pretty good at the Greek 's next door in the morning . " I sneezed . " Can I get a rubdown now ? " " No rubber at night . In the morning . Eight o'clock . Just leave your stuff out back . I 'll pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cake of soap and slapped them down on the counter . He pointed to a door at the end of the  | hall . " Through there . " I took the soap and towel and started for the door . Then I remembered my Samaritan friend . I 'd been so busy with my own problems that I 'd completely forgotten about him . Fine thing . When people go to all that trouble and you just stand there with your back to them and do n't even thank them . " Did you see where my friend went ? " I asked the basket man . I had to shout that a couple of times too . " I did n't see nobody , Buddy . You come in alone . " " But he helped me in here . He was standing right there . You must have seen him . " " Hit the showers , Buddy . You 're getting those little men and that 's bad . " I suppose I should have chased my friend clown the street to thank him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people are just nicer than other people . He did n't wait to be thanked . Now me , if I should so much as give my seat to a lady in the subway , I 'd half expect to be remembered in her will , but this guy practically carries me , God knows how far . . . gets himself all dirty from my puke and then does n't even wait to be thanked . Yes , I guess some people are just nicer than other people . I took my soap and towel and went through the door at the end of the hall clown another narrow hall and door and into a fair sized room . On the opposite side was a swinging half door going into a shower room . Next to it was a steam room sprouting hissing pipes . The pane of glass in the middle of the door was clouded over . Another opening led to the room with the beds , dormitory-type , see . More green-shaded drop lights hung over a couple of rubbing tables and the worn greasy leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once been white was against the wall between the rubbing tables . The walls and ceiling were sheeted with elaborately embossed metal and had been painted white , but at all the corners and  | nail heads , rust had bled through and mottled the white with orange . A few wooden arm chairs , benches , and white tables did the rest of the furnishings . On one of the long benches outside the dormitory , two naked men were putting on their shoes . I sagged into the nearest chair and sat there , too tired to begin getting undressed . Just staring at the floor . Through the soft hissing of the pipes I heard a faint tinkle and for some reason it reminded me of the army . For a moment I half thought I was back in the army . . . in a hospital waiting to see the doctor . . . everything was going to be all right . . . I 'd be put in a warm bed and sleep and sleep and nurses would be nice to me and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dark red bathrobe at the foot of my bed . . . and there was that tinkle that started all this . . . and it was coming from the direction of the two men . I rolled my head around and looked at them . After I got my eyes focused I could see that they were both fairly young with fish-white skins except for the faces , necks and hands , which were sunburned , leaving a sharp dividing line at the throat and wrists . The bigger one who also looked older had a reddish appendectomy scar like a monstrous centipede crawling towards his crotch . There was also a tiny light flickering on his chest and that was what was making the familiar tinkle . He was wearing a soldier 's dogtags . As he bent over to fasten his shoes the dogtags would jingle and flash . The metal necklace shone too . I remembered when they made us change from the cloth tape and plastic necklaces they used to issue to the metal kind . Right after the Cocoanut Grove fire . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies mixed up . How would they have identified me if I 'd been killed in the alley ? That was a stupid thought . . . I still had my billfold . In Normandie we 'd cut slices out of corrugated German gas mask tubes for binding around the edges of the dogtags so the tinkle would n't give  | you away on patrol . . . No need for that any more . . . they had both finished putting on their shoes and were stamping about . . . combat boots . . . so big your legs always looked puny in them . . . they were both soldiers then . . . why is it that soldiers always put their shoes on first ? Now they were putting on underwear . . . olive drab . . . do they still issue olive drab ? . . . no need for camouflage now . . . do n't they know the war 's over . As they lifted their pants out of the little wire baskets the one with the dogtags noticed me and called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . . . the warmth . . . the not lying dead in an alley . " Hey , Mac . Got the time ? " I did n't have the energy to answer . He walked over to me buttoning his fly . Then he saw my face . " What hit you , Mac ? " He could n't be more than twenty . " Accident , " I mumbled . " You can say that again , Mac . Hey , Lou , get a load of this guy . " Lou came over struggling into his shirt . He whistled when he got a close-up too . Then he laughed . " You ought a see the other guy , huh , Mac ? " " Yeah . " I tried to smile but my face was too puffed and sore . " What time did you say it was ? " I held out my wrist and they looked at my watch . " Four-fifteen . Hey Lou , get the lead out . That bus leaves in half an hour . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the condition of my face . " How 'd you do it , Mac ? Fight ? " " Sort of . " " Where ? " Before I could answer him a hulk of a man appeared at his side and shouldered him out of the way . I could n't see his face , but his huge sloping shoulders seemed to be bursting out of a white underwear shirt . The light behind him through patches of fur formed an aura around his arms and shoulders that made him look  | even bigger . He had on soiled ducks and sneakers like the basket man . Lou glared at him , but the sheer massiveness of the guy quickly overcame any ideas Lou may have had of taking a poke at him for shouldering him out of the way . Lou went back to his dressing grumbling . The rubber picked me up like a dummy and propped me against the wall and started to take off my clothes . He was evidently used to drunks , which he must have assumed I was , because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these fixed up by morning , " I said as he threw my clothes in a chair . He pulled off my shoes and socks as if I were a baby and then kicked a pair of wooden clogs out from under a bench and jerked his head at the showers . I slipped on the clogs , picked up the soap and towel and scuffled across the room to the showers . He followed me . His rubber soles made no noise on the linoleum . The shower room had a row of small individual shower stalls and one big stall for the hose . Standing under the rushing hot water felt wonderful . The rubber stood outside watching me , apparently to see that I did n't fall over . I examined as much of my body as I could see . There was n't a mirror around . As far as I could make out , it did n't look as bad as I had expected . Bruises were starting . My face stung a little , but not too much , and there did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring water soaking in the heat until my fingers started to shrivel . When I came out drying myself the soldiers were still dressing . The rubber took a sheet from the cabinet and spread it on the table , then sat on a corner of it with his tree-trunk arms folded , waiting for me . The light was on his face . He 'd have to have been a third-rate prize fighter for a good many years to get a face as cut up as that . One of his ears , the nearest to the light , had a cauliflower tinge . His nose was pushed in and there was a white line running from it to the top of his lips where  | it had once been split . It twisted his mouth like a hare lip . He was , all in all , about as tough a looking customer as I have ever seen . His puffy eyes stared at my face . I must look very bad , I thought . As I came over he got up from the table and I stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I 'm not feeling so good . " He did n't say anything put poured some oil on my back and started rubbing . He knew his job and the long heavy strokes of those hands pushed away the soreness . I tried to think about what had happened , but the strokes began to get monotonous and I started to drift off . A slap on the buttock brought me back and indicated that I was to turn over . I turned over and closed my eyes again . He 'd finished with my chest and stomach and arms and legs and was standing at the head of the table working on my neck . That was still the sorest from the rabbit punch . For some reason I began to think about Life Savers . . . . That struck me as a funny thing to be thinking about and I wondered why I should have thought of that . Then I remembered vaguely that I had wakened myself up in the alley saying it over and over again . The rubber 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fingers probing into the soreness , gently , for such an ox . My head was pressed into his stomach as he would pull my neck towards him . The oil he was using reminded me of football and basketball games when I was in school . It was cool . . . a nice smell , a relaxing smell . . . back and forth went his hands on my neck . I felt myself dozing off again . . . almost purring . . . the smell reminded me of something else too . Something I could n't quite remember with the smooth rhythm of his fingers on my neck . It was the smell of something else too . . . something like , . . . Life Savers . . . and suddenly my eyes flew open . Upside down over me was the rubber 's face . . . his puffy slits of eyes fixed on mine . . . watching them . I 'd waked  | up mumbling " Life Saver " after being slammed in the face with a hand . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savers . The fingers on my neck were no longer soothing . I was concious of them now as part of a hand , a hand that could be like a brick . The eyes were still staring down at me . I could see the hairs in his nose and the long , healed cuts over his eyes . I was n't sleepy any more . I began to get panicky . If this was the same guy ! Lying stark naked on a slab with him fingering my neck was as good a time as any to get panicky . I sat up and swung around till my feet were touching the floor . He made no effort to stop me , but he kept one huge hand on my shoulder . Maybe it was my imagination but it looked as though the packs of muscles in his shoulders were getting ready for something . He just stood there and looked at me . The cracks of eyes glittered . " Okay , I feel better now . That 'll be all . I 'll be going . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't give and I could n't budge . " You got alcohol coming . " Those were the first words he he had spoken . It might have been the same voice that said , " Hold it . Someone 's coming . " I could n't be sure . All I could be sure of was that I wanted to get the hell out of this place now . The room seemed even hotter and the glistening walls felt as though they were moving nearer . It was an effort to breathe . Sweat started running from my armpits down the side of my body . " Never mind the alcohol , " I said . " I 'm going . " He took a step towards me . I could n't hear his feet on the floor . He just moved next to me . Panic started squirting up in my throat . I fought it back . I was n't alone in an alley , this time . . . what was I being so chicken about ? The two soldiers . . . dressing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three against one . . . that was enough for even Jo-Jo , the dog-faced boy . God bless the  | army . Uncle Tim needs you . . . Of course ! But Jo-Jo was one thought ahead of me . My yell did n't even get a good start around the paw that was slapped over my mouth and before I knew what was happening I was flipped neatly over on my stomach and both my wrists clamped in one of his hands behind my back and being forced up towards the back of my head . I tried ' to bite the hand over my mouth but my teeth slipped on the grease . I tried thrashing from side to side , but he pinned me down the rest of the way with his chest . One of the soldiers must have heard part of my yell or saw me kicking my feet , the only part of me still free . " What 's eatin ' ya , Mac ? " he called over . The stupid sonof-a-bitch . Why did n't he come over and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the rubber . His mouth was next to my ear and I knew now . It was the voice of my good Samaritan who had suggested the Turkish bath in the first place . The soldiers thought his remark was very , very funny . Just to make sure I could n't attract their attention again the rubber pinched my nose together with his thumb and forefinger till I could n't even kick any more . The soldiers must have finished dressing . Even through the pounding in my ears I could hear them call good night to the rubber and me and stomp out . Only the rubber could answer . When a door slammed , he unpinched my nose and let me breathe again . In the distance I could hear the sound of a cash register and then a muffled door slam and then . . . quiet . . . except for the hissing of pipes and my struggle for breath . Still holding my arms behind my back and his hand over my mouth the rubber straightened up . He made a noise like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Good for you . Sober you up . " He jerked me to my feet . I tried to kick him , but I slipped on the wet floor . He jolted me upright with a knee in my back . Slowly he pushed me towards the  | steam room . I tried hooking my leg around a table but he yanked me loose . He kicked open the door to the steam room and threw me in . I bounced on a wall and crashed on a bench . He slammed the door . I rushed at it but he had locked it and was standing with his back covering the window . I tried to grab one of the benches , but it was bolted to the floor . I hammered on the door . It was so hot when I touched it I could feel my skin burn . I tried kicking but my bare feet would n't budge it . I yelled and the back disappeared from the door glass . 1 groped around the walls frantically searching for something I could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand was caught in a loop of chain which swung my arm against a scalding pipe . I tugged my arm away and the chain broke and something tinkled to the floor . The familiar tinkle of dogtags . They were at least something . Maybe I could pry the lock with them . I fumbled around on the floor for them but they had fallen into a mass of steam pipes and I only burned myself more before I had to give up trying to find them . All at once I noticed that there was more steam and the room was getting hotter . The hissing which had been faint at first , got louder and louder . I could no longer see the square light in the door . Almost boiling water started leaking out on the floor from somewhere and I had to keep jumping from one foot to the other . I pounded on the door again and screamed , but the steam got in my lungs and I ended up in a croak . I could n't even sit on a bench . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands again trying to find a cut-off switch to the steam inlet , none of ' the knobs I found would turn . So this was how it was going to happen to me . . . this was the one that had my name on it .. . and it would n't even be my name when they found me . . . but the name on the dog tags I could n't find in the pipes . I crouched by the door on all fours holding my head as near the floor as I could get  | it , the heat came lower and lower . The steam was like molten steel clogging up my nose . . . sliding down my throat . I crouched gasping for breath . . . waiting . . . waiting until the cloud of steam would swallow me completely .  | SOMEONE was slapping my face . I did n't want to open my eyes . I did n't want to face what was going to happen next . " Hey , Mac , " said a voice , " hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping got harder . I opened my eyes . A soldier was slapping my face . It was the one with the dog tags . " He 's coming out of it now . " The face of Lou , the other soldier , bent down over me . " You want to be careful , Mac , " he said . " You could have been hurt bad . " " A damn fool thing to do , " said the first soldier . " You ought n't to fall asleep in a steam room . It ai n't healthy . " " He tried to kill me , " I said . " Who tried to kill you , Mac ? " " That rubber . He locked me in that room . He tried to kill me . " " Look , Mac , you was n't locked in no room . The door was n't locked . Was it , Lou ? " " Hell , no . The guy 's screwy . " I tried to sit up and fell back down again . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back on the rubbing slab . I looked at the door to the steam room . It was wide open and clouds of steam were billowing out . " Come on , Lou , " said the first soldier . " Mac 's okay now . We got ten minutes to catch that bus . " " You okay , Mac ? "  | " For Christ 's sake , " I said , " I tell you he tried to kill me . " " Aw , he 's still goosey , " said Lou . " Come on . " He started for the door . " Wait a minute , " said the first one , " this crap about someone trying to kill you , that on the level ? " " I 'm trying to tell you . That rubber tried to kill me in an alley and then he locked me in the steam room . " " I told you he was screwy , " said Lou . " Come on . If we miss that bus we 're AWOL . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep it off . " I looked around the room . It was empty except for the three of us . " Where 's the rubber that was here , " I asked . " How the hell should we know ? Lou here forgot his dogtags . He left ' em in the steam room and we come back for ' em . . . and the door was n't locked either . " He started for the door too . " Lou 's right . You better try and sleep it off . . . but not in a steam room . Come on . Lou . " " Wait a minute , " I yelled . " Do n't leave me here alone . Help me out to the street . " " Look , Mac , " said the first soldier . " We got ten minutes to make the bus back to camp . We do n't know nothing about you . If you say someone tried to kill you . . . okay someone tried to kill you , but we 're getting back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake just help me get out to the street , wo n't you ? That 's all I want , I can get a cop there and prove it to you . " " We ai n't got time to prove anything . If you want we should help you out to the street . . . come on . So we 'll hold your hand out to the street but we ai n't got all day . " " Aw , leave him alone . . . he 's nuts I tell you . . . " said my pal Lou . " Naw . . . we 'll get you out to the street if that 's all you want  --  two seconds to get into your clothes or you  | go out bare ass . " I did n't argue . I ran across the room and got in my clothes that were still bundled on the chair . I did n't bother with socks or underwear or shirt . The soldiers watched me throwing on my clothes . " You got it bad , Mac . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on my head and grabbed up the rest of my clothes while I was still putting on my coat which was stiff as a board . They dragged me through the hall and as we flew past the counter the basket man yelled something after us but we did n't wait to find out what it was . The fresh air was wonderful . Lou threw my clothes at me and they both started running down the street . " So long , Mac , " Lou called back . " Be a good little boy and lay off the stuff . " " Wait a minute , " I yelled after them . " I 'll get a cop and prove it to you . " " Some other time , Mac . " And they ran around the corner . I tore after them for a couple of blocks but had to give it up . I was mad . I wanted to brain the soldiers . I wanted to brain the rubber . I wanted to hit somebody . . I was the maddest I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad enough to make me go back into the Regal Baths by myself . I set off to find a cop . We 'd get this thing settled once and for all . . . I thought . I eventually flagged a patrol car over on Eighth and told the cops my story . They did agree to come back with me , but they would n't let me soil the sacred precincts of their shiny patrol car , I had to hang on the outside while we drove back . We pulled up in front of the Regal Baths and one of the cops got out . " So you think some guy tried to lock you in a steam room after he beat you up in an alley . The same guy , huh ? " It was heaven just to look at that uniform . . . the pretty shining buttons . . . the beautiful badge . . . the  | city 's finest . . . . As far as I was concerned he did n't have a face . . . just that wonderful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were witnesses too . " He wearily pulled out a notebook . " Okay . What are their names ? " The first , fine flush of reassurance began to fade . Where had I played this game before . . . at the Casbah after I 'd found Kendall in my room . . . in Lt. Heffran 's office . . . always they want names . . . and always I do n't know them . " I  --  I do n't know their names . " " Oh . Well , where can we get in touch with them ? " Where could we ? " I do n't know that either . " " Say , what 's going on here ? " " There were two colored people . . . " I said hurriedly . " A man and woman . . . he was a musician I think , and then there were two soldiers . . . one of them was named Lou and the other one had a big scar on his stomach . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the book away disgustedly . " Well , come on . Let 's see about the rubber guy . " We entered the Regal Baths and we 'd no sooner got through the doors than the basket man rushed up to us and started in . " Where did you catch him , officer ? I was just calling the station . " " So you were just calling the station , were you ? " said the cop with a suspicious look at me . " And why were you doing that ? " For some reason the basket man did n't seem hard of hearing now . He answered the first time . " This punk tried to run off without paying . He tried to run out on me . " " Oh , he did . Well , we 'll get around to that later . Tell the rubber to come out here . " " What rubber ? " said the basket man . " This man says your rubber tried to cook him in the  | steam room . " " He 's nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him that when he first come in and asked for a room . That 's a buck and a half he owes me for the bed and shower . " " Come on back and I 'll show you , " I said to the cop . But even while we were going down the hall I knew it was no use . The room was empty . We looked in the shower stalls and the room with the beds , dormitory-type see , even the toilets . There were a couple of padlocked clothes lockers where the basket man said the rubber that works only days , like I said , kept his stuff , but there was no rubber . " I told you he was nuts , " said the basket man . " He come in drunk as a skunk and wants a bed and shower and rub . I tell him no rubber so he settles for a bed and shower and then tries to run out on me . Ask him if that ai n't so . That I told him we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the cop . What was the use ? I said it was . " Okay , get it up . A buck and a half he says . " " So now I got to pay for almost getting killed ? " " Wise guy , eh . " The cop started to look mean . " You got a fat lip , son . Maybe you 'd like to go down to the station . " " Never mind . I 'll pay . " I handed over the money . " No charge for the steam ? " " Still punchy , " said the basket man . I started to go . There was n't much else I could do . " Wait a minute , " said the basket man . " Now that you 're paid up honest , I 'll give you these you dropped back there . " He handed me a pair of Harlequin glasses .  | 25 I WENT out into the street still staring at the glasses the basket man had put in my hand . The cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I got away from the Regal Baths as fast as I could . . . walking in the middle of the street this time . So Bobby LeBranch had been there , too . He must have been in the alley with Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy . It had probably been Bobby 's voice that had whispered " Hold it . Someone 's coming . " It was all so simple now . The phone call at Peters the Dancing Boy 's . " No , I tell you . You ca n't come up here . " He probably did n't want to get nasty old blood all over his nice monk 's cloth slipcovers . The mickey in the scotch . Jo-Jo and Bobby waiting outside Peters ' since he was too finicky to let them take care of me in his apartment . Then following me till I got sick in the alley and almost finishing me then and there if it had n't been for the musician and his girl . But Bobby was no fool . He just sent Jo-Jo around the corner after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samaritan and be so helpful and suggest the dreamiest little Turkish bath he knew of . One of the tourists had n't discovered yet . . . . He had n't left the Baths at all while I was talking to the basket man . . . just slipped into the back and put on his working clothes . Maybe he worked there during the day , or , at least had at one time . And what a really groovy way to take care of me . . . asleep at the switch in a  | steam room . . . who can prove anything ? The motherly care with which he had washed me off first . . . always wash it before you cook it . . . it 's a wonder he did n't put an apple in my mouth . And the sadistic delights of the rubdown . . . the way you tickle a lobster to make him relax just before you pop him in the boiling water . . . and then calling in his pal Bobby through the back door to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably shuddering with such delicious delight that he never even knew his glasses had fallen off . . . this was even an improvement over Dachau . What a pity the soldier forgot his dogtags . . . they had to beat it out the backdoor before the final exquisite spasm . But it did n't matter . . . there was always tomorrow . . . or the day after . . . and there was n't a goddamned thing I could do about it . I 'd been beaten up , almost roasted alive and only some blisters , bruises and scratches to show for it . Lt. Heffran would give me the same brush-off this time . . . just like this last cop . No proof . . . you admit you had been drinking ? How can you be sure you were n't just imagining the whole thing . Soldiers , you say ? Well , who are they ? What are their names ? Oh , one is named Lou and the other has a scar on his belly ? Well , is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but still no names . And then running out without paying your bill . Tsk , tsk , now was that a nice thing to do . I have hear a report from Officer Pushface . . . good man , Officer Pushface . . . here there would be a pause for business of fingering reports . IIe says you were drunk and almost disorderly . . . I 'm afraid , Mr. Briscoe , you were just imagining the whole thing . Now why do n't you go away for a nice long trip somewhere and leave me the hell alone ? At the moment I was so tired and frustrated and mad that I would have been glad to believe the whole thing was just imagination . . . D.T's. . . . anything . But it  | was n't . I knew it was n't . But why ? That 's what I did n't get . Evidently I knew something a lot of people did n't want me to know , or , at least , they just thought I did . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just say , " It 's all a mistake , boys . Honestly , fellas , I do n't know a damn thing . " Because in the first place I did n't know who to say it to and you ca n't go around being careful if you do n't even know who you have to be careful of . The smart thing to do would be to get out of town before it was too late . But I had a job , for the first time in months and I was damned if I was going to run from something now . Particularly , when I did n't even know what it was . I took a cab to the Casbah , showered and shaved as well as I could around the scratches . I put mercurochrome on the cuts and Band-aids on top of that and my face looked like a camouflage net for snowy terrain . I knew how to treat the blisters on my hands and feet , so I was n't worried about them , but what the hell was Frobisher going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly since he 'd come right out and told us that the only reason Maggie and I were in the show was to look pretty , and scabs and Band-aids do n't do anything for you . I wondered for a moment if he could fire me . This was no act of God . . . this was an act of that bastard Bobby . And to get fired on top of everything that had happened to me last night would be the last straw . But what happened to me last night was n't going to happen to me again . . . not if I could help it . I had n't done so well with my bare hands , so from here on in I was going to have a gun , Mr. Sullivan 's law notwithstanding . Mr. S. had been conspicuously absent last night when I could have used him so he could take his little law and knew what he could do with it . My German pistol , which was almost standard equip-  | ment for every G I veteran of the E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of my closet . Bobbie must have found the Youth and Beauty Book that time before he got as far as looking in my shoes . There was still too much oil in the barrel and it would never have passed an inspection , but there was n't time to do anything about that now . It would shoot . The clip was still loaded and the click as I shoved it into place was mighty comforting . I always figured I 'd hock it when I got completely broke , but never quite did . The S.S. Major who owned it originally and I had played a very interesting scene in which the pistol was an important prop , and I was kind of proud of my performance . I got dressed and wrapped the pistol in a handkerchief and put it in my breast pocket . It pulled my coat down on the right side , though by experimenting in the mirror I found that if I kept my hand in the right pants pocket , it was n't so noticeable . Well , that seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to myself now nice it was there was nobody around to say , " This is it ! " an expression that always made me want to retch . But I must admit that as I went down the steps and out into the street it was what I was thinking . I did n't even stop for breakfast at Riker 's . I was taking no chances today . The last time I had had coffee and eggs some very unpleasant things happened soon after . Let 's face it . . . I was scared . Every man on the street was a potential Bobby and he would n't even be wearing his fancy glasses now to help identify him . I had them hidden behind the baseboard at the Casbah . While I waited for the subway I hugged the walls of the station . I stayed on the local . It was too easy to get pushed accidentally on purpose in front of a subway train . You think about those things after someone you do n't know deliberately tries to kill you .  | I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the walk up from Times Square to be shouldered into a waiting black sedan and whisked away for the final chase , and I sighed with relief when the Lyceum stage door came into view . Almost the entire company was standing around on the sidewalk getting a few final gulps of fresh air before rehearsal on the dusty stage . I pulled my hat ' down farther over my face and tried to make the stage door before anyone noticed me , but it did n't work . Showers grabbed my arm and pulled me back on the sidewalk . " Can such things be ? " he declaimed , hamming it up with gestures . " And overcome us like a summer 's cloud without our special wonder . " I tried to shake him off , but then Miss Randall joined in . " I pray you speak not . He grows worse and worse , " which was no lie . I was getting mad . " Question enrages him . At once good night . Stand not upon your going , but go at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could recognize the quotation now . Banquo 's ghost scene from Macbeth . It had been in Kendall 's unfinished letter to Bobby , but I did n't have time to think about it now , I was too busy trying to dream up a plausible story . I could n't tell them the truth . . . why should they believe me any more than the cops ? And even if they did , I 'd probably get fired . Mr. Frobisher certainly would n't want valuable rehearsals interrupted with someone trying to kill one of his bit players all the time . The show must go on ! As it was , Mr. Frobisher was about as frantic as he could get with the story I did whip up . Lord knows what he would have done with the truth , probably busted a gut . I made up a story about stumbling down some stairs and scratching myself on a plaster wall and a few doors that happened to be around . The whoops of laughter this brought from the rest of the cast did n't make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't there  | yet because she would undoubtedly shut them up by telling them the whole thing . . . or as much as she knew and I did n't want that . . . not yet . Mr. Frobisher kept cross-examining me . Wanted to know where the stairs were . . . exactly how it had happened . . . had I seen a doctor ? I must be careful the cuts did n't get infected . Those things can be dangerous . He was telling me ! I told him I had put the stuff on myself but he would have none of it . " You go see my doctor now . " He was n't asking  --  he was telling . " We 're starting with the first act so you 'll have time . I do n't want you to take a chance , Tim . . . I know what can happen . " He got an odd look in his eye and I knew what he was remembering so I asked him for the address and started to go . Just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was old Square-Mouth , Margo . She had certainly taken me at my word . Libby had made me promise to introduce Margo to Mr. Frobisher when I was definitely set and Margo was holding me to it . All that business about her wanting to act being Libby 's idea was a lot of whoop-de-doo . Even though judging by Frobisher 's fatherly interest in my scratches I was in pretty solid , I still did n't want to annoy him with women getting over divorces by going into the theatre . But there did n't seem to be any way out of it . I had promised . " Mr. Frobisher , " I said . " I 'm terribly sorry to bother you , but a friend of mine would like to see you about an understudy job . " And before he had a chance to refuse I called Margo over . She was just finishing paying off the cab and at least had the good grace to pretend she was surprised to see me there . She came over very reluctantly but she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bennington look today and as far as type went she was n't too much of an impossibility to understudy Miss Randall after all . But Mr. Frobisher was n't buying any .  | " I 'm sorry , Mr. Briscoe , but I do n't make it a practice to interview people on street corners . " He turned on his heel and stalked through the stage door . Two minutes ago I was Tim and must n't take a chance getting my little cuts infected and now I was Mr. Briscoe and I could drop dead . That 's what happens when you try to help someone . " Whew , " I whistled after he 'd gone . " I 'm sorry , Margo , but I tried . " " It does n't matter . " But I could tell that it did . No woman likes to be cut dead on the street . " I had no business imposing on you this way . It was all Libby 's idea really . Thanks for trying anyway . But what happened to you . Were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you all about it sometime , but I 've got an appointment right now . So long . " " Perhaps I can drop you off . " " No thanks , Margo , I 'd rather walk . " " Okay , well thanks again . " She started for the cab still standing at the curb . I remembered something I had meant to do . " Just a minute , Margo . " I reached into my pocket and pulled out a five dollar bill and walked over and put it in her hand . She looked down at it in surprise . " What 's this for ? " " The theatre tickets the other night . " " Oh . . . but . .. " " Now do n't argue . " " But I do n't understand what this is all about . " " I 'm not sure I do myself . " Greg Moulton , the stage manager , had just come out the stage door to herd the rest of the cast in . Well , since I 'd started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the job . Besides , who was Frobisher to get so high and mighty ? He 'd been nothing but a stage manager himself not so many years ago . " Greg , would you mind coming here a minute ? " He  | came over . " I 'd like you to meet Margo Shaw . I think she might be a good bet for understudy , I wish you 'd introduce her to Frobisher . " Greg looked her over . " Well , you might fit the clothes at that , Miss Shaw , but you understand with a star like Miss Randall there 's not much chance of your going on even if she does get sick . " " She understands all that , but you know Frobisher always has understudies , star or no star . The least you can do is let him decide . " " Well , why do n't you come back in about an hour , Miss Shaw , and I 'll introduce you to him during one of the breaks . Okay ? " " That 's terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little amused . I guess she could afford to be a little amused about getting a seventy-five buck a week job . . . if she could wear a coat like that one . " But I do n't think . . . " " Nuts , " I said . " What can you lose ? Go have lunch and be back at two . It 's all set . " I opened the door to the cab and there was Maggie sitting in the back . She 'd evidently been there the whole time watching me be noble . She got out and Margo got in and drove off . " What 's the idea of sitting in that cab all this time spying on me ? " " Oh Timmie , I was n't spying on you . I was waiting for all those people to go away so you could tell me what happened . Darling , who hurt you . . . was it Bobby . . . did he try to kill you ? . . . Oh , Timmie , we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . we 'll go to the police . . . " Now calm down , Maggie . It was just an accident . I 'm perfectly all right . Just a few scratches . . . " " But how did it happen ? You 're lying to me . They tried to kill you . " " I 'm not lying and nobody tried to kill me . Stop being  | so hysterical . " What was the use of upsetting her ? It would n't do any good . There was n't anything she could do about it now . So I told her approximately the same story I told the rest of the cast . She , at least , did n't laugh . But I 'm not sure she believed me although she pretended to . " Then you 're really all right ? " I assured her I was . " Well , that 's good but do n't ever scare me again like that . Oh Timmie . . . wait till you see my dress . It is absolutely out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope it is n't too good or Miss Randall will never let me wear it . And Ernie made the most marvelous little hat to match . . . . " " Never mind about your dress , did you go to Chorus Equity ? " " I 'm sorry , Timmie , but I 'm afraid I overslept . " " Then you did n't go ? " " In a word , no . " " Then you 've got time to do it now . " " But what about rehearsal , we 're late already . " " Frobisher sent me to the doctor 's and they are starting with the first act so it will be at least an hour and do n't forget I offered you a drink out of the office bottle when you did it . " " Okay chief , but you 're a hard man . Maybe I 'll try and get a job at Chorus Equity . You 'll be sorry when I 'm dancing in a louche dive in South America . " " See if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it after today . " Frobisher 's doctor had his office in Radio City and Frobisher 's name got me right in without an appointment . While the doe was cleaning out my scratches Frobisher even called up to check on my condition . With at least a hundred thousand dollars already invested in the play I could understand why he would want to make sure that my part as a walking cocktail shaker was n't going to look  | like a class in first aid . The doc reassured him that I would look reasonably human in a couple of days but I did n't feel that his final tape job was much of an improvement over mine . I was about a hundred yards from the Lyceum when I saw him . Just seeing my dog-faced pal , Jo-Jo , again was like a kick in the stomach . I ducked into the doorway of a Mexican restaurant and watched him through the angle of the window glass . He stood for a moment looking up and down the street . Even at that distance he looked big . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scared . Even with a gun I was scared . Jo-Jo slowly lit a cigarette , then packed those huge hands in his pockets and shuffled off toward Broadway . I transferred the pistol to my coat pocket and started to follow him . I did n't know what I was going to do if I did catch up to him and when I got to Broadway I was almost relieved that I lost him in the crowd . What was he doing in the Lyceum ? Had he come back to finish the job he 'd started on me last night ? God , if he was being that open about it . . . if he was that set on killing me . . . he 'd be back in a little while to try again . . . and maybe better luck next time . . . and I knew there would be a next time . . . and a next time after that until he did it . . . or I did it . Bobby was playing for keeps . No picking up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . I was sick at myself for being glad that Jo-Jo had disappeared in the crowd . I 'd had my chance . . . even a gun . I could have forced him to go with me to Lt. Heffran . . . or I could have even shot him in the back . This was no time to be concerned about ethics . But now I 'd have to wait until he came at me again . At his convenience . . . and he would choose the place  --  and there are an awful lot of choice places in New York . Alleys , subways , rooming houses , Turkish baths . . . even backstage in theatres .  | . . . All my life I 've been avoiding them , but now it looked as though Mr. Milquetoast was going to have to make a choice . . . either just wait for it to happen where or when Bobby wanted . . . or go out and look for it and make it happen . And when I thought this over on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a choice after all . The decision was just about made for me . Maggie was waiting in the hall . " What did the doctor say , Tim ? Are you going to live ? " " At least the scratches wo n't kill me , if that 's what you mean . " Of course that 's what I mean . What did you think I meant ? " " It does n't matter , Maggie . I was just trying to be funny . " " Well , I do n't like you being funny like that . " She looked my face over very carefully . " Are you sure you 're all right ? You look sort of odd . " " I 'm okay . Maggie how long have you been standing here in the hall ? " " About ten minutes . Why ? " " Did you see someone go out just now ? A big guy ? " " Looked like an ape ? " " That 's the one . " " Yes . Friend of yours ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just left . Maybe you can still catch him . " " Thank you , no . " " Well , he 'll probably come back , " said Maggie . " Yes , " I said , " he probably will . What did you find out at Chorus Equity ? " " Oh , Timmie . What a place . It reminded me of Polly Adler 's in all its glory . " " How do you know what Polly Adler 's looks like ? " " Do n't be so literal . Besides I have gentlemen friends .  | Anyway they would n't tell me if they had a Bobby LeBranch in their files because I did n't have sense enough to tell them I was doing bumps in some musical , so I got one of the cuties out in the hall by the elevator to go in . It really is the most amazing place . You 've never seen such people . Imagine having the energy to paste on false eyelashes at this hour in the morning . Does pink hair send you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you find out about Bobby ? " " I 'm coming to that , but most of them had pink hair , a very peculiar shade . Maybe I should try it . My little pal told me she did it herself . I wonder if I could ? Or maybe you could help me with the back bits . It would probably make all the difference in my life . " " Maggie , for God 's sake . . . " " Do n't get so excited or you 'll blow a bandage . I 've got it right here , Bobby 's forwarding address , " she fished around in her handbag . " Though I do n't think it 's going to do us any good because in a way we knew it all the time and Choo-Choo or Chug-Chug or whatever her name is thinks I 'd do well as a show girl and I would n't even have to dance . . . just walk around . She even offered to introduce me to Billy Rose . She 's been a chorus girl for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd love it . Do you suppose I would ? " She finally pulled a piece of paper out of her bag . " Here it is . " I grabbed it , straightened it out and read Choo-Choo or Chug-Chug 's florid backhand . Bobby LeBranch c/o Nellie Brant , Shubert Bldg. , West 44th Street , New York City , New York . Round and round it goes , where it stops nobody know . We were right back where we started . I sagged down on the dressing room steps and sat staring at the crumpled bit of paper . What was the use . Maggie sat down beside me and put her arm around me.  | " You know what you ought to do , Timmie . " " Yeah , shoot myself and get it over with . " " You see . That 's what I mean . What you need is to relax . You ought to get a massage or a rubdown or something . " That jerked me to my feet . " What do you mean I ought to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There , you see . You 're so jumpy . It would do you good . " " Why do you say that ? " " Lots of actors do . It 's the most soothing thing in the world . " " Maggie , what made you think of that ? It 's important . What made you think of a massage just now ? " " Well look at the way you 're acting . You 're all tied up in knots . " " No , no . Now think , Maggie . Why did you say that just now ? Please Maggie , think back . " " I do n't know . . . please , Timmie , you 're hurting me . " I had n't realized that I was gripping her shoulders as hard as I could . Almost trying to shake it out of her . I let go . " Did it have anything to do with that big ape that was here a few minutes ago ? The one I asked you about ? " " Why yes , Timmie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though I do think you could find a little nicer looking one . . . he was a trifle too Neanderthal for my tastes . " " But how did you know he was a rubber . . . did you talk to him . . . ? " " No , it was because they would n't pay their bill . . " Because who would n't pay whose bill ? Maggie . . . for God 's sake tell me . " " I ca n't see what you 're getting in such a sweat about . . . it was n't your bill . . . I just happened to hear him trying to collect for a massage he had given last night and somebody would n't pay .  | " Who would n't pay ? " " Darling , how should I know ? I was just waiting out here for you to get back from the doctor 's and I overheard Sweetie-pie demanding his money . " " Who was he talking to ? " It had to be Bobby or at least a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . . . maybe he was still here . " Who Maggie ... Who ? " " Oh darling , I 'm afraid I did n't see him . You see I was standing over there by the door that goes onstage and I just overheard them . It is n't nice to eavesdrop I know , but I just happened to be standing there . . . I did n't mean to listen , really . If I 'd known it was so important I could have looked in , but how was I to know ? " " But what did the person he was talking to sound like .. . could you recognize his voice ? Think back . " " No I 'm sorry . You know how it is . . . all sort of muffled and actually I could only hear Sweetie-pie clearly and I 'm afraid I was n't paying much attention . Did it have something to do with you-know-who ? " " Sweetie-pie as you call him was probably talking to Bobby when you heard him . That 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you tell me ? You mean he 's here in the theatre ? " " It 's either Bobby or a bung-hole buddy . Did anyone leave after Sweetie-pie ? " " No , I 'm sure of that , though you can get out through the front of the house if you want to . Oh Timmie , I 'm sorry if I messed it up , but you do n't tell me everything and how was I to know ? " " It is n't your fault . . . I never dreamed he 'd come here . Come on , let 's go in and try and see if you can spot the voice you heard . . . you follow me around and give me a nudge at the slightest suggestion of the same voice . " " I 'll try but I 'm afraid it 's not much use . Sweetie-pie did all the talking , but let 's go . Only do be careful . Things  | are forever happening to people backstage . " " Just what do you mean by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies . . . things falling out of the flies on top of people . . . the Phantom of the Opera . . . you know . " She would have to bring that up at a time like this .  | 26 WHEN we got on the stage it looked like old home week . I did n't even know where to begin . Ernie had brought over a hat for Miss Randall to try on . Jenny had some swatches of curtain material for the third act she wanted Mr. Frobisher to O.K. so they were having a break . Margo was sitting in a corner by the switchboard waiting for Mr. Frobisher to get through with Jenny so Greg could introduce her to him properly through channels . And Greg was talking to none other than my old nemesis , Ted Kent . Word must have gotten around about my accident and the old ghoul was there trying to get my part . Yes , Libby was there , too , standing behind him . The old double play : Magro to Libby , Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell an actor . The news will get there twice as fast . Although I had more important things to do , I could n't resist the opportunity . I sauntered over to Ted , followed by Maggie who had somewhat the air of a birddog poising to point . " Hello , Ted , how good of you to come , " I said as archly as I could which considering the bandage handicap was pretty arch indeed . " I hate to be the one to tell you your trip was for naught , but my physician assures me I shall be able to open with the show . " I glanced at Libby . " Contrary to what you may have been told . " Libby at least had the decency to blush and splutter a bit . " Do n't be ridiculous , old man , " said Ted . " Libby and  | I just happened to be having lunch with Jenny , and she insisted we stop by here just a minute with her . I have n't quite descended to walk-ons yet . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim . . . " Libby fancied herself oil on troubled waters . " I think it was grand of you to arrange for Greg to introduce Margo to Frobisher . " " But Libby , " said Margo , " I still do n't think I 've had enough experience . " " Do n't be silly , dear . You do n't have to have any experience to be an understudy for a star . You never get to play it anyhow . " Libby turned to me . " By the way , Tim , what did happen to you ? Your face , I mean ? " " I 'll tell you all about it one day . " I did n't feel up to repeating my pat little story again . " Greg , how long do you think it will be before we get to the third act ? " " ' Bout an hour , I should think . " Well , all four of them had said something and no nudge from Maggie . With Maggie still pattering after me I did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stage . Showers still thought my accident was hilarious but did n't rate a nudge . Frobisher said he was glad I was going to be able to open . No nudge . Jenny shrieked with laughter and said my face gave her an inspiration for a new plaid , but no nudge from Maggie and I had to restrain myself from doing more than nudging Jenny and her crummy jokes . I borrowed a cigarette from Maggie and while I was lighting it I whispered to her to meet me in the ladies ' room at the front of the house right away and I wandered to the other side of the stage hoping I did n't look at keyed up as I felt . I watched Maggie go through the pass door and up the aisle to the front of the house and I gave her a couple of minutes ' start , then followed her up the opposite aisle . She was waiting for me in the ladies ' room when I got there . " Well this is certainly a novel place for a rendezvous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the toilet stalls before I answered her . They were empty . " I thought it would be the safest place . Everyone else uses the johns backstage . Well , I take it you did n't recognize any of the voices . " " But I told you I did n't hear whoever Sweetie-pie was talking to . . . just a mumble . I did n't think it would do any good . And those silly questions you asked . They 'll think you 're mad as a hatter . Do you think it 's going to rain Miss Randall ? ' and Do you like baseball , Mr. Showers ? ' Really ! " " Well , I had to get them to talk somehow . " " Okay . Now what do we do ? " " I 've got to think . " " Is this where you come when you want to think ? " " Maggie , what do we know that Bobbie does n't want us to ? " " Not much . It 's what we do n't know that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Youth and Beauty . " " Yeah , but it could n't be the Youth and Beauty Book . He 's got that back . " " All but that one page , of course . " " What do you mean , all but one page ? " " That page with our names on it . It seemed silly leaving it in that day when we were going to pitch it back in Nellie 's office . " " And you tore it out ? " I should have known . Maggie and her habit of tearing out pages . She nodded very pleased with herself . " But where is it now ? " " Up in my apartment . I can get it for you if it 's as important as all that . After all it did n't have anything on it but the names did it ? " " But that must be it . That 's what he 's still after . Maggie why did n't you tell me ? " " But I thought you knew . You were right there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure I 've still got it . "  | That was it . The missing page was the missing link . That was why Bobby and Jo-Jo tried to stew me in my own juice . That was why a tombstone in New Jersey read Amos Slattery . And if I could only work it right that would be why another tombstone would read Bobby LeBranch . That page could set up Bobby for me on my own terms . I started getting all hopped up inside . No more hugging walls in subway stations afraid I 'll be pushed in front of a train . No more chairs under my doorknob . We 'd get it settled once and for all . By now I could practically hear background music of the William Tell Overture . I was Popeye after a dose of spinach . I was Dick Tracy in spades . As a matter of fact I was a damn fool , but you do n't always know those things at the time . " Maggie . How are you feeling ? " " I like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days ago you said that if I ever got anything definite about this murder business , you thought it would be sheer heaven to play cops and robbers ? " " But Angel , what bliss . Am I to be the bait for your trap ? " That jolted me . " What trap ? " " Darling , do n't tell me you have n't got a trap . That 's ridiculous , you must have a trap . How else can I be the bait ? Could you give me time to get my hair pink ? Chug-Chug says . . " Never mind about Chug-Chug . How are you on adlibbing ? Do you have to have your lines written out for you or can you make them up as you go along ? " " I do n't know . Whatever for ? " " Because in a few minutes you and I are going to play a scene in front of the whole company . " " Wonderful . Are there cocktails in it or do I really get a chance to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is to bring Bobby  | over to your house to play by letting him know that you have the missing page to the Youth and Beauty book . " " But what 's the idea ? Then Bobby is one of the cone pany ? I knew it . Which one ? Frobisher , Greg , Showers : ' ... Oh tell me . " " I 'm not sure myself yet , but the less you know the safer you 'll be , but I do know that if he is n't  --  someone in the company does know him and will pass the word along . I 'm going to drop this page from the Burns Mantle Best Plays that you tore out at the library and then you can pick it up and sort of read through the cast aloud ... . You know actors always love to talk about old plays and then when you come to Bobby 's name you can bring it . in that you have seen that name before in an engagement . book and you just happen to have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need to mention the Youth and Beauty Book by name . Our pal will know . Then I 'll take it from there . It wo n't make much sense to the rest of the people , but we 're only playing to one person  --  think you can do it ? " " My God , I certainly have all the exposition in this louse play . Why do n't I just have a feather duster and by talking to the butler , ' I sye , ' ow careless of young Mawster Bobby to leave a page of the Youth and Beauty Book lyin ' around careless like with Poor Miss Nellie not cold in her gryve ! ' I hope you 're not planning to put money in this turkey . It does n't look to me like it 's got a prayer . " But it had to have a prayer . Now or never . Last night . proved that . If I did n't get him  --  he 'd get me . Simple as that . " But they were wrong about Tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else do I do ? " " Then you simply go home and lock your door and wait . " " Where will you be ? " " Bobby will think I am at the tailor 's , I hope . "  | " And will you be ? " " No . " " Oh . " She thought this over for a minute . " And will dreamy Bobby show up ? " " No . " " Well , it sounds like a lively afternoon for me I must say . " " Someone may phone you , though . He 'll probably say it 's the wrong number or something , just to see if you 're home . That 's the only reason I 've got to have you in on this . But do n't worry , he 'll never get as far as your apartment . " " Is there going to be a lot of shooting ? I should hate that . " " Why did you say that ? " " Well , you 're sagging like an old woman on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means . " I must have taken my hands out of my pocket without thinking . " Do you think any of the rest noticed it ? " " They 'd be pretty damn stupid if they did n't . " That set me back a bit . " Well , it 's too late now . We 'll just have to take a chance . Good luck . " " Hear it not , Duncan , for it is a knell , " she quoted , " that summons thee to heaven or to hell . " " Do n't you know better than to do that ? " I said angrily . " What ? " " Quoting Macbeth . . . it 's bad luck . " " Oh , nonsense . What a silly lot you actors are . Come on , let 's get started . I ca n't wait . " She started back up the stairs . All at once I knew it was no good . " Wait a minute , Maggie . " She stopped and turned around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . It 's folded . . . closed out of
