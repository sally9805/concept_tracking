One cold afternoon last week , at New York 's Halloran ( Army ) Hospital , a long hospital train stood on the siding . Out of the hospital , walking , hobbling , on crutches , on stretchers , came the young wounded veterans of World War II . The men were just five days back in the U.S. , just two weeks out of North Africa , veterans of Tunisia , Sicily , Salerno and Naples . The train would take them to Midwest Army hospitals , where they would be near home . <P> The train was clean and comfortable , with the antiseptic smell of a hospital . Each ward car had an operating room . Nurses in stiffly starched uniforms walked down the aisles . Just before it pulled out , chaplains came on , bringing cigarets and candy , magazines and books . <P> Also on board was the New York Times 's Meyer Berger , one of the most professional of U.S. reporters . He stayed with the train until it reached Fletcher General Hospital in Cambridge , Ohio , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they came nearer &; nearer home . It was a memorable ride . Next day Reporter Berger sent his newspaper a story which well &; truly evoked the heartbreaking feelings of the returning soldier : <P> Afternoon in Jersey . " Twilight came early . Lights were turned on as the train raced smoothly southward through New Jersey . . . . The soldiers stared at the whizzing landscape , at bright-paned homes merging with descending dark . . . . They dreamed on it with hungry eyes . One lad not more than 21 , his leg amputated , told the soldier across the aisle : ' Even the dump piles look swell . ' The other soldier nodded : ' You ai n't kiddin ! ' <P> " The ward cars filled with . . . excited exclamations at sight of lighted street lamps along the highways . . . . Attendants came in with supper trays for the litter cases and the warm ward car filled with the odor of roast chicken and hot potatoes . A soldier grinned happily : ' Real American chicken ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mental cases walked slowly behind them . They laughed and chattered , stopping at the windows along the way to stare and stare again with a hungry look . . . . Half an hour later , well-fed , they limped back to their places , all aglow . Resuming his place at a window , a soldier said : ' I got ta keep looking back . I keep thinking maybe it will fade out , like a movie . ' <P> " By and by the men pulled out headboards and started on rummy , pinochle , hearts and blackjack . Some read comics and newspapers . A soldier looked up from his paper . . . and read names of brands from the sheet-names of cigarets , cigars , foods , liquors-and the card players grinned at the sound of them . . . . Men called out the names of stations-Trenton , Philadelphia , Wilmington , Cumberland . . . . <P> " A corporal spoke dreamily of the nights in Howie Dryman 's Texaco Bar &; Grill across the river from Vincennes , Ind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' not cigarets that 's beat up and spilling both ends .
