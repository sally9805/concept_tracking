The U.S. was only beginning to learn about military occupation of Japanese territory . But by last week a pattern for the future was forming on Saipan , first Jap territory where U.S. forces encountered large numbers of Jap civilians . <P> On Saipan scrawny , hungry Jap civilians were still coming out of caves where they had hidden since the battle began last June . Upon surrendering they are placed in a two-square-mile compound named " Camp Susupe " ( after the nearby shallow lake ) , which now shelters 18,000 - 13,000 Japs , the rest Christian Chamorros , Koreans and Kanakas . <P> Food and Shelter . Life is primitive on Saipan . The shipping shortage and the necessity of supplying battles farther west permit only the barest necessities ( even for Saipan 's American conquerors , who still eat out of cans ) . For the captive civilians the only cover is what can be built out of weathered planks , battered sheet tin from the bomb-shattered sugar refinery , and tattered tenting . <P> Each rickety hut ( called a " han " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. authorities deal with each group through the " hancho , " or leader . Camp Susupe 's residents wear whatever clothing can be salvaged from captured supplies , eat from the Japs ' rice , kelp and canned stores , and take what few food essentials the U.S. can spare . Recently families have been released during the daytime to cultivate green vegetables , which grow easily in Saipan 's fertile ground . <P> Medical Care . About 100,000 treatments have been given Saipan 's civilians by Army and Navy doctors and their assistants since D-plus-five . The " Midtown Pharmacy " still treats about 1,200 cases each day . Chief ailment : malnutrition , for which vitamin B1 injections are given in severe cases . Other maladies : diarrhea , worms , beriberi . <P> An Army-staffed hospital which receives the seriously ill and the wounded who have been hiding out is not as busy as it was just after the battle . <P> Birth &; Death . Saipan Japs had one of the highest birth rates on earth : about 300 children were born annually to each 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies are born each day at Camp Susupe . Authorities have attempted to record births as they occurred . Friendly Chamorros usually comply ; Japs do not . <P> Navy Lieut . Robert Frost ( " from Auburn , Maine ; I wish to God I was back there " ) told a reporter : " We were going crazy with babies at first . There were a lot of orphans , and nobody had thought of baby bottles and nipples for them . We used rubber gloves , medicine droppers - anything to get milk into them . They rushed us out some baby bottles from the States and we are in pretty good shape now . " Diapers were included in the Navy 's last shipment to Saipan . <P> The camp 's orphan asylum has only 60 babies , who are attended by three Japanese nurses . The number of civilians killed by bombing and shelling was surprisingly low on Saipan , and many of the thousands of adult civilians who committed suicide at the battle 's end killed their children also . <P> Deaths at Camp Susupe average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor physical condition of the population .
