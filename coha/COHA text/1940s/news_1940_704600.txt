txt A woman invaded a National Broadcasting studio during a coast-to-coast program today , and menaced actors with a property hatchet as people thruout the nation listened unaware . She escaped . The woman , never identified , had been told that no visitors were allimed at a certain show , but a few minutes later she stole into the studio four floors above and was allowed to stay because the program already was on the air . Then she wandered around and finally picked up a hatchet from a sound effects bench , crept up behind the actors clustered around the microphone , and brandished it over their heads . Joseph Bell , the program director , grabbed the hatchet and pushed her away . She yelled a few incoherent words just as the program went off the air , and disappeared before studio police arrived .
