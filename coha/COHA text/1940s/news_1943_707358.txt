txt BRITISH CONSIDER SENATE CRITICISM UNFORTUNATE NOW Officials Feel the Stressing of Differences on Eve of TriPower Talks Is Harmful FOR PEACE COOPERATION Some Fear Return to Economic Nationalism Here and Yankee Trader Tactics By JAMES B. RESTON By Cable to THE NEW YORE TIMES . LONDON , Oct. 10 ? Outwardly Britain 's reaction to the ex parte testimony of the five itinerant United States Senators has been polite , moderate and misleading . But , while officials are not saying much about it publicly , privately they make it clear that they resent the more violent criticism , fear the whole recent trend toward economic nationalism in the United States and do not see why this particular time  --  just before the tri-power conference  --  was chosen to demonstrate% differences between the United States and Britain . Resentment on the part of British officials available to this correspondent is based on the salient assumption by the Senators that the United States had asked for more oil from Persia and this had been refused ; that we had asked for ' unlimited use of air bases we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had requested the right to establish bases after the war on British territory and had been turned down . But , so far as one can discover in this capital , none of these things has happened . Mr. Churchill was not simply being rhetorical when he said that he did not become the King 's First Minister in order to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire . at the same time there is not only very little basis for charging the British with hold-Mg-out on us , but there is good-reason for saying that if the United States ever makes it unmistakably clear that it is prepared to take its place in establishing a real world authority in collaboration with Great Britain and Russia there is not a single base in the British Empire from Scapa Flow to Singapore that will not be open to us . Two Factors in Problem There are two ways to assure that the question of post-war bases in the British Empire becomes a critical problem between the United States and the British Commonwealth . The first is to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any responsibility for keeping the peace of the world , and the second is to challenge Britain and Russia to a world-wide grab for trade and territory after the war . The report of the Senators distressed a great many people here not alone because it gave ammunition to that part of the United States community which opposes all United States commitments to foreign powers and not alone because it tended to suggest just before the tri-power conference that the United States and Britain were at loggerheads on several basic points , but because the report seemed here to be part of a trend , a part of what The Economist called this week-end the recent " explosion of economic nationalism in the United States . " In recent days dispatches from Washington have seemed to justify this phrase . Admiral Howard L. Vickery 's statement that the United States intended to become a // BRITISH CRITICIZE SENATORS ' REPORTS // maritime nation with or without the cooperation of Britain , the reported suggestion by W. A. Patterson , president of United Air Lines , that all our air and sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum strength for competition with other powers , " the United States Chamber of Commerce proposal that American business men be allowed to go into war zones to recruit business before peace came and the appointments of Edward R. Stettinius Jr. , Leo G. Crowley and W. Averell Harriman have all led to the conclusion here that for domestic reasons the Yankee horsetrader was being revived as the ideal in United States foreign affairs . Comment on Trends Here " In political matters , " the Economist remarked , " the tide in the United States is flowing toward Wilson ; but in those questions of economic cooperation which are the lifeblood of an enduring settlement there are signs of a return to the big stick and the ideology of * * The prospects of any dramatic and immediate reversal of American economic policy are poor at the moment  --  poorer perhaps than they have ever been . " It is worth noting that British opinion does not oppose the United States getting its full share of trade that will inevitably follow the new communications which are now being strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States should not ask for privileges which especially in the realm of trade it is not prepared to grant to others . " That they the five Senators have come back with highly exaggerated notions of the way wherein British interests are pushing in front of American , is not the real point , " remarked the Manchester Guardian . " What matters is that they see that the United States is tied up with many things outside her borders and that she must begin to realize that her interests and her policy are related . * * * Similarly when Admiral Vickery tells how he ' shocked ' a British audience with his blunt words about the United States as a maritime nation we need not take his further misleading comments seriously . We would only ask the corollary of a vast American fleet  --  a sane economic policy which will fill those ships with imports as well as exports . " In summary , the British are a little leery of our Yankee horsetrader . They have done a little horsetrading with him in the past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some more in the future . But frankly they have more confidence in his ability to win the election than in his ability to win the peace .
