txt The La Guardia administration ? will sponsor in the Legislature tomorrow night . a bill giving the Board ' ' of Estimate complete control over the rate of fare to be charged on the city . subway systems . after unification of the B. M. T. , the ? I. R. T. and the city 's Independent lines . The bill declares flatly that after June , 1 , 1940 , the Board of Estimate " is empowered to fix and adjust from time to time the rate of fare to be charged . " Coupled with this is an extension for two years of the time in which a fivecent fare may be charged , at the discretion of the board . The bill is one of six designed to meet situations arising out of transit unification , which have been sent here by the city administration , and which will be introduced tomorrow night at the city 's  --  request by Abbot Low Moffat in the Assembly and Frederic R. Coudert Jr . in the ' Senate . Fare Bill Important The fare bill Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no present disposition known to exist on the part of the city administration to raise the five-cent fare after unification , the time may come when a fare increase , with the benefits , going into the city treasury , may be deemed preferable to imposition of countless nuisance taxes to maintain city activities . The first thing  --  the bill does is to provide that the unified system or any system operated directly by the city may be , operated for ten years ; instead of- eight , at fivecent fare before it is made selfsupporting . This clause originally called for ? a three-year period , , the three years- starting in September , 1932 .. Since it was obviously impossible to make a subway system competing with other lines self-support-ing by legislative fiat , this five-cent fare period for the Independent system was extended time after time by the Legislature , so that it became an eight-year period , ending this year . The eight-year period is now becoming a ten-year interval with the additional two years allowed as a test of fares and revenues under unification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system shows serious ? losses the city authorities would consider a fare increase , under the other powers conferred by the bill . The- city , of course , always has had the power to agree to a fare increase with the B. M. T. and I. R. T. , but under the old contracts the increases would , have gone to the companies first , and then only what was left would have dribbled into the city coffers . Operating Control Provided Another ? bill of interest in the group is one that gives to the Board of Transportation clear . control over the operating plans for the unified system . The board would draw up a plan , stating the rate of fare , transfer points , if any , and other details , and submit it to the Board of Estimate for approval . The significance of this would appear to be that the initiative on free transfers would lie with the Board of Transportation , rather than in the Board of Estimate , where in the future it might become a political football . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclusion of trolley and bus lines under unified operation by the Board of Transportation . It does so by the substitution of the words transit facilities for rapid transit lines in several sections of the law . A fourth measure takes away from the Transit Commission , and gives the Board of Transportation , the right ? of supervision of contracts between the city and private operators under , the . old Rapid Transit , Act . This is ? regarded as nec ! zsary because some of the contract obligations of the private companies remain alive , even after unification . The same bill provides also that whenever the city lawfully acquires any- transit facility , the Board of TransTiortation shall operate it . A fifth measure eliminates the requirements that a certificate of convenience and necessity must be obtained from the Transit Commission before a new transit route is laid out . Hearings- on Route Changes The Boroxi of Estimate would hold hearings on any- proposed changes in bus or trolley routes on lines operated by the unified system . The unified system would be the operator of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Third Avenue Railway System of trolleys in Manhattan ; trolleys and buses in the Bronx , and the Manhattan bus system . The last bill , purely a departmental administrative measure , gives the Board of Transportation power to suspend an employe charged with dereliction in duty , pending the disposition of those charges . At some points the city 's legislative program on- transit runs counter to the Wicks Transit Act , which continues the right of the Transit Commission to regulate transit operation aftbr unification , and it is probable that passage of the Wicks measure , sponsored by the Transit Commission , will be held up pending adjustments that may have to be made . - The La Guardia administration is expected to make clear its stand that . it has no intention of raising the five-cent fare after unification , but that the clause is being put into the law to cover the possible necessity of Buell an increase . At the same time , violent oppositio ? is expected from the Democrats in the Legislature , who can be expected to take full ' political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years individual Democrats ? have- sponsored bills barring the city from making a fare increase after unification . In the Constitutional Convention , they waged a fight to write into the State Constitution a provision fixing the fare at five cents , but received no encouragement , even from the Transit Commission , which sponsored the constitutional amendment giving the city the power to ? issue city bonds to pay for the private lines outside of the city 's constitutional debt limit . Union Seeks Strike Sup ' 02t The Transport Workers Union , C. I. O. affiliate , ' moved yesterday to obtain additional support for the threatened strike of 27,000 employes of the I. R. T. and B. M. T. transit systems in protest against Mayor La Guardia 's recently announced policy for treatment of labor after transit unification is consummated . The 10,000 employes of street car ' and bus companies outside the I. R. T. and B. M. T. systems will hold mass meetings Wednesday night and Thursday morning , to act on resolutions pledging their support to any strike of I. H. T .. and B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held in Manhattan Center , Thirty-fourth Street and Eighth Avenue , Wednesday at 8:30 P. M. The - second will be held in the same place . at 10:30 A. M. : Thursday . Those attending the ' meetings will be employes of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , the Eighth Avenue Coach Company , . the-:New York City Omnibus Corporation , the Third Avenue . Railways System and its Bronx bus subsidiary and a number of-small-bus concerns . The union has closed* shop agreements with all of  --  these companies . Austin Hogan , president of - the New York local - of the union , said that steps were being taken to protest to the Federal Communications Commission against alleged discrimination against the . union by radio stations refusing to sell it time on the air . According toMr . Hogan the union has tried to ? purchase time to broadcast its . side of its , controversy with Mayor La Guardia , bid , " has been stymied by none too subtle ' subterfuges laid down by:at least . two radio broadcasting companies . " The union will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and if " given the same run around " immediately-will-send its protest to the commission .
