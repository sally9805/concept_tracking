On April 26 , 1698 , Peter I called the leading Russians to his country place , Preobrazhenskoye , and told them they had to conform to Western custom by shaving off their beards . With his own hand Peter gave his noblemen 's whiskers a rough-cut . <P> On March 15 , 1946 Joseph Stalin called the leading Russians to the Kremlin and told them they would have to conform to Western custom by calling themselves ministers instead of commissars . With his own hand Stalin signed the suggestion to have his own title changed to prime minister . <P> In neither case was the effort at conformity more than superficial . The fate of the Old Bolshevik word " commissar " was just a finishing touch in Russia 's new nationalism . Commented one U.S. diplomat : " Now they have everything back but the Czar . " <P> Other changes wrought last week : <P> Seventy-one-year-old Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin resigned as President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet after 27 years in office . From the early days of the Soviet Union 's precarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansive glory , the " little father of the peasants " had dispensed friendly fatherliness and earthy philosophy . Now , with his eyesight almost gone , he was happy to quit . The shriveled sage with the oldfashioned , tip-tufted beard had the distinction of being one of the few top-ranking Old Bolsheviks to be removed from office merely by old age . <P> Kalinin 's successor is gruff , bustling , 57-year-old Vice President Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik , who will now function both as President of the Union and as an alternate member of the policymaking Politburo . The Soviet Union 's longtime trade-union chief , he is primarily the workers ' man , where Kalinin was the peasants ' champion . The son of a Leningrad janitor , he was the only member of the All-Union Soviet of Trades Unions Secretariat to survive the purge of 1937 . As Russian leaders go , he has a wide horizon : he made two wartime excursions to trade-union conferences in Britain . But he is isolationist enough to cultivate a bushy , eminently Russian mustache . <P> Shvernik 's successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union , is Vasili Vasilevich Kuznetsov , who is even more cosmopolitan than Shvernik-he was educated at Carnegie Tech and worked in a U.S. Ford plant . When he returned to Russia , he reported so enthusiastically about his life &; times in the U.S. that friends kept snapping : " Well , if you liked it so much there , why do n't you go back ? " Conforming to Peter 's Western ideal , he is clean-shaven.
