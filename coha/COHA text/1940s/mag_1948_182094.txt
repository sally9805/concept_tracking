Dark-eyed Adela Velarde was 14 when she left Ciudad Jurez to join the army of General Venustiano Carranza . She became a nurse . Dressed in a green uniform cut from the curtains of a Pullman car , she rode through the Mexican Revolution on a grey hospital train under the watchful eye of a veteran head nurse named Leonor Villegas de Manon . <P> Though fiery-tempered old Leonor drove many a military wolf away from her girls , she never had to bother about a taciturn sergeant named Antonio del Rioarmenta . He was in love with young Adelita , but he was too shy to tell anyone about it . Instead he wrote a song for her , working out the tune on his harmonica . In the hospital train at Aguascalientes one day , he sang it for her : <P> Popular among soldiers was Adelita <P> The woman the sergeant adored , <P> Who besides being valiant was pretty , <P> And respected even by the colonel . <P> A few days later the sergeant 's general sent him across a bullet-swept street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . <P> A Symbol . By an ironic twist , the sergeant 's song became the favorite of Pancho Villa 's men , not of Carranza 's army , where it was born . For years , a guitar-strumming mariachi had only to play Adelita in the company of a Carrancista to get his guitar strings shot off . Carranza won the war , but Adelita has long since won the battle of the mariachi bands . Today , when a group of paunchy old boys gather in a cantina for an evening-Indians who robbed with Zapata , green-eyed Chihuahuans who followed Felipe Angeles , tall-talking Sonorans who fought from Obregn 's armored trains-they call for Adelita . <P> Because of the song , Adelita has come to symbolize all the sturdy women of the revolution-such scowling Amazons as Colonel Juanita , who commanded a regiment of Zapata 's best cavalry ; the handsome , .45-toting blondes of the Caf Viena in Guadalajara , who could pick out a tune by firing at piano keys ; the thousands of soldaderas who followed their men into battle , gave birth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <P> A Namesake . In Mexico City last week , on the eve of the 38th anniversary of the revolution , a flashing-eyed , 18-year-old beauty named Rosa Maria Franco was chosen " Adelita 1948 . " With rifle belts slung across her shoulders , she led a parade across the Zocalo and was wined &; dined at Ciro 's . <P> The original Adelita had become matronly Adela Velarde de Perez , a secretary in a Chapultepec Park museum . A delegate to the Congress of Veterans of the Revolution , her only part in the fuss over her young namesake was to watch the parade from a crowded grandstand . It had been a long time since the bashful sergeant died in the streets of Torren.
