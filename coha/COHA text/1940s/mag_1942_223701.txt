The attack was scheduled for daybreak . In the close-packed boats moving toward the Continent , men loaded the magazines of their Bren guns and checked equipment . It was a hot , muggy night on a lifeless Channel . <P> Before dawn His Majesty 's destroyers , transports and launches , chasseurs of the Fighting French Navy , a Polish destroyer and a mile-long string of invasion barges laden with troops and tanks were off Dieppe , hidden in the night 's retreating skirts . <P> The strategy , long planned , was comparatively simple . The Commandos were to land by stealth and distract German forces in Berneval , four miles to the east , and Varengeville , five miles to the west . Major General John Hamilton Roberts ' Canadians would carry the main show , with flanking attacks against the chalk cliffs on both sides of Dieppe and a frontal assault on Dieppe 's beaches . <P> In his headquarters aboard a destroyer , grizzled " Ham " Roberts , whose close-cropped mustache makes him look as though he has merely forgotten to shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ahead of them . Batteries of German cannon and machine guns , perched on the cliffs and hidden in caves , could turn an enfilading fire on the beaches , which bristled with barbed wire . From deep fortifications further inland artillery could lay down a curtain of fire offshore . Along new military roads and railways German reinforcements could be swiftly concentrated against the attackers ( see p. 29 ) . After the assault and occupation would come the problem of withdrawal-for this was a raid , not an invasion . Dieppe was a nest of German strength , as General Roberts well knew . A little after 4 a.m. the attackers closed in on the shore . <P> The Commando barges , carrying also a detachment of U.S. Rangers , moved shoreward . Along the French coast anti-aircraft guns barked fretfully . R.A.F. bombers , sent ahead , were softening up inland positions . But the Nazis might not have guessed what was brewing , if ill luck had not overtaken the raiders groping into Berneval . <P> German E-boats , patrolling the coast , intercepted them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke belching . <P> A U.S. Ranger said afterward : " They met us with everything-mortar fire , machine guns , rifles , anti-aircraft guns and finally bayonets . " The Commandos got ashore , but they had to withdraw , cut to pieces . <P> At Varengeville to the west the Commandos were more successful . They reached the shore , carried and destroyed a battery of 6-inch naval guns , which erupted on the lightening coast like a volcano . It was time for the Canadians .
