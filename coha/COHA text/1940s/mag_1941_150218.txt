ORPHANS OF THE PACIFIC : THE PHILIPPINES- Florence Horn - Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3.50 ) . <P> Florence Horn is a small , sapient Connecticut Yankee quietly outraged by the U. S. citizen who places Manila in Cuba . Late in 1939 she took her journalistic acumen and a social conscience to the little-known Commonwealth of the Philippines , within three months turned the polyglot , 7,091-isle archipelago inside out gathering research for a FORTUNE article . Orphans of the Pacific is the byproduct . <P> " The U. S. A. , " says Authoress Horn , " does n't know what to do about the Philippines and never has , from the very beginning . " She kids the pious rationalizations of McKinley , the imperialistic fanfare of Senator Beveridge ( Almighty God had " marked us as His chosen people , henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world " ) . She finds equally quixotic the present-day Filipino hope for coexistent 1 ) independence , 2 ) protection by the Asiatic Fleet , 3 ) free trade with the U. S. , 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quezon-a sort of hothouse hybrid between Jimmy Walker and Huey Long-she has little respect . And toward American colonists she is passionately irreverent . " They build for themselves a barricaded American life wherever they are . They insulate themselves as thoroughly as possible against the life of the country they are in . They are rich in a country of poor people . . . . They grouse continually about petty inconveniences , and berate the miserable natives bitterly and endlessly . Yet when they go home to the States on leave for a visit they are out of joint there too . They are only too anxious to return to the despised Manila . ... " <P> Miss Horn 's contempt is matched by compassion for the plight of the Filipino people . To them , independence is a " bright bauble , merely a gaudy word filled with vague but glorious implications . " It is foisted upon them by politicians who themselves doubt its advisability . Should the Filipinos still want independence in 1946 ( when the U. S. is willing to relinquish its sovereignty ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitive tariffs . Their domestic economy demolished , the Philippines could not hope to escape Japanese control through economic ( if not military ) conquest . <P> As for the archipelago 's uneasy stepmother , " We hesitated about taking them in the first place ; for forty years we showed singularly little pride in possessing them ; we finally demonstrated our determination to be finished with them . We do n't really want them today , but also we do n't want to upset the status quo in the Far East , and strengthen Japan 's hand . So we may never be ' quit of them . ' "
