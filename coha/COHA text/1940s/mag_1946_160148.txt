" The cleverly phrased document turned up everywhere - mimeographed , printed in the ancient Gothic lettering that Germans love , even as a wrapping for German meat rations . In it , Goring ostensibly invited his countrymen to sabotage the peace ; justified bombings but weaseled on torture ; said : " Try to forget some . . . things , but remember others . Above all remember that you are Germans . . . that you are the people who will some day again be able to show the world what you are made of . . . .

To suggestions that the original be released to scotch the phonies , the Council has stubbornly replied : " We shall not spread German propaganda - this would be like oil on a fire .
