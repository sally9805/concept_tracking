For years the Washington Times-Herald has offered $5 for news tips . Auburn-haired Publisher Eleanor Medill Patterson paid out many a $5 , got in return many a 5 scoop , many a phony tip , many a headache . But last week " Cissie " Patterson got her money 's worth . From a news tip , a crew of four male reporters from her newshen-house unearthed a story that scooped the entire U. S. press and the Government-particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation . <P> Cissie Patterson 's Bureau of Investigation , headed by her eye 's apple , tall , lean , tough , red-haired Reporter Jimmy Cullinane , found that : <P> 1 ) Some 30,000 confidential documents of the Civil Service Commission , chiefly personnel information , had been systematically looted by Harlan G. Crandall , 29 , Commission employe , and turned over ( for a fee ) to two unnamed former Germans , now naturalized U. S. citizens . <P> 2 ) The records had been hauled in sackfuls past Commission guards by one Lawrence Haynes , to a mail advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , returned . <P> 3 ) To the former Germans went names , duties , pay , addresses , backgrounds of virtually every Panama Canal employe ; of men who work on the Army 's secret bomb sight ; of mechanics who install fire-control apparatus on battleships ; of plane designers ; of Army intelligence officers ' clerks who file , record or distribute in- &-outgoing; secret or confidential matter for war plans , communications , the State Department ; names of every U. S. motorboat owner , of confidential secretaries to President Roosevelt , Secretary of State Cordell Hull ; names of all machine-tool makers . <P> At this point , with G-Man J. Edgar Hoover rather red around the ears , FBI took over from the F. B. I. , jailed Crandall and Haynes , turned off the spotlight .
