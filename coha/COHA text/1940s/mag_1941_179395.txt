When they , heard the blare of trumpets one day last week German civilians turned up their radios . This was the signal for a Sondermeldung , an especially important announcement about fighting somewhere . Perhaps the British in Africa had been defeated already . . . . <P> The announcement was made . Merely the capture of another Russian city . A place called Rostov . <P> The place called Rostov was , according to the announcer 's voice , a very important one . It controlled the mouth of the great River Don . It lay athwart the oil pipeline from the Caucasus . It was a key point in the best railway line between the Caucasus and the capital . And , most important , it would be the linchpin of the imminent German attack on the Caucasus itself . <P> On the Russian side there was some doubt about the imminence of the attack on the Caucasus . It seemed more reasonable to guess that the Germans would first drive straight across to the Volga , perhaps at Stalingrad , thereby isolating the Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If such was the program , it was not likely that the Caucasus would suffer attack for some time . <P> But if &; when the Germans do turn south , they may have an easier time getting at the oil than is generally supposed . The mountain barrier of the Caucasus is no barrier to oil . The important oil fields are north ( Maikop and Grozny ) and east ( Baku ) of the mountains , can be reached over good terrain by good communications lines . How soon Adolf Hitler reaches oil fields , and how soon he gets oil out of them , depend on the Russians and the British , who well know the importance of Middle Eastern oil to Germany 's existence .
