txt Horse and Rider Need Change At last we seem to have reached the point where worrying about " swapping horses in midstream " is like harping on an old string . The current was so swift , racing in the right direction the horse had only to tread water to be carried along until now his hoofs are on the hard sand . But the promised land is not on the beach . It fa atop $ high hill , too high for the tired horse climb , Providentially awaiting the aide " stands a young , strong , ambit : lout horse , sure of foot as he must be to climb that slippery ascent . With nevi clear vision and revived confidence , the rider will turn and mount the strong young steed , ready and able to cam him safely to the summit . God speed horse and rider . A. R. R.
