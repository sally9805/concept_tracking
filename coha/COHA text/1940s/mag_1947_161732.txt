In the blackness before dawn , the Greek ship Chimara , 1,800 tons and packed with 548 passengers , slogged through windblown seas . She was close to shore , off the eastern tip of the Attica peninsula . Her journey from Salonika to Piraeus ( Athens ' port ) was to end in a few hours . But some of her 87 crewmen were restive . They knew the menace of floaters ; some had protested against night voyages in these waters , which had been heavily sown with mines during the war . <P> At 3:50 a.m. , it happened . The Chimara , a onetime German hospital ship , shuddered and stopped as an explosion ripped away her port bow . Her engine-room belched clouds of steam and flames . Passengers lurched through dark corridors to the decks . Soon they were a tight-packed mass of cursing , fear-crazed people , fighting to get into the ship 's eight lifeboats . <P> After 30 minutes of hellish panic , the Chimara rolled over , sank at once . Down with her went 200 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hold ( their destination had been an exile camp in the Aegean Islands ) . Many who had quit the ship died in the sea . Hours later fewer than 200 survivors were accounted for . The dead and missing : more than 400 . <P> Thus this week the peril of mines added to its toll of more than 6,300 lives taken since war 's end . The toll would surely rise ; there are still hundreds of thousands of live mines in unswept fields close to main shipping channels . The danger of floaters would remain for many years . Greece , Sardinia and Sicily were almost surrounded by minefields . Off the Channel coasts and The Netherlands and Denmark , near Eire and Iceland were thousands of mines . The U.S. coasts were believed to be swept clean .
