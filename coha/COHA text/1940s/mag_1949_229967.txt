For 65 years Philadelphia has suffered its Republican city government as it has the water it drank . Both gave off a faint but unpleasant smell , but a true Philadelphian got used to both . This year , after the exposure of graft , extortion and embezzlement in nearly every city office , the smell from City Hall became too much even for torpid Philadelphians . <P> In a record off-year turnout , they booted aside four Republicans and installed four Democrats in the posts of treasurer , controller , coroner and register of wills . <P> The triumphant Democrats were led by Richardson Dilworth , firebrand Yale-trained lawyer , ex-Marine major , and local leader of the Fair Dealing Americans for Democratic Action ( A.D.A. ) . Working with him was Joseph Sill Clark Jr. , a Chestnut Hill socialite . As treasurer and controller respectively , two new Democratic officials will take charge of the city 's much-abused purse . <P> Republicans , trying to reform their party under fire , had ditched the machine professionals , persuaded four outstanding amateurs in politics to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely , the Republicans launched what the Republican Philadelphia Inquirer labeled a " false " and " vicious " campaign against Dilworth , trying to prove that he was a crony of Communists . Philadelphia 's two major news papers , both staunchly Republican , endorsed Dilworth &; Co . <P> Elated Democrats were already setting their sights on 1951 and the mayor 's office , where a Democrat has not sat since 1884 . <P> That was big talk in a city where voters are registered nearly three to one Republican . Said the Inquirer : " It was not a matter of being a Republican or a Democrat ; it was a matter of trying to redeem the city from those who had sunk it in the mire . "
