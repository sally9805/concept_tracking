" From womb to tomb " was the British phrase for it . When Sir William Beveridge ( in 1942 ) put out his famous plan , * its socialistic scheme for insurance and medical care was sponsored by a Conservative-led coalition government . Last week , under the more appropriate aegis of the Labor government , a National Health Service Act initiated by the Beveridge Report went into effect . For every man , woman &; child in the United Kingdom , all medical care would be free , in a Socialist sense ( paid out of taxes ) : doctors ' and dentists ' services , drugs , hospital beds , eyeglasses , artificial legs . <P> Sign or Starve ? Many doctors were unhappy about it . Last February the Brit ish Medical Association had voted 10 to 1 ( TIME , March 1 ) against cooperating with the Act . But 21,341 out of 23,000 general practitioners had eventually signed up . To ease their pain , Health Minister Aneurin ( " Nye " ) Bevan had held out a placebo : his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would get a " base pay " of about $3.50 a year for each patient on their books . Estimated top income , with all extras , like obstetrics : $20,000 . Estimated income for a solo practitioner with the maximum 4,000 patients : $14,000 . <P> Among the rebellious rump of doctors , some were bitter-enders . Said one 63-year-old stalwart : " I 'm an individualist . I 'd rather cut my throat than sell my free dom . " Said a smart practitioner with a large country practice : " I serve both my bank balance and my patients by staying out . There 's no call for cheap services here , save for chauffeurs and gardeners . " <P> Many shuffled into Socialism with resigned resentment , considered it a business of " sign or starve . " Explained one 40-year-old doctor : " I 'm not keen on the service , but I ca n't afford to lose the capital I 've sunk in my practice . I 've got two boys to educate . " <P> Six Minutes Each ? The patients flocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were en titled to free care ; they were joined now by 14,500,000 more , a total of 36,700,000 out of a population of 41,460,000 in Eng land and Wales . ( Separate but similar schemes started at the same time in Scot land and Northern Ireland . ) Said one gleeful patient : " I 've been paying my doctor ten shillings sixpence ( $2.10 ) per visit twice a week . Now the fellow has to attend me for 15 bob a year ! " <P> How would the Health Act work for the patients ? It was too early to tell . But one doctor , figuring out how often his old patients fell ill , made a guess for those on his new list , decided that he could average six minutes to a patient . <P> * Titled : Social Insurance and Allied Services .
