Not the Great Herrmann , not Kellar , not Thurston , not Houdini was able to make a good thing of a magic show on Broadway , and for the past 13 years Broadway has seen no full-size illusionist 's performance . Undaunted , a miraculous hoodwinker who looks a little like Satan on stage and a little like Buffalo Bill off , who used to call himself The Great Jansen and who now bills himself as Dante , sailed into the Times Square district last week and set up Sim Sola Bim , a " mystery spectacle . " Widely advertised as meaning " thanks to you " in Danish , Sim Sala Bim is actually a phrase from a Danish folk song , is roughly translatable as Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay . <P> By the strict classifications of his strict and jealous calling Mystifier Dante is both a prestidigitator ( he does sleight of hand ) and an illusionist ( he does tricks which require elaborate props to help the illusion ) . Pacing his illusions to the brassy blare of carnival music , Mystifier Dante whirled through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lady , made stooges vanish right &; left . Loudly acclaimed was his trick of covering the open ends of a small beer barrel with paper , then distributing a few noggins from the keg among the audience . With dancing chairs , eerie levitation , mysterious cabinets and livestock summoned out of nowhere , Sim Sala Bim provided plenty of pleasantly stupefying hokum . <P> Now 57 , Harry Jansen prides himself on being one of the line of magical great ones , is known to his intimates as " Pop . " He has been Dante since 1922 . Born in Copenhagen , he went to the U. S. at the age of six , started out as a magician in St. Paul , Minn. , after watching The Great Herrmann do his stuff at the opera house there . Besides operating a show of his own , Jansen at one time ran a magic shop in Chicago . Eventually Jansen helped Thurston produce his shows . Shortly thereafter , Thurston and Jansen formed a corporation named Dante the Magician Inc . Three years later Thurston made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought out the magical assets and good will of their firm . Biggest illusion created by Jansen when he was associated with Thurston was The Vanishing Horse . It was the heaviest trick ever undertaken . <P> Jansen now creates all his own illusions . His inspirations come to him in flashes , but the work of putting a trick together takes many months . In order to keep his methods secret , he farms out a piece of an illusion to one assistant , another piece to another , then puts them together in private . Not since 1927 has he performed in the U. S. During the interim he toured the world . He was in Berlin when war broke out . Promptly the Nazis ordered him out of Germany . Says he : " That monkey in Germany cost me $25,000.
