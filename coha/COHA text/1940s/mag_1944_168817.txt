Senator Bob Taft of Ohio last week read a funeral oration over the still alive-and-breathing International Monetary Conference ( TIME , July 17 ) . He gave the press a statement : " I have been asked . . . what the terms of the agreements now being negotiated at Bretton Woods are to be and whether they have been or will be approved by Congress . I ca n't answer the first of these questions because of the secrecy which surrounds the Bretton Woods conference , but I can say that in my opinion no agreement for an international monetary fund on the terms proposed will be ap proved either by the Senate or the House . " On the first count , Senator Taft must have been too busy to inform himself . <P> For in fact the proceedings of the conference have been almost as public as the proceedings of Congress . But the second point was the more important , be cause Bob Taft is one of the most responsible of Republican Senators , and his statement had to be taken seriously . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were typical of the recent uninformed criticism by conservative U.S. bankers . Examples : <P> " Nearly all the real assets in the fund will come from this country . " ( The fact : the U.S. will contribute $2,750,000,000 to the $8,800,000,000 fund , will be the biggest , but still a minority , stockholder . ) " They will be dispensed by a board the control of which is held by countries whose currencies are much weaker than ours . " ( The fact : the U.S. will have 28% of the votes in the fund , a proportion which will be increased automatically when dollars are borrowed from the fund by other nations . ) <P> " It will not be long before all of our assets are gone and the fund is entirely made up of weaker , worthless currencies . " ( This could not happen quickly ; total borrowings from the fund are tentatively to be limited to 25% a year . But Bob Taft overlooked a bigger fact : if dollars and gold are drained out of the fund they will drain into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat is that the hard money assets of the fund will be spent in the U.S. , particularly if American tariffs prevent settlement of these debts in goods . Other countries will be as interested as the U.S. in preventing this . ) <P> Walter Lippmann shrewdly pointed out one basic flaw in Taft 's reasoning : that other nations may actually refuse to accept the direct U.S. loans which are Taft 's alternative to the Fund-Bank proposals . <P> For in direct loans , the U.S. would remain in a position to call the tune for each debtor . The other nations , mindful of the effects of the whimsical U.S. lending tariff policy of the prewar decade , might well prefer exchange controls and bilateral barter agreements among themselves to the acceptance of " humiliating " credit terms , and those loans which do not " fit their internal needs and their sense of national dignity . " <P> Since most U.S. citizens and bankers do not understand the fund or its operations any better than Senator Taft , there is a good chance that Congress will turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.
