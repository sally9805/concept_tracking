Until last week , the 1940 political campaign had been conducted in such a rarefied ideological atmosphere that it seemed , to many a voter , almost unAmerican . The whole thing is too intellectual , the voters seemed to say , and the hell with it . Last week affairs took a sharp down turn into the realm of barroom argument . Anybody could understand and appreciate such minor campaign issues as : <P> Elliott Roosevelt . Fortnight ago , blond Elliott Roosevelt , 30 , second son of the President , was gazetted captain in the Army Specialists Reserve , assigned to Air Corps procurement . Salary : $200 a month . Perquisites : $116 a month . Political repercussions : wow ! <P> Old Ironpants ( General Hugh S. ) Johnson called this performance draft-dodging , nepotism , despicable and raw . Elliott Roosevelt pointed to the magnitude of his own sacrifice of income* ( as news commentator for Emerson Radio , as operator of two Texas radio stations ) , pointed to General Johnson as " a disgusting old man . " <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too " clubs were organized ; buttons thus inscribed were worn throughout the East ; a song was written to that slogan ; and in Portland , Ore. , 25 youths invaded a recruiting station , gave hard-boiled Sergeant Marley near-apoplexy by eagerly demanding they be enrolled as captains . <P> This week Elliott said solemnly : " I decided to join the Army because I must live with my conscience . . . . Instead of doing something good , I found I had committed a horrible political error . I had done one more thing to convince Father I always put my foot in my mouth . ... If I hurt my father 's chances in November I know Father will think I have done right . " <P> Ordeal By Egg . In Detroit , plump divorcee Doris La Roue , 31 , RFC employe , pleaded guilty to tossing a metal wastebasket , a telephone book , an ash tray and other furniture oddments from an 18th story window during a downtown Willkie parade . Said Miss La Roue , denounced by the President , and straightway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her victim , Miss Betty Wilson , got twelve stitches in her head , flowers , national sympathy . <P> Candidate Willkie had n't been hit yet ; rotten-eggers are notoriously inaccurate . But people were really trying : eggs , a cantaloupe , a rock , a stick had been pitched at him . In Homestead , Pa. , police confiscated an unknown quantity of tomatoes and apple cores from some twelve-year-old politicians ; in Philadelphia , one Israel Kirby , 65-who happens to have been born in Rushville , Ind. - was arrested with a dozen eggs at a Shibe Park Willkie speech ; had to prove they were eating , not throwing eggs . <P> Here were issues the voters could understand . <P> *Texas chums of Elliott Roosevelt hinted that he had exaggerated the extent of the sacrifice .
