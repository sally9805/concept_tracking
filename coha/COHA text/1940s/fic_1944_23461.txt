THE TALL MAN A Story THOMAS SANCTON 0 N TOP the mountain in the clear twilight the trees and houses looked very small , but clean and sharp like miniatures . I peered at the crest from the dusty window of a day coach speeding north , a thousand feet below in the valley . The late red sunlight was behind the mountain . If a man had walked across the skyline I think I could have seen him . This was Lookout Mountain , at Chattanooga . Eighty years ago , on a hazy day , bloody Chickamauga had been fought against that crest . For years afterward Southerners called it the Battle Above the Clouds . On that day the people in the valley could see little . Only the pounding of artillery had told of the fighting that raged on the mountain . I looked from the train window until the mountain vanished in the darkness . The lights of Chattanooga were lost in the curving distance . The lights in the coach came on . There was a shuffling and restlessness among the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch their legs . Some drifted to the water cooler . Men walked to the lavatory room for a smoke and a pull of strong , cheap whisky . Across the aisle a soldier nodded . His head drooped forward . Finally he toppled to the shoulder of his wife beside him and went to sleep . In theseat before me a young blonde woman settled her two little blonde girls on the long end lounge and covered them with flimsy overcoats . The heat came on with a dry hiss . I could feel it flowing from the vent against my leg . A Negro porter dug beneath the seats with a broom , sweeping an accumulation of trash into the aisle . He pushed a pile of litter down the coach  --  newspapers with dusty footprints , newspapers printed in Chattanooga , Birmingham , Memphis . The New Orleans newspapers had long ago been swept away . Tomorrow , before the train reached New York , the coach would be strewn with journals that copyreaders and typesetters were laboring over now in Washington and Baltimore . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches , paraffin milk containers , greasy cardboard boxes , whisky bottles , cigarette stubs , orange peel , banana skins . The trash filled the coach with a sweet , choking odor . A Negro in a white jacket came through with a chromium tray full of sandwiches and a steaming kettle of coffee . In the past two hours or so he had made many trips through the car crying " Last call for sandwiches ! " In the rear of the coach a party of soldiers was playing poker on a suitcase turned endwise . Two soldiers stood in the aisle talking to a group of college girls . Behind me two soldiers were drinking . Their heavy woolen collars gaped open beneath their flushed faces . The car was almost filled . There were middle-aged women with daughters who resembled them . There were traveling business men with fountain pens in their pockets . Their suits were neat and cheap . There were farmers and hillsmen with black coats and starched buttoned shirts without ties . Some of the passengers were talking and laughing in the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the coot windowpanes . The couplings rolled and jerked with monotonous rhythm . I bought a cup of coffee and a sandwich in a crackly paper cover . The sandwich was made of dry , stiff bread with a wafer-thin slice of ham . The coffee was weak and very hot and lacking sugar . I was hungry . The sandwich and coffee made a wonderful mixture . This was my tenth trip between New York and New Orleans in Southern Railway day coaches ; my tenth in three years . I had spent almost a month of my life traveling on these trains . The novelty was gone . I was wishing I had spent my money on a Pullman fare . But I worked in New York for a newspaper salary , and kept returning to the South two or three times a year . To travel so far and so often I could afford to ride only in coaches . During these years I had come to know my companions on the journey . Not counting the soldiers  --  who more than any of us had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these passengers were being uprooted . Somewhere , in some city or village or on some farm , a former way of life had come to an end for them ; and they were going to some other place to start anew . We had sat up through long nights telling our stories . Some were widowed parents who were going to join their children in the North or South . Some were young men with hopeful faces who were taking their families from Alabama perhaps to a sprawling industrial city in New Jersey ; the big promotion , the long-awaited , exciting transfer had come at last . And some of thesepassengers were loyal and yet enchanted brides , who were going to live in the shambles of a cantonment village on a husband 's newly acquired lieutenant 's pay . And some , like the blonde woman in the seat before me who spent her time making nests of packages and overcoats for her two little girls to sleep in warmly , were going to join the soldiers or workers they had mated with , and to struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , strong years . There were old farmers , burned by sun and wind , courteous and timid in their movements , proud and rigid in their talk ; men who were being summoned by final illness , in some instances , to the bedside of a brother or a father they had not seen or written to for thirty years . Often the only barrier between them had been a journey across two states and the price of a fifteen-dollar coach ticket . I was thinking about these things that night in a half-asleep , dreaming fashion . As I remembered the earlier trips they all seemed to merge together . Towns and farms and movie houses went by like scenes on an endless roll of background . Sometimes the hills were covered with trees in autumnal color , and red sumac bushes waved by the railroad tracks ; and sometimes green summer foliage choked the river valleys . There is a tiresome interval for day-coach riders after nightfall . The countryside vanishes in darkness . Outside the fields may lie hauntingly beautiful in moonlight , or rain may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive headlight . The traveler sees nothing . The inside light shuts out the darkened landscape . He settles back on hard cushions to wait through the hours till midnight . Passengers grow weary with talking . They settle with their thoughts or read listlessly or stare through force of habit through the darkened windows . One by one they wrap in overcoats and try to sleep . The coach grows quieter . Somewhere the drinkers are still contending , and their voices grow loud in the stillness . At last the conductor comes in to reach into the switch box and turn on the dim night lamps . A few restless men get up and walk stiffly down the swaying coach to the lavatory . They settle on the lounge to smoke and talk . This is the hour when stories are told . A halting country voice begins a narrative and goes on and on , late into the night ; it is the voice of a countryman on a speeding train hurling through time and space , suspended in a timeless moment . Ideas and memories well up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with men he has never seen before and will never see again . Together they are cut off from reality . Somehow he knows these men . They are his brothers . He gropes to tell them the deepest memories and meanings of his life . 0 OMETIVIE after ten o'clock that night , far out of Chattanooga , I went into the lounge to smoke . There was a tall man sitting there . We said hello . His legs were crossed before him and he slumped against the seat with an air of weariness . He was a man of indefinite age . His face was gaunt and weathered . His hair and eyes were shiny black . His frame was sparse , but his hands and wrists were bony . His teeth were sound , but two or three had been knocked out and were replaced by bridgework . One of the false teeth had vanished from its crown . When he spoke this piece of empty metal sparkled . I could not guess how long that crown had been empty ; yet I thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he intended to pay . Somehow I knew this man . His suit was cheap and neat and black . It fitted his gaunt frame in a way that a tailored suit could never fit a stout man . Doubtless he had walked into a clothing store one day , in a little town somewhere in the South ; had selected a suit from the rack , put it on , counted out eighteen dollars to the clerk , and walked out . We lighted our cigarettes and began to talk . We talked at first about the train schedule . He seemed to know it like a railroad man . He thought the engineer was going to make up the fifty minutes he 'd dropped before Chattanooga . This was a good stretch of road . The weather had been good and the roadbed was hard . The tall man was going back home to a town in north Tennessee . He was tiredbut could n't sleep on trains . The jerking kept him awake . . . . I knew he would tell his story . We talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy and one in the Army . He had another son he had n't heard from since 1927 . He expected he was in the service somewhere  --  if he was still alive . Maybe he had children and was n't in the draft ; he wondered about that . His oldest son  --  and his son 's two boys  --  they were home helping him farm a few acres . I looked again at his unwrinkled face , at his crisp , thick black hair . His hair was fine but remarkably thick and black . It spoke of an indestructible , orderly vitality within him . " How old are your grandsons ? " I asked . " Let 's see . The little boy  --  he 's about twelve . I expect the other 's fourteen or fifteen . Before long the Army will get them too , I reckon . " A long silence passed . " I thought you were under forty , " I said . " Hell , " lie said . He sat there immobile , slouched against the seat , thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of April in 1887 . " " You do n't look it . " " Hell , " he said again . A puzzling , bitter smile came into his face . " I have n't got but another fifteen years to live . " No , sir , " he said at last , " I run into a piece of hard luck . I expect I could have lived to be about ninety-five like my daddy . But I ca n't do it now . I got busted up on a water tower , right up here at a little town we 'll pass soon . This here train is the one that done it , Number Seventeen . " Yes , sir . Everything 's busted through here . " He laid his arm across his abdomen . " Bones and belly . It 'll take me five minutes to get on my feet when we come to my stop . I 'll have to get on my legs and work the pain out miles this side of town . " And then he began to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a farmer in a barren , hilly county in northern Tennessee . But when his oldest children were grown he had moved , some twenty years ago , to the outskirts of a town to work as carpenter . He continued to farm a few acres and sometimes he did ordinary day labor . He worked occasionally for the railroad , painting and repairing water towers and tool sheds . He had traveled up and down this hundred miles of track , but had never been out of Tennessee . But his story was not about these things . It was really the story of an injury . " Last spring , " he said , " at this little town of Ooltewah , is where it happened . We were painting this water tower , me and a pardner . I reckon we were thirty feet high in the air . I always have been careful about my scaffold , and this here scaffold was fixed good . I do n't work any other way . I check them ropes and pulleys every day before we begin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a loose bolt I do n't do nothing more until I fix it . Some fellows do n't bother much , just rig up any kind of outfit and start in painting ; jump around , walk up and down on a sorry rig , and then they wonder why it is they get hurt . I do n't work that way . We had this good three-quarter rope , almost new , and a good scaffold under us . We were working there safe as if we were working in a field . " Well , it 's a funny thing , " he said . " Just let a fellow figure he 's got everything taken care of , and that 's when something has got to happen . Damned if I know why i t is . I 've seen it happen a hundred times . Take a man who 's worked a lifetime to get out of debt , why just when he 's done fine and paid off a mortgage and made a good crop  --  why , he 'll go hunting and trip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let a man build a new barn and fill it with feed and livestock , and like as not some plain mean devil he never even saw before will come along and burn it down . That 's the way it was with the scaffold . We fixed it sound as you can fix a scaffold . The ropes was good , the pulleys was good , the hooks was good . But something was meant to happen . Damned if it was n't . You see , we had this long lead-rope from the pulley , and it reached all the way to the ground . When we was thirty feet up in the air we do n't want no rope hanging on the ground . Matter of fact , it reached farther than the ground ; the higher we pulled the scaffold the longer the ropewas . So we drew it up and coiled it and rested it on the end of the scaffold . " Well , my pardner , he walked down to the end to pour some paint . And I was standing in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coil of rope away not to get paint on it , and accidentally the rope fell over the side . And there 's where he made his mistake . He should have pulled the rope up and coiled it first thing , and got it out the way . But he leaves the rope down and goes on a-pouring paint . " Well now , would n't you know this damned train would have to be coming down the track just then ? It 's the same train as this one , but running through in the morning instead of at night  --  twelve hours ' difference . I told you Number Seventeen done it but what I meant was Number Nineteen . It 's the same train but twelve hours ' difference . And not only that but the mail hook had to be sticking out . The hook should have been pulled in before he left the town . Them hooks are supposed to be pulled in as soon as the mailbags are picked up . Ought and is is two different animals . And here 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up speed out of Ooltewah , and here 's this rope been dropped from the scaffold  --  just that minute , I tell you ; just like that ! " My pardner was standing on a line with the train and he seen the hook about to grab into the rope and lie could see what 's about to happen . So he yelled a warning to hold on , and jumped on the scaffold ropes and locked his arms and legs around them before the jerk came . That saved him . " Well , the hook hit the rope and jerks the scaffold clean from under me . Gives it one big jerk and slammed it way out in the air , like a swing . The paint bucket splashed in my face and I 'm sprawling all which-way in the air . Ca n't see a thing any more . I figured the train was going to cut me up . But I hit the ground on my spine  --  and side . Right here . " His arm fell across his abdomen again . " My bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . You just ca n't believe what I 'm telling you . You hear your bones break and your belly bust wide open on the inside : And there I was with paint in my face , could n't sec a blessed thing , and knowing I was all stove in through here . I could feel the blood bleeding on the inside of me . Could feel my belly filling up . And pain  --  good God ! It was like someone took an anvil and mashed me with it . I done kicked many a rat in a barn and heard them kind of squeak and crunch . That 's about how it felt to be lying on the railroad track . " He looked at me and the bitter smile came across his mouth . It was merciless and utterly lacking in self-pity . There was a trace of amusement in it . In his ruddy face the silver of the empty dental bridgework sparkled . His black eyes were not unfriendly ; yet they gazed into mine with a cold inner fierceness , with something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you like that ? " he asked , reluctant to let the cruel image fade . " Legs broken , pelvis broken , guts busted open , paint in your mouth and eyes ? How would you like it ? " " Were you conscious ? " I said . " Just like I am now . " The tempo of his speech quickened as he remembered the excitement of his agony . " Conscious as I ever was in my life . I lay there on the ground and I give a moan ; it just come out of me . I knew this here railroad track was my deathbed . I knew the rope fell , that all those things happened to kill me . It was just meant for me to die . When I give that moan the pain was hurting so much I was hoping to die . " And then , " he said , and his eyes were shining , " something all of a sudden came over me . I said to myself : ' They ca n't kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to die , see . But I was supposed to have died under them train wheels . That 's the way it was meant to happen . But something had made a mistake . That 's the only way they could kill me and damned if something had n't slipped up . I had hit on the embankment instead of under the train wheels . Sometimes it happens like that  --  you get a run for your money . And it happened to me that way . I was lucky . " He bore no personal feeling against his partner and the train crew ; but in anotherpart of his mind he considered them the agents of his fate . " The pain began to make me dizzy . But over and over I kept thinking : ' I 'll live in spite of hell ! By God , I would n't give them the satisfaction of seeing me die if my head was cut off ! I 'll pick my own time to die and ai n't a man will pick it for me and least of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / bleed ever ' drop of blood I got in my body . I do n't care if my back is broke . The man do n't live that can kill me ! ' And I kept thinking that , over and over . And I ai n't stopped thinking it yet . Then my head started to whirling and I got sick to my stomach . I threw up blood all over the embankment. " ilk HE talked we smoked our cigarettes and shifted wearily on the seat . A heavy-eyed man with a stubble of blond whiskers came through the green curtain , paused for a moment , swaying with the train , and went into the small toilet compartment . Then he washed his hands and turned to us to listen , without interest . He smoked a cigarette and lurched back through the curtain . The tall man went on with the story . " My pardner , " he said , " he had got the hell scared out of him . But he was n't hurt . The scaffold swung back against the tower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he come down to me  --  down the rope . He wiped the paint out of my eyes and I could see a little . I was lying on the embankment ; half of me was on the tie ends and half on the slope . I was twisted up like a scarecrow . And he says , Good God , you busted right in two ! ' " He reached down and took hold of me and made like to straighten me out . I said , ' Get your hands off me . You 'll kill me sure . ' I said , ' If you want to help me , go get a doctor damned quick in the town . ' He says , ' I ca n't just leave you lying here busted up on the track . ' I told him to quit talking and to go get the doctor . And he run off and in a little while brought me a doctor and some men from the town . The doctor put me on the stretcher and they lifted me up . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ai n't but ten beds in it . And they wire the railroad office to rush a specialist from Chattanooga . This Chattanooga doctor comes and looks at my legs and belly . They was swollen like a balloon . And he takes me in the operating room . I was going unconscious . My head was spinning  --  Lord , the room was going round . But I could hear this doctor talking . He told the other one I was a goner . " This Chattanooga doctor come to me and says , ' Listen , can you hear me ? ' I said sure . He says , ' Then listen to what I 'm telling you . We sent a man in an automobile to fetch your family . If you 've got anything to say to them you 'd better say it when they get here . You ai n't going to be here tomorrow : , " I says , ' You think so ? ' " He says , know so . ' " I says , ' Hell , doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I says , ' Hell , doctor , I 'll be walking in six weeks , ' and 1 was . In just two days longer than six weeks I got out the bed and walked . And in eight weeks I walked out the hospital . " He told me of his days in the hospital . He had survived a grave operation and once , as his wife leaned over his bed , he had said : " Listen , I 'm in a sinking spell and about to die . Do n't do a thing now , do n't tell me a word , just run tell the doctor if he do n't pump blood in my veins damned quick I 'm a dead man . " The doctor came running . The tall man could feel life pouring in his veins as the transfusion was begun . " A few days after the operation when I begun to heal a little and it looked like I was n't going to die right offhand , this doctor comes to me and sets a bowl of plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' Hell , you 're not mixing that stuff to put on me , are you ? ' He said sure , I had to wear it , I was a dead man without a cast . I said I may be one without it but I sure was one with it . ' If you try to put that plaster on me , in this pain , I 'll roll out of this bed . ' I said , ' Look , doctor , I want to live . Just tell me what to do . But no plaster . If you want me to lie still here a month without moving , I know I got to do it . Just tell me . ' " ' By God , ' he says , ' I think you 're stubborn enough . ' " ' Just tell me . ' " He says , ' You got to lay fiat and not move for twenty-one days . One move will bust you wide open . ' " I says , ' Nothing 's going to bust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I laid there twenty-one days without a move . They put me on a bed that cranked open down the middle . And I laid there twenty-one days . The hot weather come . Sometimes I wished I had gone under them wheels . But I had n't . I never thought of quitting . It got to be a joke with me , living in spite of hell . My muscles cramped up and my belly swole out like this . I said to myself : ' I 'll lie here and put up with it . I done told that hard-headed doctor I ai n't going to move . ' And I laid there my twenty-one days . " " It must have been agony , " I said . He gazed into the distance and the cruel smile came into his face . " It was a pill , " he said . " I ai n't going to live very old , " he went on finally . " I got about fifteen years left . That will put me about seventy . My daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near as long as he did . They was happy in their old age too . I could have had me a long life . But this accident done me in . I just wore myself out in that hospital . But I picked my bones off this railroad track , and in six weeks I stood and walked , just like I said I would do . And the thought of it will give me satisfaction till I die . " He had said what he wanted to say . There was little more to talk about . We sat back in the seat dozing , swaying with the jolts of the coach . An hour or so later , in northern Tennessee , we arrived at his town . He had been striding back and forth across the washroom for a little while , trying to work the stiffness from his hips . When the train stopped he turned to me and said , " Well . " and picked up his cardboard suitcase and was gone . I went to the steps and saw him walk away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single electric globe lighted the station . I could see a macadam street , a movie house , a block of small stores , and I knew that beyond the town , stretching into the night , were the farms and woods , and at last the foothills .
