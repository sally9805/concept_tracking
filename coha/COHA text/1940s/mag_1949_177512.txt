Six months ago , Marshal Yen Hsi-shan , commander of besieged Taiyuan , kept 500 vials of poison in his office , swearing that he and his staff would kill themselves if the Communists took the city ( TIME , Nov. 15 ) . Last week the Reds held Taiyuan and the Marshal , unpoisoned and unbowed , was Premier of China . <P> He got the job by default . Last week , for the third time in six weeks , Premier Ho Ying-chin sent in his resignation . This time President Li Tsung-jen accepted it . Li submitted to a Legislative Yuan meeting at Canton the nomination of Elder Statesman Chu Cheng ( age 73 ) . Opposition included a woman legislator in slacks and a Hawaiian blouse , who yelled into a microphone : " He 's too old for the job . " Shocked oldsters came to Chu Cheng 's defense . Said one : " Chu Cheng can still climb the hundreds of stone steps leading up to Chungking . " The argument availed nothing . When Marshal Yen 's name was submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the barrel . " <P> All knew that President Li had been unable to get another candidate for the post , so Yen was confirmed . The Yuan members were more interested in a counter on one side of the meeting room above which was a sign : " Legislators planning to leave for Formosa must register here . " <P> Last week also brought news to Canton of the fall of Tsingtao , last Nationalist pocket in North China . South of the river Communist armies advanced without opposition . The Formosa registration counter did a brisk business .
