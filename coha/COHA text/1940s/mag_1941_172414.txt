Last week the Boston Bees , orphans of the National Baseball League , were adopted at last . Their orphanage dates back to 1935 , when Boston Grocer Charles Francis Adams ( not to be confused with onetime Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams , no kin ) took over controlling interest in the Boston Braves . Grocer Adams also owned Boston 's sumptuous Suffolk Downs race track . That made him , in the eyes of Baseball 's Tsar Kenesaw Mountain Landis , a greenbacked Satan . In governing baseball 's affairs , Judge Landis has always had one rigid rule : no one connected with horse racing may own a major-league ball club . <P> Ineligible to run the Braves , Turfman Adams forthwith got hardy Bob Quinn , onetime owner of the rival Boston Red Sox , to take charge of the club ( renamed the Bees ) until a suitable buyer could be found . But customers for a big-league ball club do not grow on trees . <P> Last week President Quinn finally announced the formation of a syndicate to buy Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , reputedly worth $350,000 . The 17 new owners , thoroughly acceptable to Judge Landis , include Casey Stengel , the Bees ' manager ; Max C. Meyer of Brooklyn , manufacturer of Richelieu pearls ; and Francis Ouimet , Boston 's idol who was recently exalted to golf 's brand-new Hall of Fame . With new working capital ( Judge Landis had forbidden Grocer Adams to put any more sugar into the club ) , the Bees may sprout new wings , buzz up out of the second division for the first time in seven years .
