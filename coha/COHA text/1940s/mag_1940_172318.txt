Gargantua , the gorilla , was the subject of a lot of speculation last week . Prize exhibit of Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey 's circus , this 550-lb. monster , with a nine-foot span between his outstretched hands , is the most terrifying beast in captivity . A vengeful misanthrope , he spends his days brooding in a glassed-in cage with chilled steel bars . Last week came reports that horrendous Gargantua is soon to have a mate . <P> John Ringling North , head man of Ringling Brothers , has long dreamed about a romance for Gargantua . Aside from its publicity value , it would be good business , if it worked . North values Gargantua at $100,000 , and it would be worth while to perpetuate the line . Fortnight ago Mr. North announced that he had found a fiancee . Weight : 438 Ib . Age : 8 . Her name was M'Toto . Her reputation and background were beyond reproach . Whether Gargantua would approve of her remained to be seen . <P> Mr. North found the unpretty creature in Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the pet of Mr. &; Mrs. Kenneth Hoyt . Eight years ago she was a two-month-old infant jouncing on her mother 's back around the jungles of French Equatorial Africa . Hoyt , who had retired from a U. S. Central Leather Co. job in Argentina to hunt big game , shot the infant 's gorilla father for a museum piece , and his guides slew Mother Gorilla for fun . The little puckered face of the infant won Mr. &; Mrs. Hoyt 's heart . They christened the orphan M'Toto ( Swahili for " Little Child " ) , and took her with them to Paris . There , though she had the services of good French pediatricians , M'Toto contracted double bronchopneumonia . When she finally recovered , the doting Hoyts decided to move to a warmer climate . Off they went to Havana . <P> In the garden of their $300,000 estate , they put up quarters for M'Toto : a combination playhouse and exercise room , a house with a living room and bedroom . M'Toto had a proper bed , with mattress and sheets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nickname ) embroidered on it . She learned to blow her nose properly with a handkerchief , count up to 15 , blow kisses and brush her teeth . Since Paris , she has not had a moment 's illness . <P> Mr. North would not divulge what he paid for MToto , but it was known that Mrs. Hoyt has turned down offers as high as $20,000 . M'Toto is devoted to her mistress , and whenever Mrs. Hoyt returns after a long absence beats her breast wildly , embraces Mrs. Hoyt in a mighty hug , laughs and grunts with joy . But Mrs. Hoyt agreed with Mr. North that his plan would probably be a good thing for both gorillas . <P> Last week , unaware of what was in store for her , M'Toto enjoyed her remaining days of maidenly independence . ( North 's plans were to transport her to Ringling Brothers ' winter quarters at Sarasota , Fla. some time in February . ) Under the eye of Keeper Tomas Vincente , who keeps her under control with an electrically charged rod , M'Toto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined alfresco at a garden table .
