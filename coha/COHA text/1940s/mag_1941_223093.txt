Last week another Greek completed a trip that made the Odyssey seem a beeline . This voyager was Christos Diamantopoulos , Greek Minister to Russia , who was asked to leave his post when Russia withdrew diplomatic recognition of Greece as a gesture to her then friend Adolf Hitler . His departure was finally arranged after Hitler invaded the U.S.S.R. <P> Mr. Diamantopoulos , routed to Athens via Siberia , found the tedious ten-day train ride much duller than Odysseus ' wanderings . From his window he saw no Sirens , Circes or Cyclopes , only desolate sidings and troop trains drumming west . <P> This week , stopping at his first island , Japan , Mr. Diamantopoulos wondered what next , for his Odyssey made even less sense than the original . He was 5,000 miles farther from home than when he started , and there now seemed no reason why he , a fellow victim of the Nazis , should have started at all .
