John L. Might Be Half-Right <P> Sirs : <P> To a browned-out , hamstrung nation , TIME May 13 eruditely announces that cities are running short of power , plants are shutting down , things are in a hell of a state . Your leading article . . . quotes an ominous John L. Lewis and two wrathful Senators , contains not a word about specific issues or facts involved . . . . <P> Before the public can be expected to exert its force of opinion , it wants to know who is being unreasonable , what steps can be taken to resolve the dilemma , how to get the coal dug and on fire . . . . <P> Those of us who work for a living are somewhat loth to believe that labor is responsible for all our nation 's ills . . . . John L. might possibly be more than a " master strategist " possibly ( with your implications a that his " master maneuvers are aimed straight at our liberties ) . He might even-oh , sacrilege-prove to be half-right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> . . . Your great magazine , under the heading . . . " Back of the Barn " TIME , May 6 . . . made this statement : " The technique : buying from individuals in auto-jammed Detroit , selling to the auto-hungry mid-South through auction outlets in sleepy Cairo , Ill. , and sleepier Murray , Ky. ? <P> Who told you . . . that Murray was sleepy ? How did you arrive at the conclusion that Murray is sleepier than Cairo , Ill. ? Have you or any of your roving " asses of the barn " ever been to Murray , Ky. ? <P> It appears that you . . . crawled up into the haymow in the loft and went to sleep . And , in your journalistic slumber , your uninformed , vague subconscious mind caused you to use the adjective " sleepier " about the most wide-awake town in Kentucky . <P> If you or any of your high-powered fact-finding sensation mongers would like to visit this " sleepier " town , the Chamber of Commerce will pay your fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Southern fried chicken and hickory-cured Kentucky ham with all the trimmings , and , what is more , we 'll even try to wear our shoes while you are here . . . <P> MAX B. HURT <P> Executive Secretary <P> Chamber of Commerce <P> Murray , Ky . <P> <P> The free fare sounds fine-but soporific. - ED . <P> <P> Woman in the House <P> Sirs : <P> I very much want to let you know with how much interest , admiration and appreciation I have read the article on The Netherlands TIME , May 13 . ... Your associates have done a splendid job , for not only have they accurately reported on the present temper of the country , but they also have caught quite a lot of the permanent essence of the Dutch nation , and expressed it in a very readable form . . . . <P> E. N. VAN KLEFFENS <P> Delegate of The Netherlands <P> United Nations Security Council <P> New York City <P> Super Turbo-Encabulator <P> Sirs : <P> Being of the engineering profession , I was impressed by the profundity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 15 ... in which the veil of secrecy was partially drawn from the " Turbo-Encabulator.
