txt Our New Army instructor explains that the assistant engineer ordinarily would be in the belly turret , but they 're not using it . All of a sudden there is a flash of shadow and a fighter whips from under the Fortress in a sharp , climbing turn . The four big ships have tightened their formation and the fighters are playing round them like incredibly swift dolphins round a school of sleepy whales . The fighters come from everywhere at once , and the gunners back in the belly of the ship are very busy , and the turret behind you swings smoothly from right to left and the guns follow the fighters down in their dives , shifting quickly from one to another . You can see the guns of the other Fortresses converge with yours on one fighter after another and you look at that tremendous fire power and calculate that you would not like to be in one of those fighters if they were really shooting . Fortresses in formation are poison . After an exhibition of skillful flying any carnival crowd would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the fighters pull away in the clouds and the bombers fly on toward their target . You go back to the bombardier 's office to see how it 's going to be done . You do not see the targets because you do not know where to look for them and the airplane is 40 The Bomber Team flying an erratic and wavering course . The bombardier shifts a lever to a position marked " salvo " and puts a finger on a switch . An amber light goes off and a green one comes on , meaning the pilot has started his bomb run , and the bombardier , very intent now , is glued to his sight . Then his finger flips the switch and you feel the airplane bounce just a little and then it swings widely and banks and you can see the bombs falling and now you can spot the targets , white splotches on the water . After an eternity the bombs splash among the targets and bombs from the other Fortresses already are in the air . On the way back the fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush with them before they swarm away and leave you to the peaceful business of winging home again . Eight hours after you left you are back and the Fortress swoops down to the runway and taxies up to the line and the crew climbs out and stretches its legs and holds a post-mortem on the mission . All practice bombing is not so involved . Ordinarily , the planes go out to a bombing range loaded with dummy bombs and fly back and forth over the same target while the bombardier drops one bomb at a time . This gives pilots and bombardier the practice they need to make their functions dovetail perfectly and add up to hits . 41 Our New Army In ordinary practice bombing , the pilots approach the target on a straight run , fly over it and then turn back and fly over again , their course a series of wide arcs which intersect over the target and describe a four-leaf-clover pattern in the sky . This gives them and the bombardier a different approach each time and a bomb run from a different direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives student officers experience in administration . They and the enlisted students are organized into squadrons with commanders , executives , adjutants and all the other functionaries of military organization . But flying and fighting is the central theme . Here the Army is building teams to fly and fight the big bombers now going into production in the nation 's new factories . When the planes are ready , the crews will be too . And these crews , soon to be turned out at the rate of 150 a month , will be trained for the sort of warfare America wants to wage . They will be trained to carry the fight to the enemy . 42 IV The Man on Foot ? New Style HERE on the pine-clad Georgia hills around Camp Wheeler thousands of young Americans have learned that today 's foot soldier is a complicated and highly specialized part of the war machine . The selectee comes here to the Army 's largest Infantry Replacement Center straight from civil life . He has been uniformed and classified and taught a few rudiments of soldiering at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his foot on the road to learning the doughboy 's trade and he finds it full of surprises . This is nothing like what he expected . There is no charging in line with bugles urging him on and flags waving over him . There are no extensive and intricate systems of trenches and dugouts like those his father may have told him of in some nostalgic moment . He finds himself almost as far from 1918 as he is from the muzzle-loading muskets of 1861 . Here he is taught nothing but what will enable him to inflict the utmost damage on his enemy with the least possible danger to himself . Squads right 43 Our New Army and squads left have no place in his curriculum ; he is taught no fancy formations , no spectacular maneuvers , no drill at all that he can not use to his advantage when he is face to face with an experienced , determined and ruthless foe . What will be drilled into him eight hours a day , six days a week for thirteen weeks will be knowledge he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that is all he will need to win this war . From the time he steps from the train here , a raw and awkward recruit , until he leaves at the end of thirteen weeks to join a regiment in the field , he will have absorbed an amazing number of things for which he had no preparation whatever . He will have learned to handle and care for and fire the modern foot soldier 's twelve deadly automatic weapons . He will have learned to take care of himself wherever chance drops him and to live for weeks with what he can carry on his back . He will have learned to make his rifle a part of himself and to care for it as diligently as he must care for the two feet he must depend upon to take him where he wants to go . He will have learned to move , Indian fashion , without being discovered and to permit no living thing to move within his range of perception and go undetected . 44 The Man on Foot ? New Style When he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army of the United States and that means he will be the equal , in training and in weapons , of any soldier on earth , physically fit , healthy and ready for the experience which will make him absolute tops as a fighting man . Established in March , 1941 , as an Infantry Replacement Center , Camp Wheeler rose among the crumbling remains of a camp built in World War days and named for the Confederacy 's Fighting Joe Wheeler . The first selectees for the new Army arrived March 15 , 1941 , and started their thirteen weeks ' training . At the end of that period , the first batch was shipped off to the Forty-third Division at Camp Blanding , Florida . Since then , thousands more have gone out to other infantry outfits or have remained here to train those who came in later drafts . Every thirteen weeks now , many thousands more are sent to the Army , hardened , wise in the ways of war , ready to look out for themselves wherever they may be called upon to serve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from infantry regiments throughout the Army . An enlisted cadre of 2200 came with them , of whom only 10 per cent now remain ; the places of the other 90 per cent have been taken by selectees trained here and trained so well that they have been retained to train others . 45 Our New Army Not all of the officers here now are those who came to Camp Wheeler in the first consignment . Some arrived in the first and second drafts as selectees , finished their training , went on to Officer Candidate Schools and earned their commissions . Now they are back where they got their first taste of soldiering , wearing bars on their shoulders and exercising command on the same ground where once they were homesick rookies learning the rudiments of a strange new trade . In almost the same fashion Camp Wheeler itself has grown . Not long ago it shared with the rest of the Army the makeshift equipment imposed upon it by failure of the nation to keep pace with the Army 's growth . It held classes on benches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three worn-out engines together to make one that would run and three broken-down chassis together to make one fit for demonstration and study . As Camp Wheeler grew it turned out soldiers . They had to take turns using the few machine guns and the few mortars and the very few antitank guns available for training . But they got along and they learned and the regiments which got them in the process of building up to war strength were delighted with their knowledge and their soldierly bearing . 46 The Man on Foot ? New Style Camp Wheeler is booming along now , well equipped and well staffed . Its classes are conducted in buildings built and equipped for the purpose or over ground recently purchased and ideally suited to infantry combat training . Every trainee becomes thoroughly familiar , by constant association and use , with the weapons he will fight with in battle or the tools he will employ to help his fellows fight . Men who will be sent to rifle companies fire the Garand rifle and the automatic rifle and the light machine gun and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assigned to heavy-weapons companies train with the heavy machine guns and the heavy 81-millimeter mortars they will deal with in their regiments . Antitank men have real antitank guns , not dummies , with which they maneuver and which they fire at moving targets . Every man learns every weapon , so whatever happens in battle he can function wherever he finds himself . And all are taught enough of minor battlefield tactics to take command of a squad if that should become necessary . With all his knowledge of weapons and how to use them and himself in battle , the doughboy of today can not stop there and call himself competent to fight in modern war . The infantry regiment is a 47 Our New Army complicated entity which must carry within itself the means to do , without help from the outside , any job which falls to its hand . It must move itself and feed itself and keep its frequently scattered elements in touch with each other and with the headquarters which binds them into one . And as that is true of the regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the regiment itself is an element . So today 's doughboy must be a truck driver and a motor mechanic . He must be a cook and a radio operator and a bugler and a small-arms repairman and a telephone lineman and a switchboard operator . He must be able to build the roads and bridges over which he moves and keep them in repair , and build fortifications to protect himself and destroy fortifications the enemy has set up for his own protection . Intelligence of the enemy 's situation must be gathered and interpreted , voluminous records must be kept and considerable correspondence maintained . All these things the foot soldier must do , and at Camp Wheeler he learns how to do them . Up to a certain point all trainees here go through the same instruction . They are taught to be soldiers , to accept discipline as an institution for their own efficiency , to care for their infantry weapons and to be able to hit with them what they wish to hit . 48 The Man on Foot ? New Style After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into different specialties . While the men who will fight in the line companies go on to become experts in their weapons and tactics , other men are set aside for training in the special jobs which hold an infantry regiment together , keep it going and enable the man with the bayonet to get where he needs to go and stay there as long as he wants to stay . These men are chosen on the basis of what classification tests reveal of their intelligence , their civilian experience which may be useful to the Army , their aptitude for tasks peculiar to the needs of modern infantry . When they have finished their schooling here they will be ready for assignment to headquarters companies and service companies of infantry regiments and to headquarters companies on up through divisions and corps and armies . There are thousands of them here now , young men from a score of states , middle-aged men who have volunteered to do a job they feel must be done before the families they left behind can ever be safe . There are veterans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them fighting mad . They are mad at the Japanese . They include Germany in their calculations , all right , but they want to get at the Japs . They are mad clear through 49 Our New Army at the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor , at Japanese ruthlessness , at what they conceive to be the insolence of the weakling playing the bully because there 's a big fellow on his side . Ask them what they want most to do in the Army . Almost invariably the answer is : " Get me a Jap " It is a personal matter with them ; they are in the war , whether they got in by draft or volunteered , to do what they individually can to win it . There is the case , for instance , of a thirty-seven-year-old volunteer who is pulling wires to help his son , seventeen , enlist and join him . Watch them training and you are struck with the sense of the importance of what they 're doing and the urgency to get it done . When a battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens along and lunches in the field to save time . After the first few weeks of short marches for hardening , hikes are overnight affairs . And everything they do , from hikes to firing on the combat range , is turned into a tactical problem . They do n't go on an overnight hike ; they move up to the front or change positions in a division sector , always going into concealed bivouacs , always blacked-out , always in the presence of the enemy . And they learn as they go along , little things which some day will be very big things to them . 50 The Man on Foot ? New Style There was a battalion in bivouac during the course of a four-day march away from camp . The men in this battalion , like those in all the others , have been lectured repeatedly on how to make a bivouac , how to pitch their shelter tents , how to take sanitary and other precautions . Now they are putting into practice what they have been told . Nobody has been ordered to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been laid out and they have been instructed to find places under cover for concealment from enemy aircraft ; otherwise they are left to their own choice in the matter . One soldier has set up his pup tent down a gully which would become a roaring torrent and sweep tent , man and all his effects along with it should a heavy rain come . " I 've been wishing it would rain , " said his battalion commander . " That 's all he needs to teach him never again to pitch his tent in a place like that . " The battalion was scheduled to march out that night , move to another area and bivouac in total blackout . " When they wake up tomorrow , " said their commander , " they 'll look around them and see what kind of places they got into and will they be surprised . They 'll learn how much different a place looks at night than in daylight . They 've got to learn because they 'll pick many a place to sleep in black-S1 Our New Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any better way to teach them than let them figure it out for themselves . " Go and watch a company advancing to attack through a dense hilly woods , scarred with little patches which once were plowed fields and barricaded by belts of heavy underbrush . The company commander has soldiers going ahead , " points " like fingers held out before a man moving in a dark room . The main body follows behind , walking cautiously , taking cover behind trees , stopping to listen for sounds ahead , watching for signals from their squad leaders . They look very businesslike walking slowly through the mottled woods . Stop a man on point and ask him what he 's doing . " I 'm a point off the right flank , " he tells you . " We think the enemy is somewhere in those woods ahead and the points in front will make contact with him . This is an interior company and we 're the right platoon and I 'm supposed to keep contact with the company on our right . " - You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes so small a part and you ask him how long he 's been in the Army . " This is my fifth week , " he tells you . If you walk over to your left you will find the main body , scattered through the woods so no more 52 The Man on Foot ? New Style than three or four men are visible at one time . They have stopped walking and you go on ahead to find the platoon commander , a young second lieutenant who tells you he started at Wheeler as a draftee . He has halted the platoon until he hears from his points who are worming their way through the dense tangle of underbrush ahead , and pretty soon he hears from them . A lot of shouting breaks out on the left front and the lieutenant makes a signal and part of his men move off that way . We make all that noise so the men can learn how attack will come suddenly from unexpected places , " he explains . " They 've got to learn to look for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending its men by squads to fire the Garand rifle at manshaped targets set up on a hillside across a shallow valley . The men are issued live ammunition halfway to the firing line but do not load their rifles ; they creep up to the line , taking advantage of stumps and brush and little gullies for cover , their instructors caustically criticizing their technique all the while . Then they load and fire , move off , and the next squad goes through the same routine . For men who find it difficult to learn the few facings and marching maneuvers a soldier must know these days , a section of paved roadway has 53 Our New Army been marked off with white and yellow footprints , like a dance-by-mail chart , showing foot positions for every movement . In the school for men who will be assigned to service companies and headquarters companies , ingenuity went even farther in the days when equipment was so scarce and the need so great . Here men are taught to be radio operators , rough carpenters , armorers , telephone linemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks , buglers , pioneers and intelligence scouts . For the buglers , a row of small buildings has been put up far from the center of camp , where they may sound their calls without disturbing each other or anyone else . The pioneers have erected a fortification area and have built roads and bridges throughout the camp , including a bridge to shorten their own walk from class to mess and back . Radio men are trained in a school which permits each man to progress as fast as his prior training and natural aptitude permit . Telephone linemen string wires on poles set in the woods and lead them into switchboards . Auto mechanics work on demonstration motors and chassis and keep the camp 's vehicles in repair . Drivers are put through a grueling session on a course replete with hills and devoid of roads . Cooks perfect their trade in the mess halls of other training battalions . Message center men 54 The Man on Foot ? New Style organize and conduct battalion , regimental and division message centers . Then , for a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march away from camp . The drivers operate in convoys over highways , country roads and the congested streets of near-by Macon . Buglers serve as road guides ; cooks feed the men from gasfired field ranges ; mechanics service the vehicles on the march ; every night a headquarters is set up and telephones and radio placed in operation ; pioneers build roads into bivouacs and make bridges across roadside ditches . Every man performs for a week , in maneuvers involving over 30,000 vehicle miles , the job he will be called upon to perform when he gets into a regiment . On top of all that , after long dusty marches , after weary days on the road with convoys , after hours of feeling their way through the woods in full fighting gear , these men ask for more . As soon as camp is made out comes baseball and football equipment and they go on playing as strenuously as they have worked . They are hard and tough and fit . They are making soldiers at Camp Wheeler , soldiers with the knowledge and the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGIA , is the place where blitzkrieg is bred , where tough young men are made tougher and are taught to launch themselves from the skies in sudden devastating attacks on an enemy 's most vulnerable places . Parachute troops are infighters of the fiercest kind . They must be first-class fighting men first of all ; their specially equipped airplanes and their parachutes are simply a means of placing them where they can fight inside an enemy 's guard and tie him in knots before he knows what hit him . By association with paratroopers you learn some things about them you might not have suspected . You learn that : ? They get airsick just like anybody else . They look on their dangerous profession as pretty soft in comparison with that of the infantry soldier who has to walk to battle and live in the mud and stand up against ceaseless attempts to kill him . No man who has ever refused to jump can remain in the paratroops , no matter what the rest of his record has been . 56 Paratroops A very large proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they entered the Army . Parachute troops are trained at Fort Benning literally from the ground up and prominent landmarks on this sprawling post are two towers , 250 feet high , from which they take their first jumps , and the dummy airplanes used by them and their allies , the air-borne infantry , in learning their trade . As paratroopers and air-borne infantry work together behind the enemy lines they train together here at Fort Benning . Air-borne infantry regiments are assigned to that work just as other regiments are designated as motorized or amphibian . Paratroopers are all volunteers , men of long infantry service , or selectees who have completed their basic training at some replacement center like Camp Wheeler . They decide they would like to be parachuters and volunteer for the job . The reasons which impel them to take this important step are varied . Some volunteer simply because they want the $50 a month extra paid qualified parachute soldiers . There are some who are impressed by the paratrooper 's silver badge which he wears over his heart like a pilot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parachute in a blue disc on his cap . 57 Our New Army A few like the thrill of flying and jumping . A few more want to get into the war the quickest and the surest way and they believe this is it . They volunteer and are sent here to take the paratrooper 's rigorous course of training which is all work and hard work and hardens them while it teaches them to use muscles they do n't know they 've got . And as they go through their punishing course of physical training and learn to fold their parachutes under any conditions , they are being taught to jump without tangling in their apparatus , to land without hurting themselves , and to get rid of their chutes and go into action in split seconds . It is heartening to record that most of the young Americans who come here to learn this business which requires so much in strength and endurance and courage finish the course and win their badges and boots . And of those who do fail , 75 per cent go out through no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failures are due to the soldier 's inability to develop the mental and muscular co-ordination necessary to the paratrooper 's work or because he can not learn to pack his chute or because of some temperamental difficulty which has nothing to do with courage . Another 25 per cent lose out because the grueling physical training uncovers some physical defect 58 Paratroops which makes the soldier unsuitable for parachute fighting but does not prevent his serving as a combat soldier on the ground . Then come those , only 25 per cent of the total , who quit of their own volition . They include only 5 per cent who wo n't jump after they have completed their preliminary training and are taken aloft to qualify . The largest proportion of those , 15 per cent of the total failures , are men who " change their minds " after they have begun primary parachute training . Their reasons are many but they add up to the fact that they just do n't want any part of parachuting . The remaining S per cent give miscellaneous reasons for falling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something pathetic about the S per cent who refuse to jump . They go through the course , often with enthusiasm and with high grades . Then they get up in an airplane for their first jump , form in line with their rip straps attached to the cable which runs the length of the cabin and run for the door on the signal to jump . When they reach the door something akin to stage fright seizes them . They freeze there , both feet and both hands braced against the door frame , and the men running behind them pile up against them and the line halts . And there they stand , faces frozen 59 Our New Army in fear , until they are pulled away . They are never allowed to attempt a jump again . " Maybe they are n't scared , " said a paratrooper who had just made his qualifying jump . " Maybe something just hits them that time and they would be all right every time afterward . But we ca n't take any chances . " Suppose we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as a handkerchief . Everything would be timed to the split second and if one guy held up the line only long enough to take a breath some fellows would miss the field and the whole attack might fail . " It is a peculiar thing that some men make their first and second jumps without hesitation and then freeze on the third or fourth . Out they go , exactly like the man who balked his first jump , and once in a great while some veteran of scores of jumps freezes at the door for no apparent reason . He goes out , too , finished with parachuting . They are in a delicate and desperate business , one in which every man 's life may depend upon every other man . There is no room for any man whose momentary failure might mean the failure of a mission and death or capture for himself and his comrades . If you want to see how they do it , go along with two squads making the last of their five jumps to 60 Paratroops qualify as full-fledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coveted wings , the high boots and the extra $50 a month which will make them wealthy by comparison with other men on Army pay . It is an important occasion and they are a little nervous about it and keep up a barrage of grim jokes as they take their places on the aluminum seats facing the aisle like passengers on an oldfashioned streetcar . They are still wearing the cumbersome plastic helmets of students , with soft leather bibs hanging from their chins like the square beard of Rameses to protect their necks from being burned by the fifteen-foot canvas strap which opens the parachute . When we finish this jump , " one of them explains , glad to make conversation , " we can take these things off . They 're afraid we 'll forget to keep our chins down . " When they have finished this jump , they also can substitute the paratrooper 's cloth helmet for the bulky plastic affair they wear now and the paratrooper 's boots for the socks they have pulled up over the legs of their coveralls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army has been able to devise . They have spent half their time in vigorous exercise ; they have learned tumbling and they have jumped from 61 Our New Army increasing heights until they made free jumps from the 250-foot tower , and they have jumped four times from airplanes . They all talk at once as the big plane rumbles off down a runway and thunders into the air . When it has circled and come back at 1250 feet to the field onto which they will jump , the first twelve men are ordered to stand up . They hook their rip straps to the steel static cable overhead and wait , slightly crouched and huddled together like spoons in a box . An instructor lies in the doorway and watches the field ; he raises a hand . Another instructor slaps the first man in line on the bottom and yells Out you go , " and the man is gone at once , his voice blown back screaming " One thousand ? two thousand ? three thousand . " Before the " one " is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and the next and the next , so fast that the line is trotting along the cabin floor before the fourth man is gone . The plane circles again and the last twelve men line up the same way and pile out the door . You can see them floating down as the plane circles for a landing , dangling from their risers , their badges and boots and $50 safe . This one thousand ? two thousand ? three thousand " business is almost the varsity yell of the primary parachute school . Every paratrooper must 62 Paratroops remember to count three seconds after he jumps and then , if his chute has not caught him up , to pull the ripcord on the emergency chute strapped to his lap . You see them making their first jumps from the machines rigged up to teach them and you hear an unending overtone of yelps which you interpret as this counting , excited , hurried and sometimes cut off abruptly by surprise at what the machine does to them . Not all instruction is by aid of machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he gets to the machines which will make him hard as nails or wear him out . Every student , officer or enlisted man goes through the same course , physical exercise , machine training , parachute packing and jumping . They get the same treatment and are graded exactly alike and each takes his chances with the other . Physical training during the first couple of weeks is divided equally with parachute packing . Four hours a day the students do calisthenics , practise jujitsu and wrestling , tumble on mats indoors and jump from low stands outdoors . Every day they run five miles in full uniform and they run to and from classes , growing tougher day by day . The remaining four hours of each day are devoted to packing the parachutes on which their work and their lives depend . They learn to pack them almost 63 Our New Army by instinct , on long polished tables , on the ground , under any circumstances which might overtake them in combat . And they learn to pack them so they can strap them on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off low platforms , the student paratrooper goes to a machine designed like the side of a transport airplane with the door gone , placed forty feet from the ground . He straps himself into a parachute harness suspended by slack risers from a pulley on a steel cable and , at a slap from an instructor , jumps , yelling One thousand . . . " He falls the length of the risers and is snatched upright and rides the pulley to the ground . On another machine the student is suspended on a set of risers facing backward and rides down an inclined cable , turning himself to face forward as he goes . Near the ground , an instructor pulls a release which drops him and he strikes the ground moving and rolls over , learning to land in a wind without injury . From these simple machines the student goes to the hill where the two 250-foot towers stand , each with four spidery arms projecting from its top . On one tower he is given a couple of rides sitting in a chairlike support attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he has graduated from this he goes to another place on the same tower 64 Paratroops where he is buckled into a parachute harness and hauled up , lying horizontal and face down , about halfway to the top . At an order from the instructor he pulls a ripcord and drops the length of the risers , bringing up with a jolt which startles him out of his wits and ends abruptly the " One thousand ? two thousand ... " he has started . By the time he has finished his course on this machine he is familiar with the shock of a chute opening and has been convinced that when it does open he has been brought up by the risers well within three seconds . Men of the Eighty-eighth Infantry , the air-borne regiment in training here , went through the course on this machine . It was no part of their course in loading and unloading their equipment from airplanes . They did it because they wanted to see what it was like . After he has finished with this tower , which also includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student goes over to the next tower . There he is hauled to the end of one of its four arms and is dropped in a parachute which floats free and lands him exactly as he will land from a plane . This done , he goes to a wind machine and is placed in front of it , lying on the ground , with a parachute held open to the blast . When he is turned loose , the chute blows along the ground and he rolls 65 Our New Army over and straightens himself out and gets to his feet and runs round the chute to spill its air . No matter how he lands , in what sort of wind , he has learned to get himself on his feet and free of his parachute . Fully trained on these machines , the student makes his five jumps from a plane and is qualified as a jumper and goes on to a parachute battalion where his training continues with daily jumps . The difference here is that every jump he makes from now on has meaning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and which duplicates as nearly as possible what he will do in battle . He jumps from now on with his full equipment , with pistol and rifle and submachine gun . When he lands , he gets out of his chute as quickly as possible and moves on to perform some task which is a very important part of the mission his battalion has been ordered to accomplish . He may be taking an enemy airport or landing behind an enemy front to disrupt his communications or capture his general or flank his line of resistance . From now on he is all business . Suppose you go along with the 503rd Parachute Battalion on such a mission . As a matter of fact , you learn , the battalion is testing some new equipment . But they have made a tactical maneuver out of the test and they pile their equipment aboard the plane and climb on after it and you get in with them . The plane takes off and turns southward . 66 Paratroops If you show some interest in what the battalion is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maps and spread them on the cabin floor and explain , while interested paratroopers hold down the corners to keep the maps from blowing away in the gale coming through the open door . You understand that the battalion has been ordered to take an air field and will land on scattered fields far to the south until an appointed time and then fly back over swamps inaccessible to antiaircraft guns , rendezvous some distance from the field and come over the field in formation , dropping their men on a balloon hangar . This , the operations officer explains , gives them training in precision landing and teaches them to take care of themselves in difficult spots , one of which he concedes the top of a balloon hangar to be . The air is rough , so rough that the men inside the plane are tossed and shaken and thrown from one side of the cabin to the other , no matter how grimly they hold onto things . The plane 's violent contortions are magnified by the nearness to the ground ; you are flying under 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barns , leaping over haystacks , skimming above the low pine trees and the watery swamps . Four of the enlisted men are lying on their bellies with their heads at the door , their long bodies spread 67 Our New Army fanwise into the cabin . They are vastly interested in what is passing below and now and then a scrap of their conversation floats up to you through the roaring of the wind . A small farm rushes by and a wisp of conversation reaches you from the men at the door . " Mac , " says one of them , " do n't that make you homesick ? " The plane roars on and after a while you are over the field where you were to wait before flying back to meet the others . The pilot flies over it a few times and decides the field is too muddy for his big ship so it stays up , waiting until time to start back . It is very rough . After a while you notice the others in the cabin are looking with furtive grins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inwardly disturbed . The conversation turns to casual remarks about airsickness and the plane 's erratic behavior and the man with the greenish face gets up and gropes his way aft . It is very funny and everybody laughs and kids him a lot when he comes back looking no happier , and then all of a sudden another man jumps up and makes a break for the rear . Before forty-five minutes have passed most of them have made the trip aft and nobody is kidding anybody any more and they all look as if they 'd be glad for the trip to end . Finally the end comes . 68 Paratroops The officer in command speaks quietly ? it is hardly an order ; and officers and men get up , squirm into their complicated harness with men helping officers and officers helping men , attach their rip straps to the cable overhead and stand waiting . A red light burns over the door and when the pilot switches it to green , the first man shouts " Let 's go " and steps off . The plane is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 100 miles an hour , just above its stalling speed . They go out so rapidly the plane is cleared in a matter of seconds and an officer who has remained behind pulls the dangling rip straps back into the cabin . There has been no excitement , no tenseness ; the jump has been made as casually as you might step from your automobile at the corner drugstore . One thing outstanding about the paratroops is that their officers always take all the chances first . If a new piece of equipment is to be tested , the officers jump with it first ; if a battalion is to make its initial jump at night , the officers go out first . And everybody in a parachute outfit jumps ? the chaplain , the doctors , the adjutant and the cooks and the K.P . ' s and the clerks . When the paratroops have landed ( they call it " riding down " ) and have taken an airport , they are followed by air-borne infantry whose big planes 69 Our New Army land on the captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy weapons . From that point on the battle is developed like any other and sooner or later the paratroops and the air-borne infantry are joined by the slow foot troops for whom they have prepared the way and the communiques read , " An assault led by air-borne forces gained important objectives . " However glamorous paratroops may seem to the layman , the men who have become veterans in the business look upon the ordinary doughboy as an unfortunate chap with many burdens to bear . " A lot of fellows come in this outfit , " said one of them at Benning , " because it 's the life of Riley . We go out and capture some place the generals want and then we go back and take it easy way behind the lines until they want us again . " Yes , it 's a soft life . 70 VI Officers in Training PRIVATE MURPHY will never make a soldier . But Private Murphy is a valuable man . He is doing one of the Army 's most important jobs ? he is helping the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers who will lead American soldiers in battle . You know men like Murphy . He never learns anything because he wo n't stop showing off what he thinks he knows long enough to learn . It is that quality in Murphy the Army finds so useful in its Infantry School here , where superior enlisted men are made into officers and officers are made ready for larger responsibilities . Murphy is not his real name . His real name may be Tsieschiewicz or Palazzo or Smith , and he 's not so dumb as he acts . In fact , the man who plays Private Murphy must be a smart fellow , able to learn all the wrong answers and give them with conviction and act out his part like Murphy himself . Military lore is taught here at Fort Benning largely by demonstration , on the principle that 71 Our New Army there is a right way to do everything and a wrong way , and the right way is the Army 's way . Murphy knows the wrong way and he never hesitates to bare his knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him carry away a thorough knowledge of what not to do as well as what to do , which is just about all there is to know about anything . The Infantry School , with its method of teaching by demonstration , is a comparatively ancient institution in the Army . Established as the School of Musketry shortly after the Spanish-American War , it was moved to Columbus , Georgia , in 1918 and to its present 150,000-acre site in 1919 . After twentythree years of leisurely progress , instilling principles of infantry tactics in officers , many of whom now hold high points in the Army , the Infantry School in 1940 took a new lease on life . Its history since then has been that of the whole Army , expanding and expanding again , spreading its knowledge and its training to incredible limits . Since September , 1940 , the Infantry School has expanded to 100 times its normal capacity . Then it was graduating 500 officers a year in all classes ; now it graduates 50,000 a year , almost 200 every academic day . The course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensed and intensified . Where , 72 Officers in Training in September , 1940 , its population was 1,000 students at a time , this will soon be increased to 17,000 . Most important phase of its work is training enlisted men from organizations in the field , and from Infantry Replacement Centers like Camp Wheeler , to be officers . The school 's motto is " Follow Me , " it teaches officers to lead , not drive ; it sends them out imbued with the principle that an officer can and will do anything he asks his men to do ; it teaches him his profession so well that he not only can tell a soldier what to do , he can tell him how to do it and show him , if need be . These officer candidates in the main are young men , just finished with their replacement center training . Among them is a sprinkling of gray heads and weather-beaten faces , veteran noncommissioned officers of the Regular Army or former soldiers in whom the Army has discerned the qualities of leadership it needs so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are noncommissioned officers when they come here ; perhaps they are privates with the dust of replacement centers hardly out of their hair . In either case they become " mister " when they enter the Officer Candidate School . Noncoms take off their stripes ( but keep their pay ) and all of them , noncom or private , are entitled to wear on their uniforms a disc with the letters " OSC . " They 73 Our New Army are addressed as " sir " by officers and men alike ; they rank as cadets until they have graduated and may pin the gold bars of a second lieutenant to the shoulder straps of their brand-new blouses . Some of them hold college degrees ; some have never seen a college . Formal education is not what the Army needs now . It needs the ability to lead and the ability to learn and it discovers these qualities in its men by intelligence tests and aptitude tests which it has found remarkably effective so far . Failures are comparatively few . Officer candidates are graded as they go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own class . Throughout the course graded tests are held at intervals in classrooms and in the field . These tests count considerably in a candidate 's standing . But the major test is his ability to get along with his fellows during their thirteen weeks of ceaseless labor , of living together and working together , when nerves and tempers are frayed by weariness and anxiety . On this basis , the candidates grade each other from the beginning of the course until it ends . It is a method which works both ways ; if one candidate gives consistently poor grades to another who is graded well by the balance of the class , the candidate giving the poor grades may be suspected of inability 74 Officers in Training to overcome his personal predilections in choosing men for leaders . Whatever their rank may have been before coming here , the candidates are given an opportunity to exercise command and assume its responsibilities . They are organized into companies of four platoons each and acting company officers and noncommissioned officers are assigned from their own ranks , each holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen weeks ' course , every candidate gets the feel of command in preparation for the months of command ahead of him . In the rest of the school are officers of infantry regiments who have been sent here from the field for an intensive course which will fit them for the promotions which have been coming rapidly as the Army has grown . These are junior officers chiefly , from the National Guard and the Reserve , most of whom already have served with their outfits in the field . They come here wearing the insignia of every infantry division in the Army , go through a course similar to that of the officer candidates , with some additional higher tactics thrown in , and return to their regiments ready to move ahead into the next higher post . Almost all their schooling here is received in the field ? handling troops , serving as troops themselves or observing demonstrations by trained men 75 Our New Army from three infantry regiments stationed at Benning . For instance , officer candidates are given 208 hours ' instruction in the employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to classroom lectures and 193 to field work , with 8 set aside for graded tests . In receiving 188 hours ' instruction in tactics , the candidate spends only 14 hours in the classroom and in 129 hours of general subjects , which includes most of the theoretical part of his prospective work , 36 are devoted to the classroom and the rest to field practice . It is in providing the demonstrations which make up so large a part of the candidate 's schooling that Private Murphy 's imp of ineptitude prods him to make his invaluable contribution to the Army . An officer candidate class is seated on bleachers overlooking one of the dozens of areas suitable for demonstrating some phase of infantry fighting . This class is undergoing instruction in scouting and patrolling and the field in front , slashed across by a deep ravine , spotted with little clumps of secondgrowth trees , is empty of any man-made thing except an old log cabin and a broken-down Army truck . It is one of the features of training here that the officer candidates are altogether spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 76 Officers in Training ostensibly being trained in scouting and patrolling ; actually the doughboys have been drilled carefully in their roles . Each man has a part to play and Private Murphy is one of them . The officer-instructor asks the men of the 124th to point out any soldiers they can find in the rugged landscape in front of them . They pick out a few ? in the log cabin , behind the truck , in a tree or two , behind thick pine stumps . Then they say there are no more men out there and the officer blows a whistle and four soldiers get up from the ground within 100 yards of the bleachers ; they have been camouflaged in gunny sacks . The instructor asks one of the soldiers , who has spotted most of the men discovered , how he found them . His answer is a classic of simple logic . " Well , " he says , " I looked out there and I seen ' em . " The platoon and the class are dismissed for a ten-minute rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They collect around it and one of them reaches up to take it down . A terrific explosion scatters them to a respectful distance from the gun and the tree . " That is the way a booby trap works , " explains the instructor . " You pick up some innocent-looking object and then they pick you up . " Everywhere they turn the young men are learn-77 Officers in Training stands it . Other men of the platoon get up and give correct answers and demonstrate properly the things Murphy has done wrong . Murphy always redeems himself before it is over . All the Murphys in all the courses do that . In this particular course the sergeant gives a field order , somewhat complicated , to one of the men who must repeat it as if he were a messenger , and the man gets it wrong . He tries another , who balls up the order just as the first did . He tries a half-dozen others with the same result , and then he asks Murphy if he can get it right . Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . " He repeats the order word for word and num-ber for number and the candidates in the bleachers cheer their heads off . In a way , Murphy is every-body there and his misplaced self-confidence breeds a lot of sympathy for him while it relieves the monotony of instruction . Before a class has been here a week any man who makes a dumb mistake is a Murphy . The modern infantryman is equipped with no less than twelve weapons and his officers must know these weapons inside out . They must know how to use them , how to keep them in order and how to make sure they will remain in action where they will do the most good . Fort Benning is spotted with ranges ; there are 79 Our New Army ing things which will be useful to them in the job they are fitting themselves to do . The candidates are back again in their bleachers and the platoon on the ground in front is receiving instruction from its sergeant in map reading . The sergeant asks if anyone knows how to orient a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " He does it all right , except that he comes out with south on the map turned toward north on the ground and the sergeant gets in some good licks for the candi-dates explaining to Murphy where he made his mistake . The sergeant wants to know if anybody knows how to use a watch as a compass . Murphy says , " Sure , I can do it . " He takes a watch , squints at the sun and wrinkles his brow . " You point the hour hand at the sun , " he says , and then stops and starts over again . " You point the hour hand at the sun ? " He says " You point the hour hand at the sun " four times and nobody in the bleachers ever forgets that . From there on he gets everything wrong and the sergeant explains in detail and the candidates take down in their notebooks what he says . So it goes . Murphy makes more mistakes and the sergeant corrects them , hammering each point home so carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bleachers under-78 Our New Army rifle ranges , automatic-rifle ranges , machine-gun ranges , mortar ranges , antitank ranges , and every candidate fires on all of them before he leaves . Maybe he came here from an infantry mortar company and can outshoot his instructors on mortars , but he must learn all the others , just as the man with a yard of expert rifleman medals must learn mortars . So they go through hours of emplacing and aiming mortars and then they fire them . As a graded test , the candidates are seated on bleachers on the mortar range and a crew from one of the school regiments fires at a target clearly visible from the bleachers . After each shot every candidate marks down the corrections in range he would have given had he been acting as observer for the mortar , a duty he would perform as an officer in a heavyweapons company , and is graded accordingly . Tactics of infantry are taught by carefully staged demonstrations , some of them very noisy and smoky and impressive affairs . The candidate sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground by platoons and companies and battalions attacking or defending under widely assorted circumstances . Fort Benning was chosen in the first place because it offered ground suited to practically any problem which might confront infantry in battle . 80 Officers in Training The Chattahoochee River , for instance , winds along the western end of Benning , wide and deep and swift enough to present an interesting lot of obstacles to crossing it . In the last twenty years the Chattahoochee has been crossed by men with guns in their hands as many times as the Marne has been crossed in a century . Every class sees this river crossed ( it 's called " assault on a river line " ) in such a manner that it can follow in detail every part of the operation and , to some extent , can take part in it . The students , officers and officer candidates , are seated in the usual bleachers on the east bank . It is early in the morning , though not as early as it would be if this were an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault is to be launched theoretically at 3:45 A.M. so the first elements can take advantage of darkness to cover their approach . He explains the composition of the assaulting force and its dispositions and then calls up the infantry commander , who goes over his orders with his staff so they can be heard over the loud speakers . At theoretical 3:45 A.M. , engineers with plywood assault boats trot down to the riverbank and launch their boats , and the infantry climb in and they go across , along a front from a bend above the stands to a bend below . Wave after wave goes into the 81 Our New Army river until its yellow surface is alive with the boats , like a swarm of six-legged water beetles rushing silently across . As soon as the first wave touches shore they are discovered by the " enemy " and a spatter of rifle and machine-gun fire breaks out and mortars on this side throw over smoke shells which burst on the other bank , and the white smoke wells up and drifts back to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the steep bank on the other side , hugging cover and pressing forward , while the engineers turn round and come back in their boats for more . In the woods behind the stands a battery of 105 howitzers opens up , laying a barrage for the infantry advancing from the bank into the cotton fields on the other side . There is a tremendous uproar over there and the smoke rolls ever thicker . On this side the engineers have brought up a footbridge , which they assemble with incredible speed on the bank , and push out into the river . It noses its way across , guided by a cable one party has taken over in an assault boat . In fourteen minutes the bridge is across and the infantry goes over , running well-spaced so they wo n't sink the bridge . An airplane swoops down on the other side and drops ammunition by parachute to the attacking troops over there . 82 Officers in Training Now the enemy has been pushed well away from the spot chosen for a bridgehead and more engineers come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponton bridge . The instructor sends a squad of student officers across the river to help build the bridge and details another squad of officers to assist on this side . " Infantry officers should understand , " he observes , " how much work is involved in building a floating bridge . " Engineers and infantry officers shoulder the heavy bridge pieces and run them down to the river , and the engineers start building the flexible approaches which will permit the bridge to rise and fall with the water . All of a sudden a huge raft comes floating down , and then another , and another . These are bridge sections , floating on their pontons , which have been assembled in secret in Upatoy Creek upstream . They are floated into place , guided by anchors , and made fast . The bridge is almost finished when a horn blares stridently and the men working out there drop what they 're doing and rush ashore to cover . Two airplanes appear , flying low and fast , and sweep over the bridges , dropping flour-sack bombs which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground . The planes go along and the bridge is finished , 83 Our New Army and the battalion 's motor vehicles cross over with ammunition , running fast and losing no time . They are followed by an ambulance which turns off into a dressing station which can be seen under cover of the opposite bank , where it loads up and comes back . It will take its passengers to an evacuation station established deep in the woods behind the lines by the battalion medical staff . With demonstrations such as this one the Infantry School makes clear to every student not only the part he will play in similar operations in the future , but the immensity of the operation itself . Every detail is laid before him , every step explained , every order issued in connection with the attack is read . Distinguished alumni of the Infantry School at Fort Benning today command divisions and Army corps and task forces in America 's new Army . The current crop will go out to command platoons and companies in infantry regiments under the old grads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Infantry School is supplying them to the regiments in the field , trained in leadership , the spirit of " Follow Me " strong within them . It is one of the Army 's most important accomplishments , this 100-fold expansion of its means for making officers , with the help of Private Murphy . 84 VII The Men on the Ground Who Keep ' em Flying AT the edge of Biloxi , Mississippi , a drowsy old town down here on the Gulf of Mexico , something is going on which no one could see and still doubt that America will win this war . A saga of embattled America is being written here at Keesler Field , a story of plowshares into swords on a scale which approaches the impossible . And it is only one of many like it that , put together , add up to victory . A year or so ago this huge school for aircraft mechanics was a golf course . That is , part of it was a golf course . As it has grown in the last months , Keesler Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , the Biloxi Airport , the town 's ball park and a Boy Scout camp . It is still growing . While carpenters still hammered on the frames of its barracks buildings it began turning out aircraft mechanics who lived in tents while they attended classes in the old commercial hangar . At the end of June it had turned out 8500 qualified 85 Our New Army mechanics ; next year it will produce another 25,000 , more aircraft mechanics than the United States had altogether when war began in Europe . These mechanics are the unsung heroes of the air force . For every pilot who rides the clouds to glory , twenty of these men must labor on the ground to keep him flying . They are the guards and tackles of the air team , the men who make possible the plays that win . So badly does the air force , growing by leaps and bounds , need them that they are hardly given time to be graduated before they are snapped up by squadrons in the field . Of the 10,000 or so already graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible gunnery schools making ready to join bomber combat crews like those training at Hendricks Field , and some of the best are still here teaching others . This is an urgent business on which the air forces have embarked at Keesler Field , so urgent that work never stops . Classes are held day and night , twenty-four hours a day , six days a week . Students work , sleep and rest in three shifts ; instructors the same ; cooks and KP 's in the great 2000-man mess halls feed them in three shifts , nine meals a day , in a never-ceasing round of cooking , eating and dishwashing . Nine times a day the cantonment area swarms 86 The Men on the Ground with men marching from classrooms to mess halls , under their arms the brown paper portfolios the Army issues them to carry their homework . Three times a day the area swarms with even longer lines and more of them as one shift moves back to barracks and the next takes its place . There is no waiting for anything , no pausing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time schedule geared to the nation 's need . As barracks were finished here , men moved into them and then more men came in and were housed in tents . The cantonment grew and the tent cities grew and both still are growing to take care of the mounting tide of men who will flow through Keesler Field to learn to keep ' em flying . Where does the Army get men to learn the delicate and exacting trade of aircraft mechanic , to tend the extremely complicated sum of body , engines and instruments which make up the modern airplane ? It gets them from the source of victory in every war , from the manhood of America . It reaches down and brings them in from homes and shops and schools and stores , young men who may never have given a thought to or shown one hour 's interest in mechanical things , and makes aircraft mechanics of them in 110 days of intensive training . A random glance through a handful of their 87 Our New Army classification cards tells you who they are . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago , a restaurant counterman , a beautyshop operator , a caterer , a longshoreman , a bank teller , a waiter , a bell captain , a policeman , a zipper inspector , a bartender , a florist . These are the men on whom victory in the air will depend , men you rub elbows with every day , the great middle class of America . Some of them may not like the idea of becoming aircraft mechanics when they find themselves assigned to school here . This work is so foreign to anything in their previous experience they do n't like it . One of them , an auditor and certified public accountant in civil life , asked to be reclassified and his request was rejected with a statement of policy which comes as near as anything to being a nutshell diagram of how this war will be won : ? " The number of technicians required to fill the needs of the air forces today is such that out of necessity we must make our selection in many cases without regard to the individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proficiency and aptitude for learning and training . . . . We ask the co-operation of all squadron commanders to impress on those of their command that any and all assignments are equally important toward the final objective . " 88 The Men on the Ground The number of men qualified by civilian training and occupation to keep the Army 's airplanes in action is an infinitesimal proportion of the thousands who pass through reception centers after being drafted . Automobile mechanics among them are needed by all the services , fighting and supply . The air forces can get but an inconsequential few of them . So , when the air force calls for men for its technical training schools , it gets those with intelligence ratings above a certain minimum , regardless of civilian occupation . They come to Keesler Field and are sent to the replacement center for four weeks of learning the basic principles of soldiering and becoming acquainted with the Army rifle . While they are there each man goes before a trade test board and is examined for his aptitude for the trades the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for radio or photography or weather forecasting or some specialty other than mechanics , he is sent to some other school . If his aptitude is for mechanics , regardless of what he may have been doing all his life , he goes to school here . This has proved to be a remarkably accurate system . Losses from failure to pass the mechanics ' course have amounted so far to only 5.1 per cent of the number of men admitted . Some of these failures are voluntary , like the surge of failures 89 Our New Army which followed immediately the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , when men wanted to get out of school and into action . Once assigned to school here , the student is placed in one of the three shifts and from that time on spends 770 hours in classrooms and shops . His course is divided into eleven phases of ten days each during which he moves on from the fundamentals of aircraft and engines to actual maintenance of engines and planes on the flying line . The student at the Technical Training School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , electrical systems , hydraulic systems , instruments and maintenance paperwork . Then he gets ten days ' instruction on airplane structures , ten days on hydraulic systems and miscellaneous equipment , ten days on propellers , ten days on instruments , ten days on engines , ten days on electrical systems , ten days on fuel systems , ten days on engine operation and tests and ten days each on single and multiple engine inspection and maintenance on the flying line . This school for aircraft mechanics , like every other part of the Army , has suffered from deficiencies in equipment and skilled men . Men had to be trained and ready for the tens of thousands of new airplanes flowing off the assembly lines ; what 90 The Men on the Ground airplanes and engines and instr uments the air force had were badly needed for training and fighting , for ourselves and our allies . Skilled mechanics , veterans of air corps flying lines , had to be spread thinner and thinner over the air forces in the field , over the flying schools , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for training ; training could n't wait for equipment to be built and instructors to be taught to teach others . All of it had to be done at once . So , enormous places like Keesler Field grew on golf courses and old commercial flying fields and useless swamps . Barracks and classrooms mushroomed up overnight , roads were made with the traditional Gulf Coast oyster shells , flying fields and shops were built even while they were being used . For Keesler Field , 696 experienced crew men were detached from their squadrons and sent down as instructors . Together with 203 civilian instructors , they trained the first few classes and held back 310 of their best students , so that now Keesler Field has 1209 instructors , civilian and enlisted . Equipment was an even more difficult matter , one which is still in process of solution , while training goes ahead on schedule . Obsolete airplanes and 91 Our New Army engines form part of the material on which students are trained . But that obviously is less than satisfactory . A man may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engine that was the latest thing five years ago and then go out to a squadron with modern equipment and be a total loss until he has learned all over again . Some way had to be found to teach mechanics from the ground up on equipment they will be responsible for maintaining in the field . Some of this equipment has been acquired ; some is on the way . First of all , the Technical Training School was given aircraft which had been designed for air force purposes and rejected . These planes are equipped with modern engines , modern instruments and modern de-icing , fire-fighting and other gear . Second , the Technical Training Command gained the promise of all service-type aircraft which have been wrecked and can not be repaired for use within seven days . The equipment is here to put these airplanes back into fair shape and students acquainted with them will be prepared , without further instruction , to take their places in crews maintaining them out where the fighting is going on . What equipment there is here is not idle one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything is used to its fullest capacity ; Keesler 92 ? The Men on the Ground Field is a practical application of President Roosevelt 's appeal to get the utmost use out of every machine and every tool . Most of the student mechanic 's time is spent actually working with the engines and instruments which will be his charges in the field until the war is won . Even in classroom he tinkers with carburetors or magnetos or superchargers , sees them set up so he can watch them operate under conditions similar to those of service . What book work he does is with textbooks prepared here and set aside for him in libraries attached to the classrooms . While the school still has a shortage of modern service-type aircraft , the student sees and works with every type of engine ? radial , single-row , twin-row , liquid-cooled ? and every instrument and appliance the planes of the air force use anywhere . These engines include Allisons , Wrights and Pratt &; Whitneys of the latest design , made from rejected parts , which wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reassembling for study . After the student has completed his first eight or ten days on each he has absorbed as well as he can the structure and operation of planes , engines , instruments and appliances . Then he spends ten days starting and operating engines on test blocks . For this purpose , engines of every type which the stu-93 Our New Army dent will deal with as a crew member are set up , with all types of propellers and necessary instruments , and he starts them and warms them up over and over again , under the eye of an instructor . Every engine has its peculiarities and its temperamental whims . The student learns these by experience and he goes through the standard procedure , step by step , until it becomes instinctive with him . When he leaves this stage he is prepared to step into anybody 's airplane and start the engine and run it through the necessary tests and turn it over to the pilot ready to fly . Technical procedures used at Keesler Field are the product of a quarter-century of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative measures are the result of trial and error plus experience in the same job in the first World War , when it was something brandnew and without precedent . Major General Walter R. Weaver , who commands the Air Forces Technical Training Command , organized a Mechanics Training School at St. Paul , Minnesota , in 1918 . He overcame the same shortages of equipment and trained personnel then that he faced when he was given the task of preparing tens of thousands of specialists for the air forces in this war . It is the same job all over again , multiplied in the same ratio that the im-94 The Men on the Ground portance of air power has been multiplied in the twenty-four years since 1918 . Although Keesler Field lies in the heart of one of America 's playgrounds , the 31,000 men here find little time for play . They are in a hurry ; they are in a race with the production lines . As planes roll off the lines ready to be flown and pilots are trained to fly them , crews must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what is left of Naval Reserve Park , you will find men in coveralls sitting at concrete picnic tables , under massive oak trees , centuries old and bearded with Spanish moss . These men will have books before them , studying , using their own time to speed the business of making them competent mechanics for fighting aircraft . And remember who they are , these longshoremen and bank tellers and florists . They have Saturday nights and Sundays off and sometimes the squadrons give parties in pavilions along the Gulf shore . More often the men use their week ends for more study or for rest from the week 's high-powered grind . Hard as the work is and new as it is to most of the students here , almost all of them complete the course . Any tendency to let go and coast , out of weariness or overconfidence , or any attempt to 95 Our New Army pick up a permanent assignment on the field by washing out as a mechanic is stopped by a unique system of grading . Under this system , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades throughout the course . He may fail one ten-day course and make it up , but if he fails another , his second score below passing is added to the first , and so on until he is washed out unless he picks himself up and hits the ball . The student who hopes by failing to stay at Keesler Field on a choice assignment loses before he starts because no man who fails the course is permitted to remain here in any capacity . They are going ahead at top speed building the camp here and laying out a new flying field and making aircraft mechanics all at the same time . There is in prospect , as soon as these necessary matters are taken care of , the construction of a stadium to seat 11,000 men for the recreation for which the men of Keesler Field so far have had so little time . The one feature , aside from learning their new trade , which is stressed is physical exercise , on the theory that an aircraft mechanic , unlike his fellow in the other arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So calisthenics are an important part of the curriculum at Keesler Field ? calisthenics in which men take part by the thou-96 The Men on the Ground sands between classes , keeping fit to keep ' em flying . This job of plowshares into swords is typical of the spirit in which the air forces have tackled the most tremendous expansion in men and weapons ever undertaken by any branch of any army . You can not see it and doubt that America will win this war . 97 VIII The Men Who Drive the Tanks THEY turned in the neatest trick of the year down here at Camp Polk , among the blackened stumps of what once were the mighty pine forests of central Louisiana . With the equipment of one armored division they trained two , doubling up on everything ? tanks , trucks , weapons , kitchens and that most precious thing of all , time . In thirteen weeks they created a new armored division alongside an old one , both using the same equipment , the same ground and the same experience in their training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief ceremony on the Camp Polk parade they split a mass of 27,000 men down the middle and came out with two armored divisions . The operation was practically painless . " This formation , " they were told by Major General Alvan C. Gillem , Jr. , commanding the Second Armored Corps , who conceived and carried out the radically new idea , " marks the culmination of a training period which is unique in our service . I 98 The Men Who Drive the Tanks do not believe that it has been previously attempted . . . . This has been accomplished because there was a will and a desire on the part of all of you to help . " No one needs to be told of the vital need in today 's warfare for the swift , heavy armored columns which have torn their way through vaunted defenses all across the face of Europe . This country 's need was especially great ; until the battle of France , development of its armored forces had been meager indeed . When Hitler 's blitzkriegs turned the spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to build armored divisions . Excellent tanks and weapons were designed and put into production and , whatever our own needs , a large part of them had to be put into the hands of troops of other nations who already were face to face with Hitler 's armored might . Upon what was left to us we began building an armored force of our own . It was a slow business . Armored divisions can not be trained without the special equipment of armored forces ; nothing but a tank can teach a tank driver to drive , a tank gunner to shoot , a tank mechanic to keep tanks going . Badly needed as they were , new armored divisions had to wait until equipment could be turned over to them for training . 99 Our New Army That is why the job that has been done at Camp Polk is so pregnant with hope for the future . In doing it , the armored force has proved itself an outfit of top-flight soldiers ; it has accomplished its mission with the means at hand . Last January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored force if he could train another armored division besides the Third , which then was in training here . He was told he could have no more equipment immediately , that he would have to make what he had do for both divisions . He said yes . At that time there were only four armored divisions in the Army . The First and Second had been in existence almost two years . The Third and Fourth had been activated in April , 1941 , around cadres from the First and Second . Now four more were to be created , though sufficient equipment for all of them simply did not exist . The new Seventh Armored Division came into being when the operation was performed on the parade ground at Camp Polk . It came into being complete with its commanding general and staff , its 13,000 soldiers trained in their highly specialized jobs , although , until that moment , it had not one piece of equipment , one rifle , one typewriter , one gallon of gas it could call its own . The whole job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men Who Drive the Tanks of America less than $100,000 , which probably makes the Seventh Armored the most cheaply bought new division in the Army . From now on , the Seventh Armored Division , the " Lucky Seventh , " General Gillem calls it , will go ahead perfecting itself in tactics , getting the feel of itself , becoming a solidly knit fighting machine able to take care of itself anywhere . Already it has received much of its equipment ; more is reaching it every day . The Seventh will be ready to fight months ahead of the time it could have gone into action had it waited for these things until they were off the production lines . Besides the money cost , creating the Seventh has had another price , small enough considering what it has bought . The Third , already stripped of two cadres for new armored divisions , furnished a third for the Seventh , 3700 trained men as a nucleus for the new division . It replaced these , as it had the two previous cadres , with new men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its skill to train the Seventh . As a result , the Third Armored Division , just a year after its birth , had in its ranks less than 40 per cent of the men and officers who came here in April , 1941 , to give it a start in life . Altogether 30,000 men passed through the Third in the year , many more than the total in the two full-fledged 101 Our New Army divisions which will go on training here side by side until they are ready for battle . The Third has been retarded in certain phases of its training , a situation which is true of every organization in the Army which has progressed far enough to furnish cadres for new units . It was true of the National Guard divisions whose strength was doubled by adding raw recruits in the midst of their own training . It is inevitable when a peace-loving nation sets out to build a powerful and effective Army from the small force it permits itself between wars . Obviously the monumental job which has been done here could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done is evidence of the American genius for production and the imagination of the officers and men who brought it to that moment on the Camp Polk parade ground when the Seventh Armored Division sprang full-fledged into being . Men for the new division began coming here from reception centers . As do other branches of the Army , the Seventh had to take what it could get , and it separated them after they got here on the basis of their intelligence ratings and their civilian trades , so no new organization would get all the most promising and none would get all the least promising in each lot . 102 The Men Who Drive the Tanks These men were assigned to units in the new division , to its two armored regiments , its armored infantry regiment , its three armored field artillery battalions , its reconnaissance battalion , its armored medical and supply battalions , its signal and maintenance units . Each of these , set up alongside its equivalent organization in the Third , earmarked its men for the special work they were to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Third moved into tents , turning its barracks over to the new men not yet hardened by a year in service . Both divisions , old and new , used the same mess halls , members of each division eating together in separate shifts . Offices for each unit of the new division were organized alongside equivalent offices of the old , working together on the same administrative matters . Weapons of all the Third 's companies and batteries were placed in a pool for use by both divisions and an exact schedule was worked out to get the fullest use from them . Under this schedule , each unit of the new Seventh trained for one week each with the pistol , the rifle , the submachine gun and the ground machine gun used by infantry . Every man who could pass the vehicle driver 's aptitude test was taught to drive the Army 's sixwheel 2%2-ton truck . For the first five weeks they followed the general replacement training program 103 Our New Army under guidance of the Third , using the Third 's equipment on an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week they branched out into the specialist training which made them truck and half-track drivers , motorcycle riders , tank drivers , tank and half-track gunners , cannoneers for the self-propelled 105- and 75-millimeter howitzers . Men who were to become repairmen for the division 's vehicles and weapons went to work in the shops of the Third 's maintenance battalion . Those who were to be engineers began training with the heavy and highly complicated equipment of the Third 's battalion of engineers . Training tank drivers and gunners presented perhaps the most difficult problem of all in developing the Seventh Armored Division . A few young farmers were found who had handled caterpillar tractors back home , and these took readily enough to tank driving . But the bulk of the Seventh 's tank drivers had to cut from whole cloth . These embryo drivers were given a period of instruction on a tank course which took them through increasingly difficult stages until they became thoroughly proficient in operating their powerful vehicles . Then all of them had to be taught tactics , without a knowledge of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to put his tank , in the shortest time by the 104 The Men Who Drive the Tanks safest route , where it can do the most damage . To train drivers and section and platoon com-manders in tactics a most ingenious practice course was evolved here which has been called the " golf course . " It is a section of terrain which presents just about every obstacle and every aid to tank fighting which can be found anywhere . Tank crews went over it alone , in pairs , in fours , until they knew the fundamentals of tank combat by heart . First the crew of a single tank watched a demonstration in which a skilled crew took its tank over the course , crushing a machine gun , turning off the road to pass under a protecting hill and take an antitank gun in flank , and so on . Then the crew climbed into its own tank and went through the same maneuver . They were taught some of the first principles of tank fighting : to attack the most dangerous enemy weapon first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon which can disable the tank ; to halt before using their cannon ; to move under hills rather than along their crests . From the prac-tice course they were taken to a strange piece of ground and put through the same maneuver until they learned to apply there the principles acquired on the golf course . After this work with single tanks , two tanks with new crews were put together in a section and 105 Our New Army sent over the practice course . They learned to work together , like a pair of bird dogs ; to advance one tank while the other covered it ; to approach dangerous enemy weapons from two directions ; to help each other every minute . From there they went to a strange bit of ground , as did the single tank , and worked out the problem again until they had it pat . Tank machine gunners , one of whom is the driver , were trained on a combat range which gave them practice in firing while the tank was in motion , at fixed and moving targets . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over logs placed athwart its path to make the going tough , its gunners firing whenever they can bear on the targets . Scout car and half-track gunners got the same training , but without the logs . Cannoneers in the three field artillery battalions and in the 75-millimeter howitzer platoons of the armored infantry battalions fire their heavy pieces on . an artillery range . All artillery in the armored divisions is now self-propelled ; no time is lost unlimbering and limbering up again . The artillery keeps up with the tanks and the fast-moving infantry , mounted in half-tracks . Down in the shops , where light tanks , big medium tanks , half-tracks , howitzers , machine guns , submachine guns , rifles and all the miscellaneous gear of a tank division are kept in repair , men of 106 The Men Who Drive the Tanks the new Seventh have been working side by side with men of the Third Armored Division , from which the training cadre was drawn . They learned by doing and they learned sometimes the hard way . As , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a medium tank transmission and the whole massive assembly had to be taken off again to repair the resultant damage . It was an unforgettable lesson in taking pains . Tanks are driven by air-cooled radial aircraft engines , and the men who keep them going must be aircraft engine mechanics as well as tank experts . It takes a lot of knowing to keep a tank in action . Armored Force engineers , dealing as they must with extremely heavy vehicles , are equipped with special bridge and flotation devices unknown to engineers of infantry divisions . Their truss bridge , for instance , must carry the 28-ton medium tank , which would collapse the infantry division 's 10-ton bridge like so much cardboard . They have enormous rubber boats which can be built into tank ferries and powerful cranes to lift their bridge equipment and help tanks out of trouble . And on top of that , they must be prepared to fight in the line if need be , to plug holes and back up the armored infantry in tight spots . Training an armored division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imparting 107 Our New Army high technical and tactical skill while making fighting men . That is what possibly could be . Alexandria , Louisiana , the nearest city , is sixty-seven miles away over a road which is none too good . The little town of Leesville , ten miles from camp , provides little opportunity for recreation . The men do not like this situation , and they will tell you without being asked that Camp Polk " is the lousiest post in the Army . " From their standpoint that may be true . Camp Polk , named for the Confederate BishopGeneral Leonidas Polk , lies in a desolate countryside , rutted by erosion and studded with the stumps left after repeated reckless sawmilling operations in the great pine forests . Even the few trees left have been so beaten by chains and cables in snaking out logs that hundreds have died and stand naked and dispirited like thin gray whiskers on an old man 's chin . It is an unprepossessing place , disheartening to men and discouraging to tanks , which make heavy going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the end , for training a division which must do the toughest kind of fighting and learn so many things to do it . There have been none of the distractions here 108 The Men Who Drive the Tanks which impeded training of the National Guard divisions which were assembled near the big cities of the East . Men of the Third and Seventh Armored Divisions have not been thinking all day long of what they will do that night ; their minds have been on their work and that alone ; they have given their time to training for battle , not to making life pleasant for all the local damsels . To remedy somewhat this lack of facilities for recreation , convoys are sent every week end to near-by Gulf Coast resorts . Hundreds of Armored Force soldiers are taken without cost to themselves to cities within a 100-mile radius , where they blow off what pressure they may have accumulated during a week of unremitting work . Even so , Leesville is swamped with them every week end . They come into the little town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to embroil themselves with the M. P. 's just as soldiers will do in any army anywhere . And on payday nights they smother Leesville ; the town , a buxom young native explained , " looks like it had a khaki tent spread over it . " That is an apt description . To ease the strain on local accommodations and give the men themselves as much opportunity as possible for uncongested recreation , paydays are staggered . Half of the personnel is paid the first 109 Our New Army of each month ; the other half is paid the seventh . Morale has never been a problem in the Armored Force . These men are learning something new and interesting every day . Armored Force divisions have not been created until equipment was available in sufficient amounts to train them . Even last summer , when the morale of most of the Army was dragging bottom , soldiers of the Armored Force moved about with the defiant , chip-on-the-shoulder swagger which marks tank fighters the world over . What equipment they had has served the country overtime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First , Second and Third Armored Divisions . They have been to the ordnance shops for major overhauls three times . The Seventh has them now , using them every day , and will pass them on in time to a new division which it may itself father . A remarkable job has been done here at Camp Polk , dreary and unprepossessing as the place is . It is a job which points the way for the future , a milepost on the road to victory . This is the way a peaceful nation girds for war . 110 IX Earning Their Wings AT Randolph Field , Texas , you discover that the time has come to draw a line through the air corps you used to know and write down something new : the fine young air force of today . Write it not in terms of pilots alone but of teams ; alongside the pilot write navigator and bombardier . And then you will have the key to what the air force is doing today , how it will take the air from its enemies and hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air force is growing . President Roosevelt has called for many thousands of pilots a year and the air force is giving them to him , keen young fellows , finely trained and proud of the wings they earned . And along with these pilots , the air force is training for combat other thousands of navigators and bombardiers . That is the answer of the air force to global war , with its limitless fronts and tremendous distances . Today 's airplanes , great monsters of outlandish power and range and capable of incredible destruction , are not the one-man affairs of World War I. 111 Our New Army Air crews are going to win this war in the air ; closely knitted teams of pilot , navigator and bombardier , each dependent on the other , to take the airplane to its target , hit the target when it gets there and come safely home again . It is a business now , deadly , breathless and exacting . Where the air corps trained one pilot in the lean and peaceful years not so long ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadets fly 200 hours under instruction before they get their wings , just as those cadets did back in the good old days , but they fly their 200 hours in 32 weeks instead of the 52 weeks of prewar days . The answer to that is total use of all equipment ; training planes are flown from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. with no time out for lunch , ten hours a day , six days a week . And there are plenty of them . That time in the early months when combat planes waited while training planes rolled off the production lines is paying high dividends . And , in addition , the course has been shortened and intensified . Pilot cadets are taught what is essential to combat flying and what is essential to military organization and discipline , and that is all . The intimate knowledge of engines and instruments is left to the mechanics . Young men who would like to be air force pilots are not hard to get . They volunteer in swarms , 112 Earning Their Wings from civil life and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eager to reflect the bright glamour of the way of war trod by the aces of yesterday . Though the air force has relaxed its standards , without appreciably lowering them , only about one in five of the men who wish to fly can meet them . To get 60,000 pilots the air force must examine 300,000 applicants , must carry at least 80,000 of them through some part of training . And on top of that , it must train another 20,000 or so to get 15,000 for the navigator and bombardier places on the team . So the young man who wishes to fly in this war does not enlist for pilot training ; he enlists as an air crewman , and as such is sent to the Air Force Reception Center at Kelly Field , across San Antonio from Randolph . There he is given an examination which will determine his aptitude for one place or another in the crew . Very probably the glamour and the romance of flying brought him to Kelly to earn his wings and pilot a fighting airplane against the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that air fighting needed other than pilots . What place he will fill on the air team is determined in the end by one thing and one alone ? his country 's need . He may pass the physical and aptitude tests for 113 Our New Army pilot and at the same time show himself suited for navigator and bombardier . He may have expressed a desire ( and probably has ) to pilot an airplane . He may even hold a civilian pilot certificate . If there are sufficient others who asked to be bombardiers or navigators or could not pass the tests for pilot he probably will get his chance to learn to fly . But if navigator or bombardier cadets are needed their quotas must be filled from those who have passed the aptitude test for pilot . Some of these lads are bitterly disappointed and recover only when it begins to dawn upon them how vitally important they will be to the success of the team in the air . They go to Kelly badly conditioned for this change in their hopes . They have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the medals go to the pilots alone . They have been told that navigators and bombardiers are chaps who tried to fly and failed , which is not true at all . A lot of false notions burden them when they get to Kelly , notions which they discard after they learn the truth about bomber fighting . How the air force determines just what place in the air crew an aspirant is fitted for involves a day-long bout with a set of ingenious and almost human machines and a round of oral and written examinations on many subjects . Admittedly , noth-114 Earning Their Wings ing but experience in an airplane will make absolutely certain whether a cadet can fly . But the probability of his learning to fly well and safely can be determined , and that is what is done at Kelly . His co-ordination of mind , eye and muscle is established ; his ability to accommodate himself to new things , his faculty of judgment , his quickness and accuracy of reasoning are marked . Then he is given a series of tests which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can learn what he needs to know ; the air force wants intelligence , not mere education . On the basis of these tests the cadet is graded as a pilot , navigator or bombardier . Sometimes he ranks equally well in all three ; sometimes he shows low probability of learning flying but is a whiz at mathematics . So he is rated as a flying cadet , a navigation cadet or a bombing cadet and goes off to school . Should he fail at flying and his other grades are high , he gets a chance at navigation or bombing . If he can not make the grade as a navigator or bombardier , he still may get a chance to earn his commission on the ground as an engineer , communications , photographic , weather or armament officer . The air force wants to keep him if it can , because it needs him . Once dropped in his niche , the Army air force 115 Our New Army cadet goes to ground school at an Air Force Replacement Center . If he is to try flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which he does n't set foot in an airplane . Should he be slated for navigation or bombing , his replacement center period covers nine weeks , during which he begins to ease into his specialty . The pilot cadet goes from the replacement center to one of the civilian flying schools in the area covered by the Gulf Coast Training Command , with headquarters here at Randolph Field . There he is given seventy hours ' instruction on lowpowered light training planes in nine weeks , interlarded with simple studies of engines , structures and instruments , and a hearty regimen of physical training and drill . Then , if he has passed his primary stage , he comes to Randolph for nine weeks of basic training , during which he really begins to fly . If he gets this far he has a pretty good chance of finishing . The great majority of washouts come in the primary stage , and they are for no reason now except inability to fly . In the old days approximately 70 per cent of a class would be washed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will finish . In the old days one instructor could wash out a cadet ; now he must be given trials by at least two and must receive several checks by higher officers 116 Earning Their Wings before it is finally decided he can not learn to fly the Army way . Coming to Randolph , or one of the seven other basic schools in the Gulf Coast Training Command , he switches from 200-horsepower airplanes to planes with engines of 450 horsepower . He begins to learn acrobatics and blind flying , and night flying and flying in formation . And he becomes part of an organization with tradition , an esprit de corps and vast pride in its soldierly qualities . He becomes a cadet in the sense that the boys at West Point or V. M. I. or Marion are cadets . He has his own regimental organization with cadet officers , of which he may become one in the second half of his term here . He marches smartly to and from class and into the mess hall , where he sits erect and quiet , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which is devoted to flying , the other to classroom work in radio , weather , navigation , gas identification and plane identification . Classroom work occupies two hours and ten minutes daily ; the balance of the half day is devoted to physical exercise and drill , when he keeps himself firm and becomes imbued with the discipline which is just as important in the air as on the ground . The flying time he gets here is by the grace of stout airplanes and excellent mechanics . The planes 117 Our New Army are busy all day , brought in from flying only to be gassed and change cadets . At night , mechanics of the school squadrons keep them in order , each squadron maintaining four times as many airplanes as the average squadron in the field . In the air , the Randolph cadet spends a large part of his time landing and taking off on one of a dozen or so little fields within a forty-mile radius of here . And he gets fifteen hours of instrument flying in a Link trainer where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty hours ' flying in a hooded cockpit to the old cadet 's six , and ten hours ' night flying compared with the old cadet 's three , and two of the ten are in formation . By the time he leaves here for an advanced flying school he 's a pilot . But he still has to learn to use his airplane as a weapon ; to fight with it or to fly it so his crew can fight . So in advanced school he begins to specialize . At advanced school , of which there are ten in operation or under construction in the Gulf Coast Training Command , he flies big heavy airplanes with tremendous power in them . If he is going to be a bombardment pilot , he begins to fly twinmotored trainers . His flying becomes tactical and purposeful and he begins to feel the responsibility that will be his in a few more weeks . While the pilot cadet is going along this road to 118 Earning Their Wings his wings and his lieutenant 's bars , the navigator and bombardier cadets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine weeks at the replacement center , each goes to a school where he learns his specialty . The navigator is sent to Kelly Field , where he learns to read the stars and the sun , to plot and follow a course over limitless miles of water , above the clouds where he gets no glimpse of land for hours , from any point to any other with no aid but his science . For fifteen weeks he studies , to a great extent in flying classrooms , twin-motored training planes in which three cadets and an instructor go for ever-widening flights from the field and back . Following his own trail , the bombardier goes to one of three schools where he learns what there is to know about bombs and bombsights and how to use them . He flies regularly , dropping bombs loaded with sand on targets below , spotting hits by bursts of powder smoke emitted good-naturedly by the bombs to help him out . When they have finished their special courses , navigator and bombardier come together at a flexible gunnery school for a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its crew with machine guns . Graduated there , they are commissioned . 119
