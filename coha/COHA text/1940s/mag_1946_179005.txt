Citizens of Saskatchewan 's prosperous little Simmie ( pop . 100 ) were bored . Ever since Christmas they had been snowbound . Twelve-foot drifts blocked their roads to the outer world . Once a week a train ( one coach plus cattle cars and boxcars ) chuffed in &; out , and then silence lay upon the grain elevators along the C.P.R. tracks , the general store , blacksmith shop , barbershop and garage . <P> For a while church suppers , CCF dances , an occasional four-year-old movie broke the monotony . But the routine palled , and Simmians , their pockets bulging with grain checks , were in a spending mood . The bright lights of bustling Swift Current ( pop . 6,000 ) beckoned . Simmians were ready for a spree . <P> Some town sports got an idea : charter a train for the 32-mile ride to Swift Current . Archie Simmie , station master and caf keeper , asked the Moose Jaw C.P.R. office , got word back that for a flat round-trip fare of $2.05 , a $200 guarantee , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the guarantee became a cinch . <P> Worth Every Cent . When the big day and the Special came , 85 Simmians were at the depot . All along the line others waited . At level crossings the Special wheezed to a stop , picked up sleighfuls of eager farm folk . It all got so confusing that a railway official laboriously marked the crossings on a map so that the engineer would know where to stop on the way home . <P> One hour and 40 minutes after setting out , the 263 pent-up passengers invaded Swift Current . Most women hurried to stores , just missed the first nylon sale . They bought clothes for the family , tidbits for the table . Men &; women blew themselves to a restaurant dinner , went to a hockey game , or to a movie . Some men watched a few " ends " of a curling bonspiel , took friends to the washroom for a snort or two ( with a sharp lookout for the law ) , got tight . <P> Half an hour before midnight the Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day had been $20 a family , but some splurged as much as $50 . Said happy Simmians last week in retrospect : " It was worth it . "
