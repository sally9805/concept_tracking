SCIENCE is working from A to Z in its war against disease-carrying pests . A few years ago DDT made its debut as a sure-fire pest weapon for home use . Now a new one ? ANTU ? has been added to the alphabetical arsenal . ANTU is to rats what DDT is to insects ? a powerful , quick-acting , one-shot poison that is easy to use . But like DDT in its field , ANTU has its limitations as well as its virtues , and to get the most out of its ratkilling powers you must know those limitations , as well as its dangers and the right way of using it . First of all , ANTU is a specific poison for the brown or Norway rat , which comprises about 90 percent of the rat populations in our towns , cities and farms . Although so deadly that one pound of the fine grey-blue powder is enough to kill 200,000 rats , it has little or no effect on mice and other rodents . It can kill cats dogs and farm animals if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known at the present it has no bad effects on humans unless taken in large quantities . ANTU was discovered quite by accident six years ago by Dr. Curt P. Richter at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital , in Baltimore , Md . Dr. Richter , searching for new facts about human diet , was testing his theories on a colony of laboratory rats . At one point in his experiments he decided to test the taste reactions of his rats , as compared to humans , and fed a group of six rats tiny pinches of phenyl thiourea. the bitterest substance known to man and often used without danger in taste-reaction tests on humans . Two surprising things happened ? none of the rats seemed to taste the bitterness of the chemical , and by the next morning all six of the rats were dead ! Dr. Richter 's thinking shifted quickly from diets to rats . Had he stumbled on a new " safe " rat poison ? At the time , " red squill " was the most widely used poison . but the Axis occupation of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ques- tion was , would phenyl thiourea kill wild rats as quickly and as thoroughly as it had his laboratory pets ? To find out , Richter trapped a few wild rats on the city dump . Unfortunately , the wild rats proved far wiser in their choice of food than their laboratory relatives . No amount of camouflaging or trickery could get the wild rats to taste the chemical . They turned up their collective noses at even the most attractive bait when it was mixed with the poison . The wild rats could taste the bitterness of the phenyl thiourea where the tame laboratory rats had not . Richter , however , did n't give up . Perhaps some other similar chemical would do the trick . One by one he tested more than a hundred thiourea compounds in the hope of finding one that would be deadly and that the rats would eat . His search finally led him to the chemical called alphanaphthyl thiourea , which he shortened to the less tongue-twisting name of ANTU . Wild rats found it palatable ? and fatal . Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when Baltimore was having more than its share of rat troubles , so Richter had to do little more than step out of his laboratory to find a perfect area for a field test . After an initial trial covering eight square blocks proved highly successful , the city government took over the fight , first with trained volunteers and later with additional regular paid workers . The rat colonies were exterminated systematically , block by block . The rat death rate in many cases was close to 100 percent . It has been estimated that during , one-year period more than 45.000 rats were killed with ANTU . As a result , Baltimore now has a ' City Rodent Control Office and-more than three-quarters of the densely populated sections of the city have been brought under control . ANTU is now available to the general public , but before you use it , either in its pure form or in the form of one of the ANTU prepared baits being sold commercially , you will be wise to study your rats as well as the poison . Careful Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTU is a one-shot poison ; it is not accumulative . Success depends upon getting the rats ? and that means all the rats ? to eat a good portion of the poison . Their first free meal must be their last . Unfortunately , anything less than a killing dose allows the rats to develop a partial immunity to the poison that lasts about 30 days and an aversion to it that may linger for several months . Do n't attempt poisoning operations on a small scale . The area to be covered is determined by two factors ? the location of the building or buildings to be treated and the , natural habits of wild rats . Unless they are chased by dogs or cats , or the supply of food is completely removed , rats seldom journey far from home . However , they generally live in one place and eat in another . For this reason , when rats are to be cleared from a farm , or property in the less densely populated portions of a suburb , all outbuildings as well as the main house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses are of the so-called " detached " type , groups of neighboring home  | owners should co-operate in one general anti-rat campaign . In cities , where the houses are built one against the other , a complete block is the smallest area that should be treated as a unit . Unless a city home is completely ratproofed , there is little sense in attempting to rid it of rats if the surrounding homes remain rat-infested . In crowded districts , rat control should be a community problem . Rats Often Unseen Guests The area to be treated with ANTU first should be carefully surveyed to locate all rat holes and burrows , runways ( generally found along walls or fences ) , possible sources of food , sources of drinking water , and entrance holes leading into homes and outbuildings . These are all good spots to place the poisoned bait . Watch for signs of rats ? droppings and telltale teeth marks on soap , food , wood or cardboard boxes . If there are signs of rats but you have never seen one , you-are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If you see them occasionally at night , the colony in your vicinity may number 200 . And if you see them during the day as well as at night you are surrounded by an army that may number more than 500 . Straight or Mixed Pure ANTU , which costs about $4 a pound , can be used effectively in a number of ways . A good ground bait can be made by mixing two to three parts of ANTU with 100 parts of finely ground , fresh yellow corn ( corn meal ) . This can be distributed in small shallow piles ( about a tablespoonful ) where rats are known to be . A good spot for this type of bait is just to one side of the entrance to a known hole or burrow . Another similar procedure consists of smoothing out a layer of corn meal about one-quarter inch thick and one foot in diameter and dusting it with the ANTU powder from a spray gun or an ordinary kitchen flour shaker . This particular type of bait works well on cellar or outbuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet potato and tomato ,  | or ground meat , the white and yolk of eggs , and chicken and fish heads can be dusted with the poison and used in much the same way . When using either of these baiting methods , it is wise to dust an additional area with ANTU around the food for a distance of six or eight inches . ANTU can also be used without bait . Mixed half and half with ordinary flour it can be pumped into holes and burrows or spread along runways . When the rats get the powder on their feet or hair , they lick it off and get their poison without eating ? victims of their personal cleanliness . In places where food is plentiful and there is no means of conveniently removing the supply , such as in food stores and warehouses , the rats ' thirst can be catered to by putting out shallow dishes of water that have been dusted with ANTU . The poison should be dusted on the water until a thin floating layer has formed on the surface . Combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a combination of these baiting methods and , in any case , it is wise to pre-bait for a short period before applying the poison . Set out unpoisoned bait in the same spots for three or four nights in a row , or at least until you are sure that the rats in the vicinity know where the food is . Word of the free lunch will spread rapidly through your rat colony . You can check on the nightly attendance at your rat cafeteria by looking each morning to see how much of the unpoisoned food has been eaten . If the amount consumed increases each night , continue to pre-bait with fresh food ; but once the shrinkage of the piles remains constant you can be pretty sure that the word has spread to the last rat ? and remember , it 's that last rat that counts . That night you can set out your ANTU bait with fair assurance that you will get close to a 100-percent kill . Since rats generally eat shortly after dark and early in the morning , put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and baiting period be sure to remove all other possible sources of food . Then , on the night that you set out the poisoned bait , be sure to keep your children , pets and farm animals away from the poisoned area . After the poisoning operation is completed ( the next morning ) , remove all poisoned bait and dispose of it where humans or animals are not likely to get at it . Block Holes on Third Day ANTU-poisoned rats usually die within 10 to 24 hours , so look for dead rats for several days following the poisoning . On the third day close all rat holes with dirt or stones . If any rats remain , the holes will be reopened within a few days . ANTU kills by affecting the rat 's lungs and the production of lymph fluids ? in other words , the rat literally drowns in its own body fluids . This is an important feature of ANTU , since by affecting a rat 's breathing it usually drives him outdoors to die . ANTU does not guarantee against reinfestation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeat the process within a year . Rats cost American home owners and farmers $63,000,000 annually . One rat can eat up to 50 pounds of grain a year . ANTU ? plus constant vigilance ? may save millions of this tribute to ratdom.  |
