Adventure in Baltimore ( RKO Radio ) , like a leisurely look into the family album , is good for some drowsy amusement and one or two chuckles . Set in the 1900s , it describes the misadventures of a rebellious young woman ( Shirley Temple ) who believes in women 's rights-especially the right to vote and to paint the nude human figure . Expelled from school for her outlandishly radical notions , Shirley returns home to disgrace her kindly clergyman-father ( Robert Young ) , outrage her boy friend ( John Agar ) , and throw the whole neighborhood into an uproar . <P> As a firebrand in full petticoats , Cinemactress Temple works hard , but barely manages to keep up with the slow-paced antics . Fortunately , Veteran Robert Young is on hand to hold things together . His easygoing performance gives Adventure most of its warmth and conviction . <P> The Set-Up ( RKO Radio ) is a tough little film about small-time prize fighters with big-time dreams , and the racketeers who make &; break them . Into normal screening time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stoker " Thompson ( Robert Ryan ) . At 35 , Stoker needs only a couple of stiff jolts to the head to become a punch-drunk derelict . Unwittingly , he saves himself by refusing to throw a fight . When local racketeers have finished teaching him a lesson , Stoker 's right fist is a broken mess and his fight career is ended once &; for all . To his wife ( Audrey Totter ) , it is a happy ending . <P> No Champion when it comes to realistic boxing scenes ( TIME , April 11 ) , Set-Up packs its own sharp , unexpected punches . The story , based on a poem by Joseph Moncure March , is fresh and honest . Its script , tense as a taut rope , neatly sidesteps the tintyped heroics of standard fight films and concentrates on the rotten underside of the ring and the characters that infest it . Especially pungent is the treatment of Paradise City , a typical overnight stop on the hayseed circuit . Rooting about in this neon-lighted netherworld-in down-at-heel bars , penny arcades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arresting assortment of local plug-uglies . Some of the character sketches are deftly sardonic ; others-notably of ringside sadists-are heavily overdrawn . <P> Set-Up gets much of its surface glitter and look of reality from exciting camera work and lively invention . For its emotional drive , it relies almost entirely on the quiet , slowly accumulating honesty of Ryan 's performance . <P> El Paso ( Paramount ) is a morally cross-eyed western about a young Eastern lawyer ( John Payne ) who has trouble telling right from wrong . Payne , just back from the Civil War , arrives in El Paso in search of his sweetheart ( Gail Russell ) and finds the town in the grip of violence and disorder . Landgrabber Sterling Hayden and his corrupt stooge , Sheriff Dick Foran , have the townspeople terrified . At first Payne tries unsuccessfully to unseat the villains by due process of law . Then he takes to rabble-rousing . Meanwhile , he begins to wonder if the end ( civic order ) justifies the means ( taking the law into his own hands ) . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilante friends string up a number of their enemies to nearby trees .
