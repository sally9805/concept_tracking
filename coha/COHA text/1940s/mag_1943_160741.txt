The Navy has scraped a lot of paint off parts of ships to reduce the fire hazard . What to put in its place ? Last week it became known that the Navy has an answer : a fireproof ceramic ( glazed ) coating that seems to have many advantages . <P> Called Seaporcel , a silica product , the coating is first sprayed , then fired on the surface of metal . The Navy and Maritime Commission are covering bulkheads , doors , crews ' quarters and galleys with it . It does not char , chip or crack , can be cut or tack-welded like uncoated metal , and actually strengthens light steel sheets to which it is applied-a quality which may make it possible to build lighter ships . Whether Seaporcel can be used on a ship 's hull is still a moot question ; the Navy is testing to see whether barnacles will grow on it . <P> The fact that bluejackets will like Seaporcel is obvious-it eliminates the sailor 's perennial occupation of chipping off old paint and brushing on new . Seaporcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be cleaned with a damp cloth .
