Now that the 1920 's and the 1930 's are far enough in the past to be examined with the detachment of the historian , it may be seen that a book was the undoing of the American business man . It is clear too that it was the stifling effect of American literature on American industry that caused the depression to continue all the way through 1939 , and that the domineering position held by the writers after the downfall of the business men was the only thing that stood in the way of complete economic recovery . A reversal of the traditional relation-ship between writers and business men ed during the past two decades . occurred For years American literature had been stifled by American industry . From the end of the pioneer period until long after the first World War the business men were in charge of the country . They were not intentionally cruel to the writers . They simply overwhelmed the writers with their success and their exuberance and made the writers feel inferior and impotent . The country teemed with well-to-do business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers ' nerves , causing widespread literary neuroticism . A handful of writers revolted and went to France to escape from jollity and commercialism , but most of them stayed grumpily at home and were looked upon as harmless freaks . America might still be a contented , prosperous , back-slapping nation , with writers as its only seriously underprivileged class , if one stay-at-home writer had not got so beside himself with fury at the complacence of the American business man that he determined to tear one apart . This writer was Sinclair Lewis . He wrote a book about a business man whom he called Babbitt . The book made the American business man an object of derision , and Babbitt became a household word meaning a-man-whose-childrenar e- as hamed- of-him-beca use - he- is- sosilly . The business men grew self-conscious and introspective when they discovered that the rest of the population was laughing at them . They tried to join in the laughter in order to show that they appreciated the joke . They faltered for the first time in their progress toward lasting prosperity and happiness . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspirational songs and began reading realistic , depressing novels and cynical biographies . They stopped getting together at gay businessmen 's luncheons and gradually lost contact with one another . The prestige of the writers went up as the prestige of the business men went down . The profession that had with one book brought the business men to their knees was idolized by the country at large . The public was awed by the writers and at the same time curious about them . The writers began to sell more books and make more money . They got together at literary cocktail parties in New York , slapped one another on the hack , and talked condescendingly of business men . They trayeled about the country in club cars and lectured to enthralled audiences on how wonderful it is to be a writer and how stupid it is to be a business man . The stock market crash of 1929 caught the business men full in the face . They were n't even looking . They were staring inward , gnawed by a virulent inferiority complex . The writers blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but business men could have got the country into such a mess . Many articles and books were written on this theme , increasing the prosperity of the writers . Instead of fighting back , the business men kept examining themselves morbidly and reading more books . A national election came and a new Administration was swept into office largely on a platform of disdain for business men . The new President was something of a penman himself and his early brain-trust was composed almost entirely of writers of one kind or another . The final triumph of the writers over the business men came when the captains of commerce made a pilgrimage to Washington and paid homage to one Hugh S. Johnson , a former writer of cowboy stories who , resting between two literary phases , was in charge of something called the National Recovery Administration , then popularly known as the NRA . Johnson , egged on by the President and other writers like Tugwell , Ickes , and Hopkins , told the business men how to run their businesses , and the business men , still groping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs and tried to follow it . Johnson now writes a syndicated newspaper column and gets more money for it than he got for writing cowboy stories or even for administering the NRA . Writers in all fields of literature are richer than they have ever been before . The business men , on the other hand , are still not as prosperous as they used to be and most of them are unhappy and neurotic . They lack self-confidence and are consequently indecisive . They are apologetic , self-effacing , polite , modest , and full of book learning . Many of them are downright cultured . They are beginning to show signs of a vague resentment over the condition to which they have been reduced . Everywhere they turn they find themselves being patronized by affluent writers who are prospering either in journalism or government by telling the country what is wrong with American business . In recent years a few business men have revolted and gone to Russia to get away from the new literary civilization , but most of them have stayed disconsolately at home , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as dangerous characters . The writers have been intentionally cruel to the business men . The business men cried " Uncle ! " almost eight years ago but the writers are still sitting on their chests , pummeling them . Gradually the business men are beginning to lift their arms , which have been folded over their faces . The movement is almost imperceptible , like the opening of some exotic flower , but more business men 's luncheons are being held these days in medium-priced hotels , and at the New York World 's Fair , promoted by business men , some inspirational songs are being sung by the bolder commercial groups . It may be that the business men are plotting the overthrow of the literary men . Obviously , if any real recovery is to be expected , the business men will have to build themselves up by pulling down the writers just as the writers found mental health and material prosperity in pulling down the business men . II The writers are riding high and are going to be hard to reach . They are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Astors used to be . The literary trend in Washington is familiar to most people ; the fact that the writers have muscled into the aristocracy is not generally realized . The American equivalent of the former Prince of Wales is Lucius Beebe , a columnist , who sets the male styles and has a good deal to do with what both sexes eat and drink . The best-dressed woman is Clare Boothe , a playwright , whose husband , Henry Luce , is a multimillionaire journalist . Read any New York gossip column or society page and you arc forced to read a great deal about the doings of rich writers . What the writers have accomplished in New York is typical of their social progress in every urban community in the country . The snob appeal of literature , plus its promise of affluence for its practitioners , has entered the consciousness of simple people in small towns and villages . Housewives neglect their duties to read books and to listen to fashionable writers talking either from the lecture platform or over the radio . Young people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unemployed is made up of youngsters who wish only to write and can not find steady writing jobs in an already overcrowded profession . The WPA was forced to have all kinds of things written , including guide books to every State in the union ( for which there was no audible demand ) in order to occupy the idle hands of would-be writers . New York to-day is the counting house of literature as it was once the center of business and commerce . There the rich writers may be observed , moving about behind plate glass like the unreal inhabitants of a tropical aquarium . " Caf ? society " in New York is what used to be called " Society " in that the term is used to describe the group of people who populate the most exclusive restaurants and the most expensive cafes and night clubs , who are seen at Saratoga in August and at Palm Beach in January and at opening nights the rest of the time ? who get the best tables everywhere , spend the most money , and give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . Look behind a Scotch grouse steaming on a platter in the most expensive New York restaurantand you will find a literary face . Move aside the magnum of champagne and you will see the head and shoulders of a writer . At such places as Voisin 's , Jack and Charlie 's , the Passy , the Colony , the Stork Club , El Morocco , the Plaza 's Persian Room , the Iridium Room at the St. Regis , and the Monte Carlo rich patrons who are in one way or another connected with the literary business occupy over half the tables . These are the smart places in New York , so if the old aristocracy goes out at all it must fight for caviar elbow-to-elbow with literary men and women . Sherman Billingsley , proprietor of the Stork Club , which is the headquarters of New York 's cafe society , was asked last fall what sort of people would be admitted to his new luxury establishment , the Nine O'clock Club . " Oh , the younger people from the best families , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Twenty-five years earlier he might have said " the riding crowd , " meaning the outdoor segment of the industrial aristocracy ; but now he said " the writing crowd " and it was no slip of the tongue . Actually , the writing crowd not only forms a part of cafe society but dominates it . It is a moving experience to stand in the foyer of the Stork Club and see well-born debutantes waiting patiently for tables with their millionaire escorts while eccentric-looking literary men accompanied by garrulous penwomen are led past them by one of Mr. Billingsley 's flunkies and shown to the choicest seats in the place . Just as proprietors of forgotten places Iike Sherry 's once catered to the industrial aristocracy and let in the others if there was room , Billingsley caters to the writers and allows the industrial aristocracy to take second best . Billingsley knows where the money lies . He sends cases of champagne to the homes of writers he has never even met and otherwise truckles to the literary profession as the headwaiters at Delmonico 's once truckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Yorker , became so incensed at Billingsley 's fawning over writers that he once paid out forty dollars in cash simply for the sardonic pleasure of sending Billingsley a case of champagne , enclosing his card . It was cheap champagne . A research worker delving into the secrets of the New York literary life recently asked all the leading cafes and restaurants to furnish him with lists of names of the famous and regular customers . The lists contained on an average five writers to three non-writers , the term " writers " being used here in its broadest sense , meaning persons who put words on paper for a living . If one runs an eye through the literary names culled from these lists one may get a panoramic view of cafe society , which is difficult to get unless you are a writer . Here it is , alphabetically : Faith Baldwin , Lucius Beebe , Ernest Boyd , Clare Boothe , Bennett Cerf , Marc Connelly , Paul de Kruif , Edna Ferber , John Gunther , Moss Hart , Ben Hecht , Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rupert Hughes , Fannie Hurst , Henry Luce , Charles MacArthur , Ward Morehouse , George Jean Nathan , Dorothy Parker , Louella Parsons , Maury H. B. Paul , Westbrook Pegler , Quentin Reynolds , Grantland Rice , Damon Runyon , William Saroyan , Louis Sobol , Dorothy Thompson , Carl Van Vechten , Walter Winchell , Thyra Samter Winslow , and Alexander Woollcott . Martinis all round , and a glass of amontillado for Mr. Woollcott . In other capitals of the world literary folk have always been encouraged by the aristocracy ; in London and Paris successful writers are taken up by duchesses who wish to see what they are like and usually dropped after a short time , the sight often being unattractive . It has almost always been true that as long as a writer is able to mingle with the aristocracy he will do so at the expense of his art . Marcel Proust , who wrote a great social satire on Parisian society , kept going to parties in the Faubourg St. Germain so long that he barely had time left to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before he finished correcting the proofs . In New York rich writers seem to patronize the aristocracy . It is a rare sight to see a group of aristocrats with one writer in their midst . The familiar tableau is a group of rich writers with one aristocrat hanging on . The gayest parties , the most brilliant dinners are attended by writers with perhaps two or three members of the industrial aristocracy filling in as odd men and women . Young writers in New York progress overnight from complete obscurity to a cafe table alongside the oldest families , provided the aristocrats have been able to get into the place . Before Pietro Di Donato , a bricklayer , had completed his first novel , called Christ in Concrete , he was taken by his publisher to Jack and Charlie 's and there met the cream of New York society , including Walter Winchell and a Vanderbilt who writes . " This certainly is wonderful , " the bricklayer said . It was . A publicity release got out recently by the Hotel St. Regis unconsciously gives a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . It is about Maury H. B. Paul , the rich society writer of the Hearst newspapers , who writes under the name of Cholly Knickerbocker , and it says , " He frequently stays late in the Iridium Room and usually comes with people like Postmaster General and Mrs. Farley . He offers advice to Vincent Astor , owner of the hotel , who asks him what he thinks about new ideas . " The tenacity of the Astors is staggering . An ordinary rich young man of good family finds it difficult to assume a place in New York caf ? society or to get a good table unless he is somehow identified with the writing profession . The case of Lucius Beebe , though somewhat extreme , bears out this point . Beebe comes of a Boston family whose official genealogy goes back to Charlemagne . He is worth about hail a million in his own right . His ambition when he left Harvard was to be a man about town in New York . It was necessary for him to climb into the writing profession in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a foothold in the writing set and keeping it Beebe 's tactics have been as pushing as those of a Texas oil millionaire trying to enter old New York society . He gets up at eight o'clock every morning no matter when he went to bed and hammers doggedly at his typewriter , doing a column for the New York Herald Tribune . He does everything possible to hide the fact that he is a gentleman and to create the impression that he is an up-and-coming literary man . The case of Richard Watts , Jr. , who succeeded Percy Hammond as dramatic critic of the Herald Tribune , is perhaps even more heartrending than the case of Beebe . Watts is also well off in his own right but tries to obscure this fact . He has a genuine dislike of showiness and fears that if he dresses or otherwise acts like a man of means nice people will mistake him for a successful literary man . He prefers to pose as a struggling dramatic critic and invariably wears conspicuously cheap-looking blue shirts and plain blue suits , refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more sensationally confused by his position in the world of letters than any other active New York writer . He accused Robert Benchley one time of having too many rich friends , such as the Whitneys . " You toady to the rich , " he said to Benchley . " Well , " said Benchley , looking pointedly at Watts ' man-of-the-people costume , " that 's better than toadying to the poor . " Such remarks have not helped to straighten Watts out . III Because of their material success , writers on the whole have achieved a state of complacency which is wider and more articulate than the mood of the Babbitts of the 1920 's . Writers are inordinately fond of public meetings and in recent years have organized a number of writers ' associations at which they makespeeches to one another and sometimes actually sing songs . Their speeches are more impressive than Babbitt 's were , for the writers talk not of the condition of real estate but of the condition of the world . The writers are more self-assured than Babbitt was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to real estate , the writers know exactly what 's going to happen to the world . Well-to-do journalists who made reputations and fortunes out of reporting events after they had occurred are now to be found earning a better living by being prophets . They too are highly selfsatisfied . " The British Cabinet has studied this speech and so have I , " wrote Dorothy Thompson of Hitler 's Nuremberg address . Walter Winchell , who rightfully has a fair reputation as a prophet , is not satisfied with that but last autumn cabled Neville Chamberlain advising him how to conduct the war against Germany . " Of course , " said Winchell to the British Prime Minister , " I speak only as a layman . " Obviously Winchell thinks he may be something else . The writers are so passionate in their approval of the way things are going in the literary business that each of them is understandably reluctant to vary the particular vein in which he has discovered gold . " When a writer gets hold of a good thing , " Somerset Maugham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto it for a lifetime , like a dog worrying a bone . " Modern writers arc the world 's most incorruptible specialists , which is usually hard on their readers . Edgar Rice Burroughs , generally conceded to be the greatest writer of the day , has made good by doing one thing well , the Tarzan stories . Alexander Woollcott , as a biographer has remarked , built a handsome fortune almost entirely on treacle . Dorothy Thompson makes a cool seventyfive thousand dollars a year out of unchanging indignation at the dictators . Hemingway stays tough . Gunther stays inside . Faulkner sticks to his ellipses . Thomas Wolfe was windy to the end . BUSINESS MEN , Pegler snarls , Winchell gossips , Beebe goggles , and Louella Parsons plugs . The writers like their ruts and evidently intend to stay in them , come what may . There is an atmosphere of dizzy unreality about the New York literary scene and one receives a distinct nevernever-land impression in contemplating it . Vincent Sheean was in conference recently with his lecture manager and his literary agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fly him to South Bend on the 18th , " the lecture manager said , and the literary agent nodded her approval . Sheean said later he felt like a parcel about to be stamped . It happened that Mrs. Shcean was to have a baby along about this time . The lecture manager and the literary agent turned this matter over in their minds , unwillingly aware that Sheean would like to be with his wife for the occasion . " When is this baby due ? " the lecture manager asked the literary agent , ignoring the prospective father . " On the seventeenth , " said the literary agent , consulting her notebook . The lecture manager went over his schedule for Sheean and swore . " Damn it , " he said with exasperation , " it would suit me a whole lot better on the fifteenth . " The existence of the literary agent has much to do with the rampant commercialism of the present literary set-up . In Emerson 's time the literary agent was rare and , if she functioned at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's manuscripts for him and perhaps discreetly asked a publisher for an advance of one hundred and fifty dollars on the book the author had already spent four years in writing . She lived with her cousin , a seamstress . To-day literary agents may be of either sex and arc usually not old , little , or gentle . There are sixty-five of them listed in the Manhattan business directory alone . These include all the well-known run-of-themill agents such as Brandt &; Brandt , who represent talented writers Iike Dr. Logan Clendening , Fulton Oursler , and John Gunther ; and George Bye , who handles the products of such literary figures as Ursula Parrott , John Erskine , and Eleanor Roosevelt . An agent charges the writer ten per cent of what the writer is paid by editors , book publishers , play and movie producers , radio and lecture engagements , and manufacturers willing to pay for writers ' endorsements of various products . The most successful agents are almost as well off as the most successful writers . They have luxurious suites of offices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors , editors , producers , publishers , manufacturers , and so on . The literary agent usually is worth the ten per cent he charges the writer because the agent never thinks of the full price of the novel or play he is selling for the writer but only of the ten per cent of it that he himself hopes to seize . With his mathematical vision thus ninety per cent impaired , an agent can argue with sincere conviction that the writer should get more money . The writer knows that the only reason he has an agent is that the agent is able to get more money for his products than even the dreamiest writer would have the face to ask for . The agent identifies himself so closely with the writer 's products that he often thinks of them as the result of his own labors . Thus he can say to himself , " I ca n't accept $5,000 for this play of mine , " meaning that he thinks $50,000 too little for a movie company to pay the author for the screen rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the agent 's part often becomes audible . " I have two plays running on Broadway and three new novels coming out in the fall , " you may hear an agent boast . " I knew we would succeed , " an agent once told a young novelist after the author 's new book had reached a sale of 100,000 copies . " Now we 're getting somewhere , " he added , which is somewhat as if the Old Man of the Sea had said that to Sinbad the Sailor as they crossed the first mountain range . The money they are making- these days seems to be almost uppermost in the minds of the writers . In Hollywood especially the salary of a writer usually forms a phrase in a casual introduction . " This is so-and-so , " you may hear , and then , sotto voce : " Six months contractParamount ? $1500 a week . " S. J. Perelman , the humorist , once suggested that butlers at Hollywood parties announce the salary of the guests at the same time they announced the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Garrett , $1500 a week , " and " Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Spewack , $2500 a week for the team " and so on . The suggestion was never carried out , possibly on the grounds that Hollywood writers may be depended upon to furnish the same set of facts themselves a few minutes after they enter a room . Money also constitutes a major theme for serious talk in literary groups in New York . " That was a wonderfully moving paragraph at the end of Jahn Steinbeck 's novel , " a writer of tender love stories will say . " How many copies has it sold ? " " I do n't know , " a prosperous poet will reply , " but I hear The Grapes of Wrath went for only $70,000 to Twentieth Century Fox . Do you suppose Hollywood is tightening up ? " A soulful writer full of grim integrity has bccn known to get in step with the current literary fashion in a single evening . Clifford Odets was asked to dinner by the late Sidney Howard some years ago after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted , although with condescension . " I am glad to be able to meet a typical commercial Broadway dramatist , " he said to Howard rudely when he shook hands . At dinner Odets talked about his abhorrence of money and his detestation of the motion picture industry and Howard listened politely . After the demitasse Odets said to Howard , " How much do you get in Hollywood ? " With whiskey-and-soda at the end of the evening Odets asked Howard , " How much do you think I could get in Hollywood ? " It was only a week or so afterward that Odets was in Hollywood . IV The essential trouble with American literature , both as it affects the reader and the economic picture , is that there is too much writing going on . When you mix together a publisher and a writer the chances are you will get a book , but when a literary agent is added as an active ingredient there is hardly any way to keep from getting two or three books , plus a number of articles , radio performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly one of the causes of the overproduction which is painful to readers and which has upset the national economy by pouring too much gold into an industry that turns out nothing but words . On the other hand , the extravagant demand for literary products which arose after the public became curious about writing and writers is to some degree responsible for the modern-style literary agent . It was once a writer 's custom to fool around , sometimes for years , before he got a good idea for a book ; then he sat down , wrote the book , and sold it to a publisher who passed it along to the public . This was a sound procedure from the reader 's point of view because the best man to think of an idea for a book is the man who is going to write it . Then came the overwhelming demand for new books . There were not enough new books to go round . Publishers naturally tried to supply the demand . Writers were to be had in vast numbers but the writers had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The publishers adopted a new system . Instead of waiting for writers to get their own ideas and write them down , the publishers began feeding ideas to the writers , exactly as cotton is fed to a cotton gin . Even the publishers , however , could not think of enough ideas to supply the demand and this gave the agents their great opportunity . The agents met it squarely . They turned out ideas for writers on a scale hitherto undreamed of . If a writer these days happens to get an idea for a book he wants to write the chances are he will never have time to write it because he is already signed up for two books which the agent thought of first . Thus comparatively few books are written in which either the writer or the reader may be expected to have more than a passing interest . Even firstclass writers , if they have been forced into the high standard of literary living , often find it impossible to write a good book when they want to . It takes a good writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a writer accustomed to earning and spending from $25,000 to $50,000 a year , writing a good book is an extremely foolish investment on his part and one that his wife and children might justifiably seek to prevent , by force if necessary . The high pay for writers is a reason for the scarcity of good books and for the evidences of carelessness and hurry to be found to-day in even the best literary products . A man whose time is worth anything over $25 a day finds it extremely difficult if not humiliating to spend an afternoon perfecting a paragraph or a week getting his facts straight . He simply can not afford it . Even if he is willing to throw money to the winds it makes him nervous to see his financial meter ticking away while he is engaged on such childish enterprises . When a writer 's time is worth as much as $200 a day ? which is what the time of innumerable modern writers is worth ? it becomes almost uneconomical for him to write at all . For this reason writers to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for literary by-products which can be turned out by fast dictation or by somebody else . With a few notable exceptions like Marquis James , who spent eight years writing personally his biography of Andrew Jackson , much of the research that goes into present-day books is performed by paid researchers who turn over their material to writers who can not afford to spend time in libraries or traveling about the country talking to people . Hollywood of course offers a sane solution of this problem to writers who can not afford to put in much time at the tedious business of writing . There writers are furnished with as many secretaries as they need . Much of the dialogue for pictures is dictated at high speed and put into finished form by the director , and the plots are mostly worked out in a conference room where nobody so much as puts finger to typewriter , but just talks . The radio offers another solution , except that here the author has to take care what he says and must achieve a certain level of entertainment value or the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutoff switch in the middle of a sentence . There is some evidence that the public is in favor of the trend toward not-writing among writers . Authors arc popular on the radio . One of the most widely appreciated radio programs of the moment , called " Information Please , " is composed of four famous writers notwriting , with one famous composer notcomposing thrown in as a sop to music lovers . The public 's enthusiasm for the stage appearances of Sinclair Lewis and Thornton Wilder last season was keen . More and more writers may find it possible to go on the stage and thus avoid writing . There is a definite swing away from writing in modern journalism and book publishing . Life magazine made an immediate success by keeping reading matter down to a few lines on each page . Simon &; Schuster 's most ambitious undertaking to date , A Treasury of Art Masterpieces , is a picture book , with one paragraph of words devoted to each picture . Ralph McAllister Ingersoll , former publisher of Time , who for the past year has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospective employe this spring that he was almost ready to start . " Everything , " he said , " is going fine ? new presses have been designed to print pictures fast the way we want them , dummies have been worked out and so on . Of course there 's one detail we have n't straightened out yet . " " What is that ? " he was asked . " The text , " said Ingersoll . " We do n't know what the text will be like yet . " There is evidence , however , that in spite of the fact that many writers are giving up writing the public may have a vague notion that too much writing is still going on . So-called " digest " publications engaged in gathering together the choicest prose and then emasculating it , cutting it down to around one-quarter of its original length , have been enormously admired by the public . In this particular case the public is being shamefully duped because the digest publications are using some of the money paid them by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original full-length articles and books for periodicals and publishing houses subsidized with more of the money paid for digestion by the public . Taking the literary set-up as it is today , it looks as if the time is exactly right for the business men to see their chance and overthrow the writers . The writers are feeling guilty about their affluence , which makes them peculiarly vulnerable to criticism . Outwardly they are happy , sleek , and full of self-satisfaction . Every way you look at the literary scene , the writers appear to be in much the same position the business men were in before Sinclair Lewis administered the coup de griee to the business men by writing Babbitt . All that is needed to bring complete chaos to the world of letters is a book about a literary big-shot whichwill do to the writers what Babbitt did to the business men of the ' 20 's . The writer of this book should be easy to find , for almost any modern writer will do a quick job for spot cash . The business men could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer 's while . They should be careful to get a writer who has himself succumbed to the literary temptations of the period . Sinclair Lewis is said to have been enough of a business man to understand and sympathize with the character he called Babbitt . It was the human , appealing quality of Babbitt that made him an unforgettable literary creation . The business men must get themselves a modern Sinclair Lewis to write such a book about writers . The country then would begin to laugh at writers as they once laughed at business men . The writers would fall from their present domineering position and the business men could at least rise to a level alongside the new position taken up by the writers after their downfall . The surplus money now going to writers could be used to irrigate the industrial deserts . The younger generation would he stimulated ; instead of striving to be writers they would turn against literature and adopt useful occupations , thus reducing the burden of unemployment . The writers that survived could get back to writing again and assume a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General happiness and prosperity would follow . Business men , get yourselves a writer !
