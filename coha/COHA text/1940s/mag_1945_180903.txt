When the Blue Network had the happy notion of calling itself the ABC ( for American Broadcasting Corp. ) , one Leonard Adrian Versluis ( rhymes with caboose ) protested . His Associated Broadcasting Corp . of Grand Rapids claimed prior rights to the catchy initials . This week Versluis ' ABC announced that it was about to become ( on Sept. 16 ) the nation 's fifth coast-to-coast network . <P> Dutch-descended Leonard Versluis , 47 , is a dapper go-getter who made a fortune operating a chain of photographic studios in Michigan . In 1940 , he built a station in Grand Rapids as a sideline , went on from there to the Wolverine Network , then last year blossomed out with the ABC . <P> His new chain will air programs 16 hours a day to all sections of the U.S. except the South and Southwest where transmission facilities will not be available until after the war . To start with , it will have hookups with independent stations in 18 cities including New York , Chicago , Salt Lake City and San Francisco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other networks , ABC instead plans to give listeners a full quota of news , sports events and music ; it will also feature special events and public service programs . Already in the works is a special V-J day setup that Versluis boasts will " beat the brains " out of his rival networks .
