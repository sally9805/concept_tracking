txt The American " monopoly " of the world 's gold stocks is suffering a mild decline . Of the gold newly dug this year , a drastically reduced proportion is being re-interred at Fort Knox , Kentucky . South African and Canadian mines are continuing substantial production , though they are having manpower and other difficulties  --  while output of United States mines , curtailed by the War Production Board , will fall below that for any year since gold gleamed at Sutter 's mill in 1848 . The ' Forty ; Miners turned out a national gold production of 1.9 million ounces . Experts calculate that this country 's 1943 output will be less than 1 4 million , or not much more than the Philippines alone contributed three years ago . America 's peak gold production year was 1940 , when more than 6 million ounces were mined . South Africa to England On the basis of the first seven months ' output . Canada 's gold yield may be expected to each about 3.8 million ounces this year ; and South Africa 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Just what is happening to the huge African production . officials of the Union of South Africa are n't saying , but American banking circles have no doubt it is being bought by and earmarked for the United Kingdom . It seems clear that little foreign gold has been coming to this country recently . It is probably still roughly true that the United States holds " about 70%. * of world monetary stocks of gold , but this nation 's gold stockpile has declined steadily since its record high in August , 1942 At that time it was worth more than $22 7 billion By July of this year it had dropped to $22.3 billion , representing some 638 million ounces of the precious metal. ? Biggest drop was in March , when there was a decline of $132 million . Much of this has vanished to balance international payments with Latin American nibtions and others . experts say . A lot of it is still physically here , but earmarked for foreign accounts . At last report $3.1 billion was so earmarked at Federal Reserve banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty-useless metal as far as war production goes , there is evidence that it still has allure the world around , wherever people can buy it . In this country it is unavailable except for the crafts Few markets are entirely free , but recent quotations in such Latin American markets as-Mexico . Peru and the Argentine have ranged from $38 to $51 an ounce , compared with the official U. S price of $35 . The Bombay bazaars of India are perhaps the largest of the free martsets , and the most recent available quotation there was $58 an ounce During the last year or so the price has occasionally reached $70 . Turkish and Portuguese buyers are reported willing to pay as much as a 100% premium over the American price . About the only war use of gold is for the braid . buttons and insignia of ranking military figures . The Army is reportedly also seeking several million jewelry boxes stamped with gold leaf . apparently to hold medals . Within the last year United States warships gave up an old habit of carrying gold abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it has been supplanted by arrangements under lend-lease . Industrial uses of gold are limited . It is used in plating certain kinds of chemical apparatus because , like platinum , it is resistant to acids . A condenser for acid vapors may occasionally contain as much as 200 ounces of gold . Gold also as used in spinnerets in the rayon industry . Alloys Restrict Gold tise The W.P.B. has taken no direct action restricting gold use , but it has effectively cut consumption in the arts and crafts by about 50%. simply by restrictions on alloys . Especially hampering to the jewelry trade are limitations on copper and nickpl . The optical and dental industries are considered essential users , so they get priorities on alloys required for commercial use of gold . Dentists alloy their gold with about 40% platinum . palladium. silver , copper and zinc . Gold has in recent years been coming-into greater use in decorating chinaware This utilizes what is called " liquid gold . " a sulphoresinate of gold dissolved in essential oils with small quantities of bismuth. rhodium and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ceramic , dried and baked at 700 to 800 degrees centigrade . Gold has also had an important customer in the fountain pen industry . World gold mining received its greatest fillip in recent history on January 31. 1934. when a Presidential proclamation deviklued the dollar by setting a price of $35 per ounce on gold . Largely as a result , world production jumped from 25.5 million ounces in 1933 to 40.9 million in 1941 American output more than doubled and there ' was a boom in gold mining all over the globe . Lots Left to Mine There is plenty of gold left in U. S. ground , available for extraction by underground tunnelling , surface dredging , hydraulic and other mining methods . but because of its unimportance as a direct implement of war its mining , except as a by-product of " vital " metals , has been largely banned by the W.P.B. since October , 1942 . The output that has continued is mostly accounted for by copper mines and others which yield gold as a by-product , or by a few operations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrepair . Avowed aim of the gold mining ban was to divert experienced miners from the gold mines to copper , zinc and lead mines Mining executives assert that only a small proportion of the miners have in fact transferred according to plan , though gold mining : ommunities have been sorely affected . South Africa and Canada , with economies more dependent on gold mining , have not followed the U. S. example . Since the prohibition went into effect there has been a drop in each succeeding month 's output until , according to the American Bureau of Metal Statistics , an August low point of 103,841 ounces was reached . The famous Homestake mines in South Dakota are now shut down tight , having ceased operations at the end of May when previously broken ore in the stopes excavations was mined out . Golden Queen , Empire Star . Lava Cap , Golden Cycle and Idaho-Maryland are other large producers now closed . The last of these , for instance , employs 50 maintenance men as against a normal working crew of 900 . Alaska Juneau is operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with a normal force of about 1,000 . Two of this company 's California properties have suspended operations entirely . Present workings are conducted at a small loss because of low production . but management is maintaining as much activity as possible to avoid heavy standby expense which would result If mines were closed completely . Yuba Consolidated , of California , is operating two of its 12 dredges and Natomas #Co. , of the same state , is using two of its seven dredges. ?
