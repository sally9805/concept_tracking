Japan awarded its highest military decoration-the Order of the Golden Kite-to 955 officers and men for feats in the Pacific , to 3,031 more who had fought in China . The list included such ranking officers as Vice Admiral Yukichi Yashire , Rear Admirals Yukio Kato and Toshio Otake , Major Generals Chikegi Usui and Tateo Kato . The interesting thing was not that Japan had so many heroes , but that the heroes were dead when they received the Order of the Golden Kite .
