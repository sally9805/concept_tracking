In ten months the Spanish edition of Reader 's Digest has become the biggest-selling Spanish-language magazine on record ( 350,000 circulation ) , and Publisher DeWitt Wallace has taken his place among the big U.S. exporters to Latin America . Last week he announced a new project for winning Latin American friends and losing money . It is a Portuguese edition of Reader 's Digest for Brazil . Scheduled for delivery Jan. 10 , starter edition will be 100,000 copies . <P> Like the Spanish edition ( Selecciones del Reader 's Digest ) , the Portuguese Selacaos will lose money to start with . Two further ideas will increase Reader 's Digest 's Latin American budget : 1 ) a talent-scouting trip , now afield , in search of articles from Latin America ( not to exceed 40% of magazine 's content ) ; 2 ) sponsoring free U.S. tours for Latin American writers .
