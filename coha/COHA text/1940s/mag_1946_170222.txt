Nobody had a good word for Assault , but he had a way of winning . Red-faced Max Hirsch , his trainer , complained to newsmen : " If you had a horse that won the Derby and the Preakness , would n't you say he was a pretty fair horse ? " Most of the 43,599 people who streamed out last week to watch the $100,000 Belmont Stakes apparently did n't think so yet . Elizabeth Arden Graham 's moody Lord Boswell , which had already lost two of horse racing 's Big Three to Assault , was the favorite again . <P> Belmont 's mile-and-a-half is a long grind ; the starting pace was slow . Jockey Warren Mehrtens , up on Assault , had orders to hold him back until Lord Boswell made his move . Jockey Mehrtens dutifully obeyed for a mile , decided he could wait no longer , and set out for the leaders . Assault overtook them in the home stretch , finished three lengths ahead . His winning time ( 2:30 4/5 ) was nothing sensational , but the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have won All Three. * It also made Assault the 13th biggest prizewinner in history , with $316,270 . Lord Boswell ran out of the money , in fifth place . <P> *The others : Sir Barton , Gallant Fox , Omaha , War Admiral , Whirlaway , Count Fleet .
