 | The lady who married me insists that the very first time she was embarrassed in my presence was the night I took her to see a domestic comedy written by James A. Herne and called Sag Harbor . One scene in Sag Harbor revealed Marion Abbott , a favorite character actress of that day , sewing on " tiny garments . " This exhibition , coupled with the dialogue that went with it , made the fact quite apparent that someone in the play was going to have a baby . We were not married at that time . As I now recall it , we were no more than mildly considering the possibility of marriage , should I be able to induce my employers to increase my salary to a sum in keeping with the responsibilities of marriage , i.e. , from $20 to $25 a week . Any public reference , therefore , to the process of procreation and such results as normally follow was definitely on the questionable side and firmly to be ignored by nice people . The theatre has grown up since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same wife and I ( a marital record of sorts ) sat through a play written by Elmer Rice , called A New Life , in which we were slightly embarrassed spectators at the birth of the heroine 's baby at the end of the first act . The only comment my helpmate offered on this occasion was that she thought perhaps one or two labor pains would have been as effective as six or eight and have saved both Betty Field , the actress in labor , and the audience considerable uneasiness , not to say discomfort . Pregnancy has been a long time reaching its current fulsome expression in the theatre . There were years and years of tiny-garment camouflage , usually employed as a touch of comedy relief . There were other years during which distressed heroines kept their men at home by whispering pregnant hopes in their mates ' surprised ears . ( Stage husbands are often among the dumbest of humans . ) Many a home has been saved by the promised confinement of a wife who , up to the last act , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic usefulness . And of course many a hussy has kept an otherwise noble lord on tenterhooks of anxiety by pretending that if she ever were to tell his wife what she knows , or so much as hint that he is the father of her expected offspring , she could cause an explosion that would completely shatter his life . Playwrights generally have feared to treat childbirth as anything but a joke . One season , Walter Jones , a fat and garrulous comic of his day , kept thousands of playgoers roaring with laughter when , to save the face and marital fortunes of Marguerite Clark in Baby Mine , he burgled the maternity ward of a hospital and came away with not one but three very red , newborn infants . They were , of course , obviously painted dolls ; but the simple imaginations of that pre-Ibsen day were trained to accept what they were told to accept in @#  | the way of symbols and assertions of fact . There have been serious plays in which the birth of a child has furnished a major motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the early 1890 's , the aforementioned James A. Herne had written Margaret Fleming , in which the heroine saved the life of her husband 's illegitimate son by another woman by feeding him at her own ; yeast . But mostly the newborn stage Infants that have caused audience excitements and critical fevers have been roduced and cared for off stage . The first play to bring an accouche -- ent into the home , with an audience i startled and incredulous spectators , was one called Christmas Eve , written Dr. Gustav Eckstein , a professor of physiology at the University of Cincinnati . It was produced Christmas week the season of 1939-1940 by Guthrie Mc.intic , with , I assume , the tacit if not sympathetic support of his wife , Kathaine Cornell . In Christmas Eve Dr. Eckstein fancied he could stir the intelligent interest of an average audience by telling the story a simple Polish mother whose baby a : - rived unexpectedly days too soon , to he great embarrassment of her abnor=ally self-conscious daughter . When : birth pains overcame Mamma , the daughter was entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her embarrass=tent can be readily appreciated . During the emergency birth in Christ-as Eve everybody had to turn in and help the doctor , right there on the stage . This created a situation to which audiences reacted variously . There were titfors and giggles and grunts indicating suppressed protests . There were also a few masculine snorts of laughter . But once Beth Merrill 's moans and groans were quieted and the delivery was fol.awed by the infant 's first faint cry simulated , it may be , by a healthy stagehand ) , there was a burst of applause that relieved the tension . HE moral of Christmas Eve was that the miracle of birth , to which the : . : . fighter had been forced to be an ace witness , served to cure her of her psychological disturbances and make a rmal woman of her . Before the act over , she had agreed to marry her ung man and go to Alaska with him . e play , however , was a quick failure . Again pregnancy was taken seriously tr. a dramatist when Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York City . The first curtain - dly had risen on this interesting work ore the audience was told , by means a conversation between a worried band and the doctor he had called attend his wife , that while it was true wife was pregnant , it was true also t if she bore a child , the chances were to one she would sacrifice her life . The wife , hearing this direful prophecy her husband , who favored an imate operation , fell into a dead faint . n while the husband rushed about , ling the doctor and searching wildly restoratives , a vision of her future presumed to pass through the ire 's subconscious . First , in her dream , she met the son @#  | who was to be born to her . He had reached his twenty-first year , and she found him stalwart and handsome . But , as her spirit son reminded her , she did not know all they , as mother and son , had gone through together in those twenty-one years . Thereupon , still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood and followed him all through the good and bad adventures of his life . When , in the end , the war took him from her , she was emotionally distressed ; but on being restored to consciousness , she was more determined than ever to go through with his birth . Life , she insisted , whatever the odds , is worth living . This play also failed . Pregnancy , taking it visually , as is the new stage fashion , is inspiring but something less than becoming to even our most charming actresses . Wearing the abdomen high in the cause of realism is , I think , more startling than beautiful and might easily be overdone . This fact became a little distressingly obvious with the production a few months ago of Owen Davis ' The Snark Was a Boojum . In this play there was one of those funny stage wills , in which Old Man Shilly had decreed that most of his fortune should go to the first two of his married nieces and nephews by whose cooperative efforts a Shilly heir was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will brought three sets of prospective winners to the Shilly home practically at the date of expectancy . The scene , as you may readily believe , was a bit distressing , and the fact that the things the baby racers had to say and do were less than bright did not help matters . Mr. Davis thought to inject a few thrills by the familiar trick of announcing that a homicidal maniac had escaped from a near-by sanitarium and was prowling the premises ; but nobody believed him . The Snark lasted only a week . LAUGHTER is found holding both his sides in Kiss and Tell . In this F. Hugh Herbert comedy pregnancy is mixed with adolescence , which adds another bit of boldness to modern playwriting and play production . For two acts Mr. Herbert permits a father and mother to be distressed by the belief that their daughter Corliss and her boy friend Dexter have got themselves into trouble and that biological consequences and much scandal are to follow . The audience , of course , being in on the truth of the situation , roars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify their parents ' worst suspicions . It all came about quite reasonably , which is why Kiss and Tell is one of the better comedies . Corliss has taken a solemn , **25;333;TOOLONG oath to stand by Mildred , her best friend , who has eloped with Corliss ' soldier brother . When Mildred knows that she is going to have a baby , she gets Corliss to go to the obstetrician 's with her . And when Corliss is seen coming from the obstetrician 's office and a catty and revengeful neighbor reports the visit to Corliss ' mother , the trouble starts . Corliss just has to let them believe what they will , because of her oath . And she has to drag the boy next door into it to give her child a father . The outcome is continuously explosive . There is some fun in Phoebe and Henry Ephron 's Three 's a Family , largely because the fun stems from the misadventures of an aging obstetrician rather than from those of expectant moth ( Old Dr. Bartells has been called b from retirement because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the armed forces .
