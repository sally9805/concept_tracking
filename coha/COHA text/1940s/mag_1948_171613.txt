Catholic scholars <P> have taken the dynamite <P> of the church ; <P> they have wrapped it up <P> in nice phraseology , <P> have placed it <P> in an hermetically <P> sealed container , <P> placed the lid <P> over the container , <P> and sat on the lid . <P> It is about time <P> to take the lid off <P> and to make <P> the Catholic dynamite <P> dynamic . <P> The man who wrote this is listed in the American Catholic Who 's Who as an " apologist " for the faith . He is really an agitator . For 35 years he traveled up &; down the U.S. in the dirty , ragged clothes which were his only possessions , sleeping in flophouses , eating in skid row joints , inveighing to everyone he met against industrialism , war and Christian smugness . His name is Peter Maurin . <P> Respectable people did not often listen to Peter Maurin . But in 1933 , his Catholic dynamite set off Dorothy Day , a young Manhattan radical who had flirted with Communism and Socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Together they launched a monthly paper , the Catholic Worker , and opened a " House of Hospitality " in Manhattan 's tough and dirty lower East Side , where anyone that came could be fed , clothed and sheltered as long as there was anything to share . Money would somehow be provided , they felt . When the first issue of the Worker came off the press , the editors had 92 amongst them . <P> With this month 's issue , the Catholic Worker begins its 16th year . Old Peter Maurin , now in his 70s , is crippled and numbly dying of arteriosclerosis of the brain . But the Christian dynamite he set off is still blasting away . The Worker 's circulation now totals nearly 70,000 . Nine other cities besides New York have Houses of Hospitality ( one of them in London ) . Each is staffed by workers who have dedicated themselves to voluntary poverty , pacifism , and the " 14 corporal and spiritual works of mercy . " * Wrote Editor Day , 50 , in the Catholic Worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and the weapons of the spirit is meaningless unless we try in every way to embrace voluntary poverty and not work in any position , any job that contributes to war . . . We must give up our place in this world , sacrifice children , family . . . And we will be considered fools for Christ . " <P> <P> * Corporal works of mercy : to feed the hungry , give drink to the thirsty , clothe the naked , harbor the harborless , visit the sick , ransom the captive , and bury the dead . Spiritual works of mercy : to instruct the ignorant , counsel the doubtful , admonish sinners , bear wrongs patiently , forgive offenses willingly , comfort the afilicted , and pray for the living and the dead .
