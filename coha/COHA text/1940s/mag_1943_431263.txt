IN YOUR postwar home you will find a fifth freedom ? freedom from most of the traditional inconveniences , inadequacies , and high costs of the house of the past . In short , freedom to live in that same postwar future . Everyone knows that the automobile of tomorrow will be very different from the last prewar models . The same will be true of radios and refrigerators , ranges and furnaces , sanitary and electrical equipment , and even of the roofs , floors , walls , and windows of our new houses . In some of these , improvements have come in the past at widely spaced intervals ; others have seen minor annual changes . But it never seemed to the manufacturer that he could afford scrap all his dies , tools , and machinery make a revolutionary change in his product however far ahead of him his engineers an architects might be . Now , however , all his equipment has been scrapped to meet war demands , and with peacetime conversion he will be free to build the best refrigerator . range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , designers , and architects can conceive , however revolutionary it may be in material , structure , or equipment . Besides being freed from the restriction of existing equipment , these building industries will fin themselves aided by recently developed new materials and by astonishing new uses for old ones . The result is bound to be something very like a revolution in house building and equipment . Your home of tomorrow will be a better and a cheaper house ? one designed of modern materials , by the best modern engineering thought and facilities , and geared to modern living . It will be cheaper because it  | will be largely or wholly prefabricated . But it will be a far cry from the boxlike " modern " houses that we have known . Prefabrication will at first accommodate styles of design familiar to us , but it will gradually adapt itself more , functionally , to modern living . The manufacturer will make your house of tomorrow in wall slabs , roof , and floor sections that can be shipped to you in a flatcar . Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and coldwater pipes , and , in some instances , soil pipes . They will be completely wired with continuous base outlets . The ceilings may come with concealed cove lighting . Plywood glued in place will make outside and inside walls tighter and stronger than our present ones . Or the interior ones may be made of new plastic materials that can be wiped off clean , will never develop unsightly cracks , need never be papered or painted , but can be , if you wish . Or they may have semiporous surfaces that absorb sound , and into which nails can be driven and withdrawn without leaving holes . Windows and doors will come in certain of the sections , but , far from determining a standardized design , these sections will fit into houses of innumerable architectural types . Your architect has only to choose the particular section that his design  | calls for . Your new windows will be doubleglazed , with dead-air spaces between the panes for insulation against both heat and cold . If you wish , they may be for vision only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottom for ventilation . For other windows , which may be opened horizontally to their full width , there will be complete weather stripping and screens . With both types will come filters for pollens . Radiators and registers , you will be glad to know , are to give way to piping within the walls of your house . Installation costs , which will be somewhat higher , will be offset by a fuel saving of one third of present average heating costs . Heating systems will incorporate air-conditioning . In other words , you will have humidified winter heat thermostatically controlled , and summer cooling with proper circulation of dry , filtered air . Windows need never be opened . Your heating will be automatic , of course , whether you use coal , coke , gas , or oil . Where there is cheap hydroelectric power , electricity will not indirectly heat your home by means of hot water or steam , but will work directly through heating elements within the walls and floors , integral with the prefabricated sections . Since postwar heating systems will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily be found for them . So , in planning your house of tomorrow you may write off a large part of the expense of digging a cellar and building waterproo f cellar walls , for with advanced types of flu r construction , new chemical ground treatments , and the use of copper shields , toe dangers of damp and of termites are eliminated . Only small footings will be required . Many houses will be built on precast concrete slabs which will contain pipes for floor heating . Your house may also be soundproof . Rooms will be so insulated from each other that your sleeping will be undisturbed by the noise of the late party downstairs . Radio installations and television devices will be in each room . Even more revolutionary than the changes already mentioned will be your all-metal or all-plastic kitchen built in one unit , and capable , in whole or in part , of removal and trade-in , like an automobile . Ranges will have lighted , transparent oven fronts . Time and heat control will have been developed so that before the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may put the whole dinner on the stove . Time-controlled to start cooking at a determined time , the dinner will be ready to serve on schedule . If she is late in returning . nothing will burn , for the heat will be automatically reduced to warming temperature at a set time . The real revelation , however , will be your refrigerator . It is likely to be a plastic cabinet with transparent doors , and a cylin- drical revolving interior . No hunting in dark recesses for the elusive butter ; you switch on a light , turn the shelf levers until the butter dish appears up front , and then open the door to that particular shelf by dipping out a concealed handle , or stepping on a convenient pedal , or by knee action against a button . Ice cubes will be dispensed individually by pressing a button . Cracked ice will be available in the same manner . These ice dispensers will be separate from the main cabinet , so that no cold will be lost in removing the ice . Within the refrigerator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water uncontaminated by near-by foods . In your house of the future there will be devices for both the freezing and the dehydration of your surplus garden foods , and means will be provided for their proper storage . Ultraviolet-ray tubes placed at strategic places in the kitchen will kill harmful bacteria in the refrigerator , prevent mold in the bread box , and sterilize dishes . The same fine engineering will mark the unit bathrooms and lavatories of your home . In many cases these will come in the same unit with the kitchens , back to back , on one wall , to reduce plumbing lines to a minimum . Or they may come in double bathroom units . Your shower will have sliding nonbreakable plastic walls . You will be able to set the temperature for your bath , and the water will mix itself . Condensation units within both the shower and the tub enclosures will eliminate steam , and low-voltage units behind mirrors will prevent condensation on them .  | Towel bars will be warmed to dry towels , unless a new and satisfactory substitute is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , concealed ultraviolet-ray units will go on and off while you are shaving or bathing . Soap dishes will be designed to drain off water , or all our soap for use in the home may come in liquid form . Hand faucets will give way to flush , buttonlike controls , or floor pedals . Clocks and bath scales , as well as properly lighted dressing tables , will be standard equipment . Your closets will be designed with a particular functional purpose and with care to make the maximum use of every cubic inch . They will , of course , be purchased as complete units . Throughout your house , devices of all kinds will be built into walls to free space for easier movement . Laundry machines will wash , rinse , dry , and sterilize clothes in one continuous operation ; and machine ironing , much improved , will become more common . Your house of tomorrow will be so flexible that it will be capable of being adapted at short notice and small cost to the changing needs of your family . Extra rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such additions today . Within the shell of the house , partitions may be changed to new locations in a few hours . Tomorrow 's house will be able to spread itself horizontally , too , for it will not be limited by the edges of the present 40-foot city lot . Express highways and high-speed transportation will make it possible for people to live in ever-widening circles from urban centers , and will make the narrow city house plot obsolete . You will build your house tomorrow on a larger plot of ground , with lower property tax , at no greater timedistance from your work . With more space to spread out , houses will be built around play areas . You 'll get into the sun more , and the sun will get into you more . Planned as an economical unit , your house of tomorrow will cut down home living costs , decrease housekeeping labors , and reduce the family 's doctor bills . Through radio and television it will become more a part of the outside world . But modern engineering will have made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
