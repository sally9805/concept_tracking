Columnist Dorothy Thompson , the greying seeress of the New York Herald Tribune , long ago clinched her title as No. 1 U. S. Breast Beater . One of the things over which Miss Thompson beats her breast is U. S. Isolation . Sometimes , impatient with U. S. Isolation , she has personally intervened abroad . Last week , after visiting the Maginot Line , she was soothsaying from a war-tremulous Paris . <P> Even in these shocking days , her words were a shock to the arch-Republican readers of the arch-Republican Herald Tribune . Miss Thompson asked herself : " What is the very wisest thing we could do ? " And like a shot from a French 75 , she answered : " It is not wise to make any change in the Presidency or in the Department of State . " <P> Miss Thompson proceeded to make a clean breast of it : " The President has been right . He foresaw what has happened , when people were branding him a calamity howler . In the democratic world he is a figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse for the cause of democracy and freedom than the Nazi occupation of Switzerland . " Miss Thompson then had the feminine audacity to propose that the G. O. P. not only hail Term III , and renounce any opposition , but nominate only a Vice-Presidential candidate : Wendell Willkie . <P> A national desire for political unity in time of crisis soon became apparent , although not on Miss Thompson 's terms . To the White House Franklin Roosevelt invited his 1936 G. O. P. opposition : Presidential Nominee Alf Landon , Topeka oilman , Vice Presidential Nominee Colonel Frank Knox , Chicago Daily News publisher . After his visit , Publisher Knox announced a plan to establish several air service training camps " Aviation Plattsburgs . " <P> In the first rush of national alarm , Republicans Landon , Knox , Thomas E. Dewey , Herbert Hoover hailed the President 's defense message . " The President is right , " said Herbert Hoover . But alarm over U. S. security was quickly succeeded by alarm over the fate of the G. O. P. in 1940 . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tragically late . " Republicans in Congress listened in visible melancholy to Mr. Roosevelt 's demand for 50,000 planes , haunted by a sombre vista of another four New Deal years . Third Termites were uncontrollably elated-they believed the Republican Party was the first U. S. casualty in World War II ; and that their amateurish maneuverings for Term III were blossoming as a national demand to Draft Roosevelt . Both Republicans and Third Termites believed that the President wanted Term III , would accept the nomination . <P> But some observers close to the White House still thought they knew better . Their reasoning : Mr. Roosevelt has many times said that only an almost inconceivable crisis would make him a Term III candidate . Such a crisis might be the conquest of England and France by Adolf Hitler . To the question : Are the German successes enough to make him change his mind and run ? their answer was : No , not yet .
