Last week the U.S. felt that it could afford to turn down an opportunity to make the best aircraft engine that Britain has yet devised . This did not mean that the U.S. already has the best air craft engines in the world- far from it . But it meant that , rightly or wrongly , responsible officials thought the U.S. engines now coming up were so promising that it would be foolish to try experimenting in new fields . <P> This belief of U.S. officials made a sad man , a man with cool heels , of an engineer named Alex Taub . A British-American , a Chevrolet man who went to work for Vauxhall Motors Ltd. ( the General Motors in Britain ) , Mr. Taub returned to the U.S. last December with a mission and three specimens of a whang-dinging good British aircraft engine . The mission : to persuade the U.S. to manufacture the engines in quantity . The engine : Napier 's 24-cylinder , 50-horsepower , inline , liquid-cooled Sabre ( TIME , May 5 ) . <P> By this week , wispy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best the U.S. could do was offer to manufacture a few Sabres for experience . For the rest , Britain would have to lean on its own productive plant for its supply of the sensational new engine . One reported reason for this cold shoulder was that British bigwigs in the U.S. did not want to complicate their purchasing with a new item . Another was that the services and OPM thought they had good enough engines now , better ones being made , still better ones in the works . <P> U.S. engine builders and aircraft design ers were up to their hips in a great war of horsepower- a technical war that may well win or lose World War II . Pinched for machine tools , already well along on designs for tomorrow 's engines , they had no time for a new engine that would also call for new/plane designs . <P> Whatever the merits of Alex Taub 's quest , the Sabre , already flying in the formidable Hawker Typhoon fighter , was a fair symbol of the horsepower race . Well knowing that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out after horsepower . The Sabre turns up nearly twice the horsepower of the old British pursuit engine , the 1,200 horsepower Rolls-Royce Merlin ( which Packard is still tooling up to make for Britain and the U.S. , under a $187,500,000 order ) . But the U.S. is hot after horsepower too : it already has 2,000-to-2,200 h.p. engines flying . And last month in London , Pan American Airways President Juan Terry Trippe let it be known that U.S. engine manufacturers , now going into production in the 2,000-2,200 h.p. range , are developing aircraft engines of 3,000 h.p.
