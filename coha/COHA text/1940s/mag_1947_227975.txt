Colonel Blimp nearly fainted in his bath : in Health Minister Aneurin Bevan 's leftist Tribune had appeared a headline : " Nationalize the M.C.C . " The M.C.C . is the Marylebone Cricket Club , blueblooded governing body of the national sport . Wrote poker-faced George Harrison in London 's News of the World ' . <P> " Certain more or less influential supporters of the Government are backing the idea of Government ownership . The proposers of this delicious plan are basing their case on the poor showing of the M.C.C . team in Australia . They declare that our failure in the test matches will have grievous repercussions on our prestige throughout the world and particularly with those cricket-playing races east of Suez , which already have suspicions that the Mother Country is decadent . " <P> The Government , said the Tribune , should nationalize the M.C.C . for the same reason that it had nationalized the coal mines : efficiency . It foresaw the day when players ' wages would rise , trade-union officials would sit on the selection committee and the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . headquarters . " Then England 's team would really be England 's team , and every player could feel that he was representing the entire country , not just a few private individuals . " <P> Officials of the M.C.C . refused to comment . But one member said : " If this is a joke , I consider it in very poor taste . It is nothing short of abominable and I refuse even to discuss it . " <P> No doubt Columnist Harrison had missed a note tucked away in the Tribune : " Readers are advised not to take the article on cricket , which appears elsewhere in this issue , too much to heart . "
