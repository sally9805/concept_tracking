 | As one goes north in Italy , one begins to see the testimonials of destruction . Amid the orchards of Tuscany , the province where Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were born and where half the old farmers look like Toscanini , one sees parts of villages burned to cinders and torn to pieces . Houses are split in two , holes are deep in the pavement , bricks lie along the road . It does n't help much that carousels have been set up in bombed courtyards and that children play in the dust . But the fields and the olive trees and the farm women , who still carry their baskets on their heads and walk along singing their folk songs ( though I am obliged to report that I heard one of them humming Begin the Beguine ) , do soften the impression . There is a storybook , unreal aspect to the scene . When you get to Milan , an industrial city , the damage becomes deeply depressing . You ca n't walk many steps in Milan without coming upon an ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings seem hale from a distance , but getting nearer , you see that the interiors are burned out ; the window frames appear to be in mourning , with their black borders . The city really need n't look so bad as it does . Everybody says it could have been tidied up and rebuilding begun . Why was n't it ? The penalty of Fascism is a fatigue so comprehensive and cynical that it has caused more damage than the bombs . The Milan men stand around in the debris and discuss which of the dozen parties they are going to vote for and who is going to help them . But they do not shovel away the bricks . Walter Toscanini , the maestro 's son , said to me , " I feel like a stranger here . In America we would have fixed it long ago . " It is terrible to see these people , with their deep sense of beauty , doing nothing about the ugliness around them . This fatigue and cynicism also bring about a contempt for law . Alas , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects to be bribed ? and with Italian grace and charm . It is clever to cheat . It is smart to be shifty . There is not enough milk for children ? yet if you want whipped cream , you can get it in the good restaurants at fantastic prices . Sugar is non-existent , but at $3.50 a pound it can be found quickly . Yet what Italians are capable of when they believe in a cause and when we give them intelligent cooperation ? this the rebuilding of the Milan Opera House , La Scala , demonstrates . The Scala is one of the most important opera houses in the world . It is the cradle in which some of our illustrious operas were shown when they were babies . Verdi 's last masterpieces , Otello and Falstaff , had their premieres at La Scala . So did Puccini 's Madama Butterfly . Here Aida was given its first European production . In August , 1943. a bomb fell directly on the theatre . Photographs of the damage show nothing was left of the interior ? no stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dome was gone . Reconstruction , prompted by Americans , was begun in July , 1945 . Today the outside looms as barnlike and cheerless as our Metropolitan in New York , though Giuseppe Verdi Street and Leonardo da Vinci Square . where La Scala stands , are more romantic names than 40th Street and Broadway . The Square is largely burned out . Leonardo 's face on the statue is black , and rubble still obstructs the main entrance of the house . On one door there are a few faded flowers and a sign that on this spot an anti-Fascist was shot . But inside ! There are new seats now , covered in red plush ; a new stage ; a new , hand-tooled and acoustically perfect roof ; and a chandelier as effulgent as in happier and more princely days . The @#  | theatre seats about as many as Carnegie Hail , but has many more boxes . These used to be owned b the rich families , and each family had the right to decorate its box in any color . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a painter , indifferent to the music , was putting the final touches to the ' last frieze . Toscanini returned here to raise the money necessary to finish the rebuilding of the exterior and to buy new sets to replace the burned ones . Tickets for seven concerts cost 15,000 lire ( $70 ) , a good-size fortune for Italians ; but the concerts were sold out . The week he arrived , all the bookstores featured Toscanini biographies , inexpensive but well printed . The leading picture magazine showed him . on the front cover , with the caption " The Wizard Returns . " He has n't been in Italy for nine years . When he appeared at the theatre , a seven-yearold girl , a pupil of the ballet school , very pink in a pink dress , handed him a bouquet of roses and made an eighteenthcentury curtsy . When he leaned to thank her , she ran away with modern speed . The orchestra received him standing . He was nervous and swallowed hard . He hatted a little with the men ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard diverse rumors about the orchestra . One rumor said it was so bad the maestro would pack up and leave immediately . Well , it turned out to be not so good an orchestra as our major orchestras , but under Toscanini they played like angels . The familiar miracle happened again . The old gentleman stood there and dug the music out of the men . At the daily rehearsals he sang it for them , he showed the violinists how to bow , he rehearsed each section separately , he begged , he pleaded , he thundered , he implored , he stamped the rhythm with his foot , he crouched and then raised himself high to evoke the last full measure of a climax , and he spread his hands to simmer the tone to a sweet softness ; and always there was the care , the infinite , honest care , for each and every little note . When they had finished rehearsing the first number , the musicians broke out into loud bravos . Toscanini waved the tribute aside and began again . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as if each of them had insulted him . But also , now and then , he would say , " Good . " On the last days before the first concert , work increased . Toscanini called two rehearsals a day . I never shall forget one rehearsal when things went badly : after it was over and the musicians had gone , Toscanini paced up and down the middle aisle of the theatre in deep distress . He then sank down on a chair and sat motionless for fully twenty minutes . His agony was so real and so heartbreaking that the few people still in the house did not dare move or talk ; they merely stood and looked at him . But the next morning he went at it again in perfectly good humor . And again he threw at the orchestra the exhortation " cantare , " to sing , the key word in his art . MEANWHILE , newspapers ? two-page affairs , which seem to come out every fifteen minutes ? kept printing stories with headlines such as " Toscanini 's Secret " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local music critic , denied access to rehearsals , dressed up as a workman arid sneaked in . The day before the first concert one paper printed in the upper righthand corner ( where our weather notices usually are ) : " Toscanini has renounced his fee to help rebuild La Scala . How about some of our industrialists doing likewise to help rebuild Italy ? " Several hours before the concert another paper appeared with this headline across its full width : " Thus Toscanini Reopens Old and Glorious Scala . " Underneath was a large photo ( faked ) of the full house and orchestra . Our soldiers arrived from all over Italy , mostly in jeeps . Italian visitors rushed around trying to get hotel rooms , and there were many loud and emotional scenes in hotel lobbies . There was , of course , a brisk black market in tickets . The program for the first concert was chosen on Jane Austen 's principle , " What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy . " It consisted of operatic selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boito , and Puccini , composers linked with La Scala . The second program was Brahms , Debussy , Respighi , and a " novelty " for Italy called An American in Paris . Beethoven 's Ninth , that enormous symphonic plea for one world , was the third concert . On the first night the theatre shone like  | an expensive engagement ring ? with all the lights turned on in a city long used to darkness and half-burned-out bulbs . Everything was in place : the red carpets . aid , the mirrors polished , the ushers dressed in black tights and wearing great silver chains that made them look rather like magisterial wine stewards . The audience started to arrive about an hour before the concert . Most of the men did n't dress , but most of the women did . Their coiffures were as new-made as the theatre . The filled house was a beautiful sight ; they were part of it and knew they were . Italian audiences have a habit of sanding until the last possible moment , greeting their friends with much handwaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the lights dimmed , they sat down , but immediately jumped up to greet Toscanini . They stood and applauded and shouted their welcome . He raised his hands for silence and could n't get it . He started the first number ? the adorable Rossini overture , The Thieving Magpie ? and there was so much vehement shushing that you might have thought a rocket was plying through the Scala . But then the music captured them . It was indeed playing that matched the theatre : everything stounded new and golden and shimmering . The rebirth of familiar music is Toscanini 's special achievement . He accomplished it here with all the enthusiasm of a young man and all the tenderness of an old man . The great climaxes of Verdi came like gusts of wind , and Puccini 's music , which usually is made to sound oily , sounded noble . In the middle of the first part of the program the audience could contain its excitement no longer and stood up again . The last number was the prologue to Boito 's Mefistofele , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ends dramatically , and this brought an ovation that made the previous ones sound amateurish . They screamed , " Bravo , Arturo , " feeling by this time no longer constrained to call him " Toscanini . " He came out four times in spite of some flashlight photographers , of whom he has a morbid fear . After that , hundreds went to the stage door . When he appeared , they applauded again and cried , " Well done , " and , " Thanks . " THE concert was broadcast all over Italy and transmitted by loudspeaker to the great square in front of the Dome . There twenty thousand people stood . Many of them had stood there three years ago and had watched the Scala burn and had seen the night watchman crawl from the theatre white with dust , and weeping . That the reopening of the Scala was important to the Italians is easily understood . But what happened in this faraway theatre is important to us , too . For just as we have learned that no country or people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true that no theatre or concert hall can live independent of other theatres and concert halls . In music as in all art , exchangefree , full , honest exchange ? is the lifegiving force . Verdi 's music came to us from La Scala . Now it was again played there by violinists bowing on strings imported especially from America , the musicians keeping their eyes fixed on the baton of the man who had found freedom and love in our country .
