For years , a favorite joke in the West was that the people of Moscow had a clean , sumptuous , artistically constructed subway , admirable in every respect except one : there were no trains . Unlike many other jokes about Soviet Russia , this one contained no grain of truth . The Moscow subway trains run , and they run well . <P> This week Moscow 's hordes of subway-riding white-collar workers and bureaucrats were full of stir as workmen put the finishing touches on a new subway line . It is the first segment of a Great Circle line that will intersect the present three spokelike crosstown lines ( see map ) . When the Great Circle is completed , the center of Moscow will have a fine system : a passenger will be able to get from almost anywhere to almost anywhere in the city by changing trains only once . <P> In Moscow 's Metro , each station has an architectural motif . The murals in the new station at the Central Park of Culture and Rest are devoted to " Leisure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of the 119th article of the Stalin Constitution : " Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have the right to rest and leisure . " Wall relief sculpture depicts musicians , sportsmen and dancers . At another station , the motif is " Victory of the Soviet People over Fascism " ; the mosaics show pilots , soldiers &; sailors . <P> There are no turnstiles on the Metro . Tickets are sold at booths , but most riders buy tickets in advance by the book . The passengers descend to the platforms by long ramps or escalators . Everything is brightly lighted , frequently by indirect ceiling lighting . An attendant tears off a part of the ticket , as in a U.S. movie house . Most of the subway attendants and some of the drivers are women . <P> Most trains consist of six cars ; the first car has a roped-off section for children , invalids and pregnant women . Seats , which run down the side of the cars , are upholstered with brown leather . There is no straphanging : standing passengers hold on to bars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conversation is possible . But there are no wall ads to entertain or annoy the traveler . <P> The Metro is closed from 1 until 6 in the morning . Rush hours occur just about the same time as in a U.S. city . The crowds are heavy too , but they do not push their way in &; out of cars with the blunt fury of stampeding cattle ( as is customary in New York City ) . Said one U.S. correspondent formerly stationed in the Soviet capital : " The Russian people just move along ploddingly ; they are not nearly so ferocious . "
