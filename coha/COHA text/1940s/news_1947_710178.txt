txt Secretary of State George O. Marshall and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal spoke today of the paralyzing effects they said the budget cuts proposed by Congressional committees would have on activities within their scope . Answering questions at news conferences , Secretary Marshall commented on the " impossible condition " that would be created if the Army was unable to provide adequate food for persons in occupied countries , and Secretary Forrestal stated that the Naval Reserve training program would be wiped out , new construction would ! cease and various shipyards would be forced to close . " My comment at the moment , " Secretary Marshall said , " is directed solely to that portion of the budget cut relating to the Army that refers to the food requirements of the people of those areas occupied by our troops  --  Korea , Japan , Germany and portions of Austria . " I would say this , that if the Army is deprived of the necessary funds , of adequate funds to provide food for those people who are so sorely in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our troops and for our governmental position in interna // tional commitments . We can not expect to maintain an occupation of countries like those with our troops if the people are starving . That would be an intolerable condition . " Secretary Forrestal , at a news conference arranged today at the request of Navy Department correspondents , reviewed some of the crippling effects which he said the proposed $750,000,000 cut in the Navy budget would have on " minimum " operations of the Navy Department . The Secretary observed that , as a former banker , he fully appreciated the " terrific job " Congress faced in attempting to reduce Federal expenditures . However , he traced how the Navy Department budget already had been " squeezed " from an original $8 , - 000,000,000 proposal and maintained that it now was down to ' bedrock . " If budgetary cuts are made without ample knowledge of what it means in our posture before the world , " he warned , " it eventually would invite disaster . " Reserve Program at Stake The immediate effect of a $750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill the Navy reserve program , for which $164,000,000 is needed ; close numerous Navy shipyards and shore establishments and virtually paralyze all new construction . He said the budget already was watered down to a point at which activities could not be reduced any further ; entire activities would have to be dropped . Vice Admiral Forrest P. Sher. man , who , as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations , is right-hand man to Fleet . Admiral Chester W. NImitz on operational matters , pointed out the Navy 's plight on fuel . The original budget , he said , proa ? vided funds to buy fuel to operate the fleet 120 days in the year , or ten days a month . Then the Budget Bureau scaled down the item and fuel prices simultaneously went up . This left the Navy with money to buy fuel for only three days ' operations a month . Obviously , Admiral Sherman said , this was an inadequate allowance in view of the Navy 's world-wide and training responsibilities . Mr. Forrestal ruefully pointed out that it cost money just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80,000,000 . It costs $25,600 to lay up an LST and $25,000 to lay up a carrier , he said .
