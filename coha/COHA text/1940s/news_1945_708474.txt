txt ? The organization of the Supreme Allied Command for the final , frontal offensive against Japan has been determined , it can be reported with certainty . Ii is no longer an issue of controversy or . friction between the American Army and Navy or between the Allied nations which will be participating in the climactic assault . There is complete agreement now established among all concerned . Because the concluding campaign in its opening and early stages will be amphibious , the Navy will be in undisputed charge at this point . Because American naval power will be predominant , an American admiral  --  probably Admiral William F. Halsey , who already has been making the Far Pacific something like an Allied lake ? : will be in supreme command . The Navy will remain in su- preme command until the land forces have penetrated into Japan proper beyond the protection of naval gunfire and until the Army // By John Beaufort Stall Correipondcnt of The Christian Science Monitor B-29 HEADQUARTERS , Guam . MAca ** fire of Tokyo has been set . Never since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air force carried flame to the center of a city as more than 300 ** carried it to Nippon 's Capital . In the early hours this morning at least 1,000 tons of incendiaries were dropped . and the figure may have been nearer 2,000 tons . The hurtling incendiary bombs turned clear black night into blistering day , spreading boiling lava flame patches until they covered almost 15 square miles and razed the majority of the buildings and dwellings in the area . Roughly ; it would be like burning lower Manhattan and part of sprawling Brooklyn across the East River , returning aviators disclosed at the Guam B-29 airstrip this morning . All-Out Incendiary Raid Brig . Gen. Thomas S. Power , who led the Guam-based Super-forts and circled Tokyo two hours . said , " The heart of the town is on fire . " Others said there was no comparison between this and the last fire raid over Tokyo . Incendiary experimentations have been going on ever since Tokyo raids began last November , but this was the first all-out incendiary attack . Unless the Japanese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plenty of trouble . Good Reports Maj. ? Gen.-Curtis E. Le May . to whom- General Power reported after his most successful Striperfort mission to date , said , " We are always conservative on results till we have seen photographs taken by a reconnaissance plane . Flight reports so far are very good . " Upward of 1,500,000 ' Japanese civilians live in the target area of last night 's attack . They are cramped more than 100,000 to a square mile in one of the world 's most crowded areas . They learned for the first time what the people of London , Warsaw , and Berlin have learned  --  the terrible effect of total war . Tokyo Evacuation Forecast discussion and no little confusion as to whether in the war against . Japan a distinction was to be made between the military and the civilians , between the military and the Emperor . Any doubt about the first distinction went a long way toward being answered last night . Except as it inevitably affected home industry , transportation , communications , and other public services , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be forgotten that in- dustrial war workers ? are a military factor and Tokyo is the Capital of Japan 's war industry . II this raid were succeeded by another of the same kind  --  and there is no reason why there should not be others  --  general evacuation 01 Tokyo 's 8,000,000 residents might become necessary . This would be bound to affect the running of the Japanese war machine in the Tokyo area . Only by inference can one attempt to interpret whether the raid signifies any clarification of the official United States attitude toward the Emperor and his symbols which the Japanese regard as sacred . The Imperial Palace , which lies outside the - Tokyo target area , could have been damaged . At least one returning B-29 pilot reported seeing it silhouetted in the glare of fires which sent smoke 18,000 feet high in " towering cumulus smoke clouds . " Questioned on this today , General Le May said the bombardiers were not instructed to spare the palace but that it was not in the target area . Technique Veiled Nothing can be disclosed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable degree of success-can be gath- ered from ' the fact that although hundreds of enemy searchlights probed the sky , ack ack ranged from Plight to heavy , and some night fighters were up , so far as is known not a singue bomber was lost over the target . Greater . use than heretofore of all the new Marianas B-29 air strips made it possible for a record number of planes to participate . Each plane carried a heavier load than ever before . These and other factors contributed to the record tonnage dropped on the target . It seems apparent that the versatility of these great planes- is just beginning to be displayed and General Le May intends to exploit this versatility to the utmost . Asked whether the fire raid marked a departure fiom previous raids in which pattern bombing and " pin pointing " of industrial targets were the methods used , he reportedly said to a staff officer : " It was just bombing and bombing . " At this point an American general  --  probably Gen. Douglas whose leadership and strategy have earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valuable  --  automatically will take over undisputed command . This formula has been initiated by the American joint chiefs of staff , has been approved by the Anglo-American combined chiefs of staff , and has been worked out and tested by previous amphibious operations . Because of the Predominance of American fighting power in the Pacific . the over-all strategy of the supreme offensive undoubtedly will be determined , by the joint chiefs of staff . with a review open to the combined chiefs of staff . There is evidence that the British are in accord with these plans . The decision settles long-standing speculati6n over the mooted question of whether the Navy or the Army will run the show as it nears the end . They both will run it and at clearly marked stages each will be in supreme command . There will be no overlapping authority at any time . Russia in Agreement It is also understood that if Russia at any time should become a participant in the Pacific war , Moscow would not be disposed to raise any question about the organization of the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically and the large-scale use of the British Pacific fleet already has been arranged . British and American sea forces will not be merged . The British Fleet will operate as an entity and maintain its own supply lines , preparations for which already are being advanced . While Chinese troops undoubtedly will be included in the invasion army ' which will assault the shores of Japan , the forces will be overwhelmingly American , and therefore the , command will be American . Chinese to Be Busy One reason the Chinese will be unable to participate in larger numbers is that they will be deeply involved in fighting the large Japanese army which will still be on Chinese soil . As the fighting narrows in on the Japanese homeland and'as the tentacles of Japanese conquest are severed progressively from their main lines of supply , it seems evident the American joint chiefs of staff expect these- countries to complete the task of disposing of the Japanese within their own borders . Thus the Chinese would be counted on to get the Japanese out of . China , the Dutch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as General moves north , ? the Filipinos probably would be sufficiently strong to deal with the remaining Japanese in the islands .
