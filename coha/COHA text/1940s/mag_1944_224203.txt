In the high-walled adobe jail of La Paz last week languished Mauricio Hochschild , probably the biggest mining mag nate in South America . Arrested as instigator of a plot against Provisional President Gualberto Villarroel ( TIME , May 8 ) , he was lucky to be alive . The Villarroel Government had thought of shooting him , then thought again when it pondered his connections , his influence , his hold on Bolivia . Instead of killing him , his captors handled him with the special care due such a special person . <P> The Magnate . The Government had jailed the most active member of Bolivia 's trinity of tin barons . The others : elderly Indian Simn Patio ( called one of the richest men in the world ) , who has not visited Bolivia since 1923 ; and elegant , Oxford-bred Carlos Victor Aramayo , who looks in remote La Paz like Anthony Eden in exile . <P> Hochschild was born in Biberach , Germany , son of a middle-class Jewish merchant . Trained as a mining engineer in Freiberg , he traveled all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chile , Peru , Brazil , Argentina . Sometimes he hoboed . <P> In 1927 he turned to Bolivia , began to apply modern techniques to abandoned , worked-over tin mines . Since then he has branched into copper , zinc , silver , tungsten-a variety of mine holdings which eventually exceeded those of Simn Patio . A few Bolivians welcomed Hochschild and his up- &-coming; ways ; others cursed him for stimulating the specialized mining economy which caused Bolivia 's underpaid , tuberculous , ill-fed masses untold misery , and prevented diversification which might have made a healthier economy . <P> Hochschild , called " Don Mauricio " by his well-wishers , is a big , bland man of 62 with a big , bald head , heavy brown eyebrows . He eats hugely , spills cigar ashes on his stomach , claims a stock of 2,000 jokes in various languages . He is charitable to nuns , priests , refugee Jews , and likes to hand out expensive Havana cigars as if they were calling cards . <P> Political Magnate . Soon after he started his Bolivian career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , shared with the rest of the tin trinity : to keep a " sympathetic " government , which would hold miners ' wages and standards of living to the lowest possible level . German Busch , the last President who tried to buck Hochschild &; friends , slapped him in jail , would have shot him except for powerful intervention reportedly by the U.S. and Argentina . ( Hochschild has a convenient Argentine citizenship . ) Soon afterward , Busch died ( official explanation : suicide ) . <P> Scanty reports from Bolivia last week indicated that President Villarroel and his Government of young Army officers and intellectuals were again at war with the tin companies . Hochschild again was the chief antagonist . Patio was in Montreal . Dapper Aramayo had ducked into sanctuary in the Spanish Embassy . <P> Don Mauricio , in jail , had every chance of getting out , or at worst of being exiled . He had many potent Argentine and U.S. friends . His foresighted charities had won him the support of many groups , including Jewish refugees . Benjamin Cohen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind bars , Don Mauricio was still a power-center of Bolivian politics .
