Sessions of the Brazilian Senate had become so dull that one day last week Rio de Janeiro 's big afternoon newspaper Diario da Nolle sent a cub reporter to cover the sitting . He got a red-hot scoop . At 2:25 p.m. , he spotted a Senator walking toward a desk halfway back on the left in the Chamber . That , was all he needed . The cub raced for a phone , gave the flash to his office : " Prestes is in the Senate ! " <P> For three months the whereabouts of sad-eyed Senator Luis Carlos Prestes , Secretary-General of Brazil 's outlawed Communist Party ( TIME , May 19 ) , had been a mystery . His reappearance was real news . Diario was all ready to come out with a front-page story that he was in Pernambuco . It replated so fast that the inside pages where the first story was continued made no sense . <P> Prestes asked the astonished presiding officer , white-haired Senator Fernando de Melo Viana , for permission to speak . He talked long enough to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiring against the Government with former President Getulio Vargas , and he praised Dictator Pern 's variety of democracy in Argentina , where the Communist Party is legal . <P> Nowhere did Prestes explain why he had been absent , or mention rumors that he had been in Russia . The cub reporter and everybody else forgot to ask him where he had been . Best guess was that he had stayed right in Rio , organizing new front parties for his illegal Communists to take over .
