txt BEAVERBROOK PUT IN THE WAR CABINET Believed Likely to Supervise Information if Shake-Up Retires Chamberlain By RAYMOND DANIELL Special Cable to THE NEW YORK Tams . LONDON , Aug. ** that Prime Minister Winston Churchill was planning an early reconstruction of his Cabinet were supported tonight by the announcement from Downing Street that Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , has joined the War Cabinet . The official statement said significantly that " for the present he would continue " in his present job . However , it was rumored in political circles that the recent indisposition of Neville Chamberlain , Lord President of the Council , who underwent an operation in a nursing home last week , might lead to the retirement of the former Premier from office . In that case , it was suggested that Lord Beaverbrook , who enjoys Mr. Churchill 's fullest confidence , might become Lord President of the Council as a sort of overlord of public information .

Although there is a determined press campaign under way to get Mr. Duff Cooper 's scalp , it is unlikely that Mr. Churchill would want to lose his services in the government altogether . Some compromise solution seems to be indicated and it may be that the inclusion of Lord Beaverbrook in the War Cabinet is it . At present Mr. Duff // Beaverbrook Joins Britain 's War Cabinet ; Chamberlain Retirement Believed Nearer // Cooper , although not a member of the War Cabinet , attends its sessions , and it might be possible for him to continue as Minister of Information , with Lord Beaverbrook , a full-fledged War Cabinet member , responsible for the dissemination of all news and propaganda both at home and abroad .

Important Reasons Cited One important reason why Mr. Churchill may wish to strengthen the propaganda arm of this country now is the intensification of the British blockade which , it is expected , may soon release a storm of criticism from neutral countries as well as territory occupied by the enemy against Britain . One of the tasks of any British Minister of Propaganda will be to convince the world , and especially the United States , that if starvation of the people of countries once allied with Britain results from the blockade it will be the responsibility of the Nazis rather than this country , which is fighting for its life and must deprive Germany of her seaborne raw materials even at the cost of causing untold suffering if Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord Beaverbrook to the War Cabinet has increased the membership of that body to six , at least temporarily . The other members are : Mr. Chamberlain , Viscount Halifax , Foreign Secretary ; Major Clement R. Attlee , Lord Privy Seal , and Arthur Greenwood , Minister Without Portfolio . Should Mr. Chamberlain , who , as Lord President of the Council , has only vaguely defined duties , decide that his health and age  --  he is o'er 70 ? do not permit him to continue in office , however , the members would number only five even with Lord Beaverbrook 's accession . Official announcement of his invitation to sit with those who are directing Britain 's singlehanded war against totalitarian Germany and Italy follows : " The Prime Minister has invited Lord Beaverbrook to be a member of the War Cabinet .

The new system has produced results and with the cooperation of the aircraft industry , the newspaper publisher 's drive and energy has greatly increased production and stimulated the purchases of planes and engines abroad , especially in the United States . During June and July , this year , the factory output of planes here was more than double the production in the same months of the preceding year when the factories were working almost on a wartime basis . Speaking recently , Lord Beaverbrook said that including purchases taken over from the French Government , he had spent $10,000,000 a day for every day his ministry had been in existence , representing $600,000,000 in about six weeks . This is the second war in which the Canadian-born publisher has been called to special service by his government . He was Minister of Information in 1918 toward the end of the last war .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
