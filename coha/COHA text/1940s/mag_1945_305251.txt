Events and armies were moving so fast last week that newspaper mapmakers could not keep up with them . According to the Brussels radio , many American tanks had outrun the maps they had and new ones had to be dropped by plane . <P> Other news of military maps : <P> Rhine-crossing paratroopers carried maps that glow in the dark . Amphibious troops as far apart as the Rhine and Okinawa had maps showing high and low water areas , slippery cliffs and rocks . <P> In each carrier plane 's air-sea rescue kit is a Celanese rayon-acetate map , printed on a salt-and-sun-proof pocket handkerchief . <P> The Army Map Service has turned out more maps , in greater variety , than have been used in any previous war . ( For the Normandy invasion it produced some 70,000,000 copies of 3,100 different maps . ) <P> Now the Map Service has something new to boast about : a phenomenally durable map paper . It can be folded &; refolded 3,540 times in one place before it will tear . Sample maps were tossed with dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet again . Then they were tacked to a floor , trampled , slathered with mud , grease , paint and gasoline . They came out clear and usable . A little vexed by such inanimate obstinacy , a testing engineer put a match to one map , reported happily : " Map burns easily . "
