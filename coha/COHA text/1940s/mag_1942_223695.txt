It was the eve of one of the bitterest New York Democratic Conventions in memory . Delegates from all over the State milled through Brooklyn 's Hotel St. George , checking in , registering , spilling over into nearby bars and grills . Late into the night they went for the big steaks and big gossip at the tables in Joe 's Restaurant , Gage and Tollner 's , Grogan 's . They were waiting for the word . <P> Across the East River , in Manhattan 's Biltmore Hotel , the party 's leaders met behind closed doors in urgent conference . The table , set for 30 , was decorated with gladioli . The food was good , the occasion momentous . Out of such small , private , convention-eve dinners had come the name of every Democratic candidate for Governor since 1921 : Alfred E. Smith , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Herbert H. Lehman . <P> This time there was no harmony , no happy chitchat . Big Jim Farley , who had never come away from such a dinner the loser , was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Bennett . Franklin Delano Roosevelt , President and leader of the Democratic Party , was dead set on Senator James M. Mead . Farley had the votes-promised by men who never yet broke a promise to Big Jim . The White House had the influence , the pressure , the big stick that local politicos hate to stand against . <P> No one gave an inch . The plates were cleared away , the men lit cigars . For nearly four hours they argued . Big Jim and his cohorts held their ground . So did Franklin Roosevelt 's men : short , swart Governor Lehman ; smooth , tough National Chairman Ed Flynn , a bumbling upstate leader named Terence J. McManus . <P> Finally Governor Lehman played his last desperate trump against Jim Farley 's majority of votes . He had a letter from Franklin Roosevelt suggesting a way out : Mead and Bennett would both withdraw , a dark horse would be named , party harmony would be saved . Why not ? <P> Big Jim Farley , who teethed on such offers , knew that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shook his head . The dinner broke up . Now it was up to delegates , pulled one way by loyalty to Big Jim , pushed another by White House pressure . <P> The convention opened in the St. George 's white-walled , flag-draped ballroom . Up stepped Governor Lehman to make the keynote speech . There was only milk-mild applause at his mention of President Roosevelt . But when Jim Farley stepped to the microphone he got an ovation . So did his good friend , Boss Frank V. Kelly of Brooklyn , who could win the fight for Farley by holding his 193 delegates fast . <P> Farley had the votes-could he keep them ? The convention adjourned for jockeying . Mead 's backers worked furiously ; to all who went to their suite , they invoked the power and prestige of the White House . <P> But Big Jim worked too , plodding up &; down the hotel corridors , talking to his men . He wanted no explanations ; he just wanted to know if their word was still good . <P> The delegates looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . <P> The Big Day . At 11 o'clock next morning , the delegates began to file back into the convention hall in a welter of excitement and rumor . The meeting was 45 minutes late starting ; the leaders were all gathered behind the speaker 's platform ; nobody knew what was going on but everybody knew something was .
