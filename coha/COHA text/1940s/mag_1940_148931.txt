A tough , profane , horny-handed labor boss is James Caesar ( " Mussolini " ) Petrillo , head of the Chicago local of the American Federation of Musicians . The only instrument he ever played was the trumpet . But poorly as he played it , Petrillo 's trump has sounded like Gabriel 's to many an employer of musicians . No one has fought more fiercely than Petrillo against canned music in theatres , dance halls , on the radio . By forbidding men of his local to make records which might be broadcast , he led a successful nationwide fight to get more musicians employed by broadcasters . Grateful , 11,000 dues-paying Chicago musicians have made Jimmie Petrillo the best-paid union boss in the U. S. He gets $26,000 a year - $1,000 more than John L. Lewis , whom he hates , and whose name he censored out of two Chicago shows last year . <P> Last week in Indianapolis an A. F. of M. convention elected Boss Petrillo president of the big , powerful union ( 130,000 members ) . He succeeds Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 years , retires in ill health to a life sinecure at the same $20,000 a year he has been getting .
