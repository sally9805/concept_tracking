Above the Arctic Circle , continuous daylight last week illuminated the last efforts of a haggard , heroic band of Austrian ski troops to hold the one bit of dry land which the Allies have wrested from the Nazi war machine . German airmen tried to strengthen their comrades ' failing grip , but massed Allied warships , planes , artillery and foot soldiers on all four sides brought about at last the recapture of snow-clad Narvik , all-but-forgotten Norwegian outlet for Sweden 's high-grade iron ore . <P> For seven weeks the Allies had been balked by a tall , lithe athlete of 49 , whose starving troops call him " The Bull . " Olympic athletes of 1936 remember him , Lieut . General Eduard Dietl , as organizer of the winter sports program at Garmisch-Partenkirchen . His division of mountain troops , which he trained himself and led , as he did all things , with fierce personal daring through the Carpathians in last autumn 's Polish campaign , was bottled up when British destroyers and the battleship Warspite blasted into Narvik on April 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone aloft in a warplane to call his friend Adolf Hitler in person by radio telephone . Hitler commanded his other generals in Norway : relieve Dietl at all costs . <P> A German relief column proceeding northward overland from Namsos last week was 118 miles southwest of Narvik at Bodo ( pop . 6,000 ) , which German air bombs completely incinerated . There a Norse force and a few British survivors still blocked the way . Allied warships said they sank seven German transports trying to bring Bull Dietl reinforcements by sea . <P> Around Narvik , swift ski patrols dispatched German parachutists almost as fast as they were dropped . <P> Narvik lies at the western forefoot of a mountainous promontory between two fjords . Last week a French general and General Fleischer of the Norse 6th Division superintended a 24-hour assault , begun at bright midnight . British warships ' fire and French artillery covered landings by French Alpine troops across the north fjord to one side of the promontory . Polish troops pushed in from the other side . Bull Dietl and his few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the promontory into Sweden . <P> The ore railroad threads through tunnels out of Narvik toward the nearby Swedish iron mines . Dynamiting some tunnels shut as they went , the Germans used others as fortresses . They blew up switches , heaped the tracks with wrecked rolling stock , made true Berlin 's wry announcement that if lost , the Narvik ore port would be useless to the Allies for a long time to come . At Narvik , the British admitted losing their 4,290-ton anti-aircraft cruiser Curlew , specially armed to shoot down just what finally sank her . <P> Some of his men had surrendered , some had mutinied and crept into Sweden , but Bull Dietl was believed still alive at week 's end . He fought on to keep for Germany , besides access to iron ore , an important source of strategic information . From observations made in the Narvik area , Nazi meteorologists make long-range forecasts of western Europe 's weather , determined by south-flowing air masses over the Gulf Stream .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
