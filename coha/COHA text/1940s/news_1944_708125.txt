txt Mr. Roosevelt 's repudiation of the Communists will not discourage them for a moment from continuing to give him their support . It is impossible to repudiate a Communist so successfully that he will stay repudiated  --  if his party line tells him to stand pat . At present the party line is hot support of Mr. Roosevelt because of one factor and one factor only  --  the attack that Hitler launched against Russia in the summer of 1941 . For those who think otherwise , and who like to believe ( especially for campaign purposes ) that there is some deep political affinity between Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Browder , it is useful to recall that at this point in the last Presidential campaign Mr. Browder was throwing at Mr. Roosevelt every political argument on which he could lay his hands . In 1940 the Communist party denounced Mr. Roosevelt as a " warmonger , " a " dictator , " a " usurper " of power and an oppressor of labor . It was only when Hitler attacked Russia , and Mr. Roosevelt made American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have done  --  that Mr. Roosevelt became anything but a villain in Communist eyes . He will become a villain again the moment Communist loyalty to Russia calls for the shaping of a new party line . In these circumstances " the Communist issue " is more than a little spurious , so far as the 1944 election is concerned . And in the radio speech which he made from the White House on Thursday evening Mr. Roosevelt dealt with another equally spurious issue . This is the charge that the Administration intends to keep " young men in the Army and the Navy , after their services are no longer needed for military purposes , because it fears the problem of postwar unemployment . Mr. Dewey has made this charge not once but several times . The only evideqce he has ever submitted to support it is a remark of General Hershey , made at Denver on Aug. 21 , to the effect that " it is cheaper to keep men in the Army than it is to set up an agency to take care of them when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out ( 1 ) that it is no part of General Hershey 's duty to plan the demobilization of the Army and the Navy , ( 2 ) that Federal legislation introduced last May and now on the statute books specifically declares that " the War and Navy Departments shall not retain persons in the armed forces for the purpose of preventing unemployment or awaiting opportunities for employment , " and ( 3 ) that a plan for the demobilization of the Army based on the preferences of enlisted men themselves has been announced by the War Department . It is obvious that continued talk of plans to keep men in the armed services after they are no longer needed there is not only deeply troubling to the families of these men , but that it could easily do great damage to the morale of the fighting forces at the battlefronts . For these reasons we hope that Mr. Dewey will recognize this issue as the spurious and dangerous thing it is and drop it .               @ @ @ @ @ @
