No lantern was needed in the Old North Church to signal the news . This week , as the first of 50 trucks from Texas pulled into Boston , housewives were as eager as so many Paul Reveres to gallop down to the " Automatic Bargain Basement " of Wm . Filene 's Sons Co . <P> Filene 's , which could sniff a bargain halfway across the continent , had bought $1,400,000 worth of merchandise damaged in a fire at Dallas ' Neiman-Marcus Co. three months ago . In beating out about six other bidders , Filene 's had pulled off one of the biggest " fire sale " coups in U.S. merchandising history . <P> The goods , for which Filene 's paid about $400,000 , went on sale in the bargain basement this month at about 40% of Neiman-Marcus ' price . <P> Little for Charity . By such deals Filene 's basement has managed to operate profitably for 38 years , and has become something of a Boston institution . Its success is based on its automatic price-cutting policy . Any article not sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 18 days , it is cut another 25% ; after 24 days , another 25% . If the article is not sold in 30 days , Filene 's gives it away-to a charitable organization . But charity gets little : the bargain basement sells 90% of its merchandise the first day . Only one-tenth of 1% lasts long enough to be given away . Instead of creating a " wait-for-a-lower-price " policy , the system fans a " get-it-before-it's-gone " fever . <P> Other store basements sell only low-priced items , which may or may not be bargains . Filene 's basement sells only bargains , not all of them low-priced . It has sold $4,250 mink coats for $1,950 . It once bought pipes with flanges on the stem , sold them to men without teeth . Its corset department does its fittings in the aisles , but it sells some 260,000 corsets a year . <P> The basement , where the fast &; furious selling brings in upwards of $12,000,000 a year , scours the world 's top stores for discontinued stock . Some 90% of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugs by name in its ads . <P> Little for Service . Buying &; selling on a vast quantity basis , as the basement does , keeps the overhead down to a minimum . Filene customers serve themselves , pay cash , carry their own packages ( or pay a delivery charge ) . Frequently , the basement sells the same item as its upstairs store-but at half the price . <P> Other stores have tried the automatic system . But none has been as successful , chiefly because they have not been able to get enough merchandise at all times , nor at low enough prices . And it takes shrewd buying by Filene 's to keep from getting stuck with " bargains . " Said Vice President Harold D. Hodgkinson : " The customers really decide what are bargains . You just have to be right oftener than you 're wrong . "
