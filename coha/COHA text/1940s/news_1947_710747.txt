txt What do the peoples of other countries think of the United Slates ? This is a crucial matter as America 's world role expands . llere is the ninth in a series analyzing " what others think of the United States " Mr. Lucas , a correspondent of wide experience in the Balkan and Mediterranean areas , recently has spent considerable time investigating the Greek situation at firsthand . By Walter Lucus Special Correspondent 01 The ** Science Monitor Athens " Hi , Johnny , got anything to sell ? " The theme song with which European street urchins greet arriving Americans has reached Athens . Other things , too , have conic to Greece with the American missions . American labels have ousted many British brands from the mares of the black marketeers . Prices in the popular restaurants and bars have taken a sudden startling jump of 30 per cent all round . Pretty Athenian girls walk the streets and sit in caf ? s , their lower Jaws revolving in the slow rumination of gum chewing . The Americans have come to Greece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cars and jeeps . They have brought their wives and children and customs . Restaurateurs Shocked RestauriUltkeepers are shocked , beneath their welcoming smiles , when they are asked to serve an evening meal at 6:30 or 7 o'clock . " But no one in Athens , " they feel inclined to say  --  but do n't ? " ever thinks of dining before 9:30 or 10 . " But they and most of the rest of Greece are glad the Americans have come . The United States always was a fabulous land for the Greeks . It was a place where ly simple villager could go and , after 10 to 20 years , return home a veritable Croesus . Many an illiterate Greek is n't sure where this land of gold is on the map . All many of them know is that it is somewhere " over ? there  --  nodding their heads to the westward , across the shimmering Greek mountains . U. S. Part of England ? I once asked an old peasant where he thought the UNRRA food came from . He ? was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a black embroidered Jacket such as many of the older farmers wear , black in perpetual mourning for Byron , who was lost at Missolonern lighting for Greek freedom . He scratched his head and replied , " From England . " " No , " I said , " some of It conies from England , but the majority from Ametica . " He looked puzzled . " But America , " he mused , " is n't that a part of England " ? Greece , one of the few Allied countries in Europe which has not had an American invasion , is settling back and watching the new visitors . The first reaction Is one of hope and anticipation . The Greeks are getting ready to adjust themselves to a new situation . ' Nylon ' Enters Language Already a new word has crashed the Greek language , It is " nylon " and it means " the best . " You are sold " nylon " cherries , " nylon " cabbages , and " nylon " shoes in the shops . American equipment is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain . Beggars in the streets , mostly little children , are taking a new lease on life . Their numbers are growing . American generosity is proverbial . I saw young GI 's , attached to one of the missions , pursued down the street by a pack of small ragged kids , a look of expectation glinting in their eyes , " Got any gunur chocolate ? " they chirped . Thy were not disappointed . At the other end of the scale , some Greeks are rubbing their hands in anticipation , This is their time for money making in a big way , they think . UNRRA was fairly good picking , but now that American money is pouring in , surely some of it must stick to their pockets . Like Distant Relative But the serious-minded Greek , as he sits in his caf ? and watches the passing show , has other thoughts . He feels as though he were welcoming a distant relative of whom he has heard much but never met . I asked an old man , to whom the Turks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , how he viewed the arl  --  val of the Americans , " Well , " he said , " we shall have to get used to them as we did to the French and the English , and during the war to the Germans . Maybe I shall be picking up a little bit of their slang within a week or two . " But we 've got confidence in America . In the darkest days of war an American President was our beacon of hope . That hope has materialized and we arc on the way back . " Uneasy Questions If I were asked to sum up in one word what Americans coming to Greece means to the ordinary citizen , I should say relief . But this relief for the moment is tempered with a nagging twinge of fear . The two most fricileiAt questions that I am asked nre : " What do you think will happen after next year 's presidential election if Truman does not go back . Will we be forsaken ? " And then , " Do Americans realize what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they do realize it , will they last the course ? " Some Greeks hope they will not . One Greek put it thus : " Thank heavens you British are going at last , Why can not you take your American imperialist friends along with you ? " That man was a Communist .
