The curtain goes up in darkness and a picture of the Ixopo hills develops gradually in the background . From the orchestra pit a broad flight of steps leads up to the stage . Agroup of singers sits on these steps , so placed that they are not in the way of the action but can comment on it or ascend to take part in it at any time . The first scene is the tiny and cheap but clean sitting room in the home of Stephen Kumalo , near St. Mark 's Church near Ndotsheni , Natal , South Africa . As the curtain rises , we see SINGERS entering from the pit onto the center stairs , and also from right and left stage to positions on the side steps . The LEADER takes his place center stage and sits on a basket which he carries on stage . LEADER SingsThere is a lovely roadthat runs from Ixopo into the hills.These hillsare grass covered and rolling , and they are lovelybeyond any singing of it.About youthere is grass and bracken , and you may hearthe forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and matted.You can not see the soil.The grass holds the rain and mist , and they seep into the ground , feedingthe streams in every clove.The clove is cool and green and lovely beyond any singing &nbsp; of it . p. 3 ANSWERER But sing now about the lower hills . LEADER Where you stand the grass is rich and matted  --  but the rich green hills break down.They fall to the valley below  --  and , falling , change.For they grow red and bare ; they can not hold the rain and mist ; the streams run dry in the clove.Too many cattle feed on the grass ; it is not kept or guarded or cared for , It no longer keeps men , guards men , cares for men.The titihoya cries here no more . ANSWERER Yes , wherever the hills have broken down and the red clay shows through , there poor people live and dig ever more desperately into the failing earth . LEADER SingsThe great red hills stand desolate , and the earth has torn away like flesh.These are the valleysof old men and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young men and the girls are away.The soil can not keep them any more . STEPHEN KUMALO enters and sits on a chair behind the table . As the last of the SINGERS go out the lights come up on the sitting room . GRACE KUMALO , Stephen 's wife , enters , and a small Zulu girl , NITA , runs in with a letter and crosses to Stephen p. 4 NITA Handing the letter to StephenI bring a letter , umfundisi . STEPHEN KUMALO Where did you get it , my child ? NITA From the store , umfundisi . The white man asked me to bring it to you . STEPHEN KUMALO That was good of you . Go well , small one . NITA starts to go , but pauses GRACE KUMALO Perhaps you might be hungry , Nita . NITA Not-not very hungry . STEPHEN KUMALO Perhaps a little hungry ? NITA Yes , a little hungry , umfundisi . GRACE KUMALO There is a little bowl on the kitchen table , Nita . And a spoon beside it . NITA I thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ; GRACE crosses to him and looks over his shoulder at the letter GRACE KUMALO From Johannesburg . STEPHEN KUMALO Yes , August 9 , 1949 . GRACE KUMALO " Reverend Stephen Kumalo , St. Mark 's Church , Ndotsheni , Natal . " It is not from our son . p. 5 STEPHEN KUMALO No . It 's a writing I have n't seen . GRACE KUMALO It may bring news of him . STEPHEN KUMALO Yes . Let me think . Our son Absalom is in Johannesburg ; my sister Gertrude is there  --  and my brother John is there . But he has never written to me . He picks up the knife from the tablePerhaps the way to find out is to open it . He slits the flap with the knife and hands the letter to GraceRead it , my helper . Your eyes are better than mine . GRACE KUMALO It 's from your brother John . STEPHEN KUMALO Then this is truly an occasion . Read carefully , my helper . GRACE KUMALO " Dear Stephen , you old faker in Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dear sister Gertrude to Johannesburg or not , but if it was , for the love of your own Jesus send and fetch her back . She says she came looking for a husband who ran away from her . Maybe so . Anyway she 's found plenty husbands , and the stories about the kind of house she keeps are not good for my business , because it 's known here who she is . See to this soon , O brother in God , or I 'll have the woman put away where she wo n't be so noticeable . Your affectionate brother , John . " He 's an evil man . She sits p. 6 STEPHEN KUMALO HumorouslyNo , he honestly thinks that I am a faker . He thinks all men are fakers , perhaps because he 's one . But I am not concerned about that . I am concerned about Gertrude  --  if she has taken to bad ways . GRACE KUMALO What will you do ? STEPHEN KUMALO I do n't know . GRACE KUMALO She has a planIf you were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hundreds of miles . Where would I find the money to go to Johannesburg ? GRACE KUMALO There is the St. Chad 's money . STEPHEN KUMALO Absalom 's money  --  the money we save for his school ? You would have me use that ? GRACE KUMALO Should you not , Stephen ? Absalom will never go now to St. Chad 's . STEPHEN KUMALO How can you say that ? How can you say such a thing ? GRACE KUMALO He is in Johannesburg . When people go to Johannesburg they do not come back . STEPHEN KUMALO But Absalom will ! Absalom went to Johannesburg for one purpose  --  to earn money for his education ! When he returns he will bring twelve pounds of his own to put with the twelve we have saved , and then he will have enough for a year at St. Chad 's , and he will go there and learn quickly ! I know him ! p. 7 GRACE KUMALO It 's nearly a year since we had a letter from him , Stephen . We do not know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man could work in the mines and not change . Absalom will not go to school . Take the money  --  use it ! STEPHEN KUMALO Do you know what you are saying ? If I take his school money and use it to bring Gertrude back , then I have given up Absalom ! I have said by this action that he will not make a place for himself , that we shall not see him nor be proud of him again , that he is only a drop in the great river of blacks that pours into the earth and is seen no more ! I will not say this ! I will not think it ! GRACE KUMALO I love him as much as you , but why has he not written to us ? If there 's nothing wrong he could have written . STEPHEN KUMALO O mother of little faith ! A letter can be lost so easily ! We must not cease to believe in him . We must love him , and not doubt him . There 's a great gulf between people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child , between neighbor and neighbor . Even when you live in the same house it 's deep and wide , except for the love between us . But when there is love , then distance does n't matter at all  --  distance or silence or years .

Have you plotted the high cold course of a heron 's flying , Or the thought of an old man dying , Or the covered labyrinth ofWhy you love where you love ? Or , if one love you , Why your love is true ? Only for a little , then , Tease the wild justice down to dwell with men .

I 'm getting a good lawyer . A white man 's lawyer . And he 'll do all he can for all three . There 's no use trying to defend one alone  --  they all have to stick together in this . If they do that there 's a good chance , because the fact is there 's not much evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the servant . JOHN KUMALO Well , when our lawyer gets through with that , maybe not . You see , the only one the servant says he identified is Johannes Pafuri . He says he knew him because of his eyes . He 's got a peculiar twitch over his eye , and the servant could see his eyes , even with the mask on  --  so he says he 's sure it was Johannes . On the other hand , suppose it was somebody else with a twitch over his eye ? With the rest of his face covered it would be hard to be sure it was Johannes , would n't it ? Well , the lawyer will bring that up . And that 'll shake the identification . And there 's no other evidence against them , positively none . STEPHEN KUMALO Except that  --  they were there . They will have to say that they were there . JOHN KUMALO Why ? STEPHEN KUMALO Because it is the truth . p. 63 JOHN KUMALO The truth ! Why would they tell the truth in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , if they all say they know nothing about it , they 'll get off , as sure as God 's got whiskers . STEPHEN KUMALO But in a court there is a plea  --  guilty or not guilty . JOHN KUMALO Yes . They 'll plead not guilty . Everybody does . STEPHEN KUMALO But Absalom says he will plead guilty . JOHN KUMALO Good God ! Why ? STEPHEN KUMALO Because he is guilty . JOHN KUMALO Look , Stephen , if they do n't all tell the same story , anything can happen to them . Surely you see that . Let them prove the boys guilty if they can . It 's not up to the defense to hand ' em their case on a platter . STEPHEN KUMALO I have n't told Absalom what to say . But he says he will not lie again . That he 's done his last evil , and from now on he wo n't tell a lie or do any wrong . And so he will tell them that he was there . And that he shot Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  and Johannes ? STEPHEN KUMALO Yes . JOHN KUMALO Well  --  that changes everything . You better fix that , brother , and fix it fast , or I give you my word we 'll fix Absalom . Talk to him , brother . p. 64 STEPHEN KUMALO I have . He will plead guilty . JOHN KUMALO A man who pleads guilty to murder receives the punishment of the first degree  --  and that 's hanging by your neck with a sack over your head . They do n't fool about that . STEPHEN KUMALO He has already made a confession . He has admitted the whole charge . JOHN KUMALO He can deny that . He can say he was out of his mind  --  anything . STEPHEN KUMALO And Matthew and Johannes will plead not guilty ? JOHN KUMALO Of course they will . That 's part of the game . This is what happens in a court , Stephen . The defendant may be guilty as hell but he goes in and pleads not guilty and his lawyer tries to make the evidence look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak as hell but it goes in and tries to make things look as if the defendant 's guilty as a hyena . Each one tries to foul up the witnesses on the other side and make his own witnesses look good . If the defense piles up the most points , why fine , the old sheep-face of a judge says he 's not guilty . If the prosecution piles up the most points , why old sheep-face says hang him up . It 's a game . Truth has nothing to do with it . Now if Absalom pleads guilty it would make it look bad for all three  --  but do n't let him do it , brother , because I 'm going to get Matthew out of this , and anything Absalom says is going to be used against him . By me , if necessary . So talk to him , Stephen , talk to him as you never talked to anybody before . He does n't want to die  --  and you do n't want him to die . If you want him to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim . JOHN goes out . Stephen is left musing alone p. 65 STEPHEN KUMALO Sings " The Soliloquy " What have I come to here , At this crossing of paths ? Must he tell a lie and live  --  Or speak truth and die ? And , if this is so , What can I say to my son ? O Tixo , Tixo , help me ! Often when he was youngI have come to him and said , " Speak truly , evade nothing , what you have doneLet it be on your head . " And he heeded me not at all , Like rain he ran through my hands , Concealing , as a boy will , taking what was not his , Evading commands . For he seemed to hear none of my words ; Turning , shifting , he ranThrough a tangle of nights and days , Till he was lost to my sight , and ran far into evil  --  And evil ways , And he was stricken  --  And struck back , And he loved , and he was desperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cameTo this  --  O God of the humble and the broken  --  O God of those who have nothing , nothing , nothing  --  To this  --  To the death of a man ! To the death of a man !

" And can I go to him nowAnd say , " My son , take care , Tell no truth in this court , lest it go ill with you here ; Keep to the rules , beware " ? And yet if I say again , " It shall not profit a manIf he gain the whole world and lose his own soul , " I shall lose Absalom then.I shall lose Absalom then . He speaksI must find some other way  --  Some other hope.My son did not mean to kill his son , Did not mean to kill . He singsO Tixo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal ? He singsO Tixo , Tixo , help me ! He speaksWhere can I turn now ? He singsO Tixo , Tixo , help me ! The lights dim out , and come up on the door of a well-kept residence in Johannesburg . STEPHEN goes to the door , knocks , gets no answer , and starts to go . JAMES JARVIS opens the door p. 66 JAMES JARVIS Yes ? Did you knock ? STEPHEN KUMALO I  --  I 'm sorry , sir . I  --  expected a servant to answer  --  I  --  JAMES JARVIS There are no servants here today , umfundisi . Did you wish to see one of them ? STEPHEN KUMALO No , umfundisi . I wished to see you . JAMES JARVIS Yes ? STEPHEN KUMALO I  --  His body fails him . His cane clatters to the ground and he sits on the step . JARVIS comes down to himForgive me , umnumzana  --  His hat lies beside him , he reaches for it , leaves it JAMES JARVIS Are you ill , umfundisi ? STEPHEN does n't answer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up and speaks STEPHEN KUMALO Forgive me  --  I  --  shall recover . JAMES JARVIS Do you wish water ? Or food , perhaps ? Are you hungry ? STEPHEN reaches for his cane , with another effort gets to his feet . JARVIS stands watching him , finally picks up his battered old hat and hands it to him STEPHEN KUMALO Thank you , sir . I am sorry . I shall go now . p. 67 JAMES JARVIS But you said you wished to see me . STEPHEN KUMALO Yes , sir . JAMES JARVIS Well , then  --  ? STEPHEN KUMALO I have no words to say it . JAMES JARVIS You are in fear of me . I do not know why . STEPHEN KUMALO I can not tell it , umnumzana . JAMES JARVIS I wish to help whenever I can . Is it so heavy a thing ? STEPHEN KUMALO It is the heaviest thing of all my years . JAMES JARVIS You need not be afraid . I try to be just . STEPHEN KUMALO Umnumzana  --  this thing that is the heaviest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviest thing of all your years . JAMES JARVIS You can mean only one thing . But I still do not understand . STEPHEN KUMALO SlowlyIt was my son that killed your son . JARVIS turns and walks away  --  then comes back to Stephen JAMES JARVIS Why did you come ? STEPHEN KUMALO There were three who went to rob the house , umnumzana . Two of them have lied and said they were not there . My son has told truth , that he was there , that he fired the revolver that killed your son . He will die for this truthtelling , the lawyer thinks . p. 68 JAMES JARVIS Not for his truthtelling . STEPHEN KUMALO Umnumzana , could you intercede for him ? JAMES JARVIS One does not seek to influence a court . STEPHEN KUMALO He did not mean to kill . And he tells truth . Is there not a core of good in him who tells truth ? JAMES JARVIS My son left his doors always open . He trusted his fellow men . And for this your son killed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver was in his hand and he heard someone coming and was frightened . JAMES JARVIS Have you thought what it is for me that my son is dead ? STEPHEN KUMALO I have tried . I have thought of  --  my son  --  JAMES JARVIS Have you thought what it is for his mother ? His mother will die of this . It 's in her face . STEPHEN KUMALO I know . I can see the face of my son 's mother . Forgive me , umnumzana  --  I know what this is to you . But  --  if he were only to live  --  even shut up  --  even far from us . JAMES JARVIS I try to be just . I know what it is to lose a son . But  --  I say again  --  one does not try to influence a court . And even if the judge were merciful , mercy can be pitiless . If your son went free ten thousand others might be misled into the death he escaped . Better that one be punished where punishment is deserved  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he did not mean evil , umnumzana . And to die  --  when he is loved  --  JAMES JARVIS I know about death . STEPHEN KUMALO If I could take him back to his home , umnumzana ! Away from Johannesburg . He grew up in Ndotsheni . Among the hills . There was no evil in him then . From our house we could see up through the clove to your great house . You were kind to the folk who worked the little farms . Be kind again . A terrible thing has befallen my people . We are lost . Not many have found their way to the Christ , and those who have not are lost . My son was lost . This would not have happened if there were not the gold mines , and the great city your people have built , and the little hope we have . JAMES JARVIS Umfundisi , there are two races in South Africa . One is capable of mastery and self-control  --  the other is not . One is born to govern , the other to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization  --  the other is not . The difference between us is greater than that I live on a hill and you live in the valley . If my son had killed your son I would not have come to you for mercy . Nor to the judge . Whether it were my son or yours , I would have said , let him answer the law ! STEPHEN KUMALO You  --  you could save him  --  p. 70 JAMES JARVIS You have neither heard nor understood me ! There is only a handful of whites in South Africa to control the great tide of blacks  --  and the blacks have no control of their own ! They have no mind to it  --  and no mind for it ! It 's their way to run and evade and lie and strike down in the dark ! Those who will not keep order must be kept in order ! Those who lift their hands to kill must know that the penalty for death is death ! STEPHEN KUMALO HumblyUmnumzana  --  I read my Testament carefully . Jesus has not said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where there is government it 's true . Have you more to say to me ? STEPHEN KUMALO No , umnumzana . JARVIS turns to go in .

IRINA Sings " Stay Well " If I tell truth to you , My love , my own , Grief is your gift to me , Grief alone , Wild passion at midnight , Wild anger at dawn , Yet when you 're absentI weep you gone . Stay well , O keeper of my love , Go well , throughout all your days , Your star be my luckiest star aboveYour ways the luckiest ways.Since unto you my one love is given , And since with you it will remain , Though you bring fear of hell , despair of heaven , Stay well , come well to my door again .

All those in the court will see him . IRINA Then I wish to go . Umfundisi  --  is anything sure ? p. 72 STEPHEN KUMALO Nothing is sure . He will be tried . It 's not known what will come of it . IRINA He might go free ? STEPHEN KUMALO I wish I could say yes . He says he will plead guilty . He says he will speak the truth . If he does I think he will stay in the prison . For a long time . IRINA For a long time . STEPHEN KUMALO For a very long time . IRINA So that I will never see him ? STEPHEN KUMALO It may be many years . IRINA Many years . STEPHEN KUMALO Would you wait for him  --  if it were so long ? IRINA Yes , umfundisi . I would wait .

STEPHEN KUMALO And you will wait ? IRINA Yes . STEPHEN KUMALO Even if he does not come back at all ? IRINA I will still wait . STEPHEN KUMALO And when the desire is on you ? IRINA I desire only him . STEPHEN KUMALO Stroking her hairI will come tomorrow for you . And I will tell him that you wish the marriage . Stay well , Irina . IRINA Go well , my father . STEPHEN goes out . IRINA sings " Stay Well " When you have fled from me , My love , my own , I 've waited quietly , Here alone.Some come back at midnight , Or come back at dawn , Now that you 're absentI weep you gone .

The lights dim p. 74 p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 3 Act TwoSCENE 3 A courtroom . The judge 's bench is at the left ; the judge is seated . Absalom and Matthew are in the prisoner 's dock . In the courtroom are all those we have seen who are concerned with this case or related to the prisoners : Irina , Linda , John , Stephen , the servant , and many Zulu spectators . James Jarvis , Eland , and a number of whites sit on the opposite side of the courtroom . As the lights come up Johannes Pafuri is in the witness box , center , and Burton , the defense lawyer , is questioning him . BURTON Johannes , you have been identified as one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at that time ? JOHANNES PAFURI No , sir . BURTON Where were you ? JOHANNES PAFURI At Mrs. Ndela 's house , in End Street . BURTON How do you know you were there at eleven ? JOHANNES PAFURI Because we had been dancing at a place in High Street till nearly eleven , and at eleven we were at Mrs. Ndela 's . BURTON Who else was there ? JOHANNES PAFURI Matthew Kumalo was there , and the girls Linda and Rose . p. 76 BURTON The witness is excused . Will Matthew Kumalo take the stand ? MATTHEW KUMALO comes down into witness boxMatthew Kumalo , you are accused of being one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on October eighth , between eleven and twelve . Were you there at that time ? MATTHEW KUMALO No , sir . BURTON Where were you ? MATTHEW KUMALO At Mrs. Ndela 's , in End Street . BURTON You are sure of the time ? MATTHEW KUMALO Yes , sir . We had been dancing at the place in High Street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are late , but come in , " and we saw that it was near eleven . BURTON Do you know Absalom Kumalo ? MATTHEW KUMALO Yes , sir . He is the son of my father 's brother . BURTON Was he with you on this evening ? MATTHEW KUMALO No , sir . BURTON Do you know where he was ? MATTHEW KUMALO No , sir . BURTON The witness is excused for the moment . MATTHEW steps back to the bench and sits . BURTON crosses to the judgeYour Honor , I am about to call the third defendant , Absalom Kumalo . Before I do so I wish to explain that his plea of guilty is his own choice , and that I have not attempted to influence him in any way . p. 77 THE JUDGE I understand , sir . You many proceed . BURTON Absalom Kumalo , will take the stand . ABSALOM does soAbsalom Kumalo , you are accused of being one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on October eighth , between eleven and twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , sir . BURTON Who were the two masked men with you ? ABSALOM KUMALO Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri . BURTON What was your purpose in going there ? ABSALOM KUMALO To steal something from the house . BURTON Why did you choose this day ? ABSALOM KUMALO Because Johannes said the house would be empty at that time . BURTON This same Johannes Pafuri here ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , sir . BURTON When did you three go to this house ? ABSALOM KUMALO It was after eleven at night . BURTON Did you go there disguised ? ABSALOM KUMALO We tied handkerchiefs over our mouths . p. 78 BURTON And then ? ABSALOM KUMALO We went into the kitchen and there was a servant there . BURTON This man ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , that is the man . BURTON Tell the court what happened then . ABSALOM KUMALO This man was afraid . He saw my revolver . He said , " What do you want ? " Johannes said , " We want money and clothes . " This man said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johannes said , " Do you want to die ? " Then this man called out , " Master ! Master ! " and Johannes struck him over the head with the iron bar . BURTON Did he call again ? ABSALOM KUMALO He made no sound . BURTON What did you do ? ABSALOM KUMALO No , we were silent  --  and listened . BURTON Where was your revolver ? ABSALOM KUMALO In my hand . BURTON And then ? ABSALOM KUMALO Then a white man came into the doorway . BURTON And then ? ABSALOM KUMALO I was frightened . I fired the revolver . p. 79 BURTON And then ? ABSALOM KUMALO The white man fell . BURTON And then ? ABSALOM KUMALO Matthew said , " We must go . " So we all went quickly . BURTON Where did you go ? ABSALOM KUMALO I wandered about . I wanted to find a place to hide . THE JUDGE I have a question to ask , Mr. Burton . BURTON Yes , Your Honor . THE JUDGE Why did you carry a revolver ? ABSALOM KUMALO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE JUDGE Where did you get this revolver ? ABSALOM KUMALO I bought it from a man . THE JUDGE Was this revolver loaded when you bought it ? ABSALOM KUMALO It had two bullets in it . THE JUDGE How many bullets were in it when you went to this house ? ABSALOM KUMALO One . THE JUDGE What happened to the other ? ABSALOM KUMALO I took the revolver out into the hills and fired it . p. 80 THE JUDGE What did you fire at ? ABSALOM KUMALO I fired at a tree . THE JUDGE Did you hit this tree ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , I hit it . THE JUDGE Then you thought , " Now I can fire this revolver " ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , that is so . THE JUDGE And when Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri say they were not with you at the time of the murder they are lying ? ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , they are lying . THE JUDGE Do you know where they went after the crime ? ABSALOM KUMALO No , I do not know . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a plantation and buried the revolver . THE JUDGE And what did you do next ? ABSALOM KUMALO I prayed there . THE JUDGE What did you pray there ? ABSALOM KUMALO I prayed for forgiveness . THE JUDGE How did the police find you ? ABSALOM KUMALO Johannes Pafuri brought them to where I was . p. 81 THE JUDGE And what did you tell them ? ABSALOM KUMALO I told them it was not Johannes who had killed the white man , it was I myself . THE JUDGE And how was the revolver found ? ABSALOM KUMALO No , I told the police where to find it . THE JUDGE And every word you have said is true ? ABSALOM KUMALO Every word is true . THE JUDGE There is no lie in it ? ABSALOM KUMALO There is no lie in it , for I said to myself , I shall not lie any more , all the rest of my days , nor do anything more that is evil . THE JUDGE In fact , you repented . ABSALOM KUMALO Yes , I repented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , because I was in trouble . THE JUDGE Did you have any other reason for repenting ? ABSALOM KUMALO No , I had no other reason . THE JUDGE I have no further questions , Mr. Burton . BURTON The witness is dismissed . The lights dim on the courtroom , and the CHORUS comes forward p. 82 CHORUS SingsAnd here again , in this place , A man who has killed takes breathWith the fear of death in his face , Fear of death for death , And are the terms of justice clearly met ? Not yet , no , not quite yet . The courtroom lights come up again . The spectators are standing ; the JUDGE sits ; they all sit except the three boys who are awaiting sentence THE JUDGE The evidence in this case is in many ways inconclusive , unsatisfactory , and fragmentary . Some of the witnesses are or could be interested parties . Some of the accused appear to have testified in collusion with each other or other witnesses . There are many points not clear , some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems quite possible that Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri are guilty with Absalom Kumalo of the murder of Arthur Jarvis . It was the identification of Pafuri by the servant who was struck that led to Pafuri 's arrest . It was the arrest of Pafuri that led the police to arrest Absalom and later Matthew . The alibis offered by Matthew and Johannes are obviously doubtful . No reason has come to light why Absalom should involve in the robbery and murder two men who were not with him at the time and not guilty . And yet , after long and thoughtful consideration , my assessors and I have come to the conclusion that the guilt of Matthew and Johannes is not sufficiently established . MATTHEW and JOHANNES look at each other , puzzledThere remains the case against Absalom Kumalo . Except for his plea and his confession the case against him remains substantially that against . Johannes and Matthew . His guilt is not established in the testimony alone , but that testimony , taken together with his confession , leads us inescapably to the conclusion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should confess to a deed he did not commit , and his own insistence that he had no intention to kill operates to validate the confession itself . Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri , you are discharged and may step down . They do so , move over right quietly ; LINDA and ROSE rise and join themAbsalom Kumalo , have you anything to say before I pronounce sentence ? p. 83 ABSALOM KUMALO I have only this to say , that I killed this man , but I did not mean to kill him , only I was afraid . THE JUDGE Absalom Kumalo , The spectators lean toward the JUDGE , who puts a little black cap on his headI sentence you to be returned to custody , and to be hanged by the neck until you are dead . And may the Lord have mercy on your soul . IRINA rises , then STEPHEN . JARVIS gets up and crosses the courtroom . As he does so he is met by STEPHEN . JARVIS steps back to let STEPHEN pass . He goes to Absalom , who stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act TwoSCENE 4 The prison cell . The lights come up on the chorus .

And my son  --  killed him . And the mother of Arthur Jarvis is dead of grief for her son . My people , if I stay here now I become a hindrance to you , and not a help . I must go . PARISHIONERS You can not go , umfundisi ! You can not go ! No , umfundisi ! STEPHEN KUMALO This is a poor village , Ndotsheni , and it grows poorer . In the past when our little church was in desperate need we have sometimes turned to Arthur Jarvis , and he has helped us . He will not help here again . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who slew him was my son . I must go for still another reason , my dear people . When I began to serve my God and my church I had a sure faith that the God of our world ordered things well for men . I had a sure faith that though there was good and evil I knew which was good , and God knew it  --  and that men were better in their hearts for choosing good and not evil . Something has shaken this in me . I am not sure of my faith . I am lost . I am not sure now . I am not sure that we are not all lost . And a leader should not be lost . He should know the way , and so I resign my place . p. 93 MCRAE Umfundisi , if you have lost your faith , I too have lost my faith . PARISHIONERS Yes . MCRAE Where does a man go , and what does he do when his faith is gone ? STEPHEN KUMALO I do n't know . PARISHIONERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please stay ! STEPHEN KUMALO If I keep my place , and this black thing has happened to my son and is said , little by little the few who still worship here will shrink away , the rusty roof will leak more , the floor will break till there is none , the windows will go  --  they will be thrown at and broken and will go  --  and the unpainted sides of this chapel I have loved will stand empty , roofless  --  and I shall live in despair beside it , knowing that I have done this thing to you and to my church by remaining . STEPHEN starts to go  --  they all reach out to him and he pauses VILLAGER Sings " A Bird of Passage " Lord of the heart , look down uponOur earthly pilgrimage , Look down upon us where we walkFrom bright dawn to old age , Give light not shed by any sun .

STEPHEN KUMALO You  --  you wish to come into my house ? JAMES JARVIS Yes . STEPHEN KUMALO Come in , sir . p. 97 JAMES JARVIS EnteringI stood outside your church yesterday and heard what you said to your people , and what they said to you . I want you to know that I will help you with the roof and with the painting  --  and whatever must be done . I will do whatever my son would have done . STEPHEN KUMALO I  --  thank you , sir . The church will thank you . JAMES JARVIS Whatever you need . STEPHEN KUMALO Mr. Jarvis . He looks at the clockIt 's hard for me to think of the church or of  --  in a quarter of an hour my son is to die . JAMES JARVIS I know . I could n't sleep  --  thinking of it . STEPHEN KUMALO I think this does not touch you . JAMES JARVIS Yes . It does . STEPHEN KUMALO I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat here alone . JAMES JARVIS I know my presence pains you . I know I am the last man in the world you wish to see . And yet  --  may I stay for a moment ? STEPHEN KUMALO If you wish . JAMES JARVIS Stephen Kumalo , my wife is dead . My son is dead . I live in a house with a child who knows me only as an old man . I have thought many times I would be better dead . I thought myself alone in this desolation that used to be my home . But when I heard you yesterday I knew that your grief and mine were the same . I know now that of all the men who live near this great valley you are the one I would want for a friend . And  --  I have been walking about  --  and came and knocked here now  --  becuse I wanted to sit with you in this hour  --  p. 98 STEPHEN KUMALO You want to sit with me ? JAMES JARVIS Yes , if I may . STEPHEN KUMALO Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity . If you were seen to touch my hand , this town , this whole valley , would turn against you . JAMES JARVIS I 've finished with that . I have n't come here lightly . I shall take your hand wherever I like , before whom I like . I shall come and worship in your church if I wish to worship . May I sit here with you ? STEPHEN KUMALO Yes , umnumzana . JARVIS starts to sitThis is not a good chair . He brings another chair and places it . JARVIS sitsIt 's almost the hour . O God  --  O Tixo  --  it is almost now . JAMES JARVIS But there will be a tomorrow , Stephen . Edward will come tomorrow to see Alex . He wants to come and play . STEPHEN KUMALO I shall be gone . I shall never see this place again . Nor the path where Absalom ran to meet me  --  nor the hills where he played and came late to supper  --  nor the room where he slept  --  never , never again . JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I stayed , do you know what I would preach here ? That good can come from evil , and evil from good ! That no man knows surely what is evil or what is good ! That if there is a God He is hidden and has not spoken to men ! That we are all lost here , black and white , rich and poor , the fools and the wise ! Lost and hopeless and condemned on this rock that goes ' round the sun without meaning ! JAMES JARVIS Not hopeless , Stephen , and not without meaning . For even out of the horror of this crime some things have come that are gain and not loss . My son 's words to me and my understanding of my son . And your words in the chapel , and my understanding of those words  --  and your son 's face in the courtroom when he said he would not lie any more or do any evil . I shall never forget that . STEPHEN KUMALO You think well of my son ? JAMES JARVIS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to face what Absalom faced there . A man can hardly do better than he did when he stood before the judge . Stay in Ndotsheni , Stephen , stay with those who cried out to you in the chapel . You have something to give them that nobody else can give them . And you can be proud of Absalom . STEPHEN KUMALO And he is forgiven , and I am forgiven ? JAMES JARVIS Let us forgive each other . p. 100 STEPHEN KUMALO Umnumzana  --  umnumzana ! JAMES JARVIS Let us be neighbors . Let us be friends . STEPHEN KUMALO Umnumzana  --  before the clock strikes  --  I shall stay in Ndotsheni . You are welcome in this house . I have a friend . JAMES JARVIS I have a friend .
