For three hours the men moved their knights and rooks over Saracoglu 's chessboard as cautiously as they moved toward fuller and franker understanding of their mutual problems . <P> Turkey 's first move , by President Ismet Inn , was to annul a criminal-court sentence of two Soviet citizens found guilty of the attempted assassination of German Ambassador Franz von Papen in Ankara last spring .
