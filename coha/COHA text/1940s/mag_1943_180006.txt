To Christians who find it difficult to reconcile their faith with participation in war , a famed Protestant clergyman last week made a Christian 's answer , A Preacher Looks At War ( MacMillan ; $1.25 ) . Daniel Alfred Poling tells why he sees no conflict with Christian faith in the defense of the things on which Christianity is based . <P> Dan Poling , pastor of Philadelphia 's Baptist Temple , president of World 's Christian Endeavor Union , has been deeply touched by war . His son , Army Chaplain Clark Vandersall Poling , to whose memory the book is dedicated , died last February in the sinking of an army trans port in the North African campaign . He and three other chaplains ( a Methodist , a Roman Catholic , a Jew ) gave their life belts to soldiers who had none , were last seen kneeling together on a canting deck in their final prayer . <P> " Immoral and Unchristian . " Tall , broad-shouldered Dr. Poling is editor as well as pastor ( his Christian Herald , potent Protestant monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities he has consistently espoused the down-to-earth view of religion , shown little patience with unpractical applications of faith . He stood out among U.S. Protestant leaders for a steadfast refusal to espouse pacifism after World War I. He still finds pacifism " immoral and unchristian . " To those who profess it , believing they thereby follow Jesus ' teachings literally , Poling quotes from P. W. Wilson 's Newtopia to point out that Jesus asked nothing of society , had no home , no money , spent his life in service of others . He argues that unless a pacifist can live as Jesus lived ( an impossibility to day ) , he can not justify his stand . <P> " Life , " writes Dan Poling , " is no longer a debate , it is a practice ; no longer a theory , but a fact ; for now we live not in peace but in war . <P> " War is not holy . . . . War is the sum of man 's inhumanity to man . But there are holy causes . Freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the most sacred thing , is holy . What then should we do when holy things are beneath the war machine or threatened by it ? This is the issue and , in the presence of this reality , the overwhelming number of those who seek to know the mind of Christ find themselves following Him when they fling their lives against the war machine . . . . " <P> " Let the Church have no blessing for war , but shame upon us as churchmen if we have no blessing for our sons and no blessings for our governments who , in the presence of war , defend with their very lives our holy things .
