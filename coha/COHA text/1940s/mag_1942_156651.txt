Between Us Girls ( Universal ) is chiefly notable because it provides the rattletrap tumbril on which John Barrymore 's 21-year-old daughter Diana is supposed to ride to stardom . That she survives a solid hour and a half of such a journey is a tribute to her staying powers . <P> Starlet Barrymore plays the daughter of Star Kay Francis . The plot requires Diana to don a middy blouse and pretend she is twelve in order to keep from her mother 's suitor ( John Boles ) the fact that Mother Francis is fortyish . In the complicated course of this deception , Diana also fools a charming young man ( Robert Cummings ) , who buys her roller skates and ice-cream sodas , tries to teach her to skate before his normal eyesight asserts itself and he realizes she is old enough to be his wife . <P> One evening when Diana Barrymore was 19 , and the youngest , most submerged guest at a sedate dinner , she was suddenly observed to be eating her soup from a standing position . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing the gathering into proper focus . Father John Barrymore and Mother Michael Strange were divorced when Diana was seven . From seven to twelve she was entombed in a Parisian convent school . She subsequently attended the Garrison-Forest School near Baltimore , which nearly went out of business once when Father John paid her a call . She also had a go at Manhattan 's Brearley and a string of other seminaries . <P> A year at the Dalton School was the most successful ; the Dalton feeling is that one should express oneself . Diana did . <P> Year after that her mother , born a Newport Oelrichs , saw Diana smolderingly through a slam-bang debut at Manhattan 's River Club . It was Brenda Frazier 's season . The late Cholly Knickerbocker ticketed Diana as Personality Deb of the Year , swore she could have outstripped blazing Brenda as Glamor Girl if she had half tried . Diana palled around with Brenda a little , was reported engaged to Anthony Duke , Francis Kellogg , Harry Ellerbee ( whom she called Poopsie ) , Sir William Wrixon-Becher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher . Last summer , yes-she married him . <P> Diana wanted to act . She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts . She got a part in the road production of Outward Bound . Diana first hit Broadway in The Romantic Mr. Dickens , moving the Times 's Brooks Atkinson to declare that she was the one bit of meat which made that turkey worth sitting down to . <P> On tour in Outward Bound , she first really made her father 's acquaintance . The story that he made a pass at her before he knew she was his own daughter is apocryphal . They met at the train , and it was not until he had known her several minutes that he proudly declared that he was in love with her . Said John Barrymore to the press : " Is n't she lovely ! I worked like hell on Hamlet and Richard III but she was the best thing I ever produced ! "
