txt IN your review of the Ballet Russe collection , last Sunday , you suggested that " a museum devoted to ballet and theatre and opera design " be organized . The suggestion is of great importance and will not fail to arouse interest for a neglected cause ? in fact , the very cause for which the Museum of Modern Art 's Department of Dance and Theatre Design was organized ( originally as the Dance Archives ) in 1940 . Based on the noteworthy collection of the Dance Archives , the department constitutes the beginning of a comprehensive theatre and dance collection which already contains fine originals by Tchelitchew , Berman , Rivera , Watkins , Masson , etc . In recognition of these circumstances the museum authorities recently assigned permanent gallery space for the continuous display of dance and theatre design and related subjects . The permanent gallery is scheduled to open in April with an exhibition program to be announced later . I take this opportunity to emphasize the Museum of Modern Art 's past record with regard to the theatre arts . " International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind in this country , was shown at the museum in 1934 and was directed by Lee Simonson . An exhibition , " Painters as Ballet Designers , " was arranged by the Dance Archives in 1941 . Last summer 's exhibition . " Art in Progress , " included an important section devoted to modern ballet designers . A circulating exhibition , " From Sketch to Stage , " including original exhibition material , is now touring the country under the auspices of the museum 's Department of Circulating Exhibitions . Also in prep-1 aration are exhibitions on similar subjects , slide lectures for circulation , and an illustrated book on modern ballet design . This brief r ? sum ? shows how deeply this . museum is concerned with the problem of which you speak in your review .
