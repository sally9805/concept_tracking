To nobody 's surprise , greying Roberto Cochrane Simonsen joined his fellow Senators last week in voting to oust Communists from public office. * An influential member of anti-Communist President Dutra 's party , he barely won his seat last January over Communist Candido Portinari , Brazil 's greatest painter . His own anti-Red views are well known . Besides , Industrialist-Economist Simonsen is a top-rank spokesman for Sao Paulo 's bustling industry , and Communists are bad for business . <P> The Critic . Not so predictable was Simonsen 's criticism last fortnight of the Marshall Plan . But he was being consistent . The Marshall Plan , he fears , will be bad for Brazilian business as well as for Europe 's Communists . His reasoning , as he laid it down to the Inter-American Council of Production and Commerce at Petrpolis : if Latin America must increase its exports of raw materials and foodstuffs to Europe by 30 to 50% in the next four years , as the plan calls for , another " war economy " will develop . Then workers will be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. machinery will be difficult because Europe ca n't pay for Brazilian goods in dollars . <P> Simonsen was heard with respect . He is no inexperienced theorist , but a self-made man , a pretty rare article in Brazil . Child of a British-born Santos bank manager and a Brazilian-Scottish mother , he started out at 21 as a civil engineer on the old Southern Brazil Railway . At 58 he is one of the wealthiest men in the country . He has been president or director of a dozen companies , now heads Ceramica Sao Caetano , the largest ceramic ( tile , pipe ) plant in South America , which employs 1,600 workers . <P> As founder of the influential Federation of Sao Paulo Industries ( equivalent of the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers ) , he has worked persuasively to win its members to enlightened economic ideas . He wants , he says , to make Brazil a " place where a working man can save something out of his weekly pay check instead of going steadily into debt . " On such a basis , Simonsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Thinker . A stocky , powerfully built man with a scholar 's face , Simonsen is not just a moneymaker . Intellectual as well as industrialist , he founded the Sao Paulo School of Economics , has written 17 books , including the definitive two-volume Economic History of Brazil . Recently he was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters . He is president of the Brazilian Red Cross , belongs to a hatful of foreign scientific societies . In the Senate , where he is regarded as the best-dressed member , Simonsen takes his work seriously . He seldom speaks from the floor , but puts in hard licks on committees . Currently , he is so busy that he seldom gets home to his wife and four sons in Sao Paulo . <P> A good many Brazilians are stumped by Simonsen 's up-to-date economics , and even those who understand them do not always like them . But in hundreds of letters and telegrams that , by week 's end , had flooded his fifth-floor , book-lined bachelor apartment in downtown Rio , he was applauded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause was for what he said . Much was for Simonsen , the Brazilian . <P>
