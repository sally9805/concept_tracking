txt As Wendell Winkle . the Republican presidential nominee , wound up his short visit here yesterday with the announcement of his campaign organization and flew west for a vacation in Colorado . Democratic leaders prepared for a Congressional recess and made ready to go to Chicago where , next week . their presidential nominee will be selected it over for a fraction of a minute and then explained with a chuckle that , of course , he would be asleep by that time . Too bad , he added in effect , that the radio forum was n't going to be a bit earlier . On Capitol Hill and in other quarters where opinions of the sort would ordinarily be given great weight , there is a very general expectation that President - Roosevelt will yield to a " draft " and accept a third-term nomination . Moat New Dealers are of the opinion that the President " has just got to run again ** However , these very widespread beliefs do not seem to be backed up by the conviction that one might expect them to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than one apparently first- or second-hand report of Mr. Roosevelt 's intentions when run back to what was supposed to be its source frays out into a. lot of mystery . Beta on Either Side This , if nothing else , probably accounts for the opinion in some political circles here that the President will not run . In other words , it is still possible  --  with the convention as near as it is ? to make bets on either side of the third term issue . Most politicians here v.eio think the President might not accept another nomination , even though it is almost certain to be offered him , believe that the state of the convention will be such that Mr. Roosevelt can name the nominee . If any opposition to such a selection were to develop it would have to develop powerfully fast . This leads to one other suggestion seldom mentioned here but still a possibility . That would be that Mr. Roosevelt would do the only thing that would actually surprise the convention  --  namely , decline to run again and decline to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention wide open . The only shred of evidence to support such a theory is the talk in some party quarters of a " long convention " As one prominent Democrat remarked privately yesterday it is the most amazing political enigma in history .
