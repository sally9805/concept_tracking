txt The British have started a war of nerves against the German people designed to produce a revolt against Reichsfuehrer Hitler and the Nazi regime . This is Washington 's unofficial interpretation of today 's speech by Prime Minister Churchill , which is being hailed here as the start of an intensive political warfare campaign against the Axis . Neither the State Department nor the War Department would comment on the speech . They declined to say whether it had been discussed with United States officials before its delivery or whether the United States associated itself with the Prime Minister 's threat that Britain would use poison gas " far and wide avingt military objectives in Germany " if the Germans used it against the Russians . Having heard so many solemn speeches from Mr. Churchill , officials in the capital were impressed by the optimistic tone of his address this afternoon and particularly by his confident statements about the aerial superiority of the United Nations and the progress in combating the Nazi night bombers over Britain .
