" Until last week I was a respectable columnist . But-well , foreign correspondents are like dancers and prostitutes . There is something bad in the blood . " <P> In his New York hotel room last week , merry-eyed M. ( for Marcel ) W. ( for William ) Fodor , 53 , one of the oldest and ablest of U.S. foreign correspondents , smiled happily and rubbed his hands . After a six-year absence he was going back to his Balkan beat , on which , he is perhaps the world 's top expert , and he expected great things . <P> " By the time I reach the Mediterranean , I am convinced the Germans will have evacuated the Balkans . When this happens I will be pleased to come in with our troops . " He stopped smiling . " I should be miserable writing a column in Chicago* when in the Balkans it was being decided whether the United States , Great Britain and Russia can live together . " <P> Twenty-five years ago , in the wake of World War I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zest . An engineer , fluent in five languages , he had been grumbling along as manager of a steel mill in the English Midlands . Postwar retrenchment shut the mill , freed Fodor . The Manchester Guardian liked his occasional letters from Middle Europe , asked for cables , soon hired the shy , whip-smart , " relentlessly honest " little man as a fulltime correspondent . Thereby , the Guardian conferred a major boon on U.S. foreign correspondence . <P> The Balkans have been the training ground for more foreign correspondents than any other area in the world . And of those trained there in the last quarter century , most have learned from Fodor . Says John Gunther. one of his star pupils : " Fodor is one of the true good men of this earth . ... He has the most acutely comprehensive knowledge of Central Europe of any journalist I know . Half the good work that has come out of the Danube countries since 1920 or thereabouts has been Fodor 's , not only his direct correspondence , but-indirectly-the work of other people whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson and me practically from the cradle . . . .
