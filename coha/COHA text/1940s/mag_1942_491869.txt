ACME When the invaders picked the country clean , above all else they relished Greek wine intended for the British . the gradually more frequent intervals when the pain was not too great , I could lie there in my hospital bed and study what was going on as if I had all Greece spread out before me , like a general with his maps . My wife reported daily all that she had seen and heard , and repeated the conversations she had had with Germans and Italians in restaurants and cafes . So did the dozens of Greek friends who came to visit me at every hour of the day and night . With this network of spies to aid me , I discovered that I could fit the pieces together and form a better picture of the whole occupation than I probably would have been able to form if I had been on the outside . Being wounded and close to death , I found , gives one a feeling of great detachment . I was too badly hurt to worry about myself any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals . Now I had the Germans and Italians placed , from the Greek point of view , and I was beginning to understand the Greeks themselves . Unlike the Serbs , they had n't resisted the German occupation violently . They had stood aside , as it were , with folded arms , while the Nazis seized their scanty food supplies , their little factories and mines , their too-few automobiles and trucks , their rusty railroads and their fishing smacks ; then looted their homes and shops for tapestries , icons , silks and woolens , their museums for portable statuary and relics of other wars and other epochs ; and then turned around and handed them over , stripped , for their vanquished foes , the Italians , to dominate . Hellenic Hate T HE Greeks had n't resisted violently , but they had resisted in another way , which the Germans could n't understand . They were polite , but with a politeness that was edged with contempt , and whenever the Germans turned their backs , the Greeks sabotaged , oh , so subtly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then smiled and let them see the hatred in their eyes . The Germans had formed a Quisling government through which to communicate their " will " to the people of Greece . They had asked politicians , former cabinet members , generals , doctors , professors and businessmen to " collaborate " with them in setting up the New Order in Greece . All refused ? all except a certain Gen. George Tsolakoglu and a coterie of Germanophile friends . The German generals thought it would be fitting to induct their Greek puppets into office according to the traditional rites of the Orthodox Church . So did General Tsolakoglu . All Athens chuckled , however , when the bearded metropolitan , Chrysanthos , himself a reputed Germanophile , refused to assist at such a farce . The furious Germans ordered him removed and told the prelates of Athens to elect another metropolitan to take his place . Now it so happened that the metropolitan of Corinth , Damaskinos , had been elected to the Athens post some years before , but had been replaced by Chrysanthos on the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's democratic leanings . The Germans , however , had forgotten this and saw nothing wrong when the clergy accordingly elected the popular Damaskinos to fill the office of which he had been deprived by the ecclesiastical intrigues of the late prime minister . He , too , was called upon to bless the Tsolakoglu government and , naturally , he refused . Moreover , being a dignified and fearless man , he publicly denounced Tsolakoglu as a traitor . Incensed , the Germans ransacked the clergy until they found a backwoods priest who was willing to perform the ceremony . Meanwhile , the Nazi party men had been attempting to foster a Fascist movement based on the Ethniki Neolea , the Metaxas National Youth , which the dictator had modeled after the Hitler Jugend . In Jugoslavia the Axis had had considerable success with Ante Pavelitch and his Ustasha , the Croatian youth militia which proved to be as obligingly treacherous as the Iron Guard had been in Rumania and the Nylas and Ratnik groups in Hungary and Bulgaria . But in Greece the Ethniki Neolea had somehow evaporated during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many of their potential fifth columnists had turned Anglophile overnight . I know , because some of them later became my friends . Something in the Greek character , something compounded of pride , idealism , native intelligence and 5000 years of often glorious history , prevented large-scale treachery in Greece . The Germans could n't understand it . But then , neither could they understand why 9,000,000 Greeks had stood up and fought 80,000,000 Germans on top of 45,000,000 Italians when they knew they could n't win  --  when stronger nations had taken it lying down . The biggest part of that mystery , to the Nazis , was why the Greeks had so much admiration for the English . The troops Great Britain had sent to Greece  --  somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000 men ; not 150,000 as was commonly believed at the time ? had been far too few to enable the Greeks to resist the Nazi onslaught . There had simply been no English planes . A wounded English antiaircraft man , who had lain in the bed next to mine in a clinic in Argos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen a single English plane throughout the whole campaign . Why then should the Greeks remain so loyal to allies who had done so little to help them ? Above all , why should the Greeks go on risking their lives to protect and hide the troops the British Expeditionary Force had left behind ? The obvious answer was that the Greeks had loved and admired the English ever since they had helped them overthrow the Turks in 1825 ? and that they deeply appreciated Winston Churchill 's gesture in sacrificing British gains in Libya to help Greece , even when he and they both knew that the help would be insufficient . Such quixotic thinking was too much for the Nazi mind . The Undercover War HE Germans had taken several thousand Brit-1 ish prisoners , including wounded men and most of those who had been left behind in Crete , but several thousand more Australians , New Zealanders and Englishmen were still at large on the Greek mainland . Many of them were hiding out right there in Athens . The Germans had decreed the death penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many persons had already been executed . But even that did not deter the hundreds of others from hiding Englishmen in their homes . Such prisoners as were captured were usually caught individually or in groups of two or three . The Germans transported them to Athens , where they were held for a time in jail , and then either transferred in larger groups to the big concentration camp at Corinth or sent to Germany . This shifting of prisoners gave the Greeks opportunities to demonstrate their feelings . On one occasion a crowd in a town near Athens surrounded a convoy of prisoners and started a riot . The German drivers and guards leaped from their trucks and began firing . Several Greeks were killed , but by the time the mob had been dispersed at least twenty and possibly thirty prisoners had disappeared . I investigated this incident , and all witnesses agreed that many Britons had escaped , although they differed as to the exact number . One night in Athens a German truck full of British prisoners stopped at a ( Continued on Page 461 iContinued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker . Steam can always outmaneuver sails . Ten thousand dollars is a lot of money . . . Come on , Steve . " And then he blew the whistle , one shrill paralyzing blast , before they climbed forward . Mr. Evans shouted at Mr. Waring , asking if the belt was attached . Mr. Waring said it was ready . Mr. Evans pulled down hard on the wooden lever which stretched the belt operating the buckets . Immediately , such a racket filled the air that for a moment Tack was certain the Orukter Amphibolos was foundering . But the ten iron buckets began crawling up and down the big , endless belt attached to the prow . Mr. Evans and Steve lowered the iron braces , so the buckets fell into the water , splashing . The men on the sloop cried out in terror at this firespitting , shrieking monster , running away from the prow . Crittenden fired his pistol a couple of times more , but Tack and the others on the Orukter Amphibolos ducked behind the boiler or the iron braces . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the little sloop , water spurting , iron buckets clawing into the wood , ripping at it , sending out a shower of splinters and hoards . Never had the pirates encountered such a fearful attack in their lives . Superstitious and ignorant , all they cared about was departing in a hurry when this splashing monster closed in on them with huge iron teeth , biting chunks at a time out of the reeling sloop . The sloop swung off , helpless . The Orukter Amphiholos wallowed in again for another tearing bite , Tack handling the rudder ropes as if he 'd done nothing but steer steamboats all his life . Captain Salvetti looked on , aghast , lifted his hands , cried " Madre de Dios ! " and jumped . One by one the five men of the crew dived in panic for the river . Mr. Waring leaped to the sloop , followed by Steve ; Mr. Evans halting the buckets before they could be damaged , and calling encouragement . Crittenden retreated to the mast , deserted . In a desperate hurry he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They grappled while Steve ran along the deck , crying , " Miss Chris-tine ! " Mr. Waring did n't have much trouble with the pirate . He knocked him down , threw the pistol and sword away , and after that , somehow , Crittenden lost all interest in fighting . Mr. Waring picked him up by the collar and slammed him one in the mouth which must have loosened half his teeth . " There ! " Tack heard him say , " That 's for Mr. Phisbee 's son . And this is for Miss Christine . " Another whack . ' ' And this is for me . " One more whack . Somebody called , " Hey , Tack ! Tack Bingham ! " It was getting too dark to see much , but Tack peered up and made out a laughing face leaning across the rail . It was Kip Burkhardt ! He was yelling and dancing around , and saying they 'd had him in the hold , and next Steve came from the cabin with Christine Wainwright . And Christine saw Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumpled and mussed , and his nose appeared a little dented . He let go of Crittenden when he saw Christine . She said " Oh , Mr. Waring , " in a funny , trembling voice . " I been lookin ' for ye , " said Mr. Waring , not noticing that Crittenden had rolled into the galley . " He forced me to come , " she said . " He told me father was in an accident , badly hurt , or I would n't have left the academy . " " ' T is time ye 're gettin ' home , " said Mr. Waring , and took her arm . By now the sloop was sinking by the bow . Kip jumped down to Tack , and Tack stood up straight and proud , hanging on to the rudder cords as if the running of the Orukter Amphibolos depended upon him . Mr. Evans had lighted a big whale-oil lantern , and held it for Christine and Mr. Waring while they climbed down the bow , stepping across to the prow . Steve yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " No , you do n't . Where 's Critten-den ? " " He 's knocked senseless . Let him drown . " " No , sir , " declared Mr. Evans . " You sling him aboard . How 'll I claim my ten thousand dollars without I have proof ? With him , I can go to court and sue , if the city wo n't pay . " Steve Tench dragged Crittenden across the deck like an empty sack , and they stowed him in the rear of the cockpit . Mr. Evans sat down on the bench and said that as long as Tack was doing all right as pilot , he might as well continue . Tack guided the Orukter Amphibolos up the river toward Philadelphia , with Kip enviously watching him , telling him how Bigfeet Hamels had grabbed him and taken him to the sloop . " They wo n't get far now , " said Tack . " Not with their sloop gone . " In back , Christine and Mr. Waring were whispering . Once Crittenden half roused and muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done anything worse than try to abduct Miss Christine . If Footman or the rest claim anything , I 'll say they 're lying . " " Proof ! " said Mr. Waring . " We 've got a world of proof . But the best proof is on yer own feet . Tack here has a plaster print to one of yer yellow shoes , which he took from where ye stepped into the mud the night ye stole the jewels ! As soon as we get ye to Philadelphia , we 'll show ye a plaster cast which will hang ye if Mr. Hannibal Phisbee 's evidence is n't satisfactory . " In the red glare from the boiler , Crittenden swiftly leaned forward to rip off his yellow shoes . But Steve seized his wrists and held him , and Tack whispered something hastily . Steve nodded . " What have you done with old Mrs. Westfield 's rubies ? " At first , Crittenden refused to answer . Then Steve grabbed a big hickory stick , and Crittenden mumbled he 'd given the rubies to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Steve , lifting the hickory stick . " I 'm not . He hid ' em in the attic . You 'll find ' em there . " He cast a glance at the river , gave an unexpected lurch in an effort to throw himself overboard . But Steve was ahead of him . Steve laughed and thumped him on the head with the hickory stick . Crittenden dropped like a stone ; after that he did n't move . Boats drew near them from the little river hamlets . Mr. Waring shouted for them to row back and pick up the pirates . As they approached Philadelphia , more and more boats came out , men holding flares , yelling and laughing , until , by the time the Orukter Amphibolos neared the wharves , the entire river was lighted up like the night of the Fourth of July . Men on horseback had carried the news to Philadelphia . By now the people massed along the docks knew Crittenden had been captured and Mr. Wainwright 's daughter rescued . Pitch fires made the place bright as day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; everybody seemed to be there . They got closer and closer to the wharves , and finally Tack said to Mr. Evans " I never had so much fun , " and handed the rudder ropes to him . Mr. Evans started as if he 'd been awakened from a dream . " Do n't you want to steer her in ? " he asked , as if he were cross about something . " Go ahead , then . Do n't bother me . I 'm busy . I think I 've got the most important invention of my life in my head . " Well , Tack never had such a show . Steve turned off the steam and the big Orukter Amphibolos coasted in silently to the dock , and everybody on the docks saw Mr. Bingham 's son steering it in . Tack tried to look straight ahead , watching the blunt prow nose through the slips as though he were the captain of a ship  --  and come to think of it , that awkward , ponderous invention of Mr. Evans probably was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . But Tack had to glance up once or twice ; he could n't resist doing that , to save himself . He saw his mother and father looking down at him and smiling . He saw Anne , proud as could be , waving . George and Will and Blacky Tench were shouting at him , laughing , yelling . Next , Cob Huxley shoved forward , grinning , holding Jim and Eben Ferguson by their collars . George Dallas swung around and grabbed Eben and pointed down , and Eben looked miserable and envious enough to die . Blacky danced around them , taking Jim 's right hand . Will took hold of Eben 's arm , and they forced the Ferguson boys to wave . " Let go the ropes , Tack , " ordered Steve suddenly , casting a line to a hundred waiting hands . " We 've reached harbor at last . " " Waring , " said Mr. Evans , appearing to wake up again , " Waring , if we multiply the stress of two hundred tons by the coefficient Waring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness . " Waring , do you hear me ? Waring ! " He turned to Tack and said , " Does n't that beat all ? The way he 's acting , you 'd almost think paying court to that girl 's more important than helping me invent an improved steam carriage ? Well , upon my word , I 've wasted a whole day . I 've work to do tonight . " He climbed forward , the crowd waiting . But he did n't seem to notice it . " Oh , Steve . " He halted upon the dock . " Do n't let Crittenden loose until the authorities give you the money . I 'll need that ten thousand dollars . You and Tack and Waring  --  if he can forget that girl for a few minutes ? might show the committee how the Orukter Amphibolos operates as a dredge . I 'm in a hurry . I ca n't waste all night , too , when the nation 's waiting to have steam trains invented . Good night . " He passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , He did n't look hack . He stuck the conical hat on top of his head and walked straight ahead , not seeing anybody , going on toward Front Street , already deep in thought . Tack stood and watched him until he disappeared . ( THE END ) AXIS ANARCHY IN GREECE ( Continued from Poge 13 ) military filling station for gasoline . Several Greeks appeared , all apparently drunk . One was sucking on an unlighted cigarette . He staggered up to the German truck driver and asked permission to light the cigarette from his headlight . The German laughed and motioned to him to try . He bent over and touched his cigarette to one of the headlights . He puffed hard , but the cigarette would n't light . The German truck driver roared with laughter at this stupid Greek . Even his companions laughed at him . There was so much commotion that even the German guards approached to see the fun . It lasted for quite some time . The Germans ended it by giving the drunken Greeks some matches . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappeared . By the time the Germans realized what had happened , their English prisoners had also disappeared . The Germans tried to put a stop to such tricks by ordering their soldiers to shoot to kill if any Greek approached a prison truck . The order did n't mention women and children . From then on , crowds of women and children approached prison trucks and threw flowers , cigarettes , cakes , razor blades and soap to the occupants within . Meanwhile , all over Greece , wherever there were fresh English graves , there were always Greek women on hand to strew the graves with flowers . Such sentimentality apparently did no harm to the Germans , and certainly did no good to the Englishmen , and so they were permitted to indulge in it . But this was only one of the many little ways the Greeks had of attempting to shake the Germans ' confidence . The V campaign , like the thumbs-up gesture , was another . When all the V 's appeared on Athens buildings , the first reaction of the Germans was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the V 's remain and stencil under them , " Der Sieg let Unser " ( " The victory is ours " ) . V 's were later stenciled on all German trucks and barracks , and even on their airplanes . The only difficulty was the V did n't stand for anything in German , and gave the Greeks an opportunity to make insulting jokes about it . When the Italians came , they copied the Germans ' tactic and wrote V for " Vinceremos " ( " We will conquer " ) everywhere . The Greeks promptly went around at night , changing the letters to make the result read as an insult to the occupying forces . It made the Italians and Germans rather unhappy . So did " thumbs up . " In the beginning , the Greeks made the gesture ( Continued an Page 48 ) ( Continued from Page 46 ) openly ; then , when the Germans began to jail them for it , they camouflaged the gesture by using it to straighten their hair or ties , rub their chests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks for that . These insults , trifling in themselves , but nerve-racking in the aggregate , so irritated the Germans that they appeared frankly relieved to turn over the administration of the country to the Italians on June seventeenth . The conviction was inescapable to Athenians that Hitler had been constrained to give Greece to Mussolini  --  in violation of his armistice terms  --  less because Greece was Italian Lebensraum than because the High Command thought it would be a good joke on their despised allies to present them with a bag of wildcats . Field-Gray Vultures In handing Greece over , however , the Germans neither relinquished military control of the country nor allowed anything of value to slip through their own hands . The Italians had to wait seven weeks before being allowed to occupy the Peloponnesus and the lower Greek mainland simply because the Germans wanted to make sure of picking the bones clean before the Italians got there . The Nazis not only seized every automobile and truck they could lay their hands on , they also took bicycles away from the children . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth of Athens proved reluctant to yield its bikes , the Nazis tried coercion . What happened to the son of one of our friends is typical . Madame P had been forced to board a German officer in her home . When the Germans began to have difficulties rounding up bicycles , this officer approached her twelve-year-old son , and said , " I know you have a bicycle and that you 've hidden it in the garden . We need all the bicycles we can get . But we 'll let you keep yours if you write a list of all your friends who have bicycles and who have n't given them up . " The boy refused . He said he would prefer to lose his own bicycle rather than betray his friends . He did . But the officer was rather shamefaced about it afterward and tried to make up for it with gifts of food from time to time , which Madame P had to accept . She and her children were hungry . There was no question of holding out on automobiles . Some persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely to seize a car and give a receipt on the Bank of Greece . When individuals presented such receipts for payment , the bank disclaimed all responsibility . A friend of mine was forced to surrender his car , a brand-new Opel , to a German officer for a note on the Bank of Greece for 250,000 drachmas ? $1667 at the official prewar exchange . He held on to the note , in case it should turn out to be worth something . The officer enjoyed the use of the car for two and a half months , then he was transferred to the Russian front . Before he left , he went to my friend and offered to sell the car back to him for 350,000 drachmas , explaining that the inflation entitled him to a profit of at least 100,000 . My friend , with his drachmas rapidly losing value , naturally agreed . He offered the German 100,000 drachmas in cash , plus the original 250,000-drachma note . The German refused . He wanted 350 , - 000 drachmas in cash . Foreigners were treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid in occupation marks which , though absolutely worthless outside of Greece , were slightly more valuable inside Greece than drachmas or their Italian counterparts , known as " Mediterranean liras . " This was because the rate of exchange for the mark had been increased from fifty to sixty drachmas , and it was anticipated that the Germans would continue to increase the rate from time to time as the purchasing power of the drachma decreased . Thus , while there was no point in hoarding drachmas , with prices skyrocketing , there was always the expectation among Greeks that the Germans would again increase the drachma value of their marks . They had failed to do so , however , up till the day I left , probably because they had no real interest in curbing inflation . The following episode illustrates the Nazi attitude toward currency : An American resident , preparing to leave the country , had several trucks to dispose of . He considered donating them to the Greek Red Cross , but decided not to , as there was every possibility that the Germans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell the trucks to the Germans and give the marks to the Greek Red Cross . He went to the German military transport and offered his trucks for something like 2,500,000 marks . The officer accepted the offer immediately , without even investigating whether the trucks were worth that much . He apologized to the American for not carrying such a large amount of currency in his pocket , but told him that if he cared to wait , he could get the marks for him in half an hour . " We 're printing some in the basement , on a portable press , " he explained . In economic as well as military terms , the Germans stopped at nothing . Within a few weeks after they arrived , they had literally cleaned out every shop in Athens . Canned goods , cheeses , wines , soap , silk stockings , lingerie , perfumes , shoes and clothing were the items that most appealed to the ill-fed , ill-clothed German troops and the Nazi bureaucrats that followed in their wake . They were all liberally supplied with occupation marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old story . I had seen it happen in Rumania and Bulgaria and Hungary , and it had happened in the western countries too . After each new conquest , the German troops and camp followers were given carte blanche to buy up all the commodities they could and send there home to their wives and sweethearts . In Greece , however , they did n't stop with commodities . They raided private homes and stole art and religious objects , rugs , tapestries , and even furniture . And they reveled in the equipment the British had been forced to leave behind . However short the BEF had been on airplanes and tanks , they were luxuriously equipped as far as individual comfort was concerned . The Germans , on the other hand , had nothing but war materials . Their uniforms by this time were old and frayed . In Greece they settled down to loot and pillage , bathe , wash and repair their uniforms and equipment , and complete their scanty wardrobes with what the British had left . A German lieutenant living in the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an English officer 's melton jacket . He could n't wear it on duty , of course , so he used it as a smoking jacket and went around the house stroking the material as if under a spell , commenting on its quality and its feel . " Look , " he used to say to my friends . " Wool ! Pure wool . Feel how soft . How can the English afford such luxury ? " In the Athens tailor shops , the Germans went on a spree . So many German soldiers bought civilian clothes  --  usually made out of Scotch tweeds and English worsteds  --  that the Greeks became suspicious . So did the German High Command . It suddenly published a decree forbidding any Greek to sell either new or used clothing to members of the German armed forces . There was no doubt about the seriousness of the strange decree . Severe penalties were provided for offenders . It developed that Austrians in the German army had been buying civilian clothes in order to desert from the army and hide out until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian soldiers talked so freely against the Nazi regime that they could n't all have been agents provocateurs . The following story , which is too good to be true , is at least indicative of the situation . Three German soldiers entered a caf ? and called for the waiter . " Drei Kaffee , " they ordered , in German . " Three coffees . " " Trio delitiria , " called out the waiter to the man behind the coffee machine . " Three poisons . " " Hey , " said one of the green-coated Germans , in perfect Greek . " Two poisons and one coffee . I 'm an Austrian . " Ill-feeling between Austrian and Prussian troops , however , was temporarily dispelled when the Italians arrived . Germans and Austrians alike joined forces with the Greeks to bait the poor Italians until , at times , the friction between the opposite poles of the Axis seemed even greater than that between individual representatives of the Axis and individual Greeks . The bad blood between the Germans and Italians in Greece dates from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to stage a Roman triumph and march down the main streets of Athens and have the " defeated " Greeks cheer them for the benefit of Luce , the Italian newsreel agency . According to Radio Roma the following day , the Greek population " received the victorious Italian troops with jubilation " and Greek girls " threw flowers in their path . " Nothing of the sort occurred . The German Oberkommando refused to permit a parade . It ordered the Italians to enter Athens quietly and proceed at once to the barracks the Germans had assigned them . The Italians did manage to include a band in one of their trucks and strike up Giovanezza on their way through , but that was all . The Germans joined the Greeks in laughing at them as they passed . The Boot of Italy In truth , the Italians were a fantastic lot . Beside them , the Germans looked like scarecrows . Dashing , handsome Italian officers , resplendent in gray-green uniforms decked with gold braid , rainbow stripes , and medals and decorations from the Abyssinian , Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens . Bersaglieri , sprouting pheasant plumes from their helmets as well as their Alpine hats , appeared , along with gorgeous black-shirted Fascisti and Mussolini 's " wolves , " the junior Fascists , in their grotesque stocking caps and foot-long tassels . Carabinieri , in patent-leather tricorn hats , replete with khaki dust covers to protect their shiny surfaces , took up posts in front of public buildings and at all important street corners . Some of the Alpine units wore nickel insignia bearing the inscription , " Rapido come i1 fulmine , forte come it leone . " This caused the Greeks no end of merriment , for certainly the qualities exhibited by the forces that had attacked Greece included neither the rapidity of lightning nor the strength of lions . According to the Greeks , the main characteristic of the Italians on the Albanian front was that they were about as substantial as air . The battle cry of the Greeks , in fact , was " Acraf " ? which signified precisely that  --  the surprising ability of the Italians to evaporate whenever the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they went around paying drachma notes to the ubiquitous Athenian shoeshine boys to run up and shout " Aera ! " at passing Italians . If the shamefaced Italians attempted to punish these urchins , the Germans would beat them up  --  as dozens of witnesses , including my wife , could testify . In the crowded restaurants and caf  --  s , where everyone had to double up and sit at any table with a vacant seat , my wife observed that the Germans refused to let Italians sit with them , although they encouraged Greeks to do so . The Germans became quite paternal after the Italians arrived , and went out of their way to see that no Greeks were maltreated  --  in the daytime , at least ? by their despised allies . They even forced the Greeks to help them humiliate Italians . One of the duties assumed by the Italian forces was to direct traffic . This was an entirely unnecessary function , since there was practically no traffic left to direct , except German staff cars and military trucks . My wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the sidewalks by contemptuous German truck drivers who refused to stop as ordered . Even Greeks sometimes expressed pity for the poor Italians . But the traffic guards were undeniably ridiculous . Copying the Germans , they had adopted wands with red-and-white metal disks attached to their tips , for maximum visibility . They had also added a contribution of their own ? white gauntlets . Though the essential purpose of the disks was for use in convoys , especially at night , to keep the blacked-out transports from piling into one another whenever a speeding motorized column slowed down or halted , the Italian traffic squads used them in Athens much as the conductor of a symphony orchestra uses his baton . I saw them myself , on the few occasions I was able to leave the hospital for a drive around Athens in a taxi . They acted like ballet dancers in a comic opera . Serenade for Mussolini But it was comic opera tinged with tragedy for anyone who took seriously the idea of the dignity of man . One day outside the Hotel Grande Bretagne the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playful swipe at the rear of a Greek street urchin who had jaywalked to annoy him . Immediately a German soldier , standing in the doorway of the hotel , marched over to the Italian and felled him with a single blow to the jaw . The Italian picked himself up and went on directing traffic . He made no effort to defend himself . The young Greek hooted with derision and the German said something about not being able to stand the sight of soldiers mistreating civilians . The most startling example of the Germans ' contempt for their Italian allies came one night at Maxim 's , the leading night club of Athens . It had to do with a Greek war song called Koroido Mussolini ? Mussolini the Dope . The words of the song ? a takeoff from the popular Italian La Campagniola  --  were extremely offensive to Italian ears , and soon after the arrival of the Fascist forces it had been prohibited on pain of a heavy fine and a stiff jail sentence . One night a group of German officers entered Maxim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank , they directed insulting remarks toward several groups of Italian officers sitting at nearby tables . Suddenly one of the Germans , a major , stood up and shouted to the Greek orchestra leader to strike up Koroido Mussolini . The orchestra leader smiled incredulously and tried to pass it off as a joke . The German major called the man to his table and demanded that he play the forbidden song . The orchestra leader , with a glance at the Italians  --  who had hung their heads and pretended not to notice  --  declined ? on the logical ground that he did n't want to go to jail . The proprietor of the night club appeared , and he , too , attempted to reason with the Germans . Axis Outcasts The major took out his automatic and laid it on the table . " I order you to play Koroido Mussolini , " he said . " But it 's against the law  --  your own law , " pleaded the frightened proprietor . Are you going to obey or will I have to shoot ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra leader . Silence fell over the cabaret . The orchestra began to play Koroido Mussolini , feebly at first , but gradually with more strength . They played through one verse and chorus and then stopped . " Encore ! " shouted the German major . This time all the German officers stood up and sang the entire song , from beginning to end ? in Greek . The German High Command refused to share any of its loot with the Italian General Staff , and insisted that it bring all its supplies  --  food , gasoline , trucks , munitions , everything  --  from Italy . The Italians could do nothing but comply . They sent a few supply ships and a tanker to Peiraeus , on the outskirts of Athens , but the tanker never arrived . It was sunk by an English submarine en route . The Italians begged the Germans to lend them some gasoline until another tanker arrived . But the Germans refused . For days , Italian diplomats and high-ranking officers in Athens had to walk . The situation was impossible . The Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth things over and establish some sort of order in Greece . But until the day I left , September fifteenth last , the Germans went on sabotaging their allies . By August the situation had degenerated into anarchy  --  anarchy that was condoned , if not actually inspired , by the German High Command . There was no civilian authority anywhere . The puppet government of General Tsolakoglu was hamstrung by the Germans and boycotted by the Greeks . The Italians were boycotted and hamstrung by everybody . Somehow the civilian population managed to survive the summer on a bread ration of a quarter of a pound of bread a day and a few squashes. grapes and tomatoes . Luxuries like meat , eggs , butter and milk had long since disappeared . So had rice , beans , potatoes , olive oil and other staples . People with large amounts of money could occasionally obtain certain food items on the Black Market , but prices rose so rapidly that by September even those of us who had money could no longer afford to buy much . Butter went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and my wife never could . Eggs cost fifteen cents apiece and olive oil to fry them in three dollars a quart . Navy beans imported from Jugoslavia found their way to the Black Market at a dollar a pound . Rice and potatoes disappeared altogether . Meat , so poor as to be absolutely inedible , turned up now and then at prices varying from ninety cents to $1.25 a pound . Only once was my wife able to encounter a chicken . It was a scrawny bird and cost $3.35 . But we were lucky . I had laid in a sufficient supply of drachmas to be able to patronize the Black Market , and thus supplement the inadequate meals I was served at the hospital . Even so , I lost fifty-three pounds . My wife , who ate the best meals available in the best restaurants of Athens , managed to keep from losing more than ten . The Brand of War The majority of Greeks , however , had to subsist on their wages and salaries , which averaged from twenty to forty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After three months of German looting , most of the stores in Athens had to close for lack of anything to sell . Factories had to shut down for either lack of raw materials or lack of power ; and the only professionals whose services could be utilized were doctors and nurses . They had to work overtime . People were already beginning to faint in the street from hunger before I left . Now they must be dying of disease as well as hunger . Winter has come  --  the vitamin-giving fruits and vegetables which kept the people alive throughout the summer are gone . German officers returning from Crete early in September admitted epidemics of both cholera and typhus in Candia and said that spinal meningitis had broken out among the English prisoners there . In Athens there was some typhus , but not yet of epidemic proportions , and plenty of malaria . The spread of this disease , once endemic all over Greece , but in recent years stamped out in the Athens area through the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation , was caused by two factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important  --  quinine factories had been forced to shut down because the Germans refused to supply them with the Diesel oil to run their machinery . The Athens gas works shut down altogether early in September for lack of coal , and the people were forced to cook with braziers . Electricity was always a luxury in waterless Greece , and so , for that matter , was firewood . When the gas was turned off , the only combustibles available to the people of Athens were roots and pine cones . These were gathered in the mountains by unemployed workers and demobilized soldiers , who brought them to the city , where they sold them by the handful at prices high enough to pay for their own food . Prices were so high that the average Athenian could not afford to do much cooking . The problem was temporarily solved in the poorer districts by all the families of a tenement pooling the cost of pine cones and cooking communal stews over a common brazier . Electricity was so severely rationed that by the middle of September even the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut them off in order to conserve sufficient power for lighting and for listening to the radio  --  no longer a luxury , but a psychological necessity . Despite the penalty for listening to foreign broadcasts  --  two years in prison  --  I never met a Greek who failed to listen in to either London or Cairo at least once a day . But the greatest physical hardship was the lack of transportation , forcing people to exhaust themselves walking excessive distances every day in search of food . Private transportation , of course , had disappeared the moment the Germans seized all the automobiles and trucks . Bus service in Athens came to an end in August  --  except for single busses making two trips daily on suburban lines . This in turn increased the overcrowding of the trams , already reduced to one third their normal frequency . By September the High Command was forced to do something . Instead of providing more coal to produce more electric power , the High Command ordered all the seats in the trams removed . Even then , these human cattle cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkest days of the Red Era . Life in Athens came to an end at nightfall . Tram service was suspended at 8:30 P.M. , and anyone out after that hour at night had to walk home in the dark . There were no more flashlights to be found , and without one there was always the danger of bumping into a tree or , worse , a hysterical Italian guard who shot first and asked questions afterward . Death in the Dark The Italians made the nights hideous with their gunfire . Terrified of being ambushed by hostile Greeks , they were continually shooting at every strange noise . I do n't believe they managed to kill very many people , because they were always shooting blindly into the darkness , or into the air , to let their companions on the next corner know they were still alive . Just the same , it was a risky business to pick your way home along blacked-out Athens streets at night . There was always a certain amount of Greek sniping , too , especially on the nights when the RAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . Bombings and listening to the BBC were the only two diversions left to the Greeks . Of the two , they much preferred the bombings , since they produced immediate results which the Greeks were able to check for themselves . Every time the British bombers came over , the entire population of Athens would climb to the rooftops to see the fun . Meanwhile , the Italian guards in the streets below would begin shooting frantically at the irrepressible cheers of the rooftap audience , while Greek snipers , concealed on darkened balconies , would add to the bedlam by taking pot shots at the flashes of the Italians ' rifles . It was a deadly game . Scores , of Greeks were killed every time the bombers came over , for it was a total impossibility to avoid spilling some civilian blood . But for every Greek killed dozens of Germans or Italians lost their lives and Axis shipping and aircraft were steadily being destroyed . How the Greeks managed to keep up their spirit , in the face of the appalling misery I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the Serbs understand the secret , and also the Czechs and Poles . I have an idea that even the French and Dutch and Norwegians , who certainly forgot it in the post-Munich epidemic of fear and appeasement , at frightful cost to their national pride , are now beginning to learn the formula all over again . It remained for those incurable optimists , those foolhardy patriots , the Greeks , to teach the world that it is better to fight , even against hopeless odds , than to let the Axis war machine swallow up homeland , pride and national spirit piecemeal . There was neither hope nor spirit in Rumania , Bulgaria or Hungary when last I saw those unhappy countries , but there was plenty of both when I last saw Greece . Personally , I felt very sad and pessimistic the day I left Athens , but not so the Greeks I left behind . They were as keyed up as always , busily preparing for the day the BEF would be able to return and help them massacre the enemy . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that , only two days before , the order had gone out to round up several hundred Greek officers . They were accused of having formed a revolutionary organization of demobilized soldiers , and to have cached arms and ammunition at strategic points . But only a few officers were caught and arrested . The majority were hiding out in the mountains , waiting for Der Tag .
