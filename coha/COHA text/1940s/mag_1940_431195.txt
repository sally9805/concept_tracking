 | THE children of this country have much to be thankful for . They live in the world 's greatest democracy . To a greater degree than the children of any other land they have freedom , they have health , they have security . Yet all of these children ? the children of wealthy , peaceful America ? are confronted today with a peril that may profoundly and adversely affect their futures . In state after state school funds are being slashed . In city after city the free education which is every American child 's birthright is being curtailed . And one reason for the drastic cuts is that money must be found , somehow and somewhere , to meet a burden which is now appallingly heavy , which grows greater every year , the end of which is not even dimly in sight . This is the burden of providing pensions and other forms of assistance for the old people of the United States . Between the millions of school children and old people in the United States is being waged a war of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , studies and plays until afternoon , and then goes marching home again . They are young in age and heart , and they are not in the least concerned with what is going on . But neither , it would appear , are their parents , and that is a great deal more serious . THE other army flies the tattered banners of age . For its members are old , tired , frequently discouraged , and nearly always puzzled . The men who march with it are usually unemployed . They are victims of an economic maladjustment for which they are not to blame , and which they do not understand . The women slave too hard in homes that are dark and dingy . Their health is bad . They need medical and dental care , as , all too often , do their men as well . Right now the weary army of the aged is winning the war to get more federal funds , more state funds , more city funds . The old people are winning because they have organized themselves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , which threaten the politicians with reprisals unless more and bigger pensions are granted . The children do n't vote . Nobody has bothered to organize them . And today , as a consequence , many a handsome city school is being run on insufficient funds or on a part-time schedule . Many a teacher is trying to teach in the face of the bewildering possibility that her job may be gone tomorrow . Still more are carrying on despite reduced salaries ? even without salaries for weeks and months ? while municipalities seek to raise the necessary funds . Unless it is the organizers of the pressure groups , no one is really to blame for the situation . The need of the old people is often acute . They must not go hungry or otherwise suffer . But the result , nonetheless , may be countless thousands of children growing toward maturity with inadequate schooling . Such children will be badly equipped for the stiff competition of tomorrow 's world . It is not the well educated who form the majority of the men and women on pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is executive secretary of the National Education Association : " When a state curtails education today , it is increasing the likelihood of large pension and relief rolls tomorrow . It is inhuman to neglect present-day relief and pension problems . It is social suicide to neglect the education of tomorrow 's adults . " It is inconceivable that the old people , if they realize that their demands are endangering the education of children , will persist in their pleas for larger and larger appropriations . But they may do so if American parents do not show them precisely what is going on . IN TEXAS , in Ohio , in California , in Colorado ? to name merely a few of the many states where school funds have already been cut or are in danger ? the demands for larger @# and larger old-age pensions ar a source of desperate worry fo educators . New York , richest of a the states , has also found it neces sary to economize in education Last year 's legislature reduced th state appropriation for schools b : $10,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamlet will fail to suffer . Ne York City will receive $5,300,000 les from the state than it anticipates School officials pondered and slave and hoped that vital aspects of th school program would not have to b sacrificed . But they failed to find an , remedy . They failed ? and the life of a small Italian boy whom we shall call Pietr is singularly barren this winter Pietro lives in the slums , in squalor For several winters past he has spec most of his free time at the recre tional center of the public schoc where trained directors taught hi . games and showed him how to pla The recreational center is closed no , and Pietro must play in the street There are thousands upon thousan of Pietros in New York .

The dayclasses in English are closed . At night Mrs. Constanzas must her housework . THEN there is Peter Smith , who is a native American . Peter Works in a garage . He is ambitious and industrious . He enrolled last year m an evening high school for courses in mathematics and bookkeeping . Some day he would have a garage of his own . This year , though , the evening classes are much smaller , and Peter found that there was no room for him . The New York schools are operating on a $2,000,000 deficit . Further cuts appear to he necessary . What effect can this have on the morale of the teacher ? Well , Mary Jones has a 2ertificate to serve as a substitute in any grammar school , and she anticiDated her due share of work this winter . No substitutes are to be hired , however . And there will be few promotions and salary increases . It would be grossly unfair to blame all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-age assistance is a serious problem in all of the states and a potential source of bankruptcy in some of them . The situation is aggravated by a radical change in the relative numbers of young and old @# people . The birth rate has been declining steadily , while , of course , medical science has increased life expectancy . In 1870 , the census tables show , 39.2 percent of the population was under fourteen years of age , while only 3 percent was over sixtyfive . But in 1930 the number under fourteen had shrunk to 29.4 percent , while the aged now constitute 5.4 percent . Education suffered greatly in the depression . School expenditures throughout the nation in 1934 were 17.8 percent under 1930 . Business conditions improved somewhat , and by 1936 expenditures were beginning to rise . Then came old-age assistance and other forms of relief , and budgets were slashed again . Most cities and villages depend , in part , on state aid in supporting their schools , and state aid has been drastically cut the past three or four years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax shortages . Georgia 's constitution guarantees a seven months ' school term ; but last year the legislature did nothing about a $5,200,000 deficit , so schools in forty-one counties were forced to close . In Michigan , state school funds were cut 50 percent . The future of pension legislation is even more menacing than the present . Larger payments were authorized by Congress last August , and the potential burden on the states is greater . Two main influences are behind this tendency to hand out more money . The first lies in such drives as the Townsend Plan and the California " Ham and Eggs " grotesquerie , whereby , through magic money in one form or another , the middle-aged as well as the old are to receive generous financial aid . The second influence is the widespread theory that spending money will bring prosperity . Visionary pension schemes , however foolish , attract the frenzied support of millions . This would not matter particularly , if it were not that the politicians , to still the clamor , vote larger and larger appropriations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even heavier this year with a national election looming . The situation is further complicated by the curtailed WPA program . But there is a dangerous probability that no comparable pressure will be brought for children . Let us consider the situation in Texas . The state 's 280,000 old people have , all in all , been generously treated . A total of $45,430,000 had been paid to them by the end of 1938 ? half of it through federal grants . During 1938 , the state had raised $9,109 , - 634 by taxation for their benefit . The per-capita payments were not large , of course . They varied somewhat from month to month ; last summer they came to about $14 per recipient . But this included rural areas where the cost of living is extremely low . Nor did all Texans above sixty-five receive payments . Last summer about 118,000 were on the rolls . BUT the old men and women of Texas are far from satisfied . The state law has been amended so that the ability of children to support their parents can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more liberal in other respects . W. A. Little , director of the Texas Old Age Assistance Commission , in a newspaper article prophesied that within two years 160,000 aged persons would be receiving $20 a month apiece . The annual cost would rise to $22 , - 000,000 a year . The existing fund would be about $9,000,000 . And where would the rest of the money come from ? The Texas Old Age Commission already had borrowed over $3 , - 600,000 to meet the monthly pension roll , and this had to be paid back to the banks . And what about the $5,000,000 deficit in the Texas school program ? The trouble in the state , obviously , was that nobody had been looking very far ahead . Governor Lee O'Daniel was elected on a pledge that pensions would be more liberal . He conveyed the idea that $30 a month might be paid . Yet unless other activities  | are cut down or additional taxes levied , the aged of Texas may find their allotments decreased . The money simply does n't seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would apply to all the states . In no other state are there so many conflicting forces as in California . At the San Francisco offices of the Social Security Board , which administers federal participation in old-age assistance , I was told that I ought to visit the Retirement Life Payments Association , headquarters of the " Ham and Eggs " movement . By this scheme all retired men and women over fifty were to receive $30 every Thursday . No odor of charity was to cling to these payments ? they were to be received as a matter of right . They were , besides , to lead to new and dazzling prosperity . A middle-aged man , who bore the stamp of long years of farm life on his tired , lined face , received me at the " Ham and Eggs " center and said he would gladly explain all about the special warrants to be issued by California whereby the weekly $30 would be paid . He would tell me how these would be redeemed in money and the cost met by taxes and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old folks had all this wonderful money to spend . IT IS possible that I did n't listen very carefully as he talked . Nothing he said made any sense to me . I could see no result from " Ham and Eggs " except quick and complete bankruptcy for California . But the people who thronged the headquarters were real enough and easy enough to classify . They were well intentioned , not too intelligent , willing to believe in any panacea that would lift from their old shoulders the burden of work and from their hearts the terrors of financial insecurity . The " Ham and Eggs " scheme actually came to a vote last November . The measure was , fortunately , defeated ? by a two-to-one majority . But the movement is by no means dead . The astonishing strength of the Townsend Plan and the " Ham and Eggs " movement in California is not due to lack of generosity in the state 's legitimate old-age benefits . On the contrary , California had the largest per-capita payments last summer , about $34 a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other ? now about $50 , - 000,000 a year . California had a larger relief roll ? 130,000 people ? than any state except Illinois . And under the amended federal law , experts of the Social Security Board in San Francisco agreed , California was fairly certain to increase the pensions to $40 a month . Thus far the state 's school funds have not been tapped . The outlook for the future , though , is far from bright . Under the California law , the counties must pay half of the state 's share in the old-ageassistance program . That is , out of every dollar , the federal government pays fifty cents , the state twenty-five , and the county twenty-five . The danger lies in the fact that the counties already have innumerable expenses ? and among these , of course , are the schools . Some counties are already close to financial insta- bility . In many it has been necessary to cut to the bone such vital activities as hospital service , care of children , and road repairs . The schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some aspects of the situation approach the fantastic . A woman in the state of Washington contended that she was entitled to a pension despite the fact that she lived in a fine house and had a large private income . When her application was denied , she brought suit and actually won , due to some defect in the drafting of the state ' law . The Washington legislature , struggling to make up a $2,000,000 deficit in its pension funds , nullified her claim . In Nebraska , during the twelve years between 1925 and 1937 , the running expenses of the state almost doubled , due mainly to relief and social-security payments . In the same period the school appropriations were cut by more than one third . In state after state liquor , cigarette , and other special taxes are now earmarked for old-age assistance . Colorado is in a strange tangle . Three years ago its voters approved a constitutional amendment whereby all needy people over sixty were to receive $45 a month . But the amendment did nothing about supplying the money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colorado , too , has an organization actively working for bigger payments . The National Annuity League , formed by men once behind the Townsend Plan , sponsored the amendment , which allocated 85 percent of all sales and liquor taxes to pensions , lowered the age limit from sixty-five to sixty , and established the $45 monthly minimum . By April , 1936 , the oldsters were crowding on the rolls at the rate of 1,000 a month . By February of the next year , the number of beneficiaries had increased 66 percent compared with two years before . Meanwhile , Colorado 's budget is $3,000,000 in the red , and the schools of the state are in danger of severe curtailment . INADEQUATE pay has long been the lot of America 's schoolteachers , save in the biggest cities . But they had , in a measure , security in their jobs . Today 's cutting of school funds is a problem that will not be settled for years . If it is not solved , the teachers , too , will be on the relief rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be demanding pensions . A vicious circle , still all but invisible , is taking shape : The children of America , denied the education they need , will be handicapped in the struggle for existence , and an undue proportion will be relief candidates . The teachers , denied adequate salaries and certainty of employment , will also be subjects for state and federal aid . The old people , encouraged by politicians , will continue to ask larger grants . The larger grants will deplete school funds still more . And so the process will continue until disaster is here . It is easy to grow confused these days over the many elaborate plans and projects inaugurated to end suffering and insecurity . When I speak of old-age insurance , I am not referring to unemployment insurance or to the old-age-insurance program whereby the worker and the employer share the cost . I am not referring , either , to payments to children and to the blind . All these , whether administered by the Social Security Board at Washingt or not , are distinct from the grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid merely because re and women have reached a , certain age is true , of course , that all of the proje menace school funds insofar as the sta must raise taxes to support them . The session of Congress that adjourn last summer ended in a compromise 1 tween the demands of the old people n vote and the children who do n't . Pens payments vary greatly in the differ states . In Arkansas , the total has of only $6 ; in the Southern states , genera the rates have been low . And so , fr these areas in particular , the protests ha been loud and vehement . It was poin out that other states were receiving great many more federal dollars . IF AN amendment were adopted regi ing Washington to pay more than states , instead of share-and-share-al. this situation would be relieved . Various amendments to the exist law were offered in Congress . Sens Connally of Texas suggested that the c age-assistance law be changed and that federal government contribute tow pensions on a two-to-one scale , up to $ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal grant of $10 . Thi : will be seen , was a virtual command many of the states to increase payment in order to share in this rich , new grs At least seventeen of them would , in probability , have revised their scales ward . A second amendment provided outright contribution of $30 a montl every needy old person who could qua under the laws of his state . Both these proposals were , fortunat defeated . But the compromise provi that the federal government will mi any state grant up to $40 instead of This , too , will be a direct spur to s legislatures to vote bigger pensi Again : where is the money to come fu The theory is spreading that me : because a man is old and has no mo he is entitled to be supported in rela comfort as long as he lives . Last si mer there were 1,858,000 men and woi on the country 's old-age-pension r Slight doubt exists that their numl will increase year by year . So will t demands and their power . Historic there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eighties the treasury of United States ? and there is no echi this phase ? was in fine shape . In fa ( surplus existed . Among others , the erans of the Grand Army of the Rep : viewed it with longing , and they had 1 petitioning Congress for bigger pensi In 1889 , President Harrison made the i take of appointing a veteran , Corp James Tanner , to the important pos Commissioner of Pensions . The Corp was a forthright man . " I will drive a six-mule team thrc the treasury , " he boasted . " God help surplus ! " But today there is no surplus in W ington , nor have any of the states fi to spare . Payments to the aged must c out of money that is needed for a things . Politicians know that chil do n't vote . But they must be made to member that their parents do vote . Ot wise , God help the school funds . 116                 @ @ @ @
