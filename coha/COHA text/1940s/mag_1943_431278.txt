 | NORWAY , overrun by the Germans in the spring of 1940 , bounced right y back to become one of Germany 's most tormenting enemies . It has become customary to regard Norway as one of the conquered countries and consequently to consider her opposition to the Nazis to be chiefly of the " underground " variety . This is not so . Although there is no less underground activity in Norway than in other occupied countries , Norway 's chief fight against the oppressors has been waged aboveground and in the open , both within the country and from abroad . The population of Norway is about three million , roughly equal to that of the State of Tennessee , but dispersed over an area three times as great . What can a group as small as that , and as scattered as that , accomplish against a ruthless and all-powerful foe ? Especially when that foe has firmly entrenched himself in the homeland of that people , seized control of their national and local administration , of their resources and industries , of their press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture is almost that of a Lilliputian tied down by a whole gang of Gullivers . Parts of Norway Have Eluded Hitler First of all , consider those parts of Norway which eluded Hitler 's grasping fingers . Foremost of these are King Haakon VII and the Royal Norwegian Government ( pages 334 , 339 ) . After directing open war against the oncoming Germans for two months in Norway , the King and all members of the Government , acting on express instructions given them by the last free Norwegian Storting ( parliament ) , removed to England , there to carry on the fight against the enemy from abroad . The King quickly became , and continues to be , the living symbol of all that Norway hopes and strives for in a word , the return to her free , democratic way of life . Around him all Norwegians have rallied in spirit , and with him they have taken up the many tasks related to Norway 's ceaseless fight for freedom . Naturally , the leadership of Norway 's farflung war efforts rests with Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inspiring to note that , thanks to their foresight and enterprise , Nor- way is today able to strike back at the enemy , from abroad , with an Air Force , a Navy , and an Army . Nor is that all . A second , but highly important , part of Norway that eluded Hitler 's grasp in 1940 was the Norwegian merchant marine , or at least more than 80 percent of it . That figure represents every Norwegian ship on the high seas and outside Axis-controlled ports when Hitler loosed his blow against Norway on April 9 , 1940 . Norway 's merchant marine was the fourth largest in the world . Its gross tonnage in 1939 was 4,835,000 , as compared with 21 , - 215,000 for Great Britain , 12,003,000 for the United States , and 5,630,000 for Japan . In quality , forty-five percent of its ships were less than ten years old . Sixty-four percent were fast , modern motor vessels . Forty percent were tankers , the finest , fastest in the world . Norway 's merchant fleet had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely by private enterprise on the part of scores of large and small shipowners scattered among the country 's coastal towns . One of the first acts of the Royal Norwegian Government after the Germans had launched their invasion was the requisitioning of Norway 's privately owned merchant fleet for war use . By means of London radio , and through the Norwegian Embassy in Washington , D. C. , orders were sent out to the more than 1,000 ships then on the high seas that they should report immediately to British or Allied ports . The ships ' masters received that order just a few minutes after the receipt of contradictory orders sent out by Oslo radio , which by then had fallen into Nazi hands . It fell to each individual master to choose which order he was to obey , and without a single exception they elected to follow the directions received from London . Norway 's Fleet Aided Battle of Britain Certainly Hitler 's snorts of fury must have singed his meager mustache when he learned of this development , because it was obvious that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Norwegian merchant fleet . Instead of joining Hitler the 1,000 Norwegian merchant ships , and the 25,000 Norwegian seamen manning them , immediately turned against him in a most telling manner .  | During the long months of the Battle of Britain which followed France 's collapse , the ships of the Norwegian merchant marine carried to England 50 percent of that nation 's supply of oil and gasoline , lifeblood of the heroic R. A. F. , and a third or more of the foodstuffs and war materiel being brought in from abroad . The Norwegian merchant fleet thus became an important steadying influence for Britain during the twelve months she was left to stand off the Nazi attack virtually alone . Britain realized this and appreciated it . In December , 1940 , Sir Ronald Cross , British Minister of Shipping , declared : " Norway 's contribution to the Allied merchant fleet has been of decisive importance . " A month later London declared that the Norwegian merchant fleet was worth more to England " than an army of a million men . " Her vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations ' combined war effort . Daily these ships and seamen brave the danger of torpedoes , mines , bombs , and shells . The British Minister of Shipping rightly declared that " the men who man these ships stand in the front line of battle . " Whereas front-line soldiers ordinarily risk only their own lives , these Norwegian front-line soldiers of the sea daily risk bringing the avenging wrath of the Germans down upon their families in Norway upon wives , children , and parents from whom they have been entirely cut off since the invasion . For many years before the invasion it had been customary for men and officers employed on Norwegian ships to have part of their wages paid directly to their families in Norway . Shipowners , assured by the Norwegian Government in London that they would be reimbursed after the war , continued to make  | these payments to the seamen 's families for many months after the German conquest until the Nazis stepped in and called a halt . By this move the Nazis hoped to " scare " Norwegian seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the employ of Germany , which has been sorely in need of seamen . The German plot did not work . Norwegian seamen 's anxiety over the welfare of their families in Norway was quickly allayed by the Norwegian home front itself . Instead of the regular monthly checks , which shipowners were prevented from sending , the seamen 's wives began receiving anonymous gifts of money , in the mail or on the doorstep , placed there by " friends . " That is one of the ways in which the Norwegian home front patterns its activities to bolster the open fight being waged from abroad . The men on Norwegian merchant ships have complete assurance that , for the time being , at least , their loved ones in NorBritish Combine way are not suffering any greater privations than those of their neighbors . Norway 's Seamen Scorn Nazi Bribes Norwegian seamen have steadfastly turned a deaf ear to all Nazi attempts to lure them away from their jobs by promises , threats , and even bribery . Last summer the London Times reported : " When Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sailors in Norwegian ships in the Pacific to return to Japanese ports , and these bribes were later extended to all Norwegian sailors outside Norwegian waters , but still without any effect . " Some weeks ago another campaign was launched through the German-controlled Norwegian wireless stations to induce sailors to return to Norway . Every night reports were sent out about the sinking of Norwegian ships employed on British death journeys ' and about the cruel way ' in which sailors who wished to return home ' were being treated .  | " These reports were mixed up with personal greetings and messages from wives asking sailors by their names to return . The broadcasts often included descriptions of how favorable conditions in Norway were compared with conditions under which the sailors were forced ' to work . All these pleadings have also fallen on deaf ears . " So the Norwegian merchant ships with their loyal Norwegian crews sail on , carrying guns , tanks , planes and ammunition , foodstuffs , and precious oil and gasoline to all corners of the earth where United Nations ' forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , requisitioned frorn ! private shipowners , are under the management of the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission which was created for that purpose by the Royal Government in the early summer of 1940 . The Itlission , commonly referred to as " Nortraship , " has its headquarters in London . Mr. Oivind Lorentzen , director of Nortraship , recently pointed out that of the total tonnage , 60 percent which were agreed wegian shipowners War Transport as 1939 . The rest of the fleet , he added , is sailing at rates stipulated by the United States Maritime Commission . Aside from income taxes levied on Norwegian citizens outside Norway 's boundaries , the merchant fleet is today the Royal Norwegian Government 's only source of revenue . Money derived from it is used to meet administrative expenses , to make interest and amortization payments on foreign bonded indebtedness from prewar years , to finance a far-reaching health and recreational program for Norwegian seamen , and to meet numerous other miscellaneous expenses imposed upon the  | Government by conditions due to the war . One example is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have escaped from Norway with their parents . But the most spectacular use to which these funds have been put has been for the organization , training , and equipping of Norway 's new Air Force , her new Navy , and her new Army . Heavy Loss of Ships and Men The Norwegian merchant fleet has served the United Nations ' cause at great cost to itself , both in ships and men . In an address delivered last August 18 , Mr. Arne Sunde , Minister of Shipping and Supply in the Royal Norwegian Government , declared : Since April , 1940 , when Germany invaded Norway , some 300 ships totaling about two million deadweight tons have been sunk by the enemy and about 2,000 seamen have perished . Prior to the invasion we had already lost 54 ships totaling 190,000 deadweight tons . The last attack of the German Uboats on our supply lines , especially off the east coast of America , has also hit our fleet hard . In the first six months of this year we have lost about 100 ships totaling over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely long after the war , because Norway has relied on her enterprising merchant fleet to produce the national income needed to offset the country 's unescapable unfavorable balance of trade . Great Britain , understanding this situation , has already granted Norway several cargo ships of new construction to replace losses . Others have been promised by the United States under terms of the Lend-Lease agreement between the two countries . Ships of the Norwegian merchant marine have proved their worth again and again in this war , often in a sensational manner . They aided in the evacuations from Dunkirk ( Dunkerque ) and Crete , and they continue to carry valuable cargo through seas infested with mines and submarines . In November , 1942 , Norwegian naval and merchant marine ships were among the armada carrying the war to North Africa . As mentioned above , many of the Norwegian craft are modern motorships , and because they are so speedy they are  | seldom dependent on convoys . They run it alone , thereby gaining valuable time , making a round trip in less time than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the Norwegian merchant marine have also proved their mettle . Mr. Lorentzen pays them this tribute : " Despite the hard work and the extraordinary strain under which the seamen are living , there has been no breakdown of morale . Messages have come through telling them that slackers need expect no welcome in the homeland after the war . But there was no real need , because every Norwegian sailor is at the front himself . " It is a Norwegian front as well as a united front of the free nations , for he is working and fighting under the Norwegian flag , under Norwegian management , and with a Government and a Sailor King of his own choosing . " This spirit of independence has made it possible for Norway 's sons to withstand U-boat attacks , to bear the brunt of hundreds of bombing attacks in the Mediterranean and elsewhere , and to maintain discipline in orderly relations with their authorities through their own unions and institutions . " " Little Norway " in Canada Trains Airmen The Royal Norwegian Air Force in England in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisted of only 120 officers and men , and a few battered and antiquated planes with which some of the men had made their getaway . The others had escaped across the North Sea in fishing smacks or open boats . All of them were determined to keep on fighting , and together they formed the nucleus for a new and mightier Royal Norwegian Air Force . That same year a training center was set up at Toronto , Canada , named " Little Norway . " It was not long before Norwegians all over the world learned what it was doing .  | A vastly superior enemy air power was commonly regarded as the chief cause of Norway 's downfall ; Norwegians grimly set their jaws and vowed they would never again be caught without an efficient and properly equipped Air Force of their own . And Little Norway has done the job . The original 120 quickly expanded to thousands . To the camp came recruits from all over the world , Norwegians all . Included were many who had been outside Norway when the German blow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of brave young men from back home , who had heard about the new Little Norway and risked their lives to escape from occupied territory to join up ( pages 347 , 349 , 350 , 352 , 353 ) . Some fled across the German-patrolled Norwegian border into Sweden , and from there into Finland and Russia , and from there , by devious routes , three-quarters of the way around the globe to reach Toronto , The overwhelming majority of them , however , chose to take the shorter but more perilous route across the North Sea to England . For this they used any vessel they could lay hands on fishing boats , sailboats , in some cases even rowboats . There is at least one case of young Norwegians " kidnapping " a sizable coastwise steamer from its captain and steering it safely to an English port . By the thousands they came , and invariably their first act upon reaching free soil was to report to Norwegian authorities there and to volunteer for service . " Preferably in the Air Force , " was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most needed . " A mere boy wrote to the commander of the Royal Norwegian Air Force in Great Britain : " I want to be trained as a pilot here in England in the shortest time possible . After that , I ask that you give me a plane which is loaded with explosives , and I will plunge it onto one of the German battleships .  | " This is cruel ; I am still very young and I have not seen much of life , but I have learned to hate those who attacked us . I have seen how they treat women and children . It is the coming generations that we are fighting for . I gladly offer my life if I know I can do something that will protect them . " It has been Little Norway 's task to mold such fervor into sober and efficient pilots , gunners , telegraphers , radio engineers , mechanics , and technicians . Today fully equipped , fully manned squadrons of the Royal Norwegian Air Force , composed entirely of Little Norway graduates , ground crews as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England , and Scotland . Already they are making a name for themselves . In the Dieppe raid of last August , for example , the lone Norwegian squadron that participated in that venture accounted for 15 percent of the enemy aircraft destroyed . Scores of pilots trained at Little Norway have been placed in the ferrying service , bringing bombers from America to fighting fronts across the seas . It took only three months from the time it was started to get Little Norway into full operation . Barracks , mess halls , school buildings , and a hospital had to be built ; instructors , technical experts , doctors , dentists , cooks had to be recruited . Because of the determination to make Little Norway an all-Norwegian community , this was not always easy , but it was done . In a little over two years Little Norway has given Norway an Air Force far excelling that which was on hand to meet the Germans in 1940 . And it continues to augment that Air Force at the rate of well over a thousand graduates a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost legendary feats as that of Bjarne B ? , who , only a little over a year ago in Alesund , saw the Gestapo carry his brother off to prison . Word came not long ago that Bjarne has reaped part of his revenge by shooting down  | a Dornier and a Focke-Wulf in a fight over northern France . The story of the rebirth of the Royal Norwegian Navy parallels that of the Air Force . Admiral William D. Leahy , U. S. N. , summed it up in his Navy Day address when he declared : " We Salute the Navy of Norway " " We salute the Navy of Norway , the country that wo n't give up . The Norwegian homeland lies under the heel of the Nazi conqueror , but free Norway fights on . " The Norwegian Navy was largely destroyed in April , 1940 , taking a third of the attacking German vessels to the bottom with it . Yes , the Norwegian Navy was destroyed ; but it did not die ! As I speak here tonight , a new Norwegian Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to four times the size of the force Hitler destroyed two and a half years ago ! " Here , too , a small group of determined men enjoyed the complete confidence of their King and Government . Others joined them , including many from the steady stream of volunteers escaping from Norway . Young men of the merchant marine sought transfer to the Navy , and those who could be spared were allowed to make the change . But a Navy must have ships , and , as Admiral Leahy pointed out , Norway 's Navy was left with scarcely any ships after the German invasion . Norway 's whaling fleet , largest in the world , partly solved the problem . When the Germans attacked Norway , the whaling season in the Antarctic had just ended . Ships were starting northward . These included several floating whale-oil factories and numerous small auxiliary vessels , called " whale catchers " because they go out and get the whales for the floating factory . As soon as the floating factories had disposed of the valuable cargoes of oil at British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as tankers and added to the merchant fleet . The whale catchers , on the other hand , were assigned to the Royal Norwegian Navy . Small , fast , and highly maneuverable , they make excellent subchasers , once they are properly armed . They have been extensively used for convoy and patrol duty . But the whale catchers alone did not fulfill the Norwegian Navy 's need for ships . Among the strange mixture of small vessels arriving in Great Britain with volunteers from Norway were many regarded as " serviceable . " These were requisitioned and converted into mine sweepers . Finally , the British Government lent a helping hand by making it possible for the Norwegian Navy to procure vessels of new construction ? for example , corvettes ? as well as some that had already seen service . Five of the famous overage destroyers , which the United States transferred to Great Britain early in the war , were later turned over to the Norwegian Navy . All these ships , in addition to the few destroyers , submarines , and auxiliary craft which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy of today ? a Navy which President Roosevelt described as " the fourth largest of the United Nations " ( pp. 335 , 337 , 338 , 341 , 350 ) . To be sure , Norway 's Navy boasts no battleships , cruisers , or aircraft carriers . It includes only the smaller-type vessels , but these . as the Germans know by now , have proved themselves highly effective . The size of her ships has had no limiting effect on the Norwegian Navy 's sphere of action . Today there are Norwegian naval bases in Canada , Australia , South Africa , and in the Caribbean , as well as in England and Scotland . In convoy duty Norwegian naval vessels venture into all corners of the earth . Norway 's Navy could use still more ships . In fact , if all the Norwegian volunteers now serving in Britain 's Royal Navy were recalled for service under their own flag , Norway could man once again as many additional fighting ships as she now has in service . Norwegian Army Reorganized The Royal Norwegian Army has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the same as that of the Air Force and the Navy . These men , several thousands of them now , are training in Scotland and England , where they also perform their stint as part of the British coastal patrol ( pages 344 , 346 , 357 ) . The entire Army is being schooled in Commando tactics in preparation for the day when the countries trampled by the Nazis are to be reentered and liberated . It has been equipped with modern weapons of war , and it eagerly awaits an opportunity to use them . The Government selected to serve as commander in chief of all of Norway 's fighting forces General Wilhelm Hansteen , a 46-yearold veteran of the campaign in Norway . His headquarters are in London . The " volunteers " crossing the North Sea from Norway to England are , for the most part , young , able-bodied men . But they also include older men as well as women and children . Those not suited for military service get other types of war jobs .  | Women and girls find positions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory hands . Many of the older men have taken jobs on the water front , particularly as longshoremen . Scores of fishermen who brought their boats from Norway have now established themselves along the Scottish coast where they are again working their nets and bringing in the daily catch . People at Home Fight , Too Norway is proud of the open fight she is making against the enemy on so many fronts outside her borders , but she is no less proud of the fight against the oppressor carried on by the people at home . That fight , too , is essentially an open fight . Norway is a nation of strongly individualistic people steeped in the tradition of democracy and motivated by a profound sense of justice . When the Germans make new demands or threaten new encroachments , the Norwegians judge the moves in the light of their own training in democracy and justice . To yield meekly would , to their way of thinking , be the equivalent of becoming party to the crime . So they rise and face the tyrant with an emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fjord to fjord . As the Germans scrabbled northward through Norway in the conquest of 1940 , they always took care to strip the native population of the occupied area of guns and ammunition . When the whole country had been overrun , the Germans felt confident the people had been rendered harmless . They had no guns : therefore they had nothing to fight with . So thought the Germans . But the Norwegians had on hand a whole arsenal of weapons ? secret weapons against which the Germans knew no defense . These weapons were the direct heritage of the traditional Norwegian democratic way of living . Germany sought to impose the " new order " upon Norway ? complete with its " fuehrer system " and all its regimentation of men , institutions , and industries . Germany even tried to impose upon Norway a new government headed by Vidkun Quisling . This was a stupid way of attempting to win the good will of a people who had selected  | their own form of government , king and all , by popular vote back in 1905 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was still in power . For Norwegians the situation did not even present a choice . The idea of a new government headed by the traitorous buffoon Quisling was as obnoxious as it was ridiculous . Norway has given Hitler and the whole world absolute proof that democracy is not weak , not decadent . Norway has demonstrated that democracy is full of hidden powers for self-preservation and for attack if need be ; that democracy , like a modern insurance policy , builds up year by year a reserve of strength and energy that will see it through ( lire crises . Numerous incidents could be presented to prove that the Norwegian home front 's fight is in the main open and active ( page 340 ) . By employing democratic processes , somewhat " adapted " to wartime conditions , the Norwegians have virtually been voting down Nazism month after month for the past two and a half years , and in so doing they have gradually molded themselves into a firm and unshakable home front . In the early fall of 1940 , shortly after the mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a longing look toward the 300,000 young men and boys affiliated with the hundreds of local sports clubs throughout the country . All of these were federated in a national organization . Here , thought the German and Quisling leaders , was excellent material for " the cause . " If these 300,000 youths could be enlisted under the swastika , the complete Nazification of Norway would be assured . So leaders of the national association were dismissed from their positions and replaced by Nazis . A " Sit-down Strike " in Sports District sports leaders consulted local club leaders who , in turn , placed the matter before the rank and file of the membership . There they got their answer , and it was relayed back . Meanwhile , the Nazis , gloating over what they believed an easy victory , had gone ahead with their plans . One of them , Charles Hoff , had called a meeting of sports stars and leaders and was explaining these plans to them . Norway , he said , was to be a land of golden opportunity for everyone interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipment , and privileges for people interested in sports . And every branch of sports or recreation , he added , was to have its own  | " fuehrer , " with himself as top fuehrer . He turned to Birger Ruud , famous Olympic skijumping champion . " And as for you , Birger , " said Hoff , " I 've planned that you should be fuehrer of the skiing sport . " Birger Ruud he 's only a little fellow ? leaped to his feet , his face flushed . " And as for you , Charles Hoff , " he exploded , " I 've planned that you can go jump in the lake ! " Only Birger used somewhat stronger lan-guage ! But that was the answer sent back to the Nazis by the 300,000 members of sports clubs throughout Norway . There was nothing " underground " about that , nor about these sports lovers ' subsequent point-blank refusal to have anything to do with any Nazi-sponsored sports activities of any kind whatsoever . The effect was that the sports lovers of Norway went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity the Nazis would announce big contests and championship tournaments . But no entries appeared . By refusing to participate , the athletes demonstrated unmistakably where their sympathies lay , and they did it squarely in the face of a hostile occupying power . But each athlete was strengthened by the knowledge that there stood 300,000 fellow athletes behind him , and that behind them stood a whole nation . This sports strike continues to this very day . Supreme Court Resigns The resignation of the Norwegian Supreme Court in a body in December , 194C. was tremendously important to the home front and disastrous to the Nazis . It , too , was an overt action , with no concealment about it . The Supreme Court had been placed ih power by a government chosen by the people : it had to uphold the law , and was directly responsible to the people . When the Supreme Court justices realized that there was no longer any hope of fulfilling that duty , they removed themselves from the picture rather than comply with Nazi wishes that they become Hitler 's or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the coming of the Germans , lawlessness and arbitrary rule had succeeded law and order . A few months later the bishops of the Norwegian State Church directly charged officials of the Nazi Government with failure to maintain order and justice in the country , citing  | specific instances to prove their point . Aside from a wholly t:nsatisfactory exchange of letters , the move brought no result , so the bishops placed the entire matter before the people in a " pastoral letter " which was read from every State Church pulpit in Norway . Thus the people were again forcibly reminded of the immoral character of the occupying power and of its Quisling hangers-on . This also had a solidifying effect on the home front , which was by then beginning to feel its hidden strength and to see how effectively Nazism could be combatted , even in occupied Norway , by pen , democratic action . But all this proved to be only preliminary to the great showdown which began in February , 1942 , when Vidkun Quisling was elevated to the position of Minister-President by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fascist pattern . He planned a corporate parliament composed not of elected representatives of political parties but of delegates from the various trades and professions . To get this he had first to reorganize and Nazify the trades and professions . He was stupid enough to believe he could do this by fiat . Teachers Risk Jobs and Lives Early in February he proclaimed that all teachers in Norway were automatically members of a new teachers ' association , called the Loerersamband , and that as such they would be expected to bring all their teaching into harmony with the " new order . " The result was that virtually all of the teachers rose up in rebellion . They flooded the mails with their curt letters of resignation from the samband . Even when they were told this stand would cost them their jobs , and when they realized they were risking imprisonment , torture , labor camps , and probably death itself , they did not falter . Each of those letters of resignation carried the name and address of the sender ? a challenge to " come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers were arrested and thrown into concentration camps . Some of them were subjected to severe cruelty and hardships . But they did not yield .  | To make good his threat to deprive all nonNazi teachers of their jobs , Quisling suspended school throughout Norway for several weeks . He made a frantic effort to enlist substitutes ; anyone and everyone was declared acceptable as long as he or she was of the " Nazi frame of mind . " But the search yielded only a scant handful . In the end Quisling had to consent to the reopening of schools with the old teachers in charge that is , those who were not under arrest . The first act of these teachers upon resuming work was to read to their pupils , in every classroom , a pledge in which they affirmed they were not members of the Lcerersamband , no matter what the Nazis might say . The Historic Teachers ' Pledge That pledge closed with the following solemn assurance to the pupils : " I will not call upon you to do anything which I regard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as not conforming with the truth . " I will , as I have done heretofore , let my conscience be my guide , and I am confident that I shall then be in step with the great majority of the people who have entrusted to me the duties of an educator . " Gradually Quisling 's Nazification scheme reached around to all trades and professions . and everywhere it was rejected in exactly the same way as the teachers had rejected it . One after the other , the Nation 's publishers , artists . doctors , dentists , lawyers , shipowners , industrialists , and many more , took their stand , and it was always the same ? point-blank refusal . Quisling was busy proclaiming new " organizations " and appointing Nazis to head them , but always he was left with nothing but a high-sounding name and his own handpicked staff of officers . The membership had slipped through his fingers . That 's how it went with the labor unions . too , when Quisling , as a final step before bringing his corporate parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . They , like others , wrote letters of resignation : over their signatures they told Quisling and Hitler and the whole world that they wanted no part of the " new order . "  | That was the knockout punch ; Quisling was forced to " postpone indefinitely " the creation of his corporate parliament . That was in September , 1942 . One could prepare an almost endless list of heart-rending events in Norway during the more than two and a half years of German occupation . There have been arrests , concentration camps , labor camps , the torture of Gestapo prisons , and scores of executions by German firing squads . There have been plunder and violence . There have been severe shortages of food , clothing , fuel , and shelter . There have been humiliation and sacrifice . Blood has been spilled . There has been bottomless grief . Democracy 's Hidden Strength But the great thing that has happened in Norway during this period is the discovery of this hidden strength of democracy ? the secret weapons which make even a small nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been overrun by the hordes of a nation many times its size . Not only have these weapons made Norway unconquerable , but they have enabled Norway to carry on the fight both at home and from abroad . These are weapons of the spirit , forged by the fires and hammers of democracy , and once a man or nation has acquired them , no one can take them away . How well Norway has preserved and employed this democratic heritage was attested last fall by President Roosevelt , who declared that the assistance of the Norwegians to the United Nations ' cause has been out of all proportion to their small numbers . " The President said : " If there is anyone who still wonders why this war is being fought , let him look to Norway . If there is anyone who has any delusions that this war could have been averted , let him look to Norway . " And if there is anyone who doubts the democratic will to win , again I say , let him look to Norway . He will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to his questioning . "
