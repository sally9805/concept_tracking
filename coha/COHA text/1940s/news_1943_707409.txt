Shipbuilding , they point out , continues to be extremely important . Tapering off of the huge expansion push constitutes the biggest shift in the local labor situation which has occurred in the past year and more . For many months the shipyards have ' presented by far the largest single demand for workers . The change will make it easier for Boston to slip out of Group II , an area of labor stringency with certain restrictions on new war contracts , WMC officials noted .

Requirements Cut Now the shipyard requirements for expansion have been reduced to between 6,000 and 7,000 workers , War Manpower officials note . The problem of replacements is also somewhat smaller . Meanwhile many of the demands for war workers made by other industry and by essential business firms of this area have increased , and altogether the coming Boston campaign to enlist war workers will be aimed more at meeting the shortages of other establishments than of the shipyards , it is stated at the offices of the War Manpower Commission . Lessening of the demand for shipyard workers has been contributed to by the Boston Navy Yard lengthening the work-day from eight to nine hours for four-fifths of its main production force . This increases production per employee and to that extent reduces demand for new workers .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
