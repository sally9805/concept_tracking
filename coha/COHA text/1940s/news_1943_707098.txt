By The Associated Press . ALLIED HEADQUARTERS IN NORTH AFRICA , April 18 ? Lieut . Gen. Carl Spaatz said today that his Northwest African Air Forces had " secured supremacy of the air " since the Mareth Line battle began on March 20 and had shot down 519 Axis planes since that date , against a loss of 175 . General Spaatz said that almost 1,000 enemy planes had been destroyed or damaged on the ground by a continual series of attacks against enemy air bases during that period , while Allied losses in this category were " less than two figures . " " We 've been continually on the offensive=the enemy has been on the defensive in this air war , " he added . The North African Strategic Air Force of heavy bombers and fighter escorts has followed a longterm , long-range policy . with its personnel and planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James H. Doolittle , General Spaatz explained . " This group of fliers struck probably the hardest blows in daylight ever delivered by an air force , " he declared . " One hundred Flying Fortresses , the largest formation of Fortresses ever in the air , attacked the docks at Naples April 4 , inflicting considerable damage on shipping . With , the Fortresses playing a leading part April 10 , sixty-three losses were three planes . " General Spaatz said that the air victory of April 10 was " compara-ble with R. A. F. victories of the Battle of Britain and on this occasion United States fliers were almost entirely responsible . " American fighters with the Strategic Air Force on April 10 shot down no fewer than forty enemy transport aircraft . " To neutralize the enemy air effort some of our heaviest attacks were delivered on enemy airdromes and there is little doubt that these strikes have disorganized the Luftwaffe , " General Spaatz added . " Since March 15 , strategic bombers have destroyed eighteen enemy merchant ships and damaged many sufficiently to put them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flown on thousands of sorties individual flights . " The Northwest African Tactical Air Force , which is the second part of his command , and is under Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham , follows the policy of " immediaate results , " General Spaatz said . Marshal Coningham 's tactical force , consisting of American and British fighters and light and medium bombers , played a considerable part in the attacks on enemy airfields , but the main task has been to attack enemy road traffic , shoot down enemy aircraft and protect Allied ground forces . " American Spitfires on April 3 destroyed fourteen Stukas without a loss to themselves and practically wiped out the whole formation before it was able to inflict a single casualty on our ground forces , " General Spaatz recalled . Complete Harmony Cited " The Northwest African Air Forces  --  one of the components of the Mediterranean Air Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder  --  has secured supremacy of the air since the beginning of the Mareth Line battle . It is composed of American and British air units operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in complete harmony in securing air supremacy and , in addition , making devastating attacks on enemy shipping and ports . Other components of the Mediterranean Air Command  --  the Mediterranean Air Force and Middle East Air Force  --  had a vital part . " General Spaatz also paid tribute to the Coastal Air Force that is a part of his Northwest African Air Forces . " It covered our shipping , protected our ports , made many reconnaissance flights to insure the safe arrival of our convoys and assisted in destruction of enemy shipping , " he said . On the subject of American aircraft quality , General Spaatz de-clared : " Our fighters have consistently beaten the enemy in the air , as the records show . The planes we have here can cope with anything the Germans have . Naturally , the lessons we learned ' we sent home for incorporation in future designs . " I want to emphasize that American planes here are good . Our pilots here are equally good ? as good as the pilots of any nation  --  and the R. A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Forces have thrown us together in intimate contact , and there is the highest admiration between the Americans and the R. A. F. for each other . " Replying to correspondents ' questions about the German Junkers-87 dive bombers , which , despite their alleged obsolescence , are still used occasionally in North Africa , General Spaatz said : " I would not have a Stuka type in any air force I would ever run . The best dive bomber we have is the fighter . " All of our fighters have good points , " he added , " but use them the wrong way at the wrong levels and you get into trouble . The combination of planes we have here meets our requirements very adequately . " Summing up the air war , he said : " We roam freely over Tunisia , Sicily , Sardinia and Italy day and night . It is very rare for the Luftwaffe to indulge in anything but sneak raids . What we accomplish is greatly superior in its effects to what the enemy does . The enemy has considerable fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they are safer and easier supplied but distant from the front . "
