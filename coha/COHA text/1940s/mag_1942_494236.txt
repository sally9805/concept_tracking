THE CRISIS OF THE UNITED NATIONS is Ulti ? mately the crisis of liberalism . It is no far-off crisis , enacted below the heights on which you stand . It is a test of your strength or weakness . The greatest task of democratic leadership in the last ten years was to awaken all peoples to the danger of fascist aggression . It was primarily the task of liberals , for it was against us that fascism thrust its first spear . But we were too confused , too isolated , too disorgan ? ized to offer real leadership . We failed . Many thou ? sands paid the price for our failure . The second great task of democratic leadership in these last years has been to mobilize our peoples in an all-out war . Again , because , as liberals we had no vested interest in the barriers to an all-out effort , this task was ours . Again we were weak , and unable to make our will felt in time . Many thousands are now paying the price for our failure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to bring from this immense and bloody sacrifice a peace through which it may be justified . Again , this is our task . In war , a people fight for the future and do not know it . They believe that they are fighting for the pre-war world , and powerful , en ? trenched interests encourage them in this belief . But in reality the world is transformed in the course of a world war , and if the purpose of the peace settlement is to attempt a return to the past , then the people , condemned to further suffering , come to believe that they have been betrayed . Therefore the liberals who can see the future and are not afraid of it , must work with all their power to make certain that it is the future for which wars are fought . Again we are failing . We have learned almost noth . leg from our previous failures . We are as confused , 45 isolated , as unorganized as we ever were . We are as willing to sit on the fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity " as we ever were . We are as willing to become again the kept op-Position of an outworn but ruthless system as we ever were . We stand now in grave danger of failing again . Millions may pay the price for our final failure . We have not much time left . At this moment , when the tide has turned for the United Nations , it has turned against the liberal spirit . If that spirit can not etrierge now , as a disciplined , fighting spirit , it will Perish , as all forms of life shbuld perish which have not the will to live . What are we to do ? , an irst , we have got to get off the fence and wade into this fight . We have got to understand that power alone 11111 is the final article in the series , " The Crisis of the United ilthat " ? Tun hDITOR11 is decisive now , and that the struggle for power is not a pleasant debate waged over teacups , but a harsh and bitter battle that hurts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in less than two years will come an all-important political encounter , in which , if we march to the front as we are now ? without ranks , without training , without discipline , without strategy ? we shall be cut to pieces . We have no time to play any longer with generali ? ties . We have no time to fake our way through with slogans that were hollow five years ago . We must now identify ourselves with practical , fighting concepts . We need now to see on what fronts reaction is preparing to make its offensive against these concepts . We need now to fortify those fronts . The first front on which reaction must attack is the condition of full mobilization , brought about through active government intervention , that the war has created . Reaction must attack government ownership and operation , progressive taxation , control of new in ? vestment and of profits , the government-enforced closed shop that we have achieved in wartime . Right : then we must demonstrate to our people the permanent value of these achievements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . Full mobilization in peace must become our first fighting concept . The second front on which reaction must attack is against the world organization of the United Nations that may ? grow from this war . It must attack the United Nations , because any world organization in which Soviet Russia and the colonial peoples partici ? pate as equals must be hostile to the purposes of reac ? tion and imperialism . Normally the fight will be made on the slogans , " No international WPA 's , " " No dicta ? torship over Americans by Chinks and Wops " and " No alliance with Stalin . " But the real fight will be made against the appropriations and the delegated powers necessary for the operation of any world organization . Again , if we spend our time talking about world courts and parliaments of man , while the one vital sector of our front is left unfortified , we shall be over ? whelmed . We need to prepare now for the actual fight - that is coming and for the arguments that will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our force behind a second definite concept ? the United Nations ? and second main program ? the maintenance and extension , in peace , of the working machinery of the United Nations . Our first job is to understand the future as it is forming now . Our second job is to put the future on a precinct basis . We have got to understand that as indi ? viduals we count for nothing . As a little band of un ? happy dissenters we represent absolutely nothing . We have got to swallow our sense of superiority and splen ? did isolation . We have got to join in harness with every organization that is struggling for a better world . On the domestic front we face an immediate test in the attempt of a conservative coalition to wrest power from the liberal leadership in the government in the coming Congress . The Farmers ' Union , the CIO , the AFL , the railway unions and other groups must join now in one legislative organization , under some such great man as George Norris . Because government re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on , the research units of these organizations should also join to grind out our legislative program . We must further undertake to drive home to our people the meaning of full mobilization . The govern ? ment is establishing institutions and techniques which can be used permanently to ensure full mobilization . They are faltering now , many are threatened . The government is also establishing town and county fo ? rums . They arc too few , and they lack direction . But it is in these ways that the future is expressing itself , and we must strengthen them . One action we must take now for the future : we know now that when the temporary post-war boom is over , the government will have to finance ten to fifteen billion dollars a year of new investment to maintain full mobilization . Until now the organizations which have fought for the sepa ? rate components of this program , the movements for public power , for public health , for low-cost housing , for pensions , for public works , for decent education and for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , and with no sense of the total pro- gram of which they represent a part . These groups should now form a coordinating council for full mo ? bilization in peace , through which each will agree on how the total program is to be constructed , and each will gain from being part of a much larger objective . Also , we have got to form our lines for the political fights that must come . We must build on a precinct basis a political movement that can relate our present programs to the issue of 1944 . On the world front there is precisely the same job to be done . So far , no organization has existed that can do it . The same petty jealousies , the same inability to evaluate the world revolution that is taking place dur ? ing this war , that has weakened the labor movement , have sapped the strength of the Citizens for Victory , the Council for Democracy , the League of Nations Association , the Commission to study the Organization of Peace , Federal Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join now in one movement behind which the widest possible support of church study groups , men 's service clubs , women 's organizations , national minorities and the trade unions can be gathered . Again , the job is one of education and organization . In the cities , organization must be based on the precinct , since the blocks are part of the OCD structure . In the rural areas , so long neg ? lected by the peace movement and the liberals , the center of activity must be the Triple A planning com ? mittees , the farm boards and the county organizations . We need to organize " Scrap for Russia " days , and to start the idea of " An acre for a British soldier " on the small farms . Everywhere we need to help in forums . Between the movements that must fight for domes ? tic and United Nations ends , we need to establish the closest working agreements . There is an obvious tie between these movements , the fact that by mobilizing on the home front , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war to the swiftest possible end . We need to create in the communities Win the War in 1943 Committees in which the practical de ? mands for a Supreme Council , for the publication of war aims and for the development and democratization of our own war effort will meet . To be effective we must be organized . Yet to be organized on a national basis is no longer enough . We must finally see ourselves as part of a world move ? ment ; we must bring together the struggle of liberals the world over . The need for this unification is clearest between our ? selves and Britain . The tragedy of Britain is that on her soil the conflict between America and Russia is be ? ing waged . The mass of the British people now have a great love for Russia and look upon us with benevo ? lent skepticism . But conservatism in Britain turns to us as its savior . Because Britain is falling so rapidly into economic dependence upon us , she is in a sense held as our hostage against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our weight , far too often , seems to be on the side of reaction in Britain . The simplest indication of the interrelation of liber ? alism in Britain and America , is that within a few weeks of our election , conservatism in Britain was able to de . mote Sir Stafford Cripps . Another instance is the issue of India . The inability of British liberals to break through the suppression of self-government in India discredits the liberal movement in America . But it is the inability of liberals in America to commit this coo-try to an active role in world reconstruction which could ease Britain 's recovery from the loss that the liberation of India would involve , that is a main drag on the British liberal movement . There is precisely the same interrelation of Mr alism in China , in Europe , in Latin America , in Ind : itself . In Russia , the Soviet government will ague far as we will let it toward a closer world unders ing . Therefore it is essential that we establish e Worich relationship among liberals everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reinforced by 014 vance in every other . A brilliant attempt to do just has been made by the Free World Association ? Above all we must create a really powerful American Section of the Free World Association , around which United Nations councils can be built . The issues are dear now . Leadership is at hand . There is no longer any excuse for any of us to with ? hold our energy and our resources from this fight.735 The address of the American Section of the Free World Association is care of the Rev. Howard L. Brooks , 55 West Forty-second Street , New York City . It needs local support , and it needs funds . Its leaders are waiting for you . Americas FARMERS harvested a bumper crop in 1942 . Favorable weather , improved varieties and better farming methods , together with in ? creased mechanization , produced record-breaking yields of foodstuffs . This year we harvested three billion bushels of corn , almost a billion bushels of wheat . Corn , Wheat , rye , cotton , hay , beans , peas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high records for Yield per acre . Oats , barley , soybeans , sugar beets and tobacco were very near to record yield . All in all , crop Production this year was estimated to be 14 percent more than last year and 13 percent ahead of the former all-time peak of 1937 . But food demand has increased even faster than food Production . Unless rationing of most foods is begun Without further delay , unless man power , farm ma ? chinery and transportation are properly mobilized , we are heading for trouble with our food supply . The United Nations could have used more than even the bountiful harvest we brought in this year , and next year we and our allies will require all the meat , dairy , poultry , wool , hides and by-products American farms can furnish , as well as greatly increased quan ? titiei of vegetable oils , fresh vegetables , beans , peas , potatoes , rice and sugar . But in the face of this greatly expanded demand , at , home and overseas , the Department of Agriculture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this Year 's production records . In addition , it is already dear that the military food requirement this year will be much greater than last . Our military command talks of an armed force that is not far from ten million Men . Our allies are already indicating that they will have to draw on us for greater quantities of foods than 11. eY did last year , and there are also the possible needs Qt civilians in lands our troops may be occupying . All this adds up to the fact that most Americans 4 , : 4Et year will not eat so much or so well as they did " ma year . l'he next question , then , is , which Americans will get wit Part of the food available for civilians ? If we mere running along under a well organized , total-war Plit ; there would be no question . Those who did the rtIcr8t War work , who contributed the most toward war suction would be the best fed . That is the way it isin England and the Soviet Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . In the face of a restricted food supply , however , it will be necessary for us to get on some such basis for distribut ? ing our food resources if war production is to be kept up to schedule . To divide up our domestic food supply next year so that it will contribute the most to winning the war will mean , among other things : 1 . Enforcing price control . 2 . Almost full rationing of foodstuffs . 3 . Making it possible for each family to take up its full ration . Almost every responsible official in the Office of Price Administration will readily admit that the pres ? ent Maximum Price Regulation is practically unenforce ? able and that dollars-and-cents ceilings for individual commodities must be set as rapidly as possible , with dear quality standards in each case . In a few in ? stances , steps are already being taken to install this procedure , but these same officials also recognize that the process can go little further until a policy of sub ? sidy for marginal producers and distributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the only man with the power to OK that policy . Congress specifi ? cally forbade Henderson to use subsidies . Byrnes is dodging this step . He must be forced to sanction sub ? sidies before Henderson can go much further in devel ? oping a workable price-control program . Even a sound price-control program , without ration ? ing , would inevitably result in a surge of black markets . The experience of Germany , England and other coun ? tries has established this fact beyond doubt . But even now our rationing officials are struggling with the ABC 's of rationing procedure . If they have learned from British experience , in particular , the desirability of a point system of rationing over a unit system and the need of speed and decision in declaring commodi ? ties for ration , there is little sign of it . The New Deal ? ers can make legitimate complaint about some of the men who are supposedly in control of this job . Most of them are also New Dealers by background or inclina ? tion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Meat rationing is actually being held up weeks past the time necessary for administrative preparations be
