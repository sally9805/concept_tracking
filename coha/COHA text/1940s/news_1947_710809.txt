txt WASHINGTON , Oct. ** his book , " Speaking Frankly , " released to the public tomorrow by Harper &; Brothers , James F. Byrnes reviews the foreign policy of the United States from the Yalta conference in 1945 to his retirement as Secretary of State after the New York conference in 1946 ; looks prophetically and hopefully into the future of AmericanSoviet relations ; and in so doing makes a number of sensational revelations in deceptively mild language . Among these revelations are : 1 . After President Truman , during the Paris Conference of Foreign Ministers in 1946 , attempted to compromise a rift between Mr. Byrnes and Henry A. Wallace by an agreement with Mr. Wallace that the latter was not to speak on foreign policy until the conference had ended , Mr. Byrnes resigned by teletype . Also , the Secretary of State opened the exchange after waiting vainly to hear something direct from the President . Despite official denials in Paris and Washington at the time that the Secretary had resigned or sent the President an " ultimatum , " both facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded by dismissing Mr. Wallace from his Cabinet . 2 . Mr. Byrnes was often at odds With other Presidential advisers ? with Henry Morgenthau Jr . during President Roosevelt 's administration , over the " Morgenthau Plan " to reduce Germany to a pastoral state , and with Fleet Admiral William . D. Leahy over modifying Japanese surrender terms and our attitude toward the pro-Soviet Governments of Rumania and Bulgaria . 3 . Because Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill approved the Morgenthau Plan , Mr. Byrnes declined to become Wigh Commissioner of the United States in Germany  --  agreeing with Henry L. Stimson , Secretary of War , and Cordell Hull , Secretary of State , in their opposition . Though the latter two were excluded from Quebec despite its agenda of " military matters , " Mr. Morgenthau went there with Presidential approval . 4 . V. M. Molotov , the Foreign Minister of Soviet Russia , so angered Hitler during Berlin negotiations in 1939 on applications of the Nazi-Soviet pact that , in Mr. Byrnes ' opinion , Hitler on that occasion  --  Nov. 13 ? determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Winston Churchill became so excited at Yalta over a preliminary statement on trusteeships by Edward R. Stettinius Jr. , then Secretary of State , that President Roosevelt had to quiet him by asking him to wait until he had heard the full text . When Ernest Bevin , the British Foreign Minister , compared Molotov 's methods to Hitler 's ( London conference , October , 1945 ) Molotov started to " take a walk " and was induced to stay only when Mr. Bevin withdrew the remark . 6 . At Potsdam ( July , 1945 ) President Truman asserted that the United States would never recognize the Bulgarian and Rumanian Governments which it since has recognized . 7 . At Potsdam Mr. Byrnes openly engaged in " bargaining " over admissions to the United Nations , though United States representatives at recent meetings of the United Nations Assembly have denied that this Government ever resorts to the method . 8 . At Potsdam Stalin expressed the opinion to Mr. Byrnes that Hitler was then alive , " possibly " either in Spain or Argentina , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dropped on Hiroshima . Mr. Byrnes attributes this show of non-interest to the belief of the Russians that the United States would no more give them important information about a secret weapon than they would give it to us . Roosevelt insulted by Stalin 7 . When the plan was made in 1945 for Allied officers to meet Field Marshal Albert Kesserling in Italy , to discuss his surrender proposals , Stalin sent President Roosevelt a message which the President found insulting . In this message Stalin expressed his belief in reports from Red Army sources that the United States and Great Britain were plotting a separate peace with Germany . Mr. Roosevelt sent a shaarp answer , and , after the Caserta meeting on this subject , Stalin closed the incident apologetically two days before the President died . This moved Mr. Roosevelt , one hour before his death , to include in a message to Prime Minister Churchill the advice to " minimize Soviet problems , " which " seem to arise every day and most of them straighten out " as the row over separate peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must be firm , however , and our course thus far is correct . " 8 . Mr. Byrnes inaugurated the even firmer policy toward the Soviet known as " tough , " at the first meeting of the Foreign Ministers ( London , 1945 ) . He supports its wisdom in this passage : We should not start something we are not prepared to finish . * * * I do not believe the Soviet Union will force us to take measures of last resort . It will not remain away from the peace conference on the future of Germany and thus isolate itself from the rest of the world . If it should , I do not believe the Red Army would try to hold permanently all of Eastern Germany . However , if I misjudge them , and they do go to the point of holding Eastern Germany and vetoing a Security Council directive to withdraw occupation forces , we must be prepared to assume the obligations that then clearly will be ours . * * By " we " I do not mean the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We trod that path once before . We want to make the peace collectively . But if it is not possible to secure the cooperation of all states , we should seek to enlist the assistance of as many as we are willing to join in the task . I hope , believe , and I pray , that the leaders of the Soviet Union will never force us to this course of last resort . But they must learn what Hitler learned ? that the world is not going to permit one nation to veto peace on earth . " Appointed " on Funeral Train 9 . President Truman informed Mr. Byrnes on the funeral train returning from Hyde Park that , as soon as the San Francisco Conference , then assembling , ended , he would appoint him Secretary of State to replace Mr. Stettinius . The incumbent was not notified . Mr. Byrnes began his career as a shorthand reporter , and " speaking frankly " is the product of notes made by him from the time he went with Mr. Roosevelt to Yalta as " adviser " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , though less important , revelations , some of which follow : ( a ) President Roosevelt never told Mr. Byrnes of his territorial concessions to Stalin at Yalta , and he also failed to inform Vice President Truman of this and many other actions . Mr. Byrnes learned of the concessions after he became Secretary of State and asked Admiral Leahy to transfer to the department all White House documents containing agreements with foreign nations . " I wanted , " he writes , " to know how many IOU 's were outstanding . " ( b ) Early on the morning of Aug. 10 , 1945 , word was received through the Swiss Government that the Japanese were willing to accept the Potsdam terms of surrender with the understanding that nothing in these terms would " prejudice the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler . " Admiral Leahy urged prompt acceptance . Mr. Byrnes preferred to stand on unconditional surrender " in which the United States and not Japan would state the conditions . " President Truman agreed with him . ( e ) Admiral Leahy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated the effects of the atomic bomb . ( d ) Mr. Morgenthau put a paragraph in a memorandum to Secretary Hull on the lend-lease agreement at the Quebec conference which asserted that President Roosevelt wanted Mr. Morgenthau to head the directing committee . " However , " writes Mr. Byrnes , " the memorandum from the White house * * * did not include this paragraph . " ( e ) The President 's reply to Mr. Byrnes ' teletyped resignation and ultimatum from Paris is not given in the book . But in his first message the Secretary told Mr. Truman that " it would be a grave mistake for me to continue in office , even temporarily , if it is not possible for you , for any reason , to keep Mr. Wallace as a member of your Cabinet from speaking on foreign affairs " He did not ask the President to dismiss Mr. Wallace , but he said that the Secretary of Commerce would have to be muzzled permanently while in the Cabinet  --  or else . They used the teletype for an exchange next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , because the operator could not clear " a third party off the channel . " Mr. Byrnes does not identify him , but Allied secret services have been known to listen in on such exchanges when they could . In his second teletyped message to the President Mr. Byrnes wrote : When the representatives of other governments know that as soon as the conference ends we will again have conflicting statements by your Secretary of State and your Secretary of Commerce , your delegation here can not contribute much to the making of the peace . * * * * * * you accept my resignation he Wallace might be willing to support your foreign policies or at least refrain from attacking such policies . ( f ) The secret terms , including territorial barter , between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in 1939 are given in detail from the Nazi records . They disclose a brutal program of annexations , with Molotov finally angering Hitler by insisting that German troops be withdrawn from Finland and expressing the view that Germany 's guarantee of the borders of Rumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 of course , it was . ) A great deal is omitted , despite , the title of the book . For example , i what were the real relations between the President and Mr. Byrnes when the Secretary retired after forcing Mr. Truman , some months before , to evict Mr. Wallace from the Cabinet ? But on the whole the 324 pages , plus index , are crammed with disclosures , many of which were kept from the press at the time or , through " spokesmen " or planned " leaks , " were conveyed to the public in a misleading way . For instance , Paris reporters at the time of the Wallace incident were told that the President initiated the teletype exchange with Mr. Byrnes . And a Washington dispatch of the same period reported an " unequivocal " denial by the White House that Mr. Byrnes had " ever laid down an ultimatum " to the President .
