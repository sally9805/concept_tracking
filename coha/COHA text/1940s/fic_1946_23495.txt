LETTER FROM THE RECORDING ANGEL MARK TWAIN The sketch here called " Letter from the Recording Angel " was found untitled in the Mark TWain papers . It was probably written , as the text implies , in 1887 , possibly following an August notebook entry which expresses astonishment over the recent profits of a Langdon colliery . It is printed here as it was originally written , with the Office of the Recording Angel addressing Andrew Langdon , an uncle of Mrs. Clemens . In 1886 Mark Twain had begun A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court , only to lay the manuscript aside as his custom was when the going got hard . He took it up again in 1888 and when he reached the passage where the Yankee restores the water of the holy well in the valley of anchorites and stylites , he tried to work the Recording Angel 's report into the context . He had to change it radically to adapt it to the scheme of the book : it is a mysterious , unexplained communication , possibly genuine , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a religious maniac . He could not satisfactorily work it into the mood of the book and so deleted it . So far as I know , he made no further effort to adapt or publish the original sketch . BERNARD DEVOTO Office of the Recording Angel Department of Petitions , Jan. 20 Andrew Langdon Coal Dealer Buffalo , N. Y. I have the honor , as per command , to inform you that your recent act of benevolence and self-sacrifice has been recorded upon a page by itself of the Book called Bolden Deeds of Men : a distinction , I am permitted to remark , which is not merely extraordinary , it is unique . As regards your prayers , for the week ending the 19th , I have the honor to report as follows : 1 . For weather to advance hard coal 15 cents per ton . Granted . 2 . For influx of laborers to reduce wages 10 per cent . Granted . 3 . For a break in rival soft-coal prices . Granted . 4 .

This prayer should have been directed against this subordinate 's principals , The N. Y. Central R. R. Co. 5 . For deportation to Sheol of annoying swarms of persons who apply daily for work , or for favors of one sort or another . Taken under advisement for later decision and compromise , this petition appearing to conflict with another one of same date , which will be cited further along . 6 . For application of some form of violent death to neighbor who threw brick at family cat , whilst the same was serenading . Reserved for consideration and compromise , because of conflict with a prayer of even date to be cited further along . 7 . To " damn the missionary cause . " Reserved also  --  as above . 8 .

For cyclone , to destroy the works and fill up the mine of the North Pennsylvania Co . NOTE : Cyclones are not kept in stock in the winter season . A reliable article of firedamp can be furnished upon application . Especial note is made of the above list , they being of particular moment . The 298 remaining supplications classifiable under the head of Special Providences , Schedule A , for week ending 19th , are granted in a body , except that 3 of the 32 cases requiring immediate death have been modified to incurable disease . This completes the week 's invoice of petitions known to this office under the technical designation of Secret Supplications of the Heart , and which for a reason which may suggest itself , always receive our first and especial attention . The remainder of the week 's invoice falls under the head of what we term Public Prayers , in which classification we place prayers uttered in Prayer Meeting , Sunday School Class Meeting , Family Worship , etc . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttering them . By rule of this office , Christians are divided into two grand classes , to wit : 1 , Professing Christians ; 2 , Professional Christians . These , in turn , are minutely subdivided and classified by size , species , and family ; and finally , standing is determined by carats , the minimum being 1 , the maximum 1,000 . As per balance-sheet for quarter ending Dec. 31 , 1847 , you stood classified as follows : Grand Classification , Professing Christian . Size , one-fourth of maximum . Species , Human-Spiritual . Family , A of the Elect , Division 16 . Standing , 322 carats fine . As per balance-sheet for quarter just ended  --  that is to say , forty years later  --  you stand classified as follows : Grand Classification , Professional Christian . Size , six one-hundredths of maximum . Species , Human-Animal . Family , W of the Elect , Division 1547 . Standing , 3 carats fine . I have the honor to call your attention to the fact that you seem to have deteriorated . 0 RESUME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that in order to encourage Christians of your grade and of approximate grades , it is the custom of this office to grant many things to them which would not be granted to Christians of a higher grade  --  partly because they would not be asked for : Prayer for weather mercifully tempered to the needs of the poor and the naked . Denied . This was a Prayer-Meeting Prayer . It conflicts with Item 1 of this report , which was a Secret Supplication of the Heart . By a rigid rule of this office , certain sorts of Public Prayers of Professional Christians are forbidden to take precedence of Secret Supplications of the Heart . Prayer for better times and plentier food " for the hard-handed son of toil whose patient and exhausting labors make comfortable the homes , and pleasant the ways , of the more fortunate , and entitle him to our vigilant and effective protection from the wrongs and injustices which grasping avarice would do him , and to the tenderest offices of our grateful hearts . " Prayer-Meeting Prayer . Refused . Conflicts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such as in any way obstruct our preferences may be generously blessed , both themselves and their families , we here calling our hearts to witness that in their worldly prosperity we are spiritually blessed , and our joys made perfect . " Prayer-Meeting Prayer . Refused . Conflicts with Secret Supplications of the Heart Nos. 3 and 4 . " Oh , let none fall heir to the pains of perdition through words or acts of ours . " Family Worship . Received fifteen minutes in advance of Secret Supplication of the Heart No. 5 , with which it distinctly conflicts . It is suggested that one or the other of these prayers be withdrawn , or both of them modified . " Be mercifully inclined toward all who would do us offense in our persons or our property . " Includes man who threw brick at cat . Family Prayer . Received some minutes in advance of No. 6 , Secret Supplications of the Heart . Modification suggested , to reconcile discrepancy . " Grant that the noble missionary cause , the most precious labor entrusted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or limit in all heathen lands that do as yet reproach us with their spiritual darkness . " Uninvited prayer shoved in at meeting of American Board . Received nearly half a day in advance of No. 7 , Secret Supplications of the Heart . This office takes no stock in missionaries , and is not connected in any way with the American Board . We should like to grant one of these prayers but can not grant both . It is suggested that the American Board one be withdrawn . This office desires for the twentieth time to call urgent attention to your remark appended to No. 8 . It is a chestnut . Of the 464 specifications contained in your Public Prayers for the week , and not previously noted in this report , we grant 2 , and deny the rest . To-wit : Granted , ( 1 ) , " that the clouds may continue to perform their office ; ( 2 ) , and the sun his . " It was the divine purpose anyhow ; it will gratify you to know that you have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were uttered in Sunday School . In this connection I must once more remind you that we grant no Sunday School Prayers of Professional Christians of the classification technically known in this office as the John Wanamaker grade . We merely enter them as " words , " and they count to his credit according to number uttered within certain limits of time ; 3,000 per quarter-minute required , or no score ; 4,200 in a possible 5,000 is a quite common Sunday School score among experts , and counts the same as two hymns and a bouquet furnished by young ladies in the assassin 's cell , execution-morning . Your remaining 401 details count for wind only . We bunch them and use them for head-winds in retarding the ships of improper people , but it takes so many of them to make an impression that we can not allow anything for their use . DESIRE to add a word of my own to this I report . When certain sorts of people do a sizable good deed , we credit them up a thousand-fold more for it than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the strain . You stand far away above your classification-record here , because of certain self-sacrifices of yours which greatly exceed what could have been expected of you . Years ago , when you were worth only $100,000 , and sent $2 to your impoverished cousin the widow when she appealed to you for help , there were many in heaven who were not able to believe it , and many more who believed that the money was counterfeit . Your character went up many degrees when it was shown that these suspicions were unfounded . A year or two later , when you sent the poor girl $4 in answer to another appeal , everybody believed it , and you were all the talk here for days together . Two years later you sent $6 , upon supplication ; when the widow 's youngest child died , and that act made perfect your good fame . Everybody in heaven said , " Have you heard about Andrew ? " ? for you are now affectionately called Andrew here . Your increasing donation , every two or three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm in all hearts . All heaven watches you Sundays , as you drive to church in your handsome carriage ; and when your hand retires from the contribution plate , the glad shout is heard even to the ruddy walls of remote Sheol , " Another nickel from Andrew ! " But the climax came a few days ago , when the widow wrote and said she could get a school in a far village to teach if she had $50 to get herself and her two surviving children over the long journey ; and you counted up last month 's clear profit from your three coal mines ? $22,230and added to it the certain profit for the current month $45,000 and a possible fifty  --  and then got down your pen and your check-book and mailed her fifteen whole dollars ! Ah , Heaven bless and keep you forever and ever , generous heart ! There was not a dry eye in the realms of bliss ; and amidst the hand-shakings , and embracings , and praisings , the decree was thundered forth from the shining mount , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angels , and be recorded by itself upon a page of its own , for that the strain of it upon you had been heavier and bitterer than the strain it costs ten thousand martyrs to yield up their lives at the fiery stake ; and all said , " What is the giving up of life , to a noble soul , or to ten thousand noble souls , compared with the giving up of fifteen dollars out of the greedy grip of the meanest white man that ever lived on the face of the earth ? " And it was a true word . And Abraham , weeping , shook out the contents of his bosom and pasted the eloquent label there , " RESERVED " ; and Peter , weeping , said , " He shall be received with a torchlight procession when he comes " ; and then all heaven boomed , and was glad you were going there . And so was hell . Signed TI-SE RECORDING ANGEL . Seal By command . The Letter of the Law I N KOREA , before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had two alternatives . She might go down to Chin Goki , where the dry-goods stores were , and buy a Japanese one . These kept off the rain but left something to be desired in the matter of appearance and smell , since they were made of bamboo and oiled paper . The other alternative cost more money , but it was much to be preferred . She brought out an American mail-order catalogue , studied it , and finally found an umbrella that she could afford . It was plain black , but it had a pretty handle . She wrote a check and sent in her order . Months passed . At last there was a notice in her mail : at the post office was a package . Would receiver please call for same ? She took the notice to the post office and went to the proper window . The Japanese clerk showed her a long , thin package . " How much duty is there ? " she asked . " No duty . " " Fine . I 'll just sign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " because it can not come . " " What do you mean , it ca n't come ? " " Too long , " he said . " It can not come . " " But that 's silly . It has come . Here it is . " " So sorry . Too long . It can not come . " " Look , " she said . " It 's here . May I please have it ? " He brought out a large book , and showed her the regulations . They were all there , neatly printed in both Japanese and English , the rules for size and weight of parcel post . Then he brought out a ruler and measured her umbrella to show her that it was several inches too long . That was all there was to it . It could n't come . " That is all very interesting , " she said . " But of course , now that it is here , you might as well give it to me . " She reached through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled it away from her . He stamped something on it and crossed out her address . When he put it back on a pile of packages , she turned and walked out . She stopped in at a store and bought a paper umbrella with a particularly oily smell . Two months later her check was returned , and that was the end of the matter .
