txt An agreement for the economic fusion of the British and American zones of occupation in Germany was signed last night by Foreign Secretary Bevin on behalf of the United Kingdom and Secretary of State Byrnes for the United States . The merger of the two zones of occupation in Germany is designed to make the resultant economic unit self-sufficient no later than the end of 1950 at an approximate cost of $1,000,000,000 , which will be shared equally by the United Kingdom and the United States . The agreement , the details of which have been negotiated in the past fortnight in Washington , was signed by the two Foreign Secretaries in one of the committee rooms on the thirty-seventh floor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel following the conclusion of last evening 's session of the Council of Foreign Ministers . Witnesses to Signing Among those who witnessed the signing were Lieut . Gen. Lucius D. Clay , Deputy American Military Governor in Germany ; his political advisor , Ambassador Robert Murphy and their British opposites , Lieut . Gen. Brian Robertson and Sir William Strang , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations . The decision to unite the British and American zones was made under that portion of the Potsdam Agreement that stated that : " During the period of the occupation Germany shall be treated as a single economic unit . " Russia and France were also included in the original invitation issued by Mr. Byrnes calling for an implementation of the Potsdam clause ; neither country has yet responded positively . The objective of the merger is to save the American and British people money , as General Clay recently explained . At present , the annual American deficit in the American zone of occupation in Germany , exclusive of costs for our army of occupation , is $200,000 , - 000 . If a merger were not effected , in the view of American experts , the annual deficit could be expect ed to continue in the vicinity of $200,000,000 for an indefinite peri od in the future . Cost Expected to Drop As the result of the new- agreement , American costs for 1947 will jump to $350,000,000 but will recede for 1948 and 1949 so that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1950 , the year in which the new German economic unit is expected to be self-sufficient , the total American investment will have been $500,000,000 , and the British will have contributed a comparable SUM . The British and American zones will continue to be politically independent . In the newly-created economic unit it is expected that in 1947 the deficit in the British portion will be approximately $480,000,000 while that in the United States zone will be $200,000,000 . In 1948 the British deficit is estimated at $240,000,000 , the American at $50,000,000 , while in 1949 the estimates are a deficit of $40,000,000 for the British and no deficit for the United States . In 1950 both zones are expected to be operating in the black . On the surface this appears that the British part of the economic unit will have a deficit of $760 , - 000,000 for the three-year period , and the American part a deficit of only $250,000,000 , although the total estimated deficit of $1,010,000 , - 000 is to be shared equally by both Governments . The British zone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much greater industrial population and ' potential than the American zone , whose population is 16 , - 000,000 , with a large agricultural potential . It is estimated , for example , that whereas the American zone will be able to export goods to the total of $100 ; 000,000 in 1947 , the British zone will be able to export to a total of $250,000,000 . Thereafter the British export potential is expected to jump in 1948 to $475 , - 000,000 and in 1949 to $625,000,000 while the estimated American figures advance slowly to $200,000 , - 000 in 1948 and $275,000,000 in 1949 . If , moreover , the two zones were not joined economically , the British , to get dollar credits with which to purchase food to feed the population in their zone , would have to sell coal and steel to the American zone , which is deficient in both , at very high prices . Under the present agreement , that will not occur . The food , it is believed , will be made available for purchase in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in anticipation of ratification of the agreement , for some time . The administrative machinery necessary to implement yesterday 's decision is virtually ready to begin operation . This morning at 9 o'clock , meanwhile , Mr. Byrnes will hold a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria .
