Hachiro Yuasa of Tokyo came to the U.S. when he was 18 , hoping to find " a land where one could lead a real Christian life . " He was not disappointed . For the 15 years of his U.S. career , he studied entomology , practiced Christianity , and learned to call the U.S. " the motherland of my dreams . " <P> The attack at Pearl Harbor found Hachiro Yuasa again on a visit to the U.S.-a thin , spidery little man of 51 who had become one of Japan 's top scholars and educators . But before anything else , Yuasa was still a Christian ; he decided to stay on in America in protest against the war . From 1942 to 1946 he worked as consultant for a New York interdenomination committee to help U.S. Japanese . " I am 100% Japanese , " Yuasa explained , " but I am a Christian Japanese ... I wish to be a symbol of the Church Universal . . . " <P> Dr. Yuasa 's wish has at last been amply realized ; he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . Long a dream of Christians on both sides of the Pacific , the I.C.U . will open in 1951 , specializing in graduate courses . To finance the university , Japanese businessmen have raised 150 million yen ( about half a million dollars ) ; next month , a $10 million fund-raising drive will be launched in the U.S. <P> Congregationalist Yuasa 's new Christian college can be counted on to absorb more of the U.S. than dollars . Last week , while he worked at his desk at Japan 's Doshisha University , which he now heads , Yuasa received a call from the U.S. Military Government asking the loan of some of his professors to give Japanese tax collectors a few pointers in bookkeeping . Said Hachiro Yuasa , smiling : " They realize that we ... know the American way of doing things . "
