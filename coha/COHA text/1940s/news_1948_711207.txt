txt Jamal el-Husseini , vice chairman of the Arab Higher Committee , served notice today that after the termination of the British Mandate on May 15 the Palestinian Arabs would establish an independent state unless the United Nations General Assembly meanwhile established a " temporary " trusteeship in conformity with Arab demands . Such , a trusteeship , Mr. el-Husseini told the Assembly 's Political and Security Committee , would merely fill the gap " during a short and a fixed period " following the termination of the mandate and would have " a single democratic state " as its goal . The Jewish Agency for Palestine has already announced that , irrespective of further action by the General Assembly , after the termination of the mandate it will establish . an independent state in the territory set aside for a Jewish state under the partition resolution . Mr. el-Husseini 's announcement , in the view of many delegates , lent an additional air of unreality to the long-winded debates in the United Nations . Dr. T. F. Tsiang , chairman of the Political and Security Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the General Assembly 's special session began ten days ago , and threatened the delegates with night sessions . Today 's all-day meeting of the committee was notable for two developments : ( 1 ) The committee , sitting as the General Assembly , approved a French-Swedish resolution asking the Trusteeship Council to study measures for the protection of Jerusalem and to report back urgently to the General Assembly . The vote was 46 to 0 , with the six members of the Soviet bloc and Costa Rica abstaining. ( 2 ) ? in Australian amendment , which would have referred this question to a subcommittee of the Politi I and Security Committee , brought about a test vote demonstrating that twenty of the fifty-eight members of the United Nations  --  well over tin one-third necessary to block the United States prk.posal for trusteeship as a substitute  --  continue to support partition . The United States and France were among the twenty-six countries voting against the lAustralian amendment , and there were seven abstentions in addition to absentees . These two developments conrfirmed many delegates in the opinion that somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem and its holy places , but that it was now powerless to alter the march of events in Palestine as a whole , even if it could reach a decision . Abdullah a Rey Factor Mr. el-Husseini 's statement , however , taken in conjunction with news agency reports about the intentions of King . Abdullah of Trans-Jordan , was the center of nterest among delegates . Throughout the session of the General Assembly last fall it was generally understood that if there was trouble between Jews and Arabs , 1King Abdullah would occupy the part of Palestine reserved for the Arab state and thus stabilize the situation . Bad feeling already exists between King Abdullah and Haj ' Amin el-Husseini , the exiled Grand Mufti and leader of the Arab ' Higher Committee , and also between King Abdullah and the rulers of other Arab states , in particular King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia . Therefore , it was argued last fall , such intervention by King Abdullah and his British-trained Arab Legion would keep down trouble . According to dispatches from Cairo and other Arab capitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intentions , but most delegates here accept the reports that he will now intervene , not merely to take over l the territory set aside for the pro-j posed Arab state , but to occupy all of Palestine . Such a development it is believed , would alter the military situation considerably , and might undo the capture of Haifa and other successes attained by Zionist forces1 over the past two weeks . It was supposed that Mr. el-Husseini 's threat regarding the establishment of an Arab state indicated that the other Arab rulers nad reached a firm understanding with King Abdullah despite the dynastic rivalries involved . No other Arab country possesses a comparable striking force . However , the British Government has given its pledge that King Abdullah 's ' Arab Legion , which it has been using to police Palestine , would be withdrawn with the termination of the mandate . Speculation centered , therefore , on what the British would do to restrain King Abdullah , and on what part Great Britain might yet play in efforts to establish an international force to keep order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the proposal regarding Jerusalem . As adopted by the committee , this was as follows : Tim FIRST ( POLITICAL AND SECURITY ) COMMITTEE Considering that the maintenance of order and security in Jerusalem is an urgent question which concerns the United Nations as a whole , RECOMMENDS the General As-sembly , To ask the Trusteeship Council to study with the mandatory power and the interested parties suitable measures for the protection of the city and its inhabitants , and to submit within the I shortest possible time proposals to the General Assembly to that effect . As originally Introduced by France , the resolution called on the Trusteeship Council to " take " instead of " study " meaures , but the milder language , proposed by Gun ' nar Hagglof , the Swedish representative , was accepted by the French representative , Alexandre Parodi , and was adopted . First , however , the committee rejected , 38 to 5 , with nine abstentions , a Czechoslovak-Polish amendment stating that the action taken regarding Jerusalem was pursuant to the partition resolution . This might have been interpreted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Enrique Rodrigues Fabregat , the Uruguayan representative , served notice in advance that he and other partition supporters would abstain . The amendment , which was called " mischievous " by Sir Mohammed Zafrullah Khan of Pakistan , a foe of partition , was supported only by the Soviet Union and other members of the Soviet bloc . After the committee approved the French-Swedish resolution , 38 to 5 , with nine abstentions , it adjourned and the fifty-eight members , without leaving their seats , immediately constituted themselves as the General Assembly . The only perceptible difference was that Dr. Jose Arce of Argentina , president of the Assembly , presided instead of Dr. Tsiang . The entire transition , which Sir Carl Berendsen , the New Zealand representative , said was pulling " a rabbit out of a hat , " consumed less than fifteen minutes . The committee then reconstituted itself as a committee and resumed the general or opening debate . This was still not concluded when the committee adjourned this afternoon , but will probably end tomorrow .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
