Since Wright Patman began his anti-chain-store crusade in 1935 , the stores have read little good news . But last week Utah gave them some . The citizens rared up and threw an anti-chain tax for a loss . By Utah 's constitution , a petition of 10% of the voters can set aside any law , make it subject to a Statewide referendum . To force suspension of their new chain-store tax , Utah voters used this right for the first time . <P> Credit for the coup d'etat went to the Utah Chain Stores Association , whose members operate about 400 of the State 's 6,400 stores . The tax was extreme , ranged from $50 to $5,000 a store , with the levy based on all stores owned by a chain , not just those in Utah . But the Legislature had passed it over farmer-labor protest , and the Governor signed it even after his own Attorney General had declared some parts unconstitutional . With these talking points and a sheaf of petition forms , notarized Association solicitors started a door-to-door trek April 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and last week 67,507 voters ( 27% of the 246,940 who took part in the last election ) had signed . The tax is suspended until the November 1942 election . <P> With one more victory to their credit , U.S. chain-store owners this week were loading the cannon for a fresh barrage against the 19 other States having such taxes .
