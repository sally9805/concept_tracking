The President did not kiss any babies , but that was about the only trick he missed last week . All of a sudden , as the spring wind warmed the first few crocuses , the White House stirred with old-fashioned domestic political activity . <P> Past the helmeted guards with fixed bayonets , past the uniformed police and the civilian-clothed Secret Servicemen , now thronged an unusual number of civilians , some of them concerned only indirectly with the war . In went three Girl Scouts for the President 's thanks for the 15,340,000 hours of service the Scouts had given since Pearl Harbor ( see cut ) ; in went Katharine Lenroot of the Children 's Bureau and twelve ' teenagers to watch the President sign a Child Health Day Proclamation ( May 1 ) ; in went Governor Charles Harwood of the Virgin Islands ; Postmaster General Frank Walker ; and New York Attorney Louis B. Wehle , longtime friend of the President . <P> On St. Patrick 's Day the President outdid himself in his annual curtsy to the Irish vote . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweed suit , green-striped tie and green carnation , a pot of green shamrocks and a green cat on his desk . <P> It was a full week . To Eleanor Roosevelt , winging down the coast of Brazil ( see p. 19 ) , he sent a message on their 39th wedding anniversary . Day before , Second Son Elliott had been sued for divorce by Wife Ruth Googins , mother of three ( see p. 86 ) . <P> One day the President woke up with a stiff neck . Same day the elevator that carries him downstairs broke down ; trapped , he spent the morning unable to greet John White , new U.S. Ambassador to Peru . Finally White went upstairs . <P> But the President 's two ' meetings with the press were not lively . Nobody brought up the subject of paper matches . Hearstling Bob Considine had written in a feature series that the President " wo n't permit three cigarets to be lighted on one match . " Next day WPB asked the U.S. to save paper , forget this superstition . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others . He issued a 121-word damnation of the German Army for using " the holy city of Rome as a military center , " declared that " we have tried scrupulously . . . to spare religious and cultural monuments , and we shall continue to do so . " Questioned about reports that he had reached an end of procrastinating over recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation , he announced that he had , indeed , drafted a new formula , but could not yet disclose it ( see p. 19 ) . He appealed to Finland to " disassociate herself from Germany , " - the day before Russia got Finland 's " no " to the Russian armistice terms . <P> The President also : <P> Put the Soldier Vote problem up to the 48 Governors . Congress had said that a Federal overseas ballot could be used only with each State 's permission , since State laws variously forbid or would interfere with such a ballot . Asked the President : Will your State approve a Federal ballot to supplement your own ? Replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably-nots or definite noes ; five don't-knows . These 42 replies in hand , the President mulled what he said was the main question : would the Congressional compromise give any more soldiers the vote than no new legislation at all ?
