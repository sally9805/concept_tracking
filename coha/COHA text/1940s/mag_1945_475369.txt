tressing winter spent there by the Continental Army brought forth no complaint on the score of sugar . Yet they had little or none . It seems that Washington 's contemporaries looked upon sugar not as a food but as a condiment , and one of which they were not sufficiently fond to deplore its absence . This apparently is borne out by the fact that the per capita consumption of sugar in the United States in 1791 was only seven and a half pounds a year . The consumption of sugar has risen steadily ever since , until in 1941 ? the last " normal " year before rationing ? it reached 114.1 pounds per capita . If syrup , candy , and corn and maple sugars are included , the ' figure is 129.6 pounds . It is a usual assumption that the increase of sugar in the diet has been paralleled by a decrease in the use of fats , and this is probably true . Still , it is possible that what has actually taken place is not so much a decrease in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain words used for fats , among them the terms fat , grease , and tallow . The same person who tells you he dislikes fat may add that he is very fond of butter , cream , and bacon . The man who tells you he dislikes beef fat may be fond of beef gravy and of suet pudding . In fact , many find that the expression " rendered beef suet " dues not have a disagreeable connotation but that " beef tallow " does ; yet the two expressions are synonymous . The word blubber , even though you have never tasted blubber , or spoken with anyone who has , will likely give you a feeling of revulsion . But on trial , particularly if you are one of those who would rather eat cream than butter with a spoon , you would prefer some blubbers to any butter . To me , the fresh blubber of the bowhead whale , and of the other whales with which I am familiar , is reminiscent of fresh cow 's cream , with a barely perceptible suggestion of walnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , when Dr. Elisha Kent Kane , famous polar explorer , discovered that seal and whale blubber tasted delicious he protested : " Oh , call it not blubber ! " He felt that the trouble was not with the thing itself but with the name . IN A study of food tastes it comes out that people like what they are used to . It may have been poverty , or a desire to set money aside for a rainy day , that has induced parents to feed their children so largely on bread , potatoes , porridge , cake , jam , syrup , and sugar ; ' but it is what many Americans have grown up on and they are the victims ? or the beneficiaries , if you prefer ? of established food habits according to which they like these cheap things because they are used to them . Not only that , there is a strong emotional bias in their favor as , in the popular opinion , the right food , good food , American food . According to the Associated Press , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1944 reached the usual conclusion which , however , they state in an unusual phrase . Instead of repeating the hackneyed " You like to eat what you are used to eating , " they say " People like what they eat rather than eat what they like . " While cheapness may create a liking for an article of food , through the establishment of a habit that derives from economy , there is also another and reverse tendency to favor a thing because it is costly , where you have the full application of Thorstein Veblen 's " Doctrine of Conspicuous Waste . " We all know people who serve strawberries in January more frequently than in May and June , even though it is common experience that berries imported from afar , as out-of-season luxuries , are seldom of as good flavor as the neighborhood product is when in season , Here the desire to show off triumphs over the combined motives of economy and flavor . Fat , a word now under a strong taboo complex of feelings , we do not eat if we can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat the things which we call fat . We do not eat tallow under the name of tallow ; but we love beef gravy which may be largely tallow . We trim the fat off our steaks and leave it behind on the plate , not wholly or mainly , as Veblen might have diagnosed it , in order to distinguish ourselves by conspicuous wastefulness ; rather we do it because this part of our steak comes under the taboo name of fat , for which reason we have avoided it from childhood , have scarcely ever tasted it , and are sure we do not like it . Meantime we compensate by eating a lot of fat under its agreeable names of cream , butter , bacon , gravy , shortening , and salad dressing . III TILL , in spite of all taboos , there is a 1 .. J widespread understanding that fat hunger is not only possible but normal . At one stage of the present war we were trying to talk ourselves into various beliefs about the weakness of Germany ; then it was frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which condition would help in bringing them to their knees . Later we heard about fat hunger in occupied countries , from Norway south , and not least in the Balkans and Greece . To this degree , at least , and in spite of the common belief that fat is more necessary in cold than in warm weather , we realize generally that fat is desirable whatever the climate . Except as tastes are controlled by propaganda and fashion , the longing for fat , summer or winter , depends on what else you eat . If yours is an exclusive meat diet , then you simply must have fat with your lean ; otherwise you would sicken and die . On a mixed diet , since fats , sugars , and starches are in most practical respects dietetically equivalent , you eat more of any one of them if you decrease the combined amount of the other two . Among hunting people , the chances of fat hunger increase as you go toward the Equator ; for the animals on which they depend get more and more skinny as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are only a few species that accumulate fat , chiefly the hippo and the eland . Quite naturally , therefore , we get from central Africa and northern Australia the most extreme stories of fat hunger . ( 1 ) NE of the most reliable and competent authorities on the tropics whom I have known personally is Sir Hubert Wilkins . When we were in the Arctic together , both living at times exclusively on meat , he gave me what remains my best single instance of how fats are crowded out . Sir Hubert 's father , the first white child born in South Australia , told that whenhe was young , around 1840 , the herdsmen , who were the majority of the population , lived almost exclusively on mutton ( sometimes on beef ) and tea . At all times of year they killed the fattest sheep for their own use ; and when in the open , which was frequently , they roasted the fattest parts against a fire with a dripping pan underneath , later dipping the meat into the drippings as they ate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastries increased , jams and jellies were imported or manufactured and , with the advance of starches and sugars , the use of fat mutton and fat beef decreased . Now , except that the Australians eat rather more meat than people do in the British Isles , the proportion of fat to the rest of the diet is probably about the same in Australia as elsewhere within the British Commonwealth of Nations We usually think of Sir Hubert as an Antarctic and Arctic explorer , which is right . But he is also distinguished for his tropical research through the two-year expedition he conducted for the British Museum in northern Australia , as told in his book Undiscovered Australia . Long before Wilkins , the Swedish explorer , Carl Lumholtz , was in tropical Australia . He reported at that time that the natives ate their meals on the principle children apply when they raid a cupboard ? they used up the best things first and did not eat anything but meat whenever they had enough meat ; and the fatter the meat the better . This Wilkins confirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the missionaries were having some trouble in breaking the natives of cannibalism , and that the difficulty was serious in proportion to the fatness of the deceased . When an emaciated man died , little was needed beyond a stern admonition ; but when a corpulent man was buried , they had to stand watch over the grave , and corpses sometimes disappeared weeks and months after burial . Seemingly the natives liked their cadavers about as high as the English like their game and the Norwegians their cheese , or at least did not mind their getting that way if they were fat enough . OTHER sidelight on tropical fat hunger comes from a medical missionary , Dr. G. W. Harley ; who has been in Liberia most of the time since 1926 , when he founded there the Ganta Mission of the Methodist Church , of which he is still superintendent . Dr. Harley wrote : " My own experience Fin the tropics for twenty years has been that of a person very active physically , consuming meat whenever available in amounts comparable to that eaten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a whole hog in tin cans for our personal use . . " On returning to the United States , I arrived during a heat wave , and hungrily devoured fat pork and country sausages in Washington , D. C. ? was disappointed when I could not get sausages with pancakes in Boston because it was ' too hot for sausages . ' . . . " Men who work in hot places ( stokers ) do not avoid meat and fats , rather the opposite . " Such are the views of a doctor of medicine with lung experience of the humid tropics . We turn from him to George Seybold , distinguished for success in the tropics as a business man rather than a scientist , who spent six years in the Philippines teaching school , more than a decade in Sumatra representing the U. S. Rubber Company , and then six years in Liberia for the Firestone interests . He came to believe , and to act on the belief , that much of the so-called enervating effect of a tropical climate is due to malnutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enervation " is traceable to faulty theories of diet which physicians and others bring with them ? particularly the theory that you should go light on meat in hot weather , and that if you do eat meat it should be lean . Mrs. Seybold believes in varying meals a good deal , but allows her husband considerable fat meat . When she is away from home he has only two meals a day , noon and evening . At both he eats pork chops two inches thick , with at least three quarters of an inch of fat all the way around the outer edge of each . During one absence of his wife 's , every meal he ate for six weeks consisted of these chops . In the United States Mr. Seybold has trouble getting food he likes at restaurants ? the pork chops they serve are not thick enough nor fat enough . Another believer in fat meats for tropical use is Earl Parker Hanson , who bases his view on four years as an engineer with a mining company in sub-tropical Chile , two years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnegie Institute , and several tropical years spent in Puerto Rico and elsewhere . It seems Hanson retained throughout his first six years in the tropics the usual North American beliefs about South American food , to the effect that the local people were pretty well all wrong and that New York and London knowledge of dietetics enables us to devise regimens better suited to the humid tropics than what the people of those tropics were eating , and liking to eat . When he was at last gradually converted from this view he also began to learn , through what eventually became a wide reading of tropical literature , that others before him had arrived at the same conclusions by similar steps ? but , of course , without influencing the prevailing dietetic theories of North America and Europe , which , in the main , are deduced from animal experimentation and from chemical facts , the matter of their applicability to humans being rather too easily taken for granted . There was , for instance , Henry Wallace Bates , friend and contemporary of Darwin , who spent about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin . In his book , A Naturalist on the River Amazon , one of the great classics of tropical exploration , he said : " I had found out by this time that animal food was as much a necessary of life in this exhausting climate as it is in the north of Europe . An attempt which I made to live on vegetable food was quite a failure . " IV HE RE was in Washington , in the spring of 1943 , a controversy within the Army as to whether pemmican , made from de-hydrated lean beef steak and rendered beef suet , should be used as a military ra-tion , or as an element in one . The chief argument against its use , except for the allegation that soldiers would not like it , was that , because of a high fat content ( SO per cent of calories from the suet , 20 per cent from the lean ) it was not an all-climate ration , but one useful only in cold weather , thus good only half the year in the temperate zone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Hanson was one of the resident tropical advisers of the Quartermaster General . From his own experience in the humid tropics , from the verbal reports of fellow explorers whom he met in the Explorers Club of New York and elsewhere , and from his reading of tropical literature , he was convinced that the high fat content of pemmican was no argument against its use in hot weather . He felt that if it was a good food in the Arctic it would be equally good in the tropics . So he decided to try it out through a part of the Washington summer , where the maximum temperatures of June , July , and August are demonstrably higher and , in Hanson 's opinion , more discomforting than , for instance , at Manaos on the Amazon . In his report , dated February 29 , 1944 , Hanson said : " My experience with pemmican grew out of the personal conviction that meat ? including the proper amount of fat ? is every bit as necessary for health and energy in the tropics as in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nutritionists ' arguments to the contrary . On the one hand they say that fat is the most efficient energy food known ; on the other they talk in doleful tones about the ' debilitating ' effects of the tropical climate . Why you should be careful to avoid energy-giving foods in a climate that supposedly saps your energy is beyond me . " My first personal experience with fat shortage came on my Orinoco-Amazon expedition of 1931-33 , when my canoe Indians practically went on strike because I had n't included sufficient lard or other fat in my supplies . Almost every newcomer to the Orinoco runs into that situation ; his Indians make sure , before starting a journey , that he has with him plenty of fats . " I bought enough fat to please my Indians , and then proceeded to eat on the journey from a separate pot , because Icould n't stand their greasy food . ' It was n't many weeks , however , before I avidly grabbed at every turtle egg I could get hold of ? for its rich oil as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avocado pear , and every other source of vegetable fat , when I could n't get animal fats . In those days I did not correlate that craving with my food tastes and habits ; now I do . If today I were to go on another extended journey through the Amazon basin I would either take pemmican with me from the United States or spend some time , first of all , making it down in Brazil . " Recently a lady ethnologist told me that I was all wrong in my claim that any healthy white man can stay in perfect health ( as far as food alone is concerned ) on any diet that keeps native populations and ' primitive ' peoples in health . She said she had tried it for a number of weeks in Mexico , with almost disastrous results . But when I asked her if she had n't had trouble adjusting her taste to the ' greasy ' food of the Mexicans , she stipulated that of course ' she and her companions , while eating ' exactly what the Mexicans ate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetizing way , by leaving out the grease ! Then she went on to describe her own subsequent troubles in the typical terms of fat shortage : constant hunger , a vague discomfort , lack of energy , distended stomach , etc . " During HansOn 's Washington test there were available three kinds of pemmican , differing only in their proportions of lean and fat , the A-type deriving 80 per cent of its calories from fat ; the B-type , 70 per cent ; the C-type , 60 per cent . Although Hanson at this stage was thoroughly convinced of the equal suitability of fat in hot and cold weathers he himself had never eaten a high fat diet at any season , his convictions on this point having developed after he left the Amazon-Orinoco region , when he was analyzing the results of his expedition . Accordingly he started the Washington tests on C-pemmican , living exclusively on that , with sugarless tea , hot or iced . On this ration he soon noticed a discomfort , a sort of unsatisfied longing , which he thought might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for when he shifted to the A-type pemmican , with its 20 per cent higher fat content , the discomfort vanished . Pemmican , as invented by the North American Indians of the plains and used in the fur trade of the midwestern parts of the United States and Canada , was made of uncooked , sun-dried lean , which was powdered and mixed with rendered suet . But the lean element of Hanson 's pemmican was beef which had been cooked before it was dried . It seems clear , from the records of the fur trade , that scurvy did not occur with pemmican made from sun-dried meat , but it appeared likely this trouble would develop with the cooked pemmican ; so Hanson used Vitamin C pills as the only addition . o the exclusive regimen of pemmican and sugarless tea . 1-HANSON reports that during the first five days on exclusive pemmican he had not merely the typical discomforts due to lack of fat , but other slight discomforts as well . He was used to bulky meals and was now living on food so condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters of a pound and would no more than fill an ordinary water tumbler . There was a hollow feeling which he appeased by drinking large quantities of water . On about the fifth day his stomach became reconciled to the lessened bulk , and the excessive drinking was cut down to what seemed less than it would have been with an ordinary mixed diet . There was also a bit of psychological trouble . Hanson was surrounded by dietitians who explained to him ( in part on the basis of a statement issued by the National Research Council ) that it was inadvisable to attempt getting more than 35 per cent of one 's calories from fat , and that health could not be maintained above a certain limit , which was variously stated at 40 , 50 , and 60 per cent from fat . Since he was deriving 80 per cent of his energy units from fat it seemed he was bound for trouble . He may have been sort of hypnotized into a fear that the dietitians might be right . However , he got over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hanson enjoyed his all-pemmican diet and remained at a high level of physical and mental fitness to the end of the seventhweek . It then seemed to him that no scientific advantage would be gained by continuing the regimen longer . From this experience , Hanson was strengthened in the belief that the so-called tropical enervation , which has been blamed by Europeans commonly upon the equatorial weather , is largely the result of faulty nutrition , caused by subservience to the current doctrine that in hot weather we should eat little meat and that what little we do eat should be lean . So when he was chosen in 1944 by the Foreign Economic Administration to head a mission for a two-year stay in Liberia he took with him supplies of pemmican , for the use of his family and for introduction to the whites and natives of those tropics . A DMIRAL Sir Leopold McClintock , the famous British polar explorer , was called before an inquiry into the poor health conditions on an expedition which had been commanded by Sir George Nares . In his testimony he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed excellent health , he had made it a practice to pay no attention to the prohibitions of a dietetic theory , which happened to be in vogue among the doctors in a given year , if he knew that the food condemned by the theory had been found wholesome and in other ways desirable by large numbers of people through long periods . He considered it wisdom to prefer experience to theory whenever the two were in conflict . We might , perhaps , in giving our adherence to the McClintock rule , suggest a corollary . It is that when a precept of the dietitians ? like the one against fat in warm weather is in conflict with the tastes and practices of many people in many countries through many centuries , then it is likely the dietitians themselves will eventually learn , through animal experimentation or by deduction from chemical fact , that the opposite of their precept is true . So we may reasonably expect , within not too many years , that the dietitians will announce they have discovered Jehovah was right for Palestine , Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the humid tropics , in liking meat in those climates and in liking it fat .
