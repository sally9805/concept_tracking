THE DEVIL IN FRANCE-Lion Feuchtwanger-Viking ( $2.75 ) . <P> SCUM OF THE EARTH-Arthur Koestler - Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> These are two records of personal suffering written by two anti-Nazi-intellectuals caught in France by the war . Feucht-wanger-author of Power , The Ugly Duchess and other notable novels-was a peace-loving , contemplative Jew of 57 . Except for the stench of Naziism in his nostrils , he had no interest in politics , little sense of events to come . <P> <P> " Nine years ago , " he writes , " I was sitting in my house in the Grunewald in Berlin . I had my books around me . . . . I was content . I had not the remotest idea of ever moving from that house . Six years ago I was sitting in my tranquil , white-stuccoed house in Sanary , in the south of France . I had my books around me . ... I was content . I had not the remotest idea of ever moving from that house . " <P> In August 1939 , Koestler was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant novel about the Russian blood purges , Darkness at Noon . He had never loved France quite so much as then , never been so " achingly conscious of its sweetness and decay . " He was a young ( 36 ) , Budapest-born journalist , a Gentile , a man of political action . He had been a trenchantly pro-Loyalist newspaper correspondent in Spain , where Franco forces had caught him and led him through the streets of Malaga in chains . He had been a member of the Communist party for seven years , had left it in disgust 18 months before the Stalin-Hitler pact . <P> Jittery France put both Feuchtwanger and Koestler in internment camps . The difference of their treatment is epitomized in the two books ' titles . Feuchtwanger 's " devil in France " was the crass indifference , apathy , venality , incompetence of French officialdom . His camp guards were friendly , often respectful-and always bored . The bulk of his fellow internees were " nonpolitical " or nearly so : Jewish scholars , doctors , lawyers , artisans , tradesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plebiscite , fleeing into France when they lost ; ex-members of the Foreign Legion , a few of whom had lost an arm or leg in France 's service . <P> Koestler found himself behind the barbed wire with Croat peasant partisans , Spanish syndicalists , Czech liberals , Italian socialists , Hungarian and Polish Communists , German undergrounders , Russians of various political shades whose only common denominator was that they hated Stalin and denounced one another to the French Surete Nationale . All these were " the scum of the earth . " Nearly all " bore the physical or mental marks of torture and persecution in the countries from which they had escaped , and for a more enlightened French administration these marks should have been regarded as the stamp of their bona fides and loyalty . " But they were indesirables , a polite word for scum , and in their prison camps they were worse-fed , worse-housed , worse-treated than France 's enemies , the interned German nationals . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
