When Harold Stassen popped the censorship question to Joseph Stalin ( see INTERNATIONAL ) , he was just trying to be helpful . But last week it appeared that Stassen had unintentionally struck a blow at freedom , not for it . As they passed out of the Russian orbit , U.S. and British newsmen returning from the Moscow Conference began cabling " now it can be told " dispatches . One thing several wanted to tell about was what happened after the Stalin-Stassen chat . <P> Until then , the censorship holiday on conference news had gone fairly smoothly . But when the censors read about the interview in cables ( it was not reported in the Soviet press ) , they began bearing down . Many dispatches were delayed ; some were rejected outright . " The one fact they the censors saw in stories of the Stassen interview , " cabled Carlyle Holt of the Boston Globe , " was that Stalin approved censorship . " <P> Apparently , said one correspondent , the Russians ' first experience with large-scale , uncensored coverage of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as pleasurably as a swift kick in the groin . " And though the people who irritated them most have departed , I 'm sure they still hurt all over , and this soreness is n't helped any by the generally fruitless atmosphere in which the conference closed . As a result , the correspondents who stayed behind in Moscow probably face an indeterminate period of aggravated suspicion , noncooperation and stupidly rigorous censorship -a tougher censorship than before .
