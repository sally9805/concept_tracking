Good news for the millions of U.S. sufferers from stomach ulcers was reported to the American Medical Association last week . The best way to treat severe ulcers , according to Manhattan 's famed gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein , is to drip warm milk into a patient 's stomach every minute of the day &; night . A conclusive report on this continuous drip treatment , used with great success on hundreds of Mt . Sinai Hospital patients , was finally presented last week after ten years of experiment , by Dr. Winkelstein and his colleagues , Dr. Albert Cornell , Physiologist Franklin Hollander . <P> Chief cause of ulcers is excess production of hydrochloric acid , which erodes the lining of the stomach . ( This abnormal flow of acid is usually produced by constant worrying , emotional upsets . ) Standard medical treatment for ulcers consists of many small meals of bland , semiliquid foods based on milk &; cream . Thus the stomach , frequently filled , has small chance to consume itself , and the ulcer , like other sores , gradually heals . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough . Between meals the acid continues its destructive work , especially at night , time of greatest acid flow in ulcer patients . <P> To keep restless stomachs constantly occupied , Dr. Winkelstein rigs up a quart-sized can high over each patient 's bed , fills it with lukewarm milk to which a level teaspoon of soda has been added . One end of a long , latex tube attached to the bottom of the can is swallowed by the patient . The tube , which is very soft , and scarcely larger than macaroni , is easy to swallow , does not keep the patient from sleeping , can even be used in the day time while he sits in a chair . The milk drips into his stomach constantly , its flow controlled by a screw valve . <P> Patients with severe ulcers , said Dr. Winkelstein , must stay in bed for at least three weeks , are given no food , only constant drip treatment of three quarts of milk daily . Those who can not tolerate milk are given a mild solution of aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal , patients can have three good-sized bland meals a day , must use the drip for an hour after each meal , continue it until an hour before the next . They must keep the drip tube in their stomachs all night for many months . <P> Many of Dr. Winkelstein 's patients were old men with severe ulcers of ten to 35 years ' standing . Their excruciating night pains were relieved , and their ulcers disappeared , " rapidly and often completely . " Great practical importance of the treatment is that it is cheap . Anybody can use it at home with an ordinary enema can for a container , a coat rack for a prop .
