The word went round that Governor Tom Dewey , the glistening dark horse who pretends to be invisible , would make a " significant " political speech . His own assistants passed the word . ( This was a change in Dewey technique ; hitherto newsmen have been cautioned before each Dewey utterance : do n't try to find any significance ; the Governor is merely tending to his state knitting . ) For his venture into significance , Tom Dewey chose as a date his 42nd birthday ; as the place , the ninth annual prize exhibit of New York news photographers . <P> Said the Governor : " There have been increasing signs . . . that our newspapers are being denied the right to print all the news . Important matters have repeatedly been withheld for months . . . the shooting down of 23 transport planes . . . what really happened in Teheran . . . the disquieting evidence of United Nations disunity . . . . One such incident might be charged to blunder ; two such incidents begin to lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war with blinders on their eyes . " <P> What Dewey said was perhaps worth saying , although nearly everybody else in the U.S. had said it before him . What was its " significance " ? Best guess : Dewey was thinking of next week 's crucial Wisconsin Presidential primary . Wendell Willkie was on the scene , hard at work ; perhaps Tom Dewey thought he needed to remind Wisconsin that if you looked hard for a candidate , he was n't really invisible .
