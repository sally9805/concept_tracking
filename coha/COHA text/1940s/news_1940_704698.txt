txt Two private code messages received here yesterday from business men in Switzerland stated that the scheduled sailings of the liner Rex from Genoa next Tuesday and Naples the following day had been delayed . The liner , flagship of the Italian Line fleet and the largest and fastest merchant vessel in the Italian merchant marine , was scheduled to dock in New York on May 9 after a call at Gibraltar ' on May 3 . The Italian Line office here declared that the reports from Switzerland were untrue , that the Rex would leave the Mediterranean as scheduled , and that no word to the contrary had been received here . It was said also that the Conte di Savoia would sail on time from New York , at noon today . " You can attribute that to the usual bunk , " said Italo E. Verrando , director of the Italian Line here , in regard to the reported delaying of the Rex . " The Rex will leave Italy as scheduled in our sailing list . " If there were any such move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was not sailing . " One of the messages received here by independent business interests was to the effect that a shipment of gold consigned to a New York banker could not be expected to arrive here on time since the Rex , for which it had been booked , would not sail . Unusual activity on the Staten Island waterfront near the berth of the French liner Ile de France at Pier 10 indicated yesterday that the 43,450-ton liner would depart today or tomorrow with oil tanks filled to capacity and her holds full of cargo . ' Workmen on the pier and others who boarded the vessel in the course of waterfront duties declared the big liner would carry Jut one of the largest cargoes shipped from the port in months , and that with merchandise stowed in the passengerless cabins and even the corridors the liner would have some 12 , - 000 tons on board . A few thousand tons would be her normal capacity . Observers on the bulkhead between the piers during the day saw four huge barges moored alongside at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the liner 's big cargo booms cradles were being swung down unceasingly all day to lift the copper in bundles into the holds . This was on the off-pier side , south of the ship . On the pier side booms were swinging up twenty and thirtyfoot lengths of steel and steel piping and tubing . Provisioners ' wagons called at the pier all day and it was reported last night that more steel and copper would be brought alongside this morning . The painting of the vessel was completed except for a few minor places here and there ; ship 's seamen could be seen painting gray over the promenade windows , and the starboard lifeboats were all lowered during the day while the gear was touched up and the boat equipment checked . It was said the liner had 325 seamen on board , although where they came from could not be ascertained , since the only known French crew in port , apart from the skeleton crew on the Ile during the Winter , are the stand-by seamen on the Normandie at West Forty-eighth Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Allied merchant ships . Captain Albert Fontaine has been in command of the Ile de France since she was laid up here , and it was believed he was still on board and would take her out on her first mysterious war mission , in which she will follow the Queen Mary and Mauretania by about one month . The Queen Mary , which left here at 8:20 A. M. on March 21 , was reported to have been seen at Cape Town , South Africa , on April 3 , according to passengers and several officers of the New York-Java liner Poelau Teilo , which docked in Brooklyn yesterday . Captain Hendrick Schol , master of the vessel , said he did not know what ship it was , that it was big and painted gray . Cornelius Fischer , third officer , said he was certain the ship he saw was the Queen Mary . " We arrvied in Cape Town at 10:30 on the evening of April 2 and the Queen Mary came in at 7 o'clock the next morning , " he said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo boats were patrolling back and forth about a mile and a half off shore from the Queen Mary and tenders alongside appeared to be refueling the ship . " Others , including some of the eighteen passengers , told the same story , and Captain Schol admitted that , whatever ship it was , it was being guarded by three British destroyers .
