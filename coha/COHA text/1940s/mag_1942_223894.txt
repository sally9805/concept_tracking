Out of a dusty file in the Kremlin , Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Mikailovich Molotov last week fished a nine-month-old document . It was a note from nine Governments in Exile telling him about Nazi atrocities in Occupied Europe ( no news ) and Comrade Molotov had not bothered to answer it . But Comrade Molotov 's chief , Joseph Stalin , had a special reason for wanting it answered now . <P> The British Lord Chancellor ( Lawyer John Simon ) and the U.S. President ( Lawyer Franklin Roosevelt ) had just announced that they were going to set up a United Nations Court of Justice to try all criminals-of-war-after the war . Molotov 's answer ( addressed , not to Britain and the U.S. , but to the nine little Governments in Exile ) : Why not set up the court at once ? To his Molotov cocktail the Foreign Commissar added a Stalin stinger : And why not begin by trying , and hanging , Nazi Arch-Criminal Rudolf Hess ? <P> The British Foreign Office was in a tizzy . Well it knew that , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva Convention to treat their prisoners according to certain rules , Russia 's nonadherence to the Convention leaves both Germany and Russia free to treat Russian and German prisoners as brutally as they please . If Britain were to execute Hess , Germany would probably denounce the Convention , would certainly kill hundreds of British prisoners in reprisal . <P> The Foreign Office hastily revised the status of Prisoner Hess from that of prisoner of state to that of prisoner of war . As such , Hess was safe from trial except for crimes committed as a prisoner . <P> To London and Washington , however , it looked as if Comrade Stalin were doing more than having a little grim fun with his allies and trying to toughen up the war. * Stalin , they suspected , had not forgotten that Hess went to Britain to seek an ally against Bolshevism . Perhaps Stalin , brooding over the shortcomings of his allies ( TIME , Oct. 12 ) , feared that Hess might be exerting some influence in Britain . <P> Well-founded were these suspicions . This week the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It must be finally established who Hess is now-a criminal subject to trial and punishment , or a plenipotentiary representative in England of the Hitler Government who enjoys inviolability . " <P> * Said Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox this week : " The war has descended to the lowest levels of barbarism . A few days ago a marine at Guadalcanal sought to succor a wounded Japanese , only to be killed by the man he tried to help . Navy pilots , bailing out , have been machine-gunned by the enemy on the way down . Next day , Japanese military spokesmen said captured American airmen , who had allegedly taken part in the April 18 raid on Japan , would be " severely punished in accordance with international law for inhuman acts .
