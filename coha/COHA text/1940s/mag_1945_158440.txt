" What 's wrong with that silly little mind of yours ? Eh ? What are you worry ing about ? V-bombs ? Fish queues ? In come tax ? Your health ? " <P> War-weary Britons last fortnight read these piquant queries in their favorite column-Nat Gubbins ' " Sitting on the Fence " ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) - and settled down to learn what " Dr. N. Gubbins , the notorious Fleet Street quack , " had to say on the subject of psychoneurosis : <P> " A man once told me that he shrank from meeting people 's eyes and asked me why . I told him he was probably a crook . <P> " On another occasion a man whom I hated on sight told me he imagined he was disliked by everybody . Instead of asking him whether he was unpopular at school or whether his mother loved him or not , I said : ' It 's not imagination at all . You are disliked by everybody . . . . ' <P> " To the man who said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite right . They often bite people . ' To the woman who said she was frightened of wasps , I said : ' Who is n't ? They sting people . ' <P> " And to a young unmarried man who said he was frightened of women , I said : ' That 's nothing to worry about . Go on being frightened and leave them alone . ' <P> " If you are frightened of open spaces , keep away from commons . If you fear enclosed spaces , keep out of prison . It 's as simple as that . . . . <P> " Do n't hesitate to write to me , what ever your troubles . I shall probably throw your letters away unread , but you will have had all the fun of writing them , which is part of the cure . You will get the whole thing out of your system . And I shall have so much fun tearing them up that I shall probably feel better , too . In this way we shall all save our reason and between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrors of peace .
