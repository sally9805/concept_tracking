txt As retail meat prices continued high yesterday , with little promise of any marked reductions in the next six to eight months , sharp differences over renewing rationing and price controls arose in the industry . Meanwhile , milk price advances of 1 cent a quart , scheduled here for Aug. 1 , and a similar increase on Oct. 1 , received official sanction of tire Department of Agriculture in Washington . Only the American Meat Institute held forth the hope that a seasonal increase in meat production by fall and winter " should tend to modify prices in some degree , unless offset by further increased consumer income . " Joining with the institute in opposing controls was the New York State Association of Retail Meat Dealers . Favcrring controls , with a ceiling price on livestock at the source , was the National Industry Meat Council , representing 25,000 ' shops in eight Eastern states . In a complete reversal of its 1946 stand , the New York Retail Appetizers Assor , ciation , representing 250 grocery and delicatessen shops , requested President Truman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers here will advance as the result of the minimum fluid milk prices established for the New York area by the Department of Agriculture . The alternate formulae for minimum prices set by the department were identical with those recommended on July 6 , the department specifying as follows : " Minimum prices , per hundredweight for milk of 3.5 per cent butterfat content are : ( 1 ) $5.68 for August and September , and $6.12 for October through December ; or ( 2 ) a New York price for the August-December , 1948 period comparable to that established under the Boston Federal milk order for Class 1 ' milk ' of 3.7 per cent butterfat content . The higher of the alternate minimums will be the effective price . " Department officials said that in the interval between the July 6 recommendation of this formula and its establishment , the Boston milk order went into effect , and the price of milk in Boston pulled the New York price up to $5.90 instead of the $5.68 specified in alternate ( 1 ) . Had the first price prevailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart , and the producers might have absorbed it . But equalizing with the Boston milkshed would make the price about a cent a quart more , which is expected to be passed along to consumers . In an apparent show of resistance to the expected increase in milk prices to a record high , more than 500 retail stores here continued to sell milk below the standard price of 23 cents a quart , according to Commissioner of Investigation John M. Murtagh . His survey showed that some Brooklyn stores had reduced the price to 18 cents a quart . The Commissioner said the number of retailers who had reduced prices had increased steadly since he promised to protect their sources of supply . Evidence of the upward trend in meat prices appeared in the wholesale market yesterday , where spring lamb was reported up $1 to $2 a hundredweight , but there was no general advance . Mrs. Frances F. Gannon , director of the market department 's consumers ' service , said that since price controls were lifted two years ago , fruits . and vegetables had advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , poultry 18 per cent , but beef prices approximately 45 per cent . The meat institute , in a statement from Chicago , attacked rationing and price controls as " artificial interferences with basic laws of economics , " and called - increased production ' a solution - of the situation . It made no definite forecast on meat prices , noting that " anything can happen . " A United Press story from Chicago reported livestock receipts were off considerably from a week ago and hog prices higher . Cattle receipts - were down 20,000 and hogs also 20,000 . Hogs generally were steady to 50 cents a hundredweight higher at major cornbelt markets . Samuel Morganroth , counsel- to the state association , declared ; it . was " extremely unlikely " that the National Association of Retail Meat Dealers , slated to meet . in Chicago next month , would suppbrt President Truman 's rationing and control proposals . To institute such a program , he said , would take - six to eight months . With an expected bumper gem crop and an improved world food situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These indications , he added , . and ' " our not happy " experience with Government controls , made it unlikely that the group would favor controls . Jack Kranis , president of the Meat Industry Council , differed with Mr. Morganroth . " We need rationing and price control now more than ever before , " he asserted , " because the way prices are going is murder , and they promise to go higher . " Prices now for the consumer , he added , were 30 per cent " worse than they were in the worst black market . "
