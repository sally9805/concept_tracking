Would any Senator willingly arouse G.I. ire ? Obviously not . Yet the New York Times last week headlined : SENATORS IN ITALY STIR ARMY ANGER . <P> The Senators were Montana 's Burton K. Wheeler and New Jersey 's Albert W. Hawkes , ex-industrialist and onetime president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . In Rome , they had attended a forum with 250 soldiers at a Red Cross club . It was a stormy session . <P> First break came when an enlisted man asked Senator Hawkes why Italy is not getting more aid from the U.S. When Hawkes inquired , " How would you help Italy ? " , the G.I. retorted : " We are paying you to be a Senator to answer such questions ! " A staff sergeant complained that while the U.S. had won the decision in Italy , Communism was now winning Italian hearts . <P> This brought a sizzling question from a corporal . He asked whether it would be " better to dodge the issue with Russia or fight it out right now . " Aroused on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an anti-Russian speech . A twice-wounded combat sergeant jumped to his feet and said : " I 've been led to believe Americans and Russians have been working and fighting together . Where does your line come from ? Why has the discussion taken such a trend ? " <P> The G.I.s , 90% of them combat men , finally gave the Senators a message for home : " For heaven 's sake tell them to stop proposing new payments and bonuses to soldiers . Tell them we would be willing to pay them to get out of the Army . " <P> Later , Burt Wheeler , sour on the whole performance , said of the heckling G.I.s : " A couple of Commies . " Said G.I.s of the touring Senators : " They 're bums. "
