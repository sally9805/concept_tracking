In peacetime about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls . During and just after wars the ratio mysteriously increases to about 108 boys for every 100 girls . For the first time in World War II , this phenomenon has appeared in several warring nations of Europe , according to reports from Sweden last fortnight . <P> Many doctors and scientists dismiss the phenomenon as mere illusion and folklore-perhaps because they can not explain it . But Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. statisticians call the changing ratio " an established fact . " It did not occur in the Franco-Prussian War , which lasted only a few months . Nor did it occur in the U.S. in World War I , when only 4% of the population was under arms and only for a short period . But , say the Metropolitan 's statisticians , it was the experience of all the principal European countries in World War I. <P> Explanations are various and tentative . For example : <P> &gt; Poorly nourished women , it is suggested , may give birth to a greater proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Metropolitan , " has failed to discover any such effect in connection with the terrible periodic famines in India . " <P> &gt; It is a fact that first babies are more likely to be boys . Just after a war there is an unusual increase in marriages and births , mostly among young adults . Hence a rising ratio of male babies is inevitable . <P> &gt; About 115 to 120 boys are conceived for every 100 girls , but normally about 50% more male embryos are lost in miscarriages than female . Fewer children are born in wartime , * especially-suggests Biologist Gunner Dahlberg of Sweden 's great Upsala University-to hard-working women , who are most likely to suffer miscarriages . This displacement is enough , he believes , to affect the boy-girl ratio . <P> &gt;Another explanation was offered by Theologian Johann Sssmilch , who observed the phenomenon in 18th-Century Europe . Divine Providence , he said , brings more boy babies into the world to compensate for the slaughter of men in battle . <P> <P> - Though the U.S. birth rate is now booming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army sends men overseas .
