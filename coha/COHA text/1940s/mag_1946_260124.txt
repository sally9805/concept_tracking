Gypsy Lady ( music by Victor Herbert ; book by Henry Myers ; produced by Edwin Lester ) has turn-of-the-century music and a brand-new book , and it 's hard to say which seems older . There is no question which seems pleasanter : the tunes borrowed from Victor Herbert 's The Fortune Teller and The Serenade are melodious and nicely sung . But they are not quite pleasant enough to offset the damp-towel libretto or save an evening . <P> The libretto is itself a gypsy , decked out in every tarnished bit of satin and velvet in the operetta ragbag-Romany life , dukes , marquises , matinee idols , ballet dancers , imposture , revenge-and Paree . None of this has either a true romantic glow or a sly satiric glitter . The gypsy heroine who aches to be a lady ( Helena Bliss ) soon has all the more eligible tenors in the cast at her feet-but returns in the end to Sandor , her rough gypsy mate . For though Sandor may lack pelf and polish , he has the sock tune in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Song .
