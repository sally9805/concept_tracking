THE hum of the plane motor and the hated clamor of the alarm bell came together . A scrambling rush , and we manned our ship 's guns , straining our eyes into the midday Arctic dawn . We were dead beat . The last shell from the pocket battleship that had raided the convoy had smashed our steering gear ; it had taken hours of killing work to rig emergency tackle so that we could limp on alone toward Murmansk . We expected to get bumped at any second . Planes , submarines , and torpedo boats had been pientiful on this run ; we 'd be damned lucky if we ever saw Russia . The humming grew louder above the clouds and we tensed , waiting . Then there came a yell from the bow lookout , and there was the plane -- and we could n't believe our eyes . We just gaped at the big red star on the fuselage and felt the tension drain off down through our legs . Thank God ! Joyfully we returned the pilot 's wave . He circled us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course and soon we saw high snow-covered mountains ahead and a Russian gunboat . We grinned and laughed at one another as we slowly steamed down the narrow Kola inlet toward Murmansk . Tired and red-eyed , but thankful , we stood on deck , looking at the bleak frozen country on either side . All we wanted nowwas to get our clothes off and take a bath . The inlet widened out into a fair-sized bay and there was the town of Murmansk built in a semicircle on the sloping hills above the small docks . As we moved on in to our anchorage we passed the rest of the convoy that had gone on without us , and their crews lined the rails waving and shouting . They were as glad to see us as we were to see them ? almost . They knew what it meant to be alone , drifting and helpless , within range of German sub and plane bases . Our first impression of Murmansk was a familiar one . From where we lay we could see that this was the same old story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; gaping roofs and crazy-angled walls of smashed warehouses on the damaged docks ; gaunt , blackened remains of houses . Slim , the tall Scotch-Canadian messman , came along the deck and took a light from my cigarette . He eyed the town glumly . " They 've took a beating here . " I nodded and he went on , " Just up taikin ' to the pilot . Says to watch our step . We 're only forty mile from the front line , an ' Jerry 's got an air base eight minutes away . Thcy pull a lot o ' sneak raids in daylight stumbled through the snow up the hill toward the town . What a mess ! The bombs had spared nothing ; there was not one building that had not been damaged by either a direct hit , a blast , or incendiaries . Among the ruins people still lived , crowded into whatever rooms were not completely unusable . Some houses were gutted by fire , unlivable ; many were opened by bombs in shabby intimacy to the street . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for on each side were deep craters filled with rubble , remains of houses that must have been very hard to build in a town so far from the centers of industry . Groups of old men and women and young children were stolidly at work clearing debris from battered buildings , sawing wood , and one group was repairing the entrance to an air-raid shelter . Their faces were blank and expressionless ; they rarely talked or smiled , just kept working . Both men and women wore the same clothes ? fur coat and hat , trousers , and thick felt boots . Farther along was a large brick building , only partially bombed , and through the heavy wooden doors a line of people ? mostly women ? were slowly passing . Each carried a string shopping hag inside which were three circular cans that fitted atop one another . These were food kits . Inside I could see a long table behind which women were dishing out some sort of dark soup , and at the end of the table was a stack of black bread cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was very little talking , no comment ; they just took the meager fare and left . There was no air of hopelessness about it all , just a stolid acceptance . To-day there was food , but I learned that such was not always the case . III HE only two places to go to in Mur- mansk are the Arctic Hotel and the International Club . The hotel , which has been hit several times , is a newish addition to the town and has about sixty rooms , a dining room , a lounge , and a barber shop run by women . It is the only place in Murmansk where you can get a haircut . Here congregate the mixed crowd that are in Murmansk to-day ? English sailorsfrom the convoy escorts , R.A.F. fliers , Red Army soldiers and Russian sailors , and of course merchant seamen from all the Allied Nations , speaking a dozen different tongues . We met Frenchmen , Belgians , English , Americans , Chinese . Everywhere there was a picture of Stalin or Lenin or a Red Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smash the Fascist dogs ! Down with Hitler ! " Russia never lets you forget who it is you 're fighting . Although food was rationed at the hotel we could not complain . They gave us preference as much as they possibly could , even to the extent of chocolate . This surprised us , for candy is like gold to-day in any part of Europe . The children would stop us outside , offer an incendiary bomb as a souvenir , and pipe hopefully , " Shocolad , Tovarich ? " It was breaking the law , but we would save it for them . Also our cigarettes were in great demand ; the Russians smoke one of the worst-smelling tobaccos that I 've ever encountered , and it is hard to get even that , for their Ukrainian crops were destroyed last summer ; so it was common to be asked for " papyros tabac . " The International Club has the same mixed crowd , but the townspeople do not go there much ; they leave it for the visitors . The club is well stocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moving pictures are shown there . Most of these are propaganda films ? action stories of the Red Army or Navy ? or else pictures of Russian historical subjects , but there are occasional American movies , and I saw " A Hundred Men and a Girl , " featuring Deanna Durbin , whom some Russian sailors loudly cheered whenever she sang . The young Russian girls who came to the club to talk and dance with the merchant sailors were friendly and danced well , but to the boys ' dismay , that was all . Contrary to a lot of reports that we had gleefully heard , promiscuity is frowned on in the Soviet Union . This did not discourage the boys too much though , and I was amused to hear a voice with a strong Southern accent cut through a babble of talk with : " Why , honey , y 're the cutest gal Ah ever did see . " Standing in front of a huge wall map showing the position of the Red Army around Stalingrad , I talked with Nickolai . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke excellent English , as did so many of the younger Russians . He was an engineer on a Russian ship that had been torpedoed in the Barents Sea , and was staying at the club until he found another berth . He asked me if I had seen the town , and offered to show it to me . We walked the length of the Stalin Prospekt , which is the main street . Before the war it must have been a handsome thoroughfare , with its five- and six-storey apartment houses . I was particularly struck by the modern appearance of what unsinashed buildings there were ; they contrasted so strongly with the wooden houses of the earlier period . The last things I had expected to see north of the Arctic Circle were chromium shop fittings ; but there they were , even if the shop did n't have a front wall . Some of the stores and houses would have graced any American main street , but now the glassless windows were boarded up , gaping spaces showed where others had stood , and over it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acrid , dead , musty smell of charred wood and bodies . The rubble from a house hit two nights before still spewed out into the sidewalk ; within the twisted and tangled interior men and women were digging , and on a sleigh were some dark bundles wrapped in sacking . " I knew a man who lived here , " said Nick . " Was torpedoed on the same ship as I was . Came home to his family and this happened . " There was a slur of feet coming down the Prospckt , and almost silently a line of white-clad figures , each carrying a rifle , passed us . A pair of skis was strapped to each man 's back . In their white-hooded coats , white felt boots , and white gauntlets they looked like so many ghosts . " Ski troops , " Nick said . " Those are the boys the Nazis do n't like . " We entered one of the few stores still open , but there was little to buy . A few phonograph records , some homemade children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason , quite a big pile of recordwipers , the ones with brushes on that you attach to the sound box . As these were in bright paper boxes , they had been ranged round to form a decoration . We walked back to the club , passing knots of people reading the wall newspapers , and I noted that loud speakers were common . Nick said they used them for air-raid warnings . Nick explained to me that Murmansk , so far up here in the Arctic Circle , had been a hard place to get people to settle in , and the government paid heavy subsidies and gave extra wages and privileges to any who would come . And well it might , I thought . To me this was another world , a bleak world of semi-darkness and such bitter cold that my face ached with it . A world hard for me to imagine , where life was a long bitter fight against both nature and man . A world where a cigarette was a luxury , a square meal something only to be dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even in peacetime . And now with the lack of food , heat , and decent shelter , with the front line only forty miles away , with the eternal night bombings and the ever-present risk of being shot down in the street by a strafing plane , it was just about my conception of hell on earth . Back at the club , Nickolai introduced me to Ilyana . She was a dark-haired girl in her middle twenties , oval-faced and brown-eyed . She used lipstick , plucked her eyebrows , smoked , but did not drink . She had been a schoolteacher in Leningrad and had come to Murmansk at the outbreak of the war to act as an interpreter , since she spoke several languages . Her English had a stilted , precise quality , but her accent was pleasant . Her left hand was bandaged ( she had hurt it in a raid ) , and pinned to her shirtwaist was the badge of the Russian air-raid worker . " So you have been seeing the town , " she said as we sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , Nick and I drinking vodka . " It is a pity that you can not get to Moscow or Leningrad . There we have so much more to show . But it would take too long ; our trains are slow now . " " I 'll pay you a visit after the war , " I said . She smiled . " After the war . How we are all living for that carry on where we had to leave off . Things were going so well until this beastly fighting started . I hate it . " I leaned back and looked at her , slightly surprised . Here was a different type from the usual phlegmatic Russian . She vibrated with an intensity that could be felt . " Then we can go on building all the things we planned . Parks , buildings , homes , hospitals -- oh , there is so much to do ! Just to be left alone to build up our country , that is all we want . " It occurred to me that I did n't know many young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " We have lots of building to do in America too , " I answered rather lamely . " I have seen pictures of your big towns . They are wonderful . But " ? here her brow wrinkled ? " do you know , I am surprised a little at some of the men I meet from your country . All they seem to be interested in is vodka and women . They do n't talk very much about the pressing questions of the day . " " Well , " I answered , hoping that I was n't grinning too much , " they 've just come in from a tough trip , you know . They want to relax . Besides that , seamen do n't represent all the people . " " I realize that , but quite a few of the Americans are college men . They are not even interested in politics or social economy . Do n't they teach that in your colleges ? " " Yes , of course they do , but not all of us are so vitally interested as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of us take a great interest in politics . They are so wound into our life to-day , they are our life . " We talked on for a while . Nick and Ilyana told me about Russian life and customs , and I remember Ilyana telling me , when I asked about religion , that " if there is a God in Russia it is Mr. Stalin . " Then I left them for I was due to go on watch . I walked slowly back to the ship , huddled inside of my heavy fleece coat against the bitter wind . Just outside the dock gate was a crater so large that I shivered as I looked down into it . I had heard at the club that it had been made by a land mine ; it had wiped out a seven-storey workers ' apartment house and killed three hundred people . It was so huge that asmashed truck at the bottom looked the size of a baby carriage . A moment later I carelessly stepped off the path as I turned shipward . Immediately I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylights scared out of me . Murmansk is no place to be absent-minded in , I figured as I scrambled out and hurried aboard . IV FIAT night we had the first of a long chain of high-level raids after dark . Three times in the first week we had to back the ship clear of the docks . We all had the jitters ; the Nazi planes gave us little peace , day or night , and there was little time to go ashore . Our idea of good weather was a howling blizzard , for then the Nazi planes could n't fly . We grew to hate the occasional clear days and the weak sun . We got used to day raids ? it 's easier when you can see who 's trying to murder you ? but the night raids were harder . Somehow the barrage seemed louder ; you just had to stand there and hear the hum of a motor overhead , and you never knew what second he was going to get you . All you could do was curse his black soul and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombed town lit up by the gray-green flares , the gaunt outlines of the buildings showing in a macabre silhouette . Now and then would come a shuddering boom , a vivid flash of orange flame , as pieces of a house shot skyward . All we could think about was getting the hell out of Murmansk . During the two months that we were there we all had narrow escapes . Standing on deck one night on watch for incendiaries , I was hit in the shoulder by a piece of shrapnel that luckily struck the boat deck and my steel helmet first . It buried itself in the heavy coat I was wearing , and my arm was numb for an hour . There was a pregnant laundrywoman who came aboard one morning to get the dirty linen . A lone plane appeared , and we ducked . We called to her and she came under cover . I pointed up to the plane . " No good , " I said . Her face expressionless , she too watched it . Struggling with her meager English , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? all right . For him " ? here she patted her swollen body -- we fix . " " She damn well will too , " chuckled Slim as we watched her haul away the bundles on her sled . The Germans were trying for a gasoline ship near us . Twice they ringed her with incendiaries ; they hit and sank a ship ahead of her . Old Yank and I had to go aboard her to get some meat one afternoon and found an anxious crew . " What a place ! " groaned the chief steward as he gave us a drink of rum in his cabin . " Boy , I 've been in some spots , but this is the worst . Let 's get out of here or I 'll be a bloody wreck . " " How about a steady job here , Chief ? " " Say , are you crazy ? You got to be a Russian to stick this . Did you ever see a bunch o ' people like these ? When the bomb hit that ship ahead of us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another bomb hit the warehouse and killed twenty Russians . I went over to give a hand and they said it was all right , they 'd have more men there soon ? and damned if within an hour they were n't carrying right on with the job ! The only thing that I 'm thankful for is that we do n't have to fight these birds . " We nodded . We could see the kind of a fight that these people were putting up . We could see too that they had a sense of values that took no account of superficial things ? something that was vital , alive , all-absorbing , something that did away with so many of the energy-sapping fripperies that do n't mean a thing . Sometimes their stoicism chilled me . I saw a dock worker killed by a crate that slipped . He was a mess , crushed and bloody , sprawled on the dock . The others made little comment , just cleaned up the mess as if it were only a broken melon , and carried on . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only alternative to cracking up . Bit by bit we finally got all the cargo unloaded . The Russians worked slowly but they kept at it . Twenty-four hours a day they hauled and pulled , working twelvehour shifts with no time off , working in a week-long blizzard toward the end , for which we were grateful . It was nearing time for us to leave when the Germansfinally hit the gas ship . They were too late to get the cargo , but they certainly smashed her hard . A hundredpounder landed on her stern , killing two gunners outright , tearing another 's hip away , and blowing a fourth onto the dock . It could so easily have been us ; another second 's delay in pressing that bomb release and it would have been , for we were dead in line . As it was , one of our boys was shot in the arm during the following strafing , and the woman who checked cargo had an ankle smashed . I fixed it up as best I could and she was grateful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the usual custom of the women in Murmansk with children ? she took them to the public creche as she went to work in the morning , and there they were cared for until she picked them up at night . She would draw her meal from the communal kitchen and heat it up at home . Then , she said , they all went to bed because there was so little fuel to keep the place warm . Shc had been bombed out seven times , until now there was nothing left of her furniture and she was living in a partially demolished house . I met her two afternoons later in the Prospekt , and she asked me if I would like to see her children . She hobbled with the aid of a stick into a house that was not too badly smashed . Carefully avoiding the broken steps , I followed her up two flights of stairs . I asked her why there was a rope hanging down the air shaft and she said that it was very handy when you wanted to leave in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed open a sagging door that had pieces of shoe tongues for hinges , and I followed her into a medium-sized room bare of all furniture except a wooden table and a box that served as a chair . Against the walls there were four mattresses , and on two of these two women were sleeping wrapped in blankets , their fur coats spread on top . Night workers , the woman said , and two day workers used the mattresses at night . Sitting on another mattress , also wrapped in blankets , were two young children who stared at me from bright round eyes . The boy was five , his sister a year older . They looked healthy and intelligent . Their faces lit up when I produced chocolate . Their mother told them in Russian to say thank you . " Spasiba , " they mumbled with their mouths half full . I looked around the room . On the table was a piece of black bread , half eaten ; on top of the old-fashioned woodburning stove at the far end sat a pot with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed into the bomb-cracked walls and round the boarded-up window . A print of Stalin and a snapshot of a Red Army soldier were the only pictures . The soldier was the woman 's husband and he was at the Finnish front , forty miles away . It was very cold in the room ; it smelled of sour milk , Russian tobacco , wood smoke , and sheepskins . The place was dirty , she said , but soap was very scarce . " Before the war we have nice little house ? yes . But now ? " She gave that Russian shrug . " You could leave here now that you have been hurt , " I said . She shook her head and smiled slowly . " Why I leave ? My man " ? she inclined her head in the direction of Finland ? " he no can leave . I no leave . " In a few days she was back on the job , hobbling around on her splinted foot and doing her usual twelve hours a day . We moved to the ballast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubble . On the last night I went up to the club to say good-by to llyana and Nickolai . Nick gave me a beautiful knife that he had made with metal from a smashed Messerschmitt . I did n't want to take it , but he insisted . " I 'll get more material . " He smiled . " That 's some that we did n't get under Lease-Lend . " On the way hack aboard I passed the last of our tanks being driven up to the front line . I stood and watched them go up along the winding road that lcd to the front ? Burma Road , we called it . I was glad that I 'd helped to get them here . They were in good hands . We dropped downstream the next morning and anchored to wait for the rest of the ships . Another convoy was coming in to take our places , loaded down as we had been . All morning German planes kept diving overhead ; they sank two of our freighters tough luck so late in the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck watching the raid I reflected that it would n't be Murmansk unless there was one . Slowly we wound our way out of Kola Inlet , the guns sounding more faintly , the flashes getting paler . An hour later , in the Barents Sea , the escorts were dropping depth charges against submarines . As Old Yank said , " No peace no place no more . " If it ever does come back , let it come soon to the people of Murmansk . They deserve it .
