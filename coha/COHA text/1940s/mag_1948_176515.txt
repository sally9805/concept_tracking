After six months , Detroit 's amateur detectives and junior G-men had almost forgotten about the man who shot Walter Reuther . But last week , investigating a $600 store burglary , state police picked up the trail of one Carl Bolton , 39 . Bolton , for a short time , had been a vice president of a U.A.W. local , for a long time the leader and mastermind of a gang of petty thieves . Police found him in Indiana , arrested him and four members of his gang . One of them , an ex-con named Jack Miller , decided to talk . <P> Miller declared that a few weeks before the shooting , Bolton had offered him and an associate $13,000 " to bump off Walter Reuther . " They refused . A couple of days before Reuther was shot , Bolton came to Miller 's home , asked for two shotguns . Bolton left with the guns , saying : " I 've got to borrow the typewriters . I 've got to get rid of a red-haired Communist son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to kill , along with two as yet unnamed accomplices . Police were sure of one thing . Bolton did not have $15,000 to offer from his own pocket .
