In Manhattan , the trial of Henry Lustig had barely begun when the sky started caving in on the dour little owner of Manhattan 's twelve glittery Longchamps restaurants . Unexpectedly , two of his four co-defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring with Lustig to defraud the U.S. of $2,872,766 in taxes on wartime profits . <P> Brothers Wallace and Martin Platt , Longchamps bookkeeper and office manager , not only pleaded guilty but turned Government witnesses . Wallace Platt took the stand to tell exactly how the huge job of cheating had been done . Said he : Longchamps kept two sets of books , juggled one set by understating sales and overstating purchases , used the faked figures in filing 1940-44 tax returns , siphoned the money , along with tips taken from hat-check girls , into a safety deposit box . <P> Lustig 's counsel , Lloyd Paul Stryker , admitted to the jury that his client had been " delinquent . " Nevertheless , he had a defense : Lustig , said he , had voluntarily confessed his delinquency , had paid the Treasury $1,800,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised immunity from criminal prosecution . But , said Stryker , " high Government officials cheated and deceived Henry Lustig ! " What officials ? Why , " the boss " was Henry Morgenthau Jr. , Treasury Secretary when the Lustig investigation began . Before the trial ends , some weeks hence , Stryker promised to call Morgenthau as a witness .
