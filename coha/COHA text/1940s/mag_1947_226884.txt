For years , Hollywood partygoers have shrieked with laughter at the impromptu gags and satirical songs of Radio Writer Abe Burrows ( TIME , Feb. 11 , 1946 ) . But his celebrated fans have kept Abe jealously to themselves , assuring him that the sentimental public would never appreciate his acidly unsentimental humor . Columnist Earl Wilson once gloated : " Only us hot shots get to hear him . " Last week , anyone with a radio set could hear Abe do his stuff . CBS had given him a one-man sustaining spot ( Sat . 10:30 p.m. , E.D.T. ) . Beefy , 36-year-old Abe Burrows was so delighted at getting up to a microphone that he took about half the salary he could be making scripting for others . <P> Abe 's program is 15 minutes of casual rambling . He tosses out wisecracks , parodies travelogues , concert ballads and popular songs , rasps his offbeat lyrics and thumps out his own piano accompaniment . <P> He opened last week 's show by announcing : " My rich , velvety baritone is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of . " Abe 's song titles include : I 've Got a Gal in Calico Who 's Dying for a Mink and You Ate Up a Hunk of My Heart . <P> Manhattan-born Abe , a onetime coat label salesman , thought his radio listeners ought to know what he looks like . " Am I fat ? " he asked them . " Am I sloppy ? Am I bald ? Well , my answer is yes . . . . " <P> Abe defines himself as a parlor wit who thinks of radio as a parlor instrument ( " some homes got them next to toilets " ) . But he seems hard-pressed to transport the highball-and-cigaret intimacy of his friends ' living rooms into the U.S. parlor . His cement-mixer voice strains with eagerness to wow the audience . And while most of his parodies and songs are funny , the jokes which string them together sometimes clank ( sample : " As for personal habits ... I ai n't got none " ) . <P> But his impromptu off-the-air cracks show no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recently saw MGM 's apologetic version of the radio-baiting novel The Hucksters , he remarked in the theater lobby : " This is the greatest expos of the movie industry I have ever seen . " <P> His reputation as a court jester for Hollywood sophisticates troubles Abe . He resents being called a cynic : " Cynics disbelieve real things ; I disbelieve phonies . " He claims he is working roughly along the lines of Will Rogers , except that he uses a piano instead of a rope . " The people . . . are just like me . ... I do n't want to talk like Carl Sandburg , but I like the people . " <P> CBS , expecting to get a sponsor for the new show , hopes that the people learn to feel the same way about Abe .
