" But , oh , I do n't like those people . They do n't like us . They 're dead , they do n't care , they do n't even feel foolish , " Albany said . She came over to Buck and said " Honey " to him , kissing him . The crack of Mr. Huguenine 's whip and the wild yells from Ike told them that the performance proper had begun .... The apathy inside the tent was like a fog . Pamplon got an occasionalhandclap , but for the most part the people just sat and stared . Mrs. Pamplon got through it ; but she did n't add anything to the act . She was clumsy making room for her husband 's returns , and once she teetered so that Pamplon had to grab hold of her . But Chad thought he noticed a slight quickening of interest when Fiero started his act . It was n't Fiero that roused it , though . There were plenty of jugglersin the world , and Syracuse had seen its share of them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at ; Caroline was obviously young , and shy , and conscious of herself , which gave a faint spice to her performance , simple though it was . A pair of youthful legs , however , did n't make a circus . After a minute or two , the audience became bored with the familiar routine and Chad went outside . By the entrance Albany Yates was putting on her hat . The crown and cloak and ball and scepter had been packed in their box . Beside the horses Shepley was rubbing the soles of his riding shoes in rosin . Mrs. Pamplon was lying in the shade while Pamplon stood with his back turned staring into the blank blue sky . Ike Wayfish leaned on the hurdle and wiped his face with care not to disturb the make-up . He waved a hand at Chad and said , " Nothing 's amiss , so money comes withal  --  Shakespeare . Or maybe Bisbee said it . They act as if they just do n't want to laugh . "  |p20I  " Maybe you ought to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the leaping 's due . " He loosed the cream pad from the hurdle . The band tootled a few notes to end Fiero 's act and the juggler and Caroline emerged in the skipping run that carried them from the ring but turned flatfootedas soon as they reached the outside . Mr. Huguenine 's voice was raised painfully for the next act . The Pamplons roused themselves and straggled in , and Ike and Fiero followed them . " That was a mean thing for Fred to say , " Albany said . " Mr. Wayfishtries harder than anyone else . " Chad nodded . He felt tired and half drugged . He knew it was going to go bad right through to the end unless something or somebodyhappened to catch their interest . Even the lion act was sure to fall flat now , he thought , as he handed Albany up on Buck 's back . He watched her moodily as she arranged her habit ; it was a sin to send anything so pretty in to those bezabors . She took the horse a turn round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , Buck dancing slightly with his forefeet , and pricking his ears for the pad horse 's exit . He was n't worried . All he wanted was Albany 's approval , and he was sure to get that . Horses were lucky . " Here we go , " Albany said. " ... in their Equestriole , an act acclaimed throughout the Universe , " bawled Mr. Huguenine . Barring only Syracuse , New York , Chad added to himself . But she got applause . Maybe it was the loafers from the Salina Street bridge ; maybe it was because the two , horse and rider , had plenty of spirit ; or maybe the audience had begun to get bored with their own silence . Fred Shepley listened with a smile . " Ai n't it wonderful ? " he said sarcastically , while Albanywas reciting her little poem . When she came out , he said , " My , you were good . You just about floored them . " " Did I ? " She cocked her chin . " I felt mad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotly as she met his eyes . " All right , highrider . See what you can do . " " I 'm going to . " The rest watched him go in , but Chad stared at Albany . He could see that she was mad as blazes for having forgotten herself and spoken to him . But he put down the fact that if she got excitedenough she would do anything . It was something to remember . He heard Bisbee say , " Jesus Christ , watch Shepley . " Bisbee had stopped on his way out and his voice brought the other performers behind him to see what was happening . Shepley was going through his routine with a fire he had never shown , but his performance was more striking because he seemed like ice . He did n't even pretend to smile ; he was unconscious of the audience , of the ring , of everything but himself and the pad horse . And the horse felt it , Chad saw . He was going carefully ; his pace , perfect as ever , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual play of every nerve . Caroline had to call twice before Mr. Huguenine 's blank expression of astonishment relaxed enough for him to take the ribbon standard from her , and then he nearly let go of the pole . Shepley took the ribbons superbly , clearing them high , and stealing an extra stride from the pad horse . He got a hand for each leap . " Burke and Walsh ai n't got anybody to touch what he 's doing now , " Bisbee said . " And the crowd knows it . There 's a newspaper fellow in there too from the Standard . I had to buy him drinks and give him a pass to get him to come . " Ike Wayfish said , " The piece wo n't come out till next week , though . " " I know that , but I can use copies of the paper . I 'll give ' it to editors ahead of us . They 'll print stories sometimes if they 're wrote out to begin with by another paper . What 's he trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Shepley should have taken his spring to the ground . Instead of that he was riding the tail of the pad round and round , the horse keeping his gait as he would continue to do until led from the ring , and motioning Carolineoff the bank . She stepped down after an instant , and Shepley , making another circuit , talked to Huguenine . Huguenine shook his head , and Shepley spoke again with obvious impatience . The audience and performers were all still . The threep203bandsmen had forgotten to play . The tune ended after the ribbons ; they had no precedent to take them on from there . Then Huguenine automatically reached for his chewing tobacco . He got it half out before he recollected himself and restored it to his pocket . " LAdies and GENTlemen . You are now going to see Fred .. . I mean Signor Rossello , attempt a somersault on the back of his runninghorse . " " Jesus , " Bisbee said in a low voice . " No wonder A. D. 's buf-faloed . " " ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been performed by half a dozen men in the Universe . Not by more than two , I think . " His solid face puckered uncertainly . " It ai n't advertised , " he said , more to himself than to the audience , but his voice was audible enough over the soft thud of the pad horse 's hoofs . Shepley made two more circuits of the ring , straight as an arrow on the tail of the pad , with a little rise to the balls of his feet that gave him the full lift of the quarters . " He 's got their tongues hanging out , " Bisbee said . " By Jeepers , he 's got mine . I hope he do n't break his neck . " Mr. Huguenine folded and unfolded his hands helplessly round the whipstock . Bisbee had hold of the entrance flap , as if he had to hold himself on his feet . None of the others moved except Chad , who stole a glance at Albany . She seemed to be poised , one hand holding the skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her lips were parted and her eyes followed the forty-two-foot circle of the cream pad with the green figure riding him . Chad looked back to the ring . " Suppose he does it , " he thought . " What 'll she do about it ? " Shepley was going to try it this turn . The action of his knees showed it , and the slow filling of his chest . The green body rose ; the spangles sprayed a green glitter on the air ; it was a pretty somersault ; it was perfectly timed ; he came down facing the withers perfectly , meeting the pad with his knees , his hands grasping for the pad edges.  |p204For  an instant he looked like sliding to the inside ; but the cream horse changed his lead , assumed the altered weight , and Shepley , his own face astonished in the instant of completion , rose to his feet , rode a half ring , leaped to the ground , and made his bow . Though the sun had set , the grass in the square was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canal horns from the basin where boats were crowding in to beat the Sunday landing law . The few teams remaining at the hitch rail switched their tails languidly and at long intervals . A couple of dogs squeezed under the bottom rail and trotted across the square on some immoral peregrination . Back of the hotel in the twilight a robin liquidly announced rain . Sitting by the main entrance of the empty round-top , Chad watched the lights coming on here and there in the upper windowsas people went to their bedrooms : some went out again , but some stayed on . Now and then a wagon moved down the street , but its occupants saw nothing in the square except the white hull of the tent and the shadowy silent wagons . Saturday was pay day : the performers had all gone off long before ; even Mrs. Huguenine had locked up the treasury wagon and spurred herself down- the street to look in the store windows . Chad fingered his own four and a half dollars and wondered how long Budlong would take to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't interested in examining a town like Joe Duddy , who , as soon as he received his pay , had heeled off to try the liquor and flush a pigeon . Nobody knew where Bastock had gone to . Money in his pocket was like an Arabian ring on the middle finger of a wizard : there it was ; and there Bastock was n't . But Budlong seemed to lack such natural interests . All he cared about was a jug of corn and a horse blanket inside the tentp205entrance so disposed that he could lie on one , drink the other , and keep his eye on the treasury wagon . Watching for Budlong 's return , Chad was startled to see Caroline Trid come out of the hotel . She was alone , and she stopped irresolutely , glancing up and down the street . One of the men sitting on the porch left his chair and went over to her . He took off his hat , but Caroline shook her head . She began edging towards the street , turning a little all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk . Then she started quickly across the roadway . The man , left standing , began to laugh a little louder than ordinary , Chad judged . He wondered what had become of Albany . He did n't have time to do much speculating , for Caroline hurried . She came straight for the tent entrance , not seeing him , and he felt perverse enough to keep quiet , so that she walked briskly past him into the tent . The thud of her low heels on the packed ground was decisive and close to his ear ; he even heard the drag of her skirts across the limp grass . But she stopped just inside the entrance , as if the darkness were too all surrounding . He was aware of her hesitance in it . She said , " Hello , there , " in a low voice ; but there was n't a sound even from Oscar , who for a wonder had n't begun to snore . Then Caroline came back to the tent entrance , standing there , looking back to the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thumbs hooked in the waistband of his trousers . He had the appearance of a man trying to make up his mind whether to take after a girl or not . Caroline knew it , too . Chad heard her draw her breath slowly . He said , " Do n't worry about him . If he comes over here we 'll just tell him off . " She froze where she was . He could just make her out , for the dress was light-colored , and she looked slender and tall , in that dimness almost like a Lady 's Book pattern . " Who 's that ? " she asked . " Chad . " " Oh . " He heard the shiver in her breath . She was a nervy thing , he thought.  | " I 'm glad it 's you , " she said . And then after a minute , " Would you mind me sitting down with you ? " " No , " he said . " But you better sit on the blanket . There 's some dew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She smelled faintly of perfume . She did n't say anything for a moment or two , and Chad did not feel like talking . But then she started a conversation , suddenly , making her voice sound bright . " It 's cooler out here . " " I guess it is , " Chad agreed . She was watching the man across the street . He had eased off the porch and was sort of swinging his legs , like a man not going anywhere in particular . " Albany went out after supper and it 's still hot in our room and I came down for some air , " she said . " I think it 's a nice town , do n't you ? " " She went out of the hotel ? " Chad asked . " Yes . She did n't say where , or when she would be back . It 's funny , I thought it was an awful place , all during the parade , and the people looked awful , and then all of a sudden after Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful somersault . Albany said she 'd never seen anything like it .... " Her voice petered out . The man had crossed the street and was now coming through the hitch rail , taking his time , still , and looking around . Chad drew his feet back under him . " What do you want ? " The man jumped . " Nothing , " he said . " Well , mister , the next performance is Monday afternoon . " The man came forward a few paces . " I reckon this is a public square , " he said , with a shade of bluster in his voice . Chad said , " Sure . But the wagons and tent ai n't . Otherwise make yourself at home . There 's plenty of damp grass to cool off on . " The man lingered a moment and Chad said to Caroline , " Funny the way the young ones like to hang around the tents , ai n't it ? "  | " Yes , " she said . " They act just fascinated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " But he thought better of it and retreated almost to the hitch rail . He stayed there a moment longer , then lifted his leg and hilted himself over and went off , keeping out of the light from the hotel door . Chad gave a low laugh . " I guess that feller needs beans . " Caroline said gravely , " I 'm glad you were here . " " You 've got over your mad at me ? " " Yes , " she said . " It was a mean business , " he said . " But I never thought of such a thing . " " I guess you did n't . " " You like being with the circus ? " " Yes , " she said . " I like it better , though , when we 're on the road doing the little towns . " " So do I. We 'll be roading after Monday . " She said , " This is the farthest I 've ever been from home . " " I guess you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never knew what it would be like , being with nice people . " " Sure , " Chad said . " I like Mrs. Huguenine . She 's nice , " Caroline said seriously . " She 's awful fat , but she 's kind . Mrs. Pamplon is nice too , but she do n't talk much . She 's gone to bed . " " How is she ? " " Mr. Pamplon said she was feeling better . He came and asked Albany for sal volatile . He does n't know what 's the matter with her . " It was desultory conversation , but it served to fill in the time ; and Caroline seemed to think she ought to say something . She kept coming back to Shepley 's somersault ; and they discussed the offhandway in which he had practically ignored the troupe 's congratulations . When Wayfish asked him how it felt to do what only Hunter and DeForest were known to have done , Shepley said why not ask them . The clown had looked hurt . Chad said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Caroline said Albany did n't think so . She said Shepleycame from a good family that had gone poor . He came from down at Fort Plain or near it and that was how he had got into circusing in the first place . The great menagerie man , Herr Driesbach , who now showed in the Bowery , came from Fort Plain . Shepley managed to get apprenticed to Westervelt , the rider , in Parsons 's Circus . Later he had joined out with Captain Page and done the northern loop through Canada one season . He had quit Page to join Trimble , which was the show that had folded up on Mr. Huguenine 's farm . Caroline seemed to know all about Shepley 's history , but when Chad asked what she knew about Albany , it turned out that she knew next to nothing . Albany had begun riding in equestrian melodramasand spectacles like Cataract of the Ganges , Bluebeard , and Siege of Montgatz . She had seen the famous white horse , Surrey , perform , and it was the sight of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and train him to be as good . Then she found Buck . None of the big shows wanted her ; the horse was too green for one thing , so she joined out with the first small show that would take her , which was Trimble 's . She had thought of highridingbut had never tried it . " Do you think a woman could ever do a somersault ? " Caroline asked . " No , " said Chad . They let it drop , Chad remarking that Budlong was certainly taking his time and Caroline saying dutifully that he certainly was . Then as if the mere mention of his name had been enough , Budlong loomed lankly out of the shadow beyond the treasury wagon with a jug swinging from his finger . " You ai n't been wasting your time , none , " he said to Chad . " Who 's your girl ? " " It 's me , Mr. Budlong , " Caroline said quickly . " Well , I 'm sorry I was so long a time . But I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallon , he 's got to sample . "  |p209Budlong  hauled a blanket out , sat down , elbowed the jug , and tasted it . He wiped his mouth and said , " I wonder was it milk came out of that there Roman wolf you see pictures of in schoolbooks . This-here 's Bourbon . Bourbon is a good drink . It 's good by daylight , and it 's good by dark . It 's good on a cold day and better on a hot one . You can take it standing up or setting down or lying on your back , and she 'll swallow just the same . She 's good with water , but she 's better without , and a sensible man do n't go to build a fire with wet wood anyway . I 'll bet Bourbon would taste first-rate in a wolf 's tit . Even Dagoes like it . Give me enough of it and I 'll learn you the Constitution of the United States . " He sighed , making a faint hum in the mouth of the jug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull . The two men looked towards each other and Budlong said , " Missy , it would n't hurt you and we 're all friends . " Caroline said in the darkness : " Bourbon is a man 's drink , Mr. Budlong . " " That 's so , " he said . " That 's so . " Then he took the jug back and said , " I 'm obliged to you , Chaddy . You need n't wait up on me . You two run along and have a good time now . " You could tell he had fixed in his mind to be alone . Chad got on his feet and Caroline rose quickly beside him . " Good night , Mr. Budlong , " she said . They walked towards the gap in the hitch rail with the dew cool on their feet , Chad shambling through it and she lifting her skirt , her wrists curved , and her face down-bent . Chad said , " What are you going to do , Caroline ? " They were near enough the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look at him . " I guess I 'll go in , " she said . " I 'm all cooled off . It was nice sittingout there . " She smiled for him . " It 's been real nice . " " Why , the evening 's not scarcely begun , " he said . " Do n't you want to go to the stores or anything ? " She shook her head ; and he remembered suddenly that she was n't drawing any pay . She probably did n't have a cent in her little leather ridicule . He could see that she hated the idea of spending an evening alone in a hotel room ; and he did n't blame her . She stood looking at him , her face solemn and oval in the fanningbonnet brim . It was extraordinary how clothes changed a person . At Cisco 's , in her ragged dress that left her half bare , she had looked older than her years and too full of knowledge for a nice girl ; but here she looked younger , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't know the first thing of what she was really like . Well , he had nothing to do on his own hook unless he tried getting drunk , and he did n't feel like that . " Look here , Caroline . Maybe you 'd come out with me ? " He could see her hesitate , and he said shrewdly , " I could n't buy you no champagnewine . But we might go see the Museum . " " I 'd like to , " she said gravely . A constable told them how to find the Museum , and Caroline took Chad 's arm . He found it pleasant to be walking along the street with a nice-looking girl . She had a light , carrying step ; and she was so excited at going to a museum that she lost a good deal of her constraint . " I 'll hardly know what to look at first , " she told him . " I do n't know anything about it , " he said . " Mr. Wayfish said the exhibits were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen real waxworks , have you ? " " Not what you 'd call museum waxworks , " Chad said . " Mother once saw a waxworks , before she was married . She said it even had figures of real living people in it . " " I do n't know about this one , " Chad said . " I imagine most of them are dead people . " Caroline nodded . He could see the beginning of the part in her hair under the flared bonnet brim.  |p2II  " People generally get more famous when they 're dead , " she agreed . They first heard the music more than a block away . It swelled out of a side street , and through it came the sound of bells . Chad said , " That must be it . " But the music faded . When they turned the corner , however , they heard it again . They were wondering which building it might come from when suddenly a door swung open , casting brilliant light across the roadway , and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole street . As the door swung shut , Chad closed his arm on her hand and said , " Come on , let 's go right in , " and she followed him up the steps and through the door . A man in a frock coat that swelled over his hips said to them , " It costs two bits each . " But he might as well have not spoken as far as Caroline was concerned , for the organ music was like a great wave engulfing her . It filled the hall ; the lights seemed to swim in it . She could not see anyone playing ; but confronting her were a line of wax figures all in real costumes , some with their arms folded on their breasts , some with their hands at their sides . Over their heads hung a line of bells , which Caroline felt sure must be the chime they had heard as they came down the street . As they stepped forward together towards the figures , the bells started ringing . It was a beautiful sound , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Every figure had a hammer hinged to the back of his or her head , and at the proper moment the hammer rose and struck the bell above it . The female figures rang the trebles , and the male figures the deeper ones . It was miraculous , to see those calm figures keep their pose and ring bells so , in tune with the organ . It was scarcely mortal . After a minute the bells ceased , but the organ played on . Chad said , " Let 's go in there . " He indicated a door that had a sign , WAXWORK EXHIBIT , over it , and Caroline followed him with a feeling of impersonal reluctance , as if she dreamed . The regular waxworks proved to be more interesting to look atp2I2 if not as lively to listen to . Neither of them read easily , but betweenthem they managed to work out who all the people were . The room was lighted by a gas chandelier of four jets that was almost fantastically bright in itself , so that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stout man who seemed familiar with the figures , Chad and Caroline learned that the hair was human and made in Paris , France . The eyes looked almosthuman at first , also , but after a minute or two they gave Caroline an odd feeling , and then she realized that it was becausethey never blinked , and she noticed another queer thing about them . The blue eyes were all exactly alike , and so were the brown eyes . Thus David Lambert ( the biggest man that ever lived ) had a sort of family resemblance to Desdemona ( being stabbed with an actual knife by Othello ) . But their costumes and all the rest of them were quite different . Caroline liked best the Sleeping Beauty , whose eyes were entirely closed , though the fat man assuredhis companion that she had eyes under the lids  --  it was a first-rate exhibit , he insisted . There was also Queen Elizabeth in a red wig with a crown full of jewels , and Lady Jane Grey with her head on the block and the Headsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his home . He had a black cloth tied over his face and the sign said it could be viewed for the price of ten cents . Chad asked Caroline whether she wished to see it , which she thought very gentlemanly of him , but she said he ought n't to spend money on her to that extent and looked upset about it , so Chad did not insist . Then , as if to reward them both , the stout man summoned the proprietor , paid ten cents , and demanded that the mask be lifted . The proprietor tried to get Chad to pay ten cents , and when Chad refused he could not very well put them out of the room , so they saw the face anyway . After all the going on , it was disappointing that the executioner still looked like a plain man with trouble in his home . General Washington and his Generals did not interest them so much , so they crossed the hall to another room which wasp213labeled CURIOSITIES OF THE NATURAL WORLD . It contained a two-headed calf , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mastodon , sea shells , stuffed small animals , three parrots that never made a sound , and the Embalmed Head of a New Zealand Chief . Caroline held Chad 's arm again as they went from case to case . He seemed much more interested in the curiosities than she was , but it was no more than right that he should study them as long as he liked , since he had bought the tickets . She did not care to look at the beating heart of Byron so she looked at Chad , and she thought he looked kind . When he turned unexpectedly , she blushed ; but he merely wanted to know what she thought of the heart , and she said it seemed poetic to her . She thought it was a foolish thing to say ; it was the first thing that came into her head . Chad nodded approvingly . " He was a poet , " he said . " I heard a man tell about him in the Yellow Bud . He tried to free the Greeks but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on beating till sunset , like a snake 's , but they said it was because he loved freedom so . It sounds queer to me . " He wanted to return to the embalmed head , but the proprietor began announcing from the hall the evening 's last Grand Performanceof the Italian Phantasmagoria , and they went into a room with twenty or thirty chairs in it and a sheet hung on the wall . There were not many people so there was room for them to sit down and they had just done so when the lights went out . They sat in complete darkness for a few minutes . Nobody said a word , and Caroline could hear the breathing of other people . Then a bright light shot out and lit upon the sheet ; colors appeared in it , and suddenly it turned into a picture as clear as day . It was a city , with a long street running right away from the bottom of the sheet , and buildings on each side , and green trees , and a closed carriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very good , but the proprietor said it was Paris , France . He rang a little bell . The picture disappeared , leaving white light , but suddenly another took its place . This , he said , was Westminster Abbey in London , England . In that way , Caroline and Chad saw Vienna , and Athens , and Egypt , and Mount Ararat , and finally Naples , and it was in Naples that the wonder happened . First it was a clear day ; in the next second a dark cloud had come over the whole top of the sky . The light faded like magic . Thunder roared , and all at once great flashing silver drops of rain slanted across the picture . After a minute the proprietor rang his bell and the lights came on . The cool darkness of the street was a relief , for the Phantasmagoriahad made the room very hot , and Caroline 's head still rang from the thunder . It was not , of course , real thunder . It had been produced by a ragged small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the lights went on , everyone saw him blowing his nose in a corner of the room .

She had the feeling that they had come to know each other well , as people do who have taken a journey in each other 's company . It seemed scarcely possible that they had been in the Museum less than two hours . It gave her a dreamy feeling , so that it was a shock to realize suddenly that the lights ahead belonged to the hotel . Chad stopped at the end of the porch , which was now emptyof sitters . The chairs looked blind facing out at the street . It was , quiet and nearly dark , since the dining-room lights had been put out .

" " I had a lovely time . " They had been moving towards the entrance , their heels rappingtogether softly over the porch boards , and when he stopped she passed a step beyond him into the light . Her head was bent so that he could not see her face under the bonnet brim . Thep215gauze scarf she was wearing had slipped from her shoulders , the ends hanging over her forearms , leaving her neck bare , and the light picked out the thin gold chain . He recognized it at once , and following its course he saw that the storekeeper had been right about the length . The locket itself was hidden below the V of the dress . Then he saw that she was looking at him , her face flushing darkly . She started to pull the scarf back into place , let it go , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " Do you want to see it ? " " It kind of caught my eye , " he said slowly . She said , " It 's a perfume locket . We found it in our room and the black boy did n't know who it was for . Albany said to leave it till we found out , but it looked so pretty that I put it on after she 'd gone . " She held it out to him and he took it in his fingers . It was warm , just as the storekeeper said it would be , and the perfume was sweet all round his face . " I put in some of Albany 's perfume , " she explained . " I know I ought n't to have worn it . " " I do n't see harm in doing that , " Chad said . " Did she like it ? " " Not as much as I did , I think . But I never had a real gold locket . " She took it out of his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think the person that left it ought to have said who it was for , do n't you ? " Chad said , " Yes . " " It was n't right to wear it , " she said . " I hope Albany wo n't be cross about it . But when I put it on I felt as if it might have been mine . " He watched moodily as she restored the locket to its place . It was ironical to think how he had planned for Albany to wear it and to pick his own time telling her who it came from . The plan had worked out , except to the person wearing it . What Caroline said about Albany having plenty of such things was probably true.  |p216She  was saying , " I wish we knew who sent it , though , and whether it was for her or me . " " I sent it . " " Oh . " She turned white . " You wanted Albany to wear it , did n't you ? And I had to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm awfullysorry , Chad . " Her lips quivered . " And talking about it like this . I 'll put it right back and tell Albany the first thing . " " No ! " Chad was n't going to be laughed at . If it had n't meant anything to Albany it ought to be forgotten . " It was n't for her , " he said . " It was for me ? " Caroline was motionless : her fingers inside the front of the dress still touched the locket . He saw the color returning painfully to her face , until even her neck was red . It made him feel foolish and helpless and angry ; and he could n't evade her eyes . " Oh , " she said again , and then , " Thank you very much , " in a tight little voice . " I love it . I 'll love wearing it . I had a lovely time tonight . " She turned quickly to the door . He had hardly time to say , " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looked as if she were trying not to cry . BOOK IIITHE TENTING SEASONp219THE week that included the last performance in Syracuse and first in Auburn was the best of the season for Huguenine 's Geddes , Jordan , Canton , and Weedsport , the tent was sold out . course , as Bisbee said , they were not on Burke and Walsh 's vertised routing ; the big show would make the jump from Syra to Auburn by the turnpike , missing the canal towns , and it not yet come close enough behind them to bleed the audiences . advance agent , however , had made the loop , tearing down Huguenine paper and putting up Burke and Walsh in its p ' This did no harm because Bisbee had returned to Syracuse started out ahead of the wagons , tearing down Burke and Walsh tacking their own new sheets . The new sheets were handsome  --  about ten by fourteen inch ( and displayed two cuts . One was the MODERN DANIEL of Wayfish standing nobly in the face of a charging lion ; but ov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law gravitation in his extraordinary somersault on the back of a ga ' ing horse , as successfully performed for the first time in the Wes Hemisphere at Syracuse on June 18 , 1836  --  the attempt to be n at each and every performance . The cut was the original high-rise picture used in the big posters , showing the horse at full stretch the rider poised on one foot . He had been made to do the somen by the simple expedient of cutting him from the block and reinser him , upside down . The result , as Bisbee said , was sensational . By time the show reached Weedsport , moreover , the local papers i bringing out the story . Bisbee had secured proof sheets from Onondaga Standard and was now winging over the roads ahead of the show and handing a sheet free gratis to every editor . The entire company reflected the prosperity . Shepley , naturally , was getting the advertising ; but anyone who came to look him over was more than likely to watch the rest of the performance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Burke himself , might turn up for any performance . It put a kind of gaiety on all of them . The chief trouble was that Shepley , though he made the attempt as announced , had missed the pad in both Canton and Weedsport . The thrill was there in the sight of the green body spinning over the horse ; the fall to the ring did n't rob it of any excitement  --  Shepley got a big ovation each time . What bothered Ike Wayfish and Bastock and Huguenine was when Shepley would hurt himself . Even without hurting himself , three falls might lose him his nerve . Chad thought this was likely . He had been watching Shepley close since that first night in Syracuse and he could see , even while he was making those first three successive somersaults , that he was getting fine-drawn . The first time in Canton , he took it out on himself , saying he had been plain clumsy ; but after Weedsport , he claimed the pad horse had broken his gait . That was a lie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ; for Albany and Fred had made up their misunderstanding . The news went out on Sunday morning in Syracuse when Mrs. Pamplon told Mrs. Huguenine that Shepley had moved over to the Syracuse House . They had had breakfast together in the dining room . To Chad it seemed obvious that Albany must have done most of the making up ; he felt sure of it when she took pains later in the day to be nice to him . She said Caroline had told her about the evening they had had at the Museum and how it was Chad who had left the locket . " It was a nice thing for you to do , " she said . She looked as if she meant it , too . Oddly enough Mrs. Pamplon , who , in spite of her timid appearance , had such a nose for finding out details , acted pleased that Shepley and Albany should be taking up again . She thought it whollyp22Iproper  --  the two stars , they should marry . It would be enchanting , she said , and Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it . Mrs. Huguenine disapproved of such language . She would rather see them wedded by a preacher . There was far too much gossip about the immoral lives of circus people as it was . She wished Mr. Huguenine would talk to Shepley about it , and Huguenine , looking like a farmer who has discovered glanders in his horses , said he would . But everyone knew that he would n't . He had n't said a word for a week . Now he came round from the treasury wagon announcing that they had four hundred admissions . The tent was jammed . When Chad looked in he saw them packed together like pickled salmon in a barrel , even blocking off the usual alley to the main entrance . They hardly left room for the performers to get through ; and a couple of deputy sheriffs had to get to work to make space for the stilt walkers in the march around . The march around had just begun when Chad noticed a buggy drive into the lot behind a spanking pair of light bays . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a small man , dressed in a black coat and waistcoat and dark trousers ; but he acted as if he knew what he was doing . In spite of the band music and the hollering in the tent that would have scared the average team endways , the horses merely slung hips and worked their ears at the ring stock ; and the driver wound the reins round his whip and sat there , first studying the round-top , which was popping boils in the breeze , then looking over the three horses , paying the most attention to the cream pad , and finally meeting Chad 's eye . When he did he raised his hand and beckoned . " Sorry , mister , " Chad said . " I 'm minding the ring stock . You ai n't supposed to tie in this lot anyhow . " The man stared . He had a thin , high-colored face , and heavy-lidded blue eyes . For an instant they turned hard as porcelain . Then he climbed down over the wheel and came over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " That 's not ap222bad crowd , boy . " Joe Duddy got ahead of the beat at the moment , and the stranger smiled . He counted under his breath , " Three windjammers , one two three four five six seven eight , three of ' em on stilts , "  --  his glance came round to Chad ,  --  " and one punk . " He went past Chad and looked at the ring stock . " Use the grey ? No . He 's green . Two ring stock . I hear you 've got a lion . What 's the black do ? Academy act , I suppose ? " He kept nodding to himself as if he were quite capable of answering the questions for himself . " Have a segar . " He offered Chad one without looking at him , and Chad took it . " That pad horse looks pretty fair for a run-down show like this . " Chad said , " He 's good enough . The black one 's better , though . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Buck . " Not much of an establishment . I never expected to see it rolling again after it broke down with Trimble . No freaks ? " His lips tsk-tsked . " Fat woman ? I 've seen fatter than her doing chamber work in the Astor Hotel . Well , where 's Huguenin ? " " You can see him after the all-out , " Chad said . " I 'll see him now . " Chad did n't like him . He did n't like orders anyway . He said , " Mr. Huguenine 's in the ring . Maybe he 'll see you after the show , if he feels like it . " " He 'll feel like it , " said the little man . " Give him this card . " Chad took it and read the name , Ovid T. Burke  --  in the corner was " Pres. Burke &; Walsh Combined Equestrian &; Acrobatic Circus &; Menagerie . " Mr. Burke had taken another segar from his pocket and folded his lips over it . He did not light it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segar roll across his underlip and cocked it in the opposite corner . His china-blue eyes examined Chad carefully . His face was neither kind nor unkind . He looked as if he would be good at running a circus or any other project that he had in mind . Chad decided not to get too sturdy . He said , " Look here , Mr. Burke . Mr. Huguenine 's got all he can handle in the ring . I ai n't going to give him your card till the show 's out . But you can walk inside and watch the show if you want to . "  |p223Burke  's eyes did not move from Chad 's face , but his segar rolled halfway over the lower lip before he caught up with it and brought it back . " What do you do here , son ? Just punk ? " " I handle the ring stock , " Chad said . " And Huguenine pays me for it . " " Yes . I figured that out myself . How 'd you join out ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Too bad it 's not a real show , " Mr. Burke said . " You 'd get along in a real show . Like mine . " Chad looked at him . " This one suits me all right . " Mr. Burke nodded . " I know Bisbee . He 's not a fool . When you see him , son , tell him from me to leave off tearing my paper . " He glanced at his horses . " They 'll stand . I 'll look this whistle show over . " He went into the tent as the band returned to the fly , let the tune drop , and came out , Bastock and Budlong knocking " Champlain " water from their instruments . It was Joe Duddy who noticed the team . " What 's that rig doing ? " " A feller came late . He 's gone inside , " Chad told him . " Serve him right if his team runs off , " Joe said , " leaving them there . Wish I had time to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chaddy . Three makes it messy and four do n't work half so good . " Budlong said scornfully , " Those horses wo n't run . They 're clever . They 've seen tents before . What 's his name ? " " Burke , " Chad said . Chad could not tell whether Budlong caught the name , for Bastock was yelling for him and Joe to come inside . But Albany Yates had heard him and she said now , close to Chad 's shoulder , " Did you say Burke ? " Her face was vivid with suppressed excitement . Chad nodded . " Here 's his card . "  | She took it , read it , and for an instant held it , tapping the corner on her gloved finger . Then she gave it back . " Is he inside ? " " Yes . " " Have you told anyone else , Chad ? " " Budlong . I do n't know if he caught on . " " He would n't miss it , " she said . She was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawklike glance he had noticed the first day he had known her , when she was riding Buck down to the wood lot . " I wonder if I ought to tell Fred , " she said quietly . " He might get nervous if he knew . " She turned back to Chad and asked , " What do you think ? " " Suit yourself , " he said . Fred Shepley came over near them to get at the rosin box . " What 's the news ? " he asked , staring Chad 's way . " Nothing , Fred . We were just talking . How do you feel ? " " I feel all right . I 'll make it all right today if that fool horse does n't start crossing his feet again . You saw him yesterday . It carried him right out from under me . " His eyes were defiant , and for an instant Chad felt almost sorry for him . He said , " I was out here . I did n't see him . " Shepley did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , saying nothing , each one of them in a separate mood . The Pamplons moved up to the entrance , ready to go in . Handclappingfor the end of Fiero 's juggling act broke out and the ring stock pricked ears , considering it , and then relaxed . Above , the round-top popped gently against the blue sky , and standing in its shade was like waiting on the outside edge of life . Within the canvas was the world : one step and you had to face it ; it took hold of you ; it was kind to you , or it bore you down . Time was not measured by any clock but was created by the impulse , displeasure , or applause of collected human beings . They watched Fiero emerge , pleased with himself ; and Caroline Trid came as far as the canvas , her face slightly flushed , looked atp225them all , hovering a brief instant while Huguenine 's voice shouted laboriously " . . . Premeer gymnats of Europe , in their first American tour . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepley 's eyes moodily upon them as he stirruped Albany to her saddle . The girl was light on the black horse . They waited their cue , controlled , poised , breathing like a single creation , eyes to the entrance . It seemed hardly an instant before they were going in and Chad and Shepley , the cream pad at their shoulders , moved up to watch . She rode today as though she were in love ; and Buck responded to her mood , so that the two , horse and equestrienne , were like partners in a new flirtation . They acknowledged applause lightheartedly , delighted to take the world into their confidence ; and when Buck bowed it was as if she curtsied . Caroline Trid , who had joined them , said curiously , " Albany 's made him bow twice in that one spot . I wonder why . " Chad had already picked out Burke 's black-coated figure . The circus manager was following both the performance and the reactionof the audience to it . His china-blue eyes left the pair to swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face did not show at all what he made of it ; but it was plain to Chad that Albany had picked Burke out of the crowd and was performing for him . It was plain to Shepley also . He had come out of his absorption when Caroline spoke and his eyes had immediately lit on Burke . He seemed puzzled for a moment ; then , as if the sight his eyes had taken in had just penetrated to his brain , he said , " That rig outside , " and turned to Chad . " Did he come in that rig ? " Chad nodded . " That 's what you were talking about , " Shepley said . " She wanted to know , " Chad said . " You knew . You told her , did n't you ? " " Yes , " Chad said . " He said his name was Burke . " Chad did n't know why he told Shepley , but looking at his face he could tell that the same thought was in both their minds.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . " The bitch . " Caroline said angrily , " You 've got no right to talk like that " ; but Shepley ignored her . He ignored Albany as she made her exit ; he gave Burke , who was clapping his hands perfunctorily , one look ; then he ignored him too . " Come on , stumblefoot , " he said to the pad horse . Albany handed the reins to Chad but she followed him over to the hurdle to pat Buck . " Was n't he fine today ? " she asked . Chad said , " Both of you . " She rested her chin on the riding whip between her hands . " I have n't seen Mr. Burke in years , " she said . " Not since Parsons 's Albany Circus . But he does n't appear to have changed . " " He noticed you all right , " Chad said . " You certainly played in his lap . " She glanced quickly up . " Do you think it showed ? " " Well , Caroline noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred ? Does he know Burke ? " " I told him . " " Why did you ? " " I do n't know , " Chad said . Her eyes became curious . She stared at Chad , but she was listening to the tent . Then she turned abruptly towards the entrance . Chad unsaddled , slapped Buck 's rump , and went after her . She did not notice him when he came up , and he did n't speak to her , but looked in over her head . The crown of her hat just reached his eyes . Shepley had finished the ribbons and Caroline had them bunched in her arms . Sweating heavily , Mr. Huguenine was announcing the defiance of the laws of gravitation in Signor Rossello 's attempted somerset . Burke , across the ring , was looking towards the performers ' entrance , but as Joe Duddy rolled his drum he glanced at the rider . Fred took a full circle of the ring before he somersaulted . He made the pad , and he got a hand ; but Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exit . He reached itp227before Shepley , touched his hat to Albany , saying , " How are you , Miss Yates ? " and saw Chad . " Hello , son , " he said . " Do n't forget to give Huguenine my card . I 'll be back . I 'm going to visit a little with Miss Yates . " He took Albany 's hand and placed it inside his elbow . " It 's quite a while since I saw you , " he said to her . " I was just starting in then , " she said . " I said you were promising . Where did you find that horse ? " Chad could hear her telling him as they started across the grass , following the round of the tent . Mr. Burke was carrying his segar in his off hand , flicking the ash lightly with his little finger , and Albany walked lightly beside him , with her skirts held up in her free hand . They made a genteel picture ; but if Shepley thought so too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a blanket , wrapped himself in it , and lay down on the grass . Caroline was waiting by the hurdle when Chad went back to tie the cream pad ; she was looking for Albany . When Chad told her that Albany had gone off with Mr. Burke , she was excited . But she thought it was a shame Mr. Burke could n't have stayed to see Ike Wayfish 's act . By now , everyone knew about Burke 's presence ; and after the tent emptied the entire company waited inside for his return . He came in through the main entrance as if he owned the show . He looked cooler than frog water , Budlong said , walking up to Huguenine . " Hello , Huguenine , " he said . " You got my card . " " Yes . " Huguenine 's solid face was troubled . His hands fidgeted . " I hope you liked the show . " " It 's all right for a whistle show , " Burke said . " But it 's on my route and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The roads are public , " Huguenine said , after a minute 's consideration . " Maybe they are , " Burke said . " But New York State is Flatfoot country . Any punk can tell you that . " He pulled a fresh segar out and lit it in Huguenine 's face . " If you try to tie into me I 'll bust you . It 's a warning , see ? So watch out . " Mr. Huguenine had to clear his throat . " Seems to me Bisbee said something about the Flatfoots telling that to Raymond and Waring , " he said hesitantly . " I ai n't a circus man myself , but seems to me they made out all right . Joe , you keep shut . " Joe Duddy had started flapping his arms to crow . Burke paid no attention . " You 're not exactly the same class as Raymond , " Burke said drily . " No . But I 've put my money in this outfit , and I ai n't going to throw it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I aim to stick to it . " He looked solid as an ox in front of Burke and Mrs. Huguenine completed the delight of Joe Duddy by saying , " Do n't hit him , A. D. Ho 's too little . " Burke was unruffled . " I 've traced your dates , " he said . " We 're showing Lyons June 30 . If we find you there we 'll take your show to pieces . That 's all . " He turned for the performers ' entrance , but he stopped as he reached it . " And quit tearing my paper , Huguenine . " He stepped out . Presently they heard the buggy cramping as the horses wheeled . They were trotting snappily as they passed the main entrance , the little man sitting forward on the seat , holding his whip trailing like a mail driver . " I wish to God I 'd pulled them linchpins , " Joe said . He picked the mop bucket off the cage wagon and started gathering horse buns from the ring . Ike Wayfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huguenine , who was leaning glumly against the center pole , and after a few minutes Bastock said , " You sure stood right up to him , A. D. " He spoke as if Huguenine instead of Burke had been the little man . Mrs. Huguenine , however , was n't a bit sobered.  | " Do n't worry , A. D. , " she told her husband . " He ca n't do nothing , can he ? " " No , " said Huguenine . " Not that I know of . " He looked up as Albany came back into the tent . It was in Auburn that Bastock decided to look at Caroline on a horse . Till then he had refused even to consider it . Every morning , after the tent was up , he used the time before the parade putting her and Chad through a series of exercises . But the Sunday followingBurke 's warning to Huguenine , he changed his mind . They did n't get any notice from Bastock . Chad was waiting his turn at the hand grips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight upon her right foot and stretching the left as far and high behind her as she could while Bastock sat on the ring curb and whittled a plug in the palm of his hand . A slow rain was falling . The round-top showed wet and grey . Budlong was shaving himself near the main entrance . The mirror , propped on one of the blue seats , was turned to catch what light came in from a misty sky . Except for him , however , they had the tent to themselves . Joe Duddy had n't showed up since suppertime the day before , and Mrs. Huguenine had gone down to the hotel for a late breakfast . Oscar the lion was inside the tent because of the rain ; but he drowsed , taking his Sunday fast philosophically . Caroline suddenly dropped her leg and twisted her body round without letting go the hand grips . " Do I have to do it again , Pete ? " Bastock nodded . He stuffed his pipe and came over behind her . She made a face at Chad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch it , watching the curve of her back take shape , the hollow come into it , and the long leg in the faded tights reaching back . It made him feel sleepy , with the drip of rain in his ears , like one cat watching another stretch . Pete took her foot in the palm of his hand , as it came waist-high , and lifted it slowly until she said " Ouch ! " " See , Missy ? There 's a couple of muscles you did n't even know was there . " " I do now , " she said , putting her foot down and rubbing her hand up and down the back of her thigh . " But it does seem kind of senseless to me just the same . " Bastock nodded . " You 're limber enough , you turn cartwheels , and you can throw pretty back somersets , for a girl . You couldmakea plastic all right , but we 're figuring on horses , Missy . You got to have strength . You do n't want to tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pad . There ai n't room . " His black eyes swelled solemnly at her . " If you was a kid , it would be different . I could use a whip . Ai n't nothing like a whip used right to learn a human , just like a dog or a horse . I ai n't ever whipped a girl your age , though . Tads or women is different . Chad here 's too big for me to lick . I doubt if he 'll ever make a real rider anyhow . " He changed his mind about smoking , knocked the pipe into his hand , and stuffed the tobacco into his mouth . " Chad , you get that pad horse , and we 'll see . " Me ? " Chad stared at him . " You want the cream ? " Bastock spat disgustedly over the ring curb . " My God , " he said . " You two been yawping and blatting about horses for a whole week and now when I say to get one , you act like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , say so , and I 'll resign right here . " " Oh , Mr. Bastock ! " Caroline , letting go the grips , turned round . " It 's only we 're surprised . You said we could n't start riding for weeks ; did n't he , Chad ? " " Months , " Chad agreed . " He just wants to break my neck . But I 'll get the horse . " " Fetch the pad in here , Chaddy . If you saddle outside it 'll get wet . "  |p23I  " Ca n't I do anything ? " Caroline asked . " You can set here and hold my hand for me , " Bastock said complacently . " I need it . " When Chad came back with the cream horse out of the rain , they were sitting on the bottom tier of seats and Budlong , finished with shaving , had joined them with a line of lather drying down the wing of one ear . The rain made the tent dim , so the three figures seemed far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew steadily through the main entrance , smelling of raw dirt and wood smoke from the town fires . It hardly seemed to Chad a comfortable day to start the active art of equitation . But the horse accepted the pad tranquilly . " Some day , " Bastock said , " you 're going to realize how lucky you are to have a chance learning on a horse like him . He do n't do anything wrong . If you fall , it 's your own fault . " He looked the horse over for a minute before buckling on a longer rein . " Stand-up rein , " he explained . " Budlong , fetch me that pratique strap , will you ? " Budlong ambled over to where he had been shaving and ambled back with a long strap like a lunge strap , attached to what appeared to be a wide belt . Bastock accepted it dubiously . " There was n't a pratique strap in this entire shebang , " he said . " I had to have this thing made up last night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind about riding some time yesterday . " Now , Missy , " he was saying , " I got to buckle this onto you . " Puzzled , Caroline lifted her arms for him . " I had to guess the size , " he said . " But we left plenty of allowance . Does it feel all right ? " " Yes , " she said . " What 's it for ? " " So you wo n't break your neck , " Bastock said , eyeing her . " Maybe it 's too high . I never pratiqued a girl . Well , we 'll see . " He put the end of the long strap through a ring in the pad pommel , took his place near the center of the ring , and told Chad to mount the girl on the horse . " Set sideways , " he said . " Like a lady in a picture . "  | Chad felt her slight shivering . He grinned at her , but her face was intent and pale . When she met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , and turned to Bastock . " Take hold of the rein , Missy , " the little man said . Budlong had handed him a lunge whip , which he now cracked . The pad horse started easily . It almost seemed as if he knew what was up . He went like silk . Chad stepped over the ring curb , but he did n't join Budlong on the seats . " You do n't need to grip . Set up straight . You 've got the reins to balance with . You ca n't fall , Missy . Just think you 're setting in a chair in your best dress on the Main Street Hotel porch and feel easy . " " I would n't feel easy there ! " Caroline said . " I 'd be scared to death . " But it was surprisingly easy to sit the lolloping gait , with the slight inward slope the horse made following the curve . The color began to come back to her cheeks . Presently one hand let go the rein , and Bastock , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like a hawk , said , " Let it hang , if you do n't need it , Missy . " She did , riding with her hands slightly raised , and Budlong said , " Perty . " " Yes , she makes a picture , " Bastock agreed . " Now then , Missy , jump down . " As she obeyed , Bastock set himself ; the strap tightened , and she was swinging by the horse 's shoulder . The horse stopped of his own accord and Bastock let her down . " You see you ca n't hit the dirt if you want to when you 've got a pratique strap , Missy . Did it set all right ? " She was pulling it down in place , tucking her leotard into her trunks . " It felt fine , " she said breathlessly . " All right , Missy . Now , up you get and we 'll begin . " As soon as she was mounted and the horse in motion , Bastockp233directed her to get up on her hands and knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Spread your feet some . That 's it . " She looked unsteady , and she held tight at first ; but after a round or two , Bastock made her let go with one hand and take the reins ; then straighten up on her knees . At the third stride she slipped and toppled , but the pratique swung her forward . This time , however , she hung by the middle , both ends down ; and she was completely out of breath when the horse stopped . " Took your wind ? " Bastock asked . She gasped , " Yes , " and started to giggle . " I thought all my clothes were coming off . " Bastock grunted . " Get up , this ai n't a church picnic . You got to ride three rings on your knees . " Strangely , she did it ; and she was still erect on her knees when the horse stopped . Bastock said she was fine . Some riders , he explained , somersetted from their knees . It gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and you were half over before you knew you had started . " But it do n't look like so much , and you do n't get high off the horse . Now then , back on the pad , Missy , and Chad , you hold that nag . Now , get up on your feet . Like this . Put your left foot just ahead of where his hips are , and your right back of the pommel . That 's it . You face inward first . Facing out is harder . Do n't stiffen your knees , or you 'll get throwed the first move he makes . Hold onto the reins . Look at his ears . You 've got your feet lined up with the reins . Bring the left one nearer me . That 's pretty . By God , that 's pretty . Look at it , you big bezabor , " he said to Budlong . Budlong lifted impersonal eyes and went on chewing tobacco . But Chad saw what Bastock saw . She was pretty on a horse ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her look light . She toppled ; Bastock caught her ; and Chad shoved her back . She fell again , and again and again . Bastock gave over talking to her about how well she looked . She looked worse each time . And then , after half an hour , when Bastock had lost all patience and suddenly roared , " Pull in that God-damned rump , ca n't you ? " she made a circle of the ring , standing unsteadily , her feet slipping and shifting and her knees like hammers ; but she stood up . And when the horse stopped , Bastock was triumphant . " You 're going to ride , Missy . You 're going to ride high . By God . Get down . Budlong , get her a blanket . She 's valuable . You 'd get a blanket for a horse , would n't you ? Hurry up . " His black eyes stuck out at her ; he beamed and wiped his mouth . " My God , I 'm tired , " he said . Caroline 's knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Budlong escorted her to a ringside seat , wrapped her , and sat her down . " Now we 'll set and watch the comics , " he told her . Buckling the pratique on Chad , Bastock chuckled . They all felt satisfied , as if they had all contributed to her ride round the ring . Caroline herself looked proud , her eyes full of shine . Even Chad grinned when Bastock said , " Remind me if I forget to hold onto the strap , Chaddy . " " What do I do first ? " " Get on the horse . " Chad started the cream pad , got him galloping , and put his hand on the pommel . It was an easy vault , with the horse leaning towards him , and the pad was big as a door to light on . " My Crimus . " Bastock was sarcastic . " He 's a vaulter . Now do n't straddle him , set sideways like Caroline . Gawd , ai n't he pretty ? Your feet are too big , Chaddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , or you 'll scare the horse . Get up on your knees . There ai n't no sense stopping for a master rider like you . " Sitting the pad was fine ; but as soon as his tail got off it , Chad lost his security . He had to grab the pommel , as Bastock pointed out with loud scorn to Caroline . But in a moment he got his knees where they belonged and spread his feet on the tail of the pad , making a sort of triangle of his shins , and tried to straighten . The tendency of his knees to lift surprised him . Twice he started to reach for the pommel and Bastock yelled at him to watch thep235horse 's ears . " Look right through them . If you look down and watch the ground you 'll see you 're going in a circle . " Then he caught it ; and once he had it was easy to keep the position , for the horse 's gait was regular as clockwork . Bastock stopped the horse after two circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ride , too , " he said grudgingly . " But nobody 'll fall in love with you . Now , we 'll try standing up . " The first thing about standing that astonished Chad was the sudden decrease in the size of the pad . He took the position Bastock had described to Caroline , got a good grip on the stand-up rein , and nodded his head . At the first lift of the horse 's rump he nosedived . He had a flashing glimpse of Caroline 's intent face , of Bastock 's heels digging ruts through the grass , and then the strap caught him in the wind . He hit ground , but he was all right , except for a pain in his belly . " You ai n't doing much on that strap , " he complained . " I done enough to keep you from digging a hole . But we 'll get Budlong . He 's more your heft . " Budlong came over lazily and took the strap in one hand . " What am I supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when he starts swimming , " Bastock said . " Now get up there and keep your be-hind inside your pants , Chaddy . " Chad tried it again , springing his knees more freely . He began to have some respect for Shepley . The idea of ever even trying a Somerset was appalling . He tried to brace his right foot and take more of the rise in his left knee ; and suddenly he realized that he had made most of a full circle . It was the even gait of the horse that ironed out his trouble . As long as he followed the gait , he was all right . Then he heard clapping , and looked over towards Caroline , but found he was on the wrong side of the ring to see her , and suddenly he fell off , and Budlong nearly cut him in two . Budlong let him hang . " Do I let him down ? " he asked . Caroline was still clapping her hands . " You went round nearly two times , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've seen one or two worse , but it 's his big feet give him a head start , Missy . " He unbuckled the pratique strap . " We done enough for today . You 'll both feel sore tomorrow , probably . But maybe that will learn you that it 's more comfortable to stay on the horse 's back . " It was still raining . The drops formed on Caroline 's hair , lit on her face . Watching her out of the tail of his eye , Chad thought she seemed a lot older . She was getting to be nice looking , he thought , she had a pretty mouth , the thin upper lip was short , and when she turned and caught him looking at her , it was quick to smile . " I think it 's awfully nice we two can learn riding together , " she said . " Do n't you ? " " Oh , sure . " " I mean , " she said quickly , " I 'd be scared to death trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But knowing you 're trying it too makes it a lot easier . " " I feel that way too , " Chad said . " But you 're going to be a real rider , some day , Caroline . Why , you hardly ever been on a horse . " " Is n't he nice ? " she said . " He 's so careful . He tries so hard to go smooth and make it easy for us . I love him . " Stroking the peaceable cream-colored nose of the horse , she blushed suddenly under the rain . " I wonder why Pete wanted us to begin today . So sudden . He must have made up his mind about it yesterday , too . He had the pratique ready . " Chad said , " I been thinking about that too . " Huguenine 's Circus began the week of June 27 with less than a hundred admissions . Overnight all their paper in Auburn had been torn down and a whole new series of Burke and Walsh tacked in its place . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chadp237found one on the livery-stable door . It had a lovely cut , four times the size of any of Huguenine 's pictures , showing an elegantly drapedtent interior with four male equestrians on four Arab horses facingas many similarly mounted female riders . The females all wore ostrich plumes in their hats ; their leotards were trimmed likegrenadier uniform jackets except for lace ruffs at the throat ; and their trunks fitted the form . MAMMOTH ARENA AND AMPHITHEATERUnder the direction of Burke , Walsh &; Co . The above establishment will be opened in the City of Auburnon Tuesday , June 28 , 1836 . The Arena is newly and completelyfitted out , with a superior BAND OF MUSIC ; a first rate company of EQUESTRIANS , possessing unequaled talent ; and a stud of HANOVEREAN AND ARAB HORSES , which for beauty and management ; excel all previous exhibitions ever offered such a liberal and discerning community . All patrons are particularly invited to view the Arena while fitting up to prove how comfortable they will be seated . It is likewise " proper to state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as divert the genteel of sociey . " Upwards of eighty men and horses are occupied in this immenseestablishment . Boxes 50 cents ; Pit 25 cents . Performances will commence at half past to A.M. , and at 2 o'clock P.M. Box seats for 2000 people . Joe Duddy reported that along the store district the paper was twice the size of that one , with a picture of the elephant included , and a paragraph about the hyena . " I would n't mind paying twenty-five cents to see it , " he said . " I tore down some , and I drawed a bag and teats on the elephant , butdurned if a feller who saw it did n't believe it was so . We ca n't beat a show like that , Chad . " Chad could n't help feeling a hankering to see the big show himself . But he said , " Well , we 'll be standing different towns till weget to Lyons . " " Yeah , " said Joe . " But what do we do in Lyons ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him the kind of man who would leave it open to plain competition ... . Riding Jerry and leading the other two horses , there was n't any way a man could keep dry . The tent had weighed a ton taking down , and Bastock told them it would feel twice as heavy to put up . His belly was sore from the pratique strap . They had put in two hours that morning , and Caroline had made several turns of the ring standing up . Now and then during a flash of confidence she had given them glimpses of what she might turn into , and the way she looked then kept coming into Chad 's mind . He himself had n't done any better than he had on his first try . But he had enjoyed himself during the first part of the practice . They all had . Caroline 's face showed it ; and there was a feeling of all of them working together , with Budlong , Joe , and Bastock all making remarks about Chad , and telling Caroline she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only after Albany Yates came into the tent that they began to go badly . She had drifted in out of the rain , saying good-morning to them all , and hoping they did not mind her joining them . She stood close to Chad , watching Caroline thoughtfully with her grey eyes , and giving her generous praise . But Caroline almost at once began to commit faults so badly that Bastock lost patience ; and presently he took her off the horse and put Chad up and started to make savage remarks . The air of the tent changed completely . Only Albany seemed unconcerned . She said something pretty about them both and went out again . But the practice had fallen all apart . Neither of them could do anything right . In fifteen minutes Bastock gave the thing up . " Take him back , " he said . " Take yourselves away too . " Walking down to the barn , Caroline said , " Why did she have to butt in ? " " Why should n't she ? " Chad asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was nice about both of us . " " It was fine before she came in . " Caroline 's face was set . " I hate her . "  |p239Chad  was amazed . " Why , " he said , " if it had n't been for her you would n't be with the circus , probably . " " just the same , she 's always after something for herself . " Chad kept quiet . " First she wants Fred , and then she drops him , and then she takes up with him , and now she drops him again . She just turned him off . " " She did ? " Chad became attentive . Caroline turned to look at him . " She told him she did n't want to get married . She said there was n't any sense in doing it now . What does she want ? " " Well , I do n't blame her not wanting him . " " Then she ought n't to go with him , " Caroline said fiercely . " If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get spiteful . " " I 'm not . Just because she does something open-hearted once , I do n't see why I have to owe her everything all my life . " " She do n't expect that . " " What does she expect ? " Caroline bit her lip . " You think she 's just wonderful . So does everybody else . Go ahead , " she said . " See if I care . " She left him abruptly , her cheeks flaming , and walked off towards the hotel ... . Just before dark the rain let up and the wind blew hard for a few minutes , clearing the air . To Chad 's left a strip of pale yellow sky lay under the clouds . Ahead , the road led over rolling land . He thought they ought to be coming to Throopsville before long , and he decided to stop at the first tavern for a drink . If they had a fire going , he would stay long enough to get partly dried out ; anyway until the wagons came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet meadowland . It was too dark for him to see much of the country , only the shapes of trees and occasional farmhouses and barns against the pale westwardsky . The color had drained from it and the light was fading from the road . The horses splashed through puddles he could not see , their hoofs spanking the water smartly . He looked back for wagon lights , but there was no sign of them . Then , facing forward again , he saw a small cluster of lighted buildings stretching out along the level road and heard water falling in Owasco Creek . Throopsville was no more than a hamlet , and Clapp 's Tavern was easy to pick out . It had a liquorish breath , and a porch along the roadside front . Chad turned Jerry round the corner , hearing the voices inside peter out at the sound of horsehoofs in the slop of the yard . A back door opened , shooting light upon a sow with a spotted litter clustered against her mountainous dugs and a wetfoothen perched on her flank . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was , letting Chad stall the horses in the dark . " Trading horses ? " he asked when Chad had crossed the yard . " No . They belong to Huguenine 's Circus . " " Yeah ? There was a party of them come by in a wagon . They stopped here for a while . " He led the way into the taproom , where six or seven villagers were sitting round the stove . They looked at Chad when he said " Evening " to them and one of them said " Hello . " Mr. Clapp explained that Chad was with the circus . " Did n't get the name , " he said . " Hanna , " said Chad . " I 'll have some whiskey . You got any Bourbon ? " " Not here . Anyways , we call it corn . You ai n't a dough-face , ' are you ? " Chad grinned . " What is it ? " " Demmycrat . " A thin-faced man bit the word before he laid it down . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had one dough-face vote in this district last election , " he said . " We thrown the other out . How do you stand on the small-bills question , mister ? " " I like ' em , but I like big ones better , " Chad said.  | " Yes . But how 're you going to do business if banks ca n't print no money less'n five dollars ? The dough-faces have got the banks in their hip pockets and they 're trying to put a mortgage on the farmer so they can foreclose it . They hold up slavery to keep him down . They do n't let him send abolition through the mails ; that little dough-face Kendall 's closed the Post Office against it . And what was they afore they got to Washington ? Oh , Andy Jackson was a soldier , I do n't hold against him . But look at Taney and Kendall , two-dollar mules ! You put them kind of animals in power and right away you got a solid party twice the size you figured on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes they 're all snarled in one big lump and then where are you ? " Chad said , " Where ? " " Yes , " said the thin-faced man . Mr. Clapp said , " I voted for Seward and I 'm going to keep right on voting for him till he gets elected . " A voice remarked from the corner , heavily , " Two-dollar mules can make manure just like horses . " " How do you stand on Masonry ? " asked the thin-faced man . " I do n't stand on anything but my own feet , " Chad said . Someonelaughed . As if he were reproving him the man who had talked about manure and mules said , " In France they say every other child is a bastard . " Nobody wished to dispute this statement . After a moment Chad asked , " How long ago was the light rig here ? " Mr. Clapp said , " Couple of hours , I guess . They got some supper . They did n't appear like circus people . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . One of them 's staying here now . She said she wanted to wait for the wagons . " " She ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Clapp . " She 's in the kitchen with the wife . " He pointed with his thumb . He did n't need to . The door was open . Looking through , Chad saw Caroline Trid . She was staring at him , her eyes large in her thin face.  | He put his glass on the end of the plank bar and said , " Excuse me a minute , " and went through the door . " What did you stay here for ? " She said , " Mrs. Clapp , let me make you acquainted with Mr. Hanna . " The reproving formality of her voice embarrassed him . He turned to see a witchlike old woman in a corner take her hands from the dishpan and wring them and wipe them on her apron . Her bright eyes shifted rapidly over Chad before settling on his face . She said , " These dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get much help . The glasses I wash ! Take him to the parlor , if you want to , honey . Here 's a candle . " Caroline , thanking her , took the candle , and led Chad through a door towards the front of the house . Another door off a musty stair hall opened into a dim little room that had a looking glass , a bunch of dry flowers on a table , four chairs set facing , and a thin but blossomy carpet . It made Chad think of Elias Proops 's remark about another place : " Only a ghost could chew tobacco there . " The candle shine pooled in the mirror and the blank windows equally . It lit Caroline 's breast and face more brightly . Across the room , Chad had another view of her , her square shoulders with her bonnet hanging on them , her soft hair , and her own face above it , watching him . Beyond the door , now closed , the voices murmured in the taproom . " Why 'd you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question and her head tilt to his face , and then he looked at hers , and he saw there were tears in her eyes . " What 's the matter ? " " Oh , I just could n't stand it in the wagon . " Her voice gained strength with talking , but she kept it very low . " I did n't want to sit with Albany , and she and Shepley would n't say a word , and Mrs. Pamplon was so scared , and it was raining . And then Fiero tried to hold my hand . " She smiled . " Was n't it silly ? " She was studying the candle flame , cradling the stick in bothp243hands . " If it was raining , I planned to ride with Mrs. Huguenine . " When he did not answer , she raised her eyes . " And I kept thinking about the way I was this morning . Getting mad and telling you I did n't care what you thought . But I did . We did n't speak all day because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . And if I 'd gone on with the wagon , I 'd have had to wait till tomorrow . " She stopped . He said after a minute , " You waited here just to see me . " " Yes . " She was looking again at the candle in her hands . In the mirrorhe saw the bend of her neck between the bonnet brim and the soft clustering of hair . She meant what she said ; she had waited there for him . But she was telling him something else , making an offer ; all he had to do was pick it up , and it would belong to him  --  like finders keepers . Ever since he could remember he had had to take care of himself . He had always lived alone since he ran away from the orphanage . Even there , except for the little girl Marie , he had been by himself . He had never had a friend until he came to Canastota . Elias was a friend , but he was an old man ; and Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone fox , Elias used to say of him , and he had always liked the idea ; he could put his foot in his pocket whenever he liked and light out . And he had thought of Caroline as just a youngster , too ; one who knew more than was good for her , perhaps . But now he was n't so sure . He could see himself in the mirror like a colt put on a lungingstrap for the first time , half scared , half interested , shying off and on . Then , realizing they had been a long time there , he looked at her . There was a patience in the way she waited , as if she understood what he was feeling , as if time were a candle in her hands . Catching two threads out of the light , the locket chain made links of them , and following them down to where they ended he could see the soft pressure of her breathing inside the bodice of her dress . It was a grey-blue dress , it must have been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after chasing Albany in his mind so long , he should be on the edge with a girl in clothes of hers . But he had n't thought of Albany lately , hardly at all ; and the girl inside the dress was n't Albany . He did n't know anything about Albany ; but he knew all about how this girl was put together , seeing her in tights every day , watching her do exercises , putting her on the pad horse . He just had n't bothered to think ; and now he had only to put his hand on her shoulder . He said , " If you keep holding the candle that way , I 'm liable to get burned . " She lifted her face then , searching his . " Burned ? " she said . " How ? " " This way . " She dropped the candlestick , and the candle broke free as it struck the floor , rolled on the carpet , and went out . For an instant she felt like a rod in his hands . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in love with him , he could feel it ; and that she had been in love with him , storing it for him . It was something he had never had . It made him feel proud to kiss her . It seemed to him as if it had been intended to happen ; he could n't get over it . Each time he felt like kissing her again , she was ready . But she was n't like the girls he used to pick up along the towpath . He was a person to her and she intended it to last ; she was in love ; he could feel it taking living shape beside the dried flowers on the table . He looked over her shoulder after a while , at the blank windows , and saw four wagon lights pulling slowly along the road . He did n't say anything , but turned her so that they stood side by side in the dark window , looking out , her hip pressing his , and his hand on her waist . She said , " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are we going to tell them now ? " he said . " I do n't care . " " We 've got to stop them anyway , before they get by . "  | " Let 's not tell them tonight , " she said . He fumbled for the candle , picked it up , and put it in its stick upon the table . They went outside by the hall door . " I wish I could go with you , " she said . " It would take too long to get the saddle out . You ca n't ride in that dress anyway . " Huguenine 's team pulled into the light and Mr. Huguenine regarded them with stolid amazement . Chad said , " Caroline stayed over here to ride with you . Can she get in with Mrs. Huguenine ? " Huguenine scratched his head . " Why , I guess so . But what 's the idea ? " " It 's her idea , " Chad said , grinning at Caroline . " Never mind . Let her get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Huguenine had risen from her bed ; the pay wagon rocked as she fumbled for the door . She opened it , standing there in a nightgown that looked like a tent , the hair upon her forehead sprouting a battery of curlers . " You come inside with me , dearie , and tell me what that monkey has been doing with you . " " Where 's the horses ? " Mr. Huguenine asked Chad as the door closed . " They 're in the barn . I 'm getting them now . " " All right , " said Mr. Huguenine . " Geddap , you two . " He cracked his whip , and the wagon rolled along . Chad went after the horses . Mrs. Clapp was standing on the back porch , her eyes like a bird 's . " How 'd it go , Mr. Hanna ? " " Fine , " he said . " But we dropped the candle . There may be a grease spot on the carpet . " She nodded . " Never mind , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TENTING SEASONp246Nobody but Mrs. Huguenine said anything about Caroline 's staying behind at Clapp 's Tavern . Huguenine had called Mrs. Huguenine out of the treasury wagon when they were raising the round-top on the Port Byron lot , and she had put her heft on one of the ropes . The canvas was like sheet lead to raise , still wet , but the sun promised to dry it out before packing time .. Mrs. Huguenine raised her fat arms , with the rope wound round her wrists , and just sat down . The canvas could n't resist her . And she said to Chad , " Well , so you 're going to get married . " Chad was a little startled . " Caroline tell you ? " " Dearie , what do you expect she did , me and her in a wagon that size and I having made up my mind ? Of course she did . Cried some and said she had never dreamed of it . She said she had never known what it was to be happy in her life before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped she would make a leastways decent wife . Just like any other girl in love . " Chad said , " You think it 's all right ? " It seemed pretty serious , getting married , now that Mrs. Hugueninewas outlining the way a girl felt about it . " I do n't know how much money you 've got . " " I 've saved about twenty dollars . " " She do n't make anything , " Mrs. Huguenine said . " I do n't know . A man ought n't really to get married unless he 's saved up fifty dollars . In the old times , you did n't need cash money . You got a cow off your parents and you took up free land with an axe and a rifle . I wish I 'd been born in that time . I 'd have liked it . But nowadays it 's different . Folks are trading in stores for their food and they spend money on their clothes . You 're both young , though , and that 's the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got her looks . "  |p247She  dropped the rope , which had left red trenches in her wrists , and watched Joe Duddy driving the staubes . Joe swinging the twelve-pound gimmix was something she liked to see ; the tent peg looked as if it were going down through butter ; and the crack of the sledge on the seasoned wood had an almost beautiful rhythm . " I wish you joy , Chad , " she said . " Both of you . And do n't worry . I 've not even told A. D. " She lumbered away briskly towards the wagon to clean up her breakfast dishes and get some washing done and Chad started setting up the seats and lugging in the boards . Bastock asked when he and Caroline wanted to practise and he said as soon as he had got Oscar 's meat . He went down the street towards the canal . Off and on during the night he had heard the boat horns , and after he had picked up the usual eight pounds of lean , and a salted mackerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killing time to watch the boats . Early as it was , there were plenty of them , loading and passing through . Barrels of flour were being rolled onto one close by ; the flour must come from the mill , it was one of the biggest in the state , and the roll of its run of twelve stones was like a distant thunder over the noise of the basin . A line boat was draggingwest right in front of him , carrying immigrants , with one young couple sitting side by side on the top deck , staring right and left , as if what they saw looked strange . It made Chad feel good to see it all again and hear the shouts , the cracks of the whips , the heavy blowing of the horses ; it took him back to the Yellow Bud ; it seemed mysterious to think of that same boat having hauled through Canastota . Maybe Elias Proops had seen it go by ; if he had he 'd have noticed the immigrant girl . Her hair was like wheat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling too , to come out of the country at night , so far away , . and find the same canal , the same still ditch of water ; it was more impressive than following its towpath , to come out on it that way and see the boats hauling their slow pace . Another boat came by , more immigrants on board . They were coming all the time , feeding through , to strike out west from Buffalo . That country must be filling fast . Illinois was a state , Indiana , and they said Michigan territory would become one any time . They had spilled across the Mississippi River , and Missouri was a state ; but when he was in the orphanage most of that land had been Indian country . Some day he planned to go out there and see it . A boat horn droned by his ears , like a jackass bawling , dinning his head . He looked at the steersman , a thick-set man with heavy hands and thickets sprouting from his ear holes . Chad read the name on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.Y . He had driven for that boat a while ; and he remembered the man 's strap , his drunken roaring coming towards the stable to rouse him for the night trick . Now the captain 's eyes , following the shore line , came to Chad and passed along with the even , deliberate glide of the boat . He did n't recognize the shivery little boy with freckles in a white scared face . " There 's your pay , " the captain used to say , putting eleven dollarson the table in the cabin . " Here 's the receipt . Make your mark here . " And Chad would put a cross beside the ridged thumbnail on the paper . Then he would stand aside , and the captain would get the other hoggie to sign another receipt for the same money . " There , boys , " he would tell them , pocketing the money , " we 're all legal and businesslike . Now I 'll just make my mark " ; and he would pull the heavy strap from his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be amusing to take a passage on that man 's boat ; it had four bunks in the cargo space and the captain was always obsequious to passengers . Then he remembered that he would have to get passage for two . He was going to be married . It was something he had never actually figured on until it happened ; but riding up the road from Throopsvillelast night , he had got to thinking how nice it would be to end that trip in a hotel room , in a bed already warmed for him . He hitched up his parcels and turned away from the canal , wondering whether a girl thought the same kind of thoughts before shep249was married . He did n't know about Caroline . Sometimes he thought she knew a lot ; and then at times she seemed like a child . She had been that way for a minute in the dead little parlor ; and then she had suddenly seemed ready for anything . Well , he thought , they were fixed for the summer , as long as the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on as a rider , they would both be making money . They would be almost wealthy if that happened . They could have champagne wine , even ; he wondered how much a bottle of it would cost and what it tasted like . He would like to buy a bottle the night they got married if it did n't come too high . As he turned up the street , he saw her ahead of him , and he lengthened his stride to catch up . " Hello , " he said . It made her start . She turned quickly , seeing who it was , and blushed . Her eyes were shy . " Good morning , Chad , " she said . " You ready for practice ? " he asked . But he saw she was ; she was dressed in her tights ; her legs showed thin and long under the edge of the cloak . " Yes , " she said , walking along beside him . But she kept her eyes straight ahead . After a minute Chad said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " She turned her eyes , then looked into his , saying nothing . " You meant it when you said you 'd marry me ? " he asked her . " Mrs. Huguenine told me you 'd told her . " " Yes . I did n't know if you 'd meant it , though . My people are n't ... " He said , " I have n't got any at all , Caroline . I do n't even know who they were . " " I had to tell Mrs. Huguenine . I had to tell someone . " " We wo n't be rich , you know , " he said . " But we ought to get along all right this summer . I can get a job this winter . " She nodded . " I do n't mind being poor . And we wo n't stay that way . Not when we learn to ride . " A little of the shyness had gone.  | " I wo n't ever be much of a rider , " Chad said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than me in a year . " " Maybe you could get to be a circus agent , " she said . " Like Mr. Bisbee . He makes nearly as much as a rider . I guess more than a female . " She looked at him . " You 'd be good at running a circus , I think . You 'd have ideas , good ones . Would n't it be fun if we ever owned our own show ? " Chad agreed , thinking to himself that that was n't likely to happen to people like them . " Probably , though , " he said , " you 'll want a house to live in . " She shook her head . " I like traveling , Chad . I would n't mind it a bit . I was thinkinglast night how a person could fix over a wagon like that treasury wagon and make it seem a lot nicer . " They were getting near the lot . Under the sun the round-top had lost some of its soddenness . It was drying out fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad found his tongue stumbling . " Maybe we could get married Saturday , in Palmyra . Then we 'd have Sunday , and I guess Mr. Huguenine would give me the day off . Would you be willing to do that ? " " Yes . " She looked at him , her eyes again shy , and looked away . Maybe he had smelled the fresh meat , or maybe the sun had got to him , warming his decrepit hide , or maybe Joe Duddy had left too much water on the floor of the cage wagon where he liked to sit down ; anyway , the lion roared . The sound was heartening . It was the first healthy sound Oscar had made since the Saturdayshowing in Auburn . Both of them went to the cage wagon and watched Joe Duddy feed him his meat . " He 's taking hold pretty good this morning , " Joe said . " I think he 's a nice old animal , " Caroline said . " It must be pitiful , when you 're old , being caged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her voice , covered a free piece of meat with one paw , raised his yellow eyes , and coughed at all of them ....  |p251Bastock  was becoming excited over Caroline 's progress . " Once in a while you strike a natural-born rider , " he said . " And she 's one . Look at her , she 's been up four times , but she can do straight riding and look pretty at it . She does the foot-to-pommel and we 'll try her on the foot-around in a couple of days . She 'll learn it . She knows how to handle her body , so when I tell her what to do she do n't need a framed picture to figure it Out . " He was n't exaggerating . Everyone who came to watch the practicesaw she was good ; and Mr. Huguenine said , " When she gets ready to go in the ring with it , we 'll have Bisbee look her over . If he says it 's all right , I 'll put her on the payroll . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bastock said . " Supposesomebody who knew something about running circuses came around and took her from you . " " I would n't go , " Caroline called , seeing Mr. Huguenine 's worried face . She was like a bird on the horse ; she had confidence ; and even in her plain circles of the ring she conveyed her own excited pleasure to the onlooker . It made Chad think of Albany 's riding ; Bisbee would call it " class . " They did n't see anything of Albany , except at show times ; and little of Fred . Fred himself was not riding as well . He had failed twice on the Somerset ; he acted as if he had lost his ambition . Speaking about him , Bastock told Chad and Caroline : " You 've got to love riding if you 're going to be a rider . Take Fred . He do n't . He can work himself up to ride if he 's mad or feeling fine . A real rider can go in on a wet ring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do a toe-to-mouth with water dropping down her back . " The haul to Clyde was the toughest one the show had had . They rolled down into the Seneca Valley after sunset , and passed through Montezuma village without stopping , to make the corduroyacross the marshes before the light failed completely . The treasury wagon got along well enough ; but the tent wagon sunk the logs entirely under the marsh water , and before it had made a quarter mile , the team from the cage wagon had to be hooked on ahead of the four-horse hitch to bring it out of the slack , and then unhitched as soon as the big wagon was rolling and taken back for the cage . It was dark long before they got through ; the horses were half wild with the bad footing , the threatening water , and the mosquitoes that swarmed into their ears . Their shoes dug at the slippery logs , tearing splinters out of them ; they dodged holes by a miracle ; and the only thing that kept them moving was the lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four miles they had used up four hours ; and dawn was breaking when they tugged into Clyde village . It was light enough for Chad to see that the Huguenine paper had been replaced on the livery-stable door by one of Burke and Walsh 's big sheets announcing their show at Lyons next day . A sleepy stablehand asked him what they expected to get out of showingin Clyde . Half the village had made plans to go over to Lyons , he said . Chad said he did n't know . It hardly seemed worthwhileputting up the tent at all , let alone having a practice session . But Bastock insisted on working Caroline anyway . " Losing a day now she 's started is enough to set her back a week . " The little man set himself on a bucket and drank water from a dipper while the other skinners just lay anywhere and went to sleep . Caroline had given Chad her cloak for a pillow ; he rolled it up under his head and lay on the canvas flap from the cage wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by regularly as clockwork ; and if he squeezed his eye up he could see Bastock moving slowly round the pole , the pratique strap in his hand , his dark eyes red and half closed ; the grass smelled of dew , and the thud of the hoofs was like the ticking of a clock ; and he felt himself drifting down into the damp grass smell . But a sudden bugling note in Bastock 's voice jerked him awake . " She done a foot-around . Just as neat , by Jesus , " he was yelling.  | " Wake up , you big bezabors . She done a foot-around . " He glared redly at them ; and then his face fell sheepishly . " Guess I must have got dozy . I was n't hardly watching , and all of a sudden she done it . " Caroline 's face was flushed . She was sitting on the pad , looking breathless , while the horse lolloped easily and tirelessly round and round . It was like a clock running down and Chad got a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where 's the pratique ? " Bastock gaped slowly . Then he looked at the circling horse , at Caroline on the pad , and then down at the bucket he was sitting on . The pratique strap lay on the grass at his feet . " Oh my God , " he said . " I had hold of it ; and then I got thirsty and I must have set down and forgot . " Caroline nodded . " I wanted to try it without the strap . I saw you were n't noticing when you dropped it , so I unbuckled it . I wanted to see if I would feel scared . " " Did you ? " asked Chad . She shook her head . " Not after the first circle . " She smiled at him , then looked quickly towards Bastock . He had hollered " Whoa ! " to the horse ; and as soon as the animal stopped he said , " Get down . " His voice puzzled them both ; but Caroline obediently flipped her long legs and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " Pick up that strap . Give it to me . " He doubled the leather , swung it suddenly , giving her a full cut across the backs of her thighs . The snap of the striking leather was like a pistol shot . Caroline stiffened and went white . Chad scrabbled to his feet and yelled , " Hey , there . " But the little man flung the strap away . " Next time you get a notion to go off on your own hook , rememberthat . " His voice trembled with rage . " If you want to learn , you 'll do it my way . See ? Did I tell you you was ready to ride without no pratique ? "  | " No , " said Caroline . She looked as if she would like to rub her legs ; she seemed ready to cry . It made Chad mad . " You got no busines licking her whatever you say , " he shouted . " Give me that pratique . I 'll show him how it feels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broke her damned neck , " he said . " It ai n't yourbusiness anyway . I 'm learning her . You keep your mouth shut . " " It is my business , " Chad said grimly . " I 'm marrying her . " " You 're what ? " " Marrying her . " " The hell you are . " The little man 's red eyes swelled . " Who told you you could do that ? " Caroline had picked up the strap . " I did , " she said . " Now who wants to lick who next ? " The way she said it delighted Chad ; it was n't what he would have expected of her at all , and he grinned at Bastock . But Bastock could not get the other idea out of his head . " Well , I 'll be bitched , " he said . " You 're all of you tired out , " Caroline said . " That 's why you 're mad . And I promise I wo n't do anything again without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe I was hasty , " he admitted . Budlong said , " For a hasty man you certainly did smack her . It woke Joe right up . " Joe grinned sheepishly . " I met a pigeon once and she liked ... " Pete turned on him . " Shut your mouth . In front of a girl ! " " You done the smacking , did n't you ? My God , I did n't dastuse a strap . " They were getting steamed up again , like a bunch of steamboats , valves popping just about every so often . Caroline had never seen a steamboat , but she could tell pressure when she saw it . " I ai n't mad , " she said . " Why should everybody else get mad ? " In the silence they could hear the tunk-tunk where Fiero was practising his knife-throwing back of the tent . He would throwp255the clutch of knives and then walk up to the board and pull them out . When he got to the board he would talk to himself , scolding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If things went too badly , he would complain about Caroline being so tall . It made Joe happy to hear him suffer . " That crazy Dago , " he said , and , as if he had heard it , Fiero stuck his head under the canvas , got up on the inside , carrying his knives fanwise in his left hand , and announced , " I make three perfectoes today . Maybe you lost a little hair . Phoo . What is some hair on a young lady ? " He beamed . Bastock said , " That 's fine , Fiero . But I ai n't letting no rider of mine stand for them knives . Not till I know you 're good . " Fiero showed his teeth . " Yes , yes . You are right . But the trouble is I am too God-damn good . If I was n't so good , I would n't put the knife in the head . Tomorrow I do three more perfectoes and the day after I do three more , then I put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SignorinaCarolina . We get on the posters , do n't you think ? " " I do n't think . Go ask Bisbee . Anyway , she 'll be Mrs. Hanna by the time you stick a knife into her . " " Mrs. Hanna ? Signora Hanna . " He shook his head . " The name is no good . " He recollected himself and turned to Chad . " I felicitateyou , you and Miss Trid both . " He smiled tragically . Joe murmured , " I bet he was planning to marry her himself . " " Why not ? " Bastock said , watching the juggler stride out of the tent . " He told me once it was a lot better to be married to your target because if you hit her she ca n't testify against you . Probably he 's scared now . " He wiggled his shoulders . " All the better . He wo n't be in such a hurry to start sticking her . " Budlong said , " That was a pretty name he called her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill her with . " Chad shook his head . " I ai n't going to be married to a Dago . If I was managing this shebang , I would turn all the names American . Then we 'd have a talking point against the big shows . I bet people would like it . Americans for America ; riding against the talent of Europe . " Bastock nodded thoughtfully . " I would n't wonder you were right , Chaddy . Why do n't we just call her Carolina ? I never figured out why Albany did n't go under her own name , playing New York State . How do you like Carolina , Missy ? " " I think it 's nice . " " Just Carolina , " Chad said . " People will try to figure out who she is and why she 's named that . They 'll start talking . " " Well , " said Bastock . " I would n't wonder if she was using it sooner than we planned . " " What you talking about ? " asked Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got an idea of it , that 's all . " Bastock refused to be worked on . He coiled the pratique strap . " Will she wear a skirt or will she wear trunks ? " Joe asked . He stared frankly at Caroline . " She sure has a pretty leg , but a buttock ... " " You shut up . " " Down in Virginia they come fatter , " Budlong said . " It 's a queer thing . I always figured it was their partiality to smoked ham . " " Bisbee and the gaffer will dress her , " Bastock said . Chad did n't enter the discussion . He took the pad horse by the cheek strap and led him out of the tent with Caroline alongside . She said , " I wonder what Pete is figuring on . " " I do n't know . " " I would n't dare to ride before an audience , " she said . Then she looked under the horse 's head at him . " Would you like me to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . I like you in trunks . I think it would be easier riding . " " Yes . " She wrinkled her nose thoughtfully . " A skirt is morep257ladylike , though . Those gauze ones . Like what a dancer wears . I saw a picture of one once . I 'd like to look like her . " " You look all right whatever you 've got on , " Chad said . She glanced sidewise at him , and looked away . She was pleased . " I 'm going to be awful scared though . She reached up to pat the horse . He arched his neck for her . " He 's good , " she said . " He 's nice . I love him . It 's funny I never thought to ask his name . What is it ? " " I do n't know , " Chad said . She was amazed . " Has n't he ' got one ? " " No , they just call him the pad horse . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes me , too . He likes both of us . He ought to have a name , " she said excitedly . Her earnestness surprised Chad ; but it pleased him too , and he had to agree with her . " Yes , he ought to . " " Why do n't we name him ? He could have a name with us both , then . What would you call him ? " Chad said , " You want short names for horses . Like Dick , or Prince , or Buck . " " Buck , " she said soberly . " When I joined out I thought he was the most beautiful , loveliest horse that ever was . But now I think  --  he is . He 's got to have a name . It would n't be nice otherwise . " " He is a good horse , " Chad said . " He 's handsome . " " He 's faithful and he knows what to do . He would n't ever go wrong with a rider , ever . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could see the barn ahead , the roof rising up behind the hotel , and there were some people on the porch watching them . Caroline said shyly , " I 've thought of a name , but it is n't a short one . " " What is it ? " " Jonathan . " " I do n't know , " Chad said . " What 's it for ? "  | " He was a faithful friend , " she said . " Once when Pa was away , Ma took me and Andrew and Paul to the church picnic . And a man told us children a story after eating . I do n't remember what it was about , except battles and a king fighting against savage people . I do n't remember his name , but he had a friend named Jonathan . And Jonathan always looked out for him , and he died fighting for him . I 've always remembered him . " " Then I think it 's a good name , " Chad said . " Do you really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short if we want to . " " I shall always call him Jonathan . " She stroked the horse . " Do you like that name , Jonathan ? " He pricked cream-colored ears . " I think he knows it 's his name , " she said . They had got used to people staring at them . Generally they paid no attention ; but the voices on the hotel porch were loud , and one of them was Mr. Huguenine 's . " By God , you ca n't do it ! " he was saying . " Well , I am . " The second speaker was Mr. Burke . He looked just the same , in his sober black clothes . His blue eyes were icily contained ; he studied Mr. Huguenine the way he would study a penned bull . Huguenine not only looked like a penned bull , he bellowed like one . For a mild man it was extraordinary . Either he was in bad trouble , Chad thought , or he was mad as hell . Huguenine was both . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no show without her . " Mr. Burke flicked a long ash off his segar . " I told you to watch out , Huguenine . I gave you warning . But you decided to butt in anyway . You cut into our route . Of course it 's going to ruin you . That 's the whole idea . "  |p259He  reminded Chad of Mrs. Mott picking beetles off her frontyardflowers . She would take them cleverly by the head , and pinch . The sweat rolled down Huguenine 's face . " We ai n't hurt your business , " he said . " We 're a little show . I took the mortgage just to help the feller out . I do n't expect to make big money out of it . I just want to pay up on my own investment . You ai n't got no legal right to one route any more than I have to another . " Anyone but Huguenine could have seen it was no use arguing . " Sure , the route belongs to anybody , " Burke agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the money to see it 's mine , too . There just ai n't room for any but Flatfoot shows here . " He drew on his segar , studied the ash , and pointed it the way a schoolteacher would his rod . " I can get along without Lady Lillian . But you ca n't . I can afford to hire her even when I do n't need her . But she 's a good act , " he conceded graciously . " The horse is hers , too , so she brings him along . You have n't got a prayer . " So that was it . That was what they 'd talked about in Auburn . Albany had known all week . Chad 's eyes strayed over the porch . The circus people made a group at one end : the Pamplons with worried eyes , translating what they heard in their French minds ; Fiero , flashing eyes and teeth uncomprehendingly and smiling hard at Mr. Burke ; Ike Wayfish , with the skirts of his clown coat hanging over the rails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end three or four hotel inmates tried to appear not to listen , and in the front door between them , the proprietor , leaninghis hand against the jamb , estimated the likelihood of trouble . Mr. Huguenine gulped . " I got a contract , " he said . " By God , I 've got a contract . " " Sure , " said Mr. Burke . " I do n't doubt it . But she 's breaking i t . " I 'll get a lawyer , " said Huguenine . " I 'll bring you into court , so help me God . " " Go ahead , " said Mr. Burke . " See where that gets you . " " I 'd rather go to the poorhouse than be rode off by you . "  | " You probably will , " Mr. Burke said , tilting his head . " Mr. Brewster , " he said to the proprietor , " tell your groom to bring my rig around front as soon as the lady 's bags are in . And hitch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ready by now , " he remarked to the company at large . His eyes caught sight of the cream pad and Chad and Caroline . " Hello , " he said . Chad said , " Hello . " Mr. Burke smiled evenly . Chad said , " Suppose we start making trouble . You 're quite a long ways from your show . " Mr. Burke continued to smile , but his eyes chilled . " I would n't advise you to try it . " He tilted his head back and called for Mr. Brewster . " Sheriff inside ? Tell him I 'd like to see him . " Even before the sheriff appeared , wiping Burke 's whiskey from his lips with his shirt sleeve , Chad saw there was nothing Huguenine could possibly do . Mr. Burke said , " We 've had kind of a disagreement , sheriff . " " Yep ? " The sheriff looked Mr. Huguenine over . " Yep , " he said . He leaned against the doorjamb . " This is a nice orderly town , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the sheriff . He looked dubious , but he was willing to be told by a man of Mr. Burke 's obvious importance . " I guess you only allow moral shows here ? " " I guess so . " Mr. Burke uncrossed his legs and recrossed them . " Have a segar , sheriff ? " " Much obliged . " The sheriff took the segar , bit it , and examined Mr. Huguenine throughout the process . Nobody said anything , and in the silence they heard the quick light heel taps of Albany on the stairs . She came out dressed for driving , her bonnet tied down snugly . She stopped for a moment , looking them over , and then she smiled . " Good-bye , everybody , " she said.  | " Albany . " Mr. Huguenine was hoarse . " You ai n't just going to quit on me ? On all of us ? " " I 'm sorry , " she said . She sounded sorry . Then she glanced at Mr. Burke and arranged the ends of her shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I accepted it . " " I know , " Huguenine said . " But you might have told me . I got this town billed with you . I got Lyons and Palmyra billed . Why , I got you billed all the way out beyond Albion now . Besides , you signed a contract . " " Did I ? I 'm sorry . But Mr. Burke asked me not to mention it . " Her chin came up , bringing the bow of the bonnet ribbons with it . " Which one of you would n't do the same if you got the offer ? " she asked defiantly . " I want money , and Burke and Walsh are going to pay it to me . " She offered her hand to Mr. Burke , who had risen , and he tucked it in his arm and escorted her down the steps . A groom brought the rig round the corner from the barn and cramped the wheel while Mr. Burke handed her up . Her bag was back of the seat . Another man led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not too short , " she admonished . " He likes to make play . " She smiled at the man . " All right , Miss Yates ? " Mr. Burke asked . " My saddle , " she said suddenly . " I 've got a better saddle all waiting for you . Brand-new . Englishmade . " He climbed in , settled himself , flicked the ash clean , and picked up the reins . He glanced back at Jonathan . " Want to deal on that pad horse , Huguenine ? " Chad heard Caroline draw a sharp breath . But Huguenine said , " No . " " I 'll make you a cash offer . " " Make me a dozen , " said Huguenine . " And go to hell . I hope you break your neck . " Mr. Burke said , " Ready ? " to Albany , and , when she nodded , started the horses . They went down the street at a smart trot , neither of them looking back . Jonathan lifted his head and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was straightened out by the lead rope and the dust was against his chest . " Well , " Chad said , " I might as well stable you . " He led the cream-colored horse round the porch . Caroline said , " I wonder where Fred is . " Nobody knew where Shepley was , and nobody else seemed interested . Huguenine sagged off the porch and plodded away towards the tent ; the Pamplons stared vacuously at Caroline for a moment , before going inside to their rooms , and Fiero followed their examplewith a sad but encouraging smile for Caroline . Ike Wayfish continued to sit on the rail , and when he saw that Caroline did not intend to follow the others , he cleared his throat companionably . " You ca n't blame her . She 's wanted a chance in a big show for years . " " I suppose not , " Caroline said . " But I do n't see why Mr. Burke had to do it . " " It 's this syndicate , the Flatfoots . They dass n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other business . " " Are they so big ? " " They surely are . They 've got four or five shows . Some they own and some they just rent stock to . They get wild animals in Africa and bring them over . They have to show a profit ; they do n't care what becomes of the people they ride out . If you get strong enough so they ca n't drive you out , they buy you in . With a show like this it 's cheaper to ride you out . If Burke and Walsh do n't want Albany next year , they 'll find her another show or they 'll drop her . But she 's good enough to stick , I guess . " " What do you think Mr. Huguenine is going to do ? " Wayfish put his hands on his knees , found a loose thread on one , and picked at it . " I do n't know . He ca n't think of anything without Bisbee around . " The people at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , the men frankly looking atp263Caroline 's faded tights , though the cloak partly covered them . Caroline felt better when Chad finally came round the hotel cornerand joined them in the sun . He asked , " Do you think we 'll show in Lyons now ? " " I do n't know , " Wayfish said . " A. D. 's a stubborn cuss . " " It wo n't do us much good , I guess . " " No . " Inside the hotel a clock struck eleven . " Heavens ! " Caroline exclaimed . " I 'll have to get ready for the parade . " " I 'll wait here for you , " Chad said . She gave him a quick grateful smile . " Caroline 's a real nice girl , " Ike Wayfish observed . He boosted himself off the rail . " Want a drink ? " " No thanks . " Chad sat down alone , conscious of the stares of the porchsittersbut ignoring them . He tried to figure it out . They had Shepley and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , they ought to be able to get along somehow . He wondered how much money Albany 's going would save the show in salary . If they broke down he ought to be able to get work somewhere . He could support himself easily enough ; but getting married altered things . Still , Caroline would n't expect a lot , not the way she had been raised . They ought to get along . Maybe they better put off the champagne wine . He noticed that the porch-sitters were still staring at him , and he wondered what they would think of a circus hand trying to figure how he could get married just the same as any young man . The performance in Clyde was dismal . Though the town could n't have known that the star equestrienne had quit , there had beenp264not more than three dozen paid admissions , and the only applause came from a few small boys who had sneaked under the canvas . There had been no point in putting them out . The only person who showed no reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same degree of perspiring uneasiness that he showed in a full tent . He stumbled over the " gymnats " exactly as he always did . His only pause came when Lady Lillian 's act should have come on . He started to announce her , recollected himself , and for the first time actually got his chewing tobacco into his mouth . He bit hard and bawled to the three dozen confused spectators that owing to an unfortunate episode in Port Byron in which Huguenine 's Great and Only International Circus 's star equestrienne had broken both legs and a collarbone , the act had been temporarily discontinued . They would pass on to the even more startling performanceof the world 's leading high-rider , the great Signor Rossello with his death-defying disregard for the laws of gravity in his somerset on the back of his galloping horse . It was an improvisationto feel proud of and Mrs. Huguenine clapped heartily . The main trouble was that Fred Shepley refused even to attemptthe somersault . He had been sullen , speaking to no one before the parade and keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to knock down some of the seats , and then without a word went off to the hotel . The skinners tore down the round-top and stowed it , and the rest of the companygathered at the lot to hear what Mr. Huguenine would have to say . They were waiting when he finally emerged from the treasury wagon , where he had been making a recount of the day 's receipts . His face was glum . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked irascibly . " We ought to get started . " " We going to Lyons ? " Wayfish asked . " Yes . " Mr. Huguenine bit the word and laid it down . " We going to show ? " " We 're advertised , ai n't we ? "  | " Burke and Walsh will be showing the same stand , " Bastock pointed out . " They ai n't going to like it . " A kind of dignity settled on Huguenine 's stolid face . " I told that feller I would n't let him run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has if you do n't get going . " " Suppose he tries to burn us out ? " " Seen a show get burned out in Alabama , " Budlong amplified the notion . " Gaffer was a stubborn feller . He got his warning not to show the next town . It was Point Comfort . He raised the tent and took tickets . They burned his tent . " " What did he die of ? " Joe Duddy asked . " Cholera morbus , " Budlong said . " He caught it from the monkey . " " We 'll show , " said Mr. Huguenine . He climbed to the box of the treasury wagon and yelled over his shoulder , " You set , Bettina ? " The wagon lurched as Mrs. Huguenine moved from the small window and settled on the bed . " You bet your neck , A. D. , " she called cheerfully . For once the treasury wagon rolled out ahead of the light rig . Ike Wayfish shrugged . " Well , it 's his money . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ready ? " The Pamplons and Fiero climbed aboard ; Shepley was already seated . Caroline said , " Can I come with you , Mr. Bastock ? " The little man shook his head . " No . If there 's trouble , I 'd have to take care of you instead of myself . " She got into the wagon without a word , taking the seat beside the clown . But when they started , she cast an anxious look back at Chad , telling him with her eyes to be careful . It made him feel good . Bastock said , " It 's my idea we better raise the rag tonight , if Burke ai n't there to bother us . " " I believe in it . " Budlong cheeked his spit . " If you got the rag all set , and the pegs all drove and the gimmix loose in your paw , all you do is knock at the heads butting in . " He mounted to his high seat , unloading his cheek on the way up.  | The tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer to Chad , having only two horses ; and for the first time he actively missed Buck . The cream pad moved up alongside Jerry as if he felt lonely also . He came in close , and the two horses started matching strides , archingtheir necks together as if they took pleasure in it . The notion came to Chad that they could be worked together in the ring in a two-horse act . They kept so even that it looked as if anybody could get up on their flat rumps and ride them standing . But he dismissed the temptation of trying it himself . A man who was going to get married in two or three days had no business risking a broken leg .... Beyond Lock Berlin , the road crossed to the south side of the canal and headed due west ; but the canal came back again , with Lyons on the other side , and the wagons crossed the second bridge about seven o'clock and rolled into the village when householders were coming out on their porches after supper . Boys , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels ; they stared a minute in disbelief ; then the cry went up : " It 's the circus . " For a short space it seemed as though good times had returned to Huguenine 's . The boys were gathering a train ; and there was no better advertising in the world . " Look at the horses , " they shouted , as Chad came along . They asked him what was in the cage . When he told them , those who heard became important . " There 's the lion . Right in there . " They ran boldly close , laying careless hands on the sides . But a piercing voice rose at a cross street . " I do n't see no elerphunt . " Some tavern idlers turned their heads to tacked-up posters on the wall under the porch , looked back at the weathered wagons . " That ai n't Burke and Walsh . It 's just a little show . It ai n't got no elerphunt at all . " One or two boys , less sophisticated , still followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they too dropped behind , and Huguenine 's caravan pulled into the lot with nothing but the solitary treasury wagon to greet them . Budlong threw down the reins . " A. D. , " he yelled . But Huguenine was n't there ; only Mrs. Huguenine . The treasury wagon swayed as she came to the window . " I ai n't dressed , " she yelled back . " A. D. 's gone to the store . What do you want with him ? " " Does he still figure to show , ma'am ? " " I do n't know . He did n't say different . " She spoke with dignity . " A. D. 's stubborn , you know . He ai n't likely to quit just because Burke tells him to . " Her voice brightened . " You boys figure to lift the rag tonight ? If you do , I 'll help soon as I get this dress over my head . " She pulled the curtain modestly . As Bastock wheeled into the lot , Budlong said to him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well set her up , " Bastock said . " I want to practise Caroline anyway . Where 's Ike ? Where 's A. D. ? " " Trading . I do n't know where Ike is . I just got here , " Budlong complained . It was the third time that they had handled the canvas that day and the work went slow . The sun had set long before they got her raised , and they had to peg down the ring curb by lantern light . Mrs. Huguenine brought a stewpot into the tent for the skinners . She seemed anxious to please them , and she said they had had no time to get food and anyway she would like the stew cleaned up . It was rich in gravy , having been carried for two days , and they were grateful for it . They told her it was good . She beamed on them . " I wish I had my oven , " she said . " Some nights I just keep thinking of a plate of hot biscuit with a teaspoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep thinking of that a mile to a time . " The performers came to the tent while the skinners were still eating . Caroline sat down next to Chad . Fiero set up his target board but the lantern light was n't bright enough . The Pamplons looked lonesome and uneasy . Wayfish reported that Shepley had gone off after supper , without saying where he was headed for.  | " I guess he was looking for a sight of Albany , " Ike said . " I went down to the other hotel and found she was staying there . The clerk told me she had the room next to Burke 's and he was paying a dollar a day for it besides her food . " It seemed wonderful to think of a circus paying out money like that on a single performer . Ike went on , " I seen one of their posters , too , a new one , and I took it off the board . There was n't nobody round at the time . " He held it out . It announced Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar cut of the male and female riders posed before draperies . But as an added special extra attractionfor the instruction and edification of the audience , it stated that the famous equestrienne , LADY LILLIAN , would appear in an important part of the performance , in her solo ride on the celebratedArabian horse , BUCEPHALUS . She would leap four-foot hurdles in the ring . ( " They got room for jumping in a tent that size , I guess , " Wayfish said . ) " Her style of equitation is talented , graceful , and without parallel in any hemisphere , the march to the beat of the drum martial and spirited , and the waltz to the accompaniment of the full band of music undeniably sublime . " " She never done that with us , " Joe Duddy said . " We did n't have no full band of music , " Budlong pointed out . " Hell , I beat the drum all right , did n't I ? " " What is it , anyway ? " Caroline asked . " I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidesteps him and makes him change lead . " He thought of that early morning ride , back in Canastota , when she rode out patterns through the trees . " I do n't know if it would look much like waltzing . " " Anything would look good if you have a full band of music , " Bastock said . They passed the poster from hand to hand , regarding it gloomily . " She ai n't got a picture of herself the way she had in our posters , " Mrs. Huguenine pointed out , but no one else seemed to share her satisfaction . They clustered wordlessly in the ring , their faces lit dimly by the lantern light , which threw glum shadows of them on the under-curve of the round-top . In the silence outside they heardp269one of the horses hopefully blowing in his feed box for a stray oat . Bastock said suddenly , " No sense in just setting here . Do you think you could practise , Missy , if we hung some lanterns on the pole ? " Caroline said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad , Chaddy . " Caroline went out with Chad to get Jonathan . She held the bridle while Chad saddled him with the pad . The horse craned his head towards the feed boxes of the wagon teams ; he could not understand why he had not been fed ; and his mane drew over Caroline 's face . It was still in the lot . The new moon lay on its back above a tree shape in the west . Caroline said , " I made a wish on the moon last night . " " Did you ? " Chad was working on the pad , his head under the flap . His voice was muffled and short . " Yes . I always try to wish on a new moon , seeing it over the right shoulder . That 's luck . They say if you wish for money and say money to yourself , you 'll never lack cash , if your wants are n't too much . I do n't want a great deal . " " Is that what you wished for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I hope you wished for money . " " Chad , what do you think 's going to happen ? " " I do n't know . " " I wish Mr. Bisbee was here . He 'd know what to do . Do you think Burke and Walsh will do anything to us ? " " How should I know ? What do you want to ask questions for all the time ? " " I 'm sorry . I did n't know I was . " " Well , you was . " " It seemed so lonely in the tent . All of us seemed lonely . I had to talk . But I wo n't ask any more . I do n't want you to be mad at me . " " I ai n't mad , " he said , coming round Jonathan 's shoulder . He could make her out faintly , her hand on the arch of the horse'sp270neck , her cheek against his mane , one knee bent . " Give me a kiss , " he ordered . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Chad caught hold of her , pulling her tight against him . He felt her shiver and kissed her hard . When he let go of her , she asked , " You have n't changed your mind ? " " No . " He jerked the horse 's bridle impatiently . He felt fine again walking with her towards the dark tent . There was something almost humble in the way she came with him that made him forget the labor of raising the canvas a second time in one day . She belonged to him . If he wanted to tell her to do something , she would do it . The pad horse pricked ears at the entrance . He was n't used to night practice and the tent looked strange to him with the lanterns hanging from the center pole . The ring seemed to be sunk into the grass , the round-top to float high . The performers had moved over to the seats , except for Wayfish , who with Bastock talked to Mr. Huguenine in the ring . Huguenine had his hat off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to them stolidly , watching the shadows of Bastock 's hands moving on the grass at his feet . " She wo n't be ready to ride by herself for a month , " Bastock was saying . " But Ike can carry her through . He 's willing . " " I 'm glad to do it , " Ike said . " She 's got gifts . " Chad touched Caroline 's arm , and she started and smiled a little . But her face was pale and intent . Huguenine grunted . " If she 's any good , I 'll have to pay her . And I 'll have to pay for new paper . " " You 've got to do that anyway , A. D. , " Mrs. Huguenine called , fanning herself on the top seat . She was enjoying the novelty of the whole business . " Sure , sure , " Huguenine complained . " But where 's the money coming from ? I ai n't no Flatfoot . I ai n't no syndicate . God damn it , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Well , you 've got you a circus now . She 'll die unless we get anotheract going . The show was n't anything in Clyde . " " I get the knife throw perfectoed , " Fiero broke in , eagerly . " Wait till you do , " Bastock said . " Only now and then I miss not hitting the head , " the juggler said . " It is a little inch . " " Sure , you 're fine , Fiero . " Bastock caught sight of the three in the entrance . " Bring him in , " he said . " It wo n't hurt you to watch , A. D. Let 's see how the horse goes in lantern light . " The pad horse stepped high over the ring , put down his head , and blew softly when Bastock started him . But he fell into his trained gait once he was moving and the light shone on the pad , picking it out brightly , an island floating over the ground . Ike Wayfish took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " But I do n't mind trousers . " " No vaulting tonight , " Bastock said . " You ai n't used to it . We 'll put Caroline up . " He called Caroline over , helped her onto the pad . " Set back , Carolina . Now , Ike . " " What do we do , Pete ? " " Try making your feet , first you , then her . You ai n't got no pratique on , Missy , " he reminded her . Ike rose easily , turning to face Caroline . He gave her his hand , riding backwards , the look of astonishment he always assumed automaticallycovering his face . They stood rather unsteadily on the moving pad , then caught their balance . " Let go of him , Missy . You all right ? If you feel you 're going , jump clean . Turn around , Ike . Now take his belt , Missy ; that 's fine . " It was a fumbling business ; but with Ike 's assurance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a picture suddenlycame out of the riding  --  the red-nosed lout and the graceful , long-legged girl . Chad saw it at once ; and even Huguenine 's face brightened . Bastock , flashing a glance at him , nodded . " It 's got comedy , " he said . Chad said , " You could start her alone , and then Ike could run out and vault in front of her and pretend to be falling off , and she would try to catch him . We could call it courtship or something . " " Courtship of the Lout Lubin , ' " said Ike ; " we can work it out . In the end I take my clothes off and show my expensive costume and she lets me kiss her hand . It would be pretty . " Bastock agreed . " When he 's in tights , then they can do their posing . It 's a good idea , Chaddy . Now try changing places . No . It ai n't safe . You get off , Ike , and mount back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left alone , riding the pad on her feet . Standing close to the curb , looking up at her , Chad saw how absorbed she was . He was n't in her mind at all ; she smiled at him , but she smiled the same way at Budlong and Joe and Mr. Huguenine . " Set down ! " bawled Bastock . She came out of herself , then , her smile widening . " You did n't tell me to , Mr. Bastock , " she said maliciously . " I thought you had sense . Look out . " Now that she was seeing their faces , her balance deserted her . She went over the off side , jumping just in time , and striking on her hands and one knee . " My stars , " cried Mrs. Huguenine . She had torn her tights over the knee and the knee was scraped . It made her limp . Bastock was swearing frantically . " Can you walk ? " he shouted . " It 's just a scrape . It 's not stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at all of you the light seemed to look queer . I just was n't paying attention . " " Well , get up again , " he said . " Stop that horse . " The pad horse stopped , moving his ears . " Why do n't you give her a chance to catch her wind ? " Chad asked . " Damn her wind , " said Bastock . " She 's had a fall . The only thing is to work the notion right out of her as long as she can move . If she was n't a female I 'd give her a licking to take her mind off it . " He was angry at himself and her . Ike acted anxious at her unsteadiness when they had mountedp273again in reverse positions . " Take her by the waist , " Bastock said . " Now , you , you feeling all right ? " Caroline said , " Yes . " " All right . Begin doing your exercises . " He watched while she did her leg stretches backward past Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to hold onto herself , and her arms were poised for balance . It had a kind of fascination , watching the girl 's legs and body adapt themselves to the problem of balance . At moments , when the poise was perfect , she seemed almost afloat in the lantern light . There was not much to it , but it made a routine of sorts , and to the little audience of tired performers and skinners it was new . As Bastock said , there was a lot to be added to it . The toe-to-mouth , the leg-forward , the foot-around , with Ike and Caroline changing hands . " We 'll try putting her on in Pittsford , " he said . Caroline was not destined to make her bow to the public in Pittsford , but they did not know that then . They were all hopeful after that night practice ; it encouraged them to think that they might be building a brand-new act . There were n't many female riders who could pose on a pad . It made Chad excited and proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't feel like sleeping yet , " he said . " Do you ? " Caroline shook her head . " Are n't you tired , though ? " " No . Anyway , with the old rag all set up , I can sleep late tomorrow . How about going down and seeing if the big show 's come in yet ? " " I 'd like to , " she said . " Then go change your clothes while I put up the horses . I 'll meet you at the hotel . "  |p274He  watched Caroline through the front door and saw the people in the office look after her as she crossed to the stairs . He could imagine that happening in times to come , when she was famous . " I 'll probably still be raising canvas , " he thought . She would be bound to grow ambitious . The first thing he knew she would n't want to hang around with a one-horse show ; she would want a full band of music ; and somebody like Burke would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tagging along . He knew he would never have the ambition or the talent to become a first-class rider himself . When he finished with the horses , he ambled round to the porch , standing quiet in the darkness , the way he used to scout for Mrs. Mott at the Yellow Bud . There were n't any lights . The only illuminationcame from the hotel windows . Caroline was waiting for him in her print dress , her head bonneted , her ridicule swinging nervously in her fingers . She was watching for him , but she had n't seen him ; and he stayed still enjoying the look of her , all feminine , and much younger than she seemed riding , and he saw she was anxious for him to get there . " Here I am , " he said , enjoying her start . She ran at once down the steps and took his arm . She was wearing the locket ; he smelled the perfume as she walked beside him down the street . She kept close up to him , matching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , quick , and light , and full of life . They stopped on the canal bridge , to stare eastward along the dark thread of water . There was a bow lantern so far off that it seemed stationary and they studied it a long time before they made out which way it was moving . Chad heard her draw her breath slowly . " What is it ? " " I was thinking how you must have gone by our house , " she said . " When you were driving . And I never knew it . " " Knew what ? " " That I was going to be your wife . Maybe I even saw you . " She turned her head . " What did you look like , Chad ? " " Just like any other hoggie . Pretty dirty . Half naked , probably . "  |p275He  grinned . " I knew your place . Lots of times , when we were hauling past Canastota on the night trick , I 'd think if I could keep awake past Trid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you even saw me , " she went on with her thought . " I might have . " " I did n't look like much , either . " She was silent . Then she said in a low , fierce little voice , " If you and me . . . if we have children , I wo n't let them run around the way I did , being dirty , hearing dirty talk . " " Even tenting ? " he asked . " Not even if I got to be like . . . " He caught himself . " . . . If I turn out lazy and no good , just projecting after easy money , never doing no work , getting drunk all the while ? " " Like Pa ? Why do n't you say it ? But you wo n't . I wo n't let you . But even if you did , my children would n't live dirty . " He had to admire her ; she had seemed so young ; and now she was talking this way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way off for him . He did n't think of them , getting married . But he did n't mind her talking of them if she wanted to ; it aroused pleasant speculations . He let himself hang over the railing , watching the black water and the bow lantern coming along it towards them . He could see its reflection now , even though he could n't yet make out the horses . " Suppose I got to be tough and started knocking you around ? " She took the notion calmly . " You wo n't . Because I wo n't let you . I made up my mind about you a long time ago . Do you think I 'll let you change it ? " She did n't lean against the rail ; she was erect . He imagined he could make out the line of her small jaw under the bonnet brim . And he found he was believing her . She was chock-full of wanting to live ; she aimed to make herself a good life ; and she had picked him to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned to himself . " I wonder why they make bonnets like that ? " " Why ? " He could tell from her voice that he would always be able to startle her.  | " Because if a feller wants to kiss a girl , he just about has to make a full dive and come up underneath to do it . " She put it back off her head with one quick sweep of hand and arm . " Oh , Chad . " After a minute he said , " You keep talking about marrying and raising children . Have you stopped to think that two days from this minute you and me will be married ? " " What do you think I 've been thinking about ? " " Well , " he said . " Maybe getting to be a female star performer . " Her voice was sarcastic . " A lot you know . What do you think a girl would think about just before she 's getting married ? What do you think I 'm like ? " She moved quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifting her face . " Do n't you like me ? " " Yes , " he said , saying the word into her mouth . She loosed herself . " I think we better go look for Burke and Walsh . " " All right . " He started off the bridge but she touched his arm with the tips of her fingers . " I want to be married right , Chad . I wish I had bed linen , and china and some glass and even clothes to bring with me . " " What would we do with chinaware ? " he asked . " It 's what a girl ought to have . I 'm not bringing anything . " " Well , I 'm not either . I never even knew who my father and mother were . We 're starting out from scratch . Maybe we 'll have more fun that way . " " Yes , maybe . Trousseaus is what they call them . Rich people . " " Is it ? " Chad ambled along easily in one rut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishbone of sod dividing them . " Ai n't that light on the road , Caroline ? " She stopped and stared . " I think so . It 's not a house light . It 's moving . There 's another one , behind it . " " Must be a roll in the ground . They 're coming over it . There 's number three . "  | " Four , " Caroline counted . " They must be the light wagons . I guess that 's the lot , down there . It 's been mowed . We can stand under that tree and they 'll turn in by us . " They entered the lot where the bars were down and moved along the fence towards the tree . Its shadow hid them . It had low branches and made fingers against the sky . A man was carrying a lantern across the lot , and Chad saw now that there was a wagon by the far fence . The man wished them good-evening . " You come to see the circus pull in ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to come and see it tomorrow and bring the lady . The tent will be up then . She 's quite a sight . You can see the show for a quarter of a dollar , twenty-five cents . You want to see the freaks . Greatest concourse of human oddities ever seen in this state . " " What is there ? " Caroline asked . " Well , take Ella , the girl without any limbs . Ma'am , you would certainly like to see her . Drinks , sews , cuts paper with her mouth . She 's got beautiful features , sir . Yes sir , cut the legs and arms off all the women in this country and Ella McChesney would still be the belle of the ball . " " Got a fat lady ? " Chad asked . " Sure . Only she 's a child . Five years old . " " How much does she weigh ? " " Two-oh-five in a silk kimono . This here 's a moral entertainment . You ought to see the dwarfs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fat child . " And the Living Skeleton . All for ten cents , mister . I 'll be looking for you . " He passed them , going through the bars and taking a stand in the road , where he started to swing his lantern . By its light , Chad and Caroline made out a group of figures coming down the bridge from the village . They picked out Bastock and Budlong in the forefront , and then realized that practically all of Huguenine 's company had decided to see the show roll in . Caroline called and waved her arm and they all congregated under the apple tree.  |p278They  were just in time . The first wagons were rolling along the straight stretch , the horses quickening stride as they saw the lantern being swung . The roll of wheels , the stamp of hoofs , gained volume . The lantern swinger started bawling , " Right in , Jed . Right in and clear across . Solid going all the way . Had a good trip ? " " Sure . Roads are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent wagon . " The teamster swung his team through the bars and the eveners crashed as the tugs slacked going off the road shoulder , and then snapped up the weight as the horses leveled out . Mrs. Huguenine put back her shawl . " Hunh ! That wagon do n't look nothing extra . Look at its paint . " The second wagon rolled in close . The lantern caught a scroll of gilt paint . BURKE , WALSH &; CO . A couple of light rigs followed it , drawn by single horses . " Lucky-boy rigs , " Bastock said . " Here 's two more . " He spat . " Moral show , hey ? " Then another heavy team , dragging a bigger wagon , went off the road and the load banged heavily . Seat jacks . It was followed by another just as big , and then a third smaller one loaded just with planks . Across the field the wagons were lining along the fence , their lanterns making a glow . The man with the hand lantern ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop . " Plenty of figuring to a show with this many wagons , " muttered Bastock . Nobody else said anything . It was being borne in on them that this was the kind of concern that could roll right over Huguenine 's Great and Only International Circus and hardly feel a bump . After the seventh wagon had driven in , the ring stock came along the road and they seemed to make a herd . One of the teams in the lot started whinnying ; they were answered down the road ; the Huguenine troupe heard a spatter of hoofs ; a man yelped by the bars , and the ring stock trotted through , heads up in their cloudp279of dust , and were driven to a corner where men caught them and haltered them and tied them to the fence . Someone had started a bonfire , feeding it with a bag of straw , so that the flames leaped and threw a light all over the lot , even onto the road . A rig went by the bars , keeping on the road for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They got coaches , " someone said under the apple tree . " Look at that . They can let down the curtains when it rains just as if they 'd bought tickets . " Then the tent wagons , two of them , each with a four-horse hitch , rolled heavily along the road , turned off with groaning reaches , and headed for the bonfire . The horses were beauties , matched Conestoga Chunks , fat and strong . " I guess that 's all , " Ike said . " I 'm going to bed , myself . " He started for the road , the others following him . But as they neared the bars , Bastock cocked his head suddenly . " Wait a minute . Look . " They had n't heard anything from the road ; the voices in the field had settled into a steady current of sound , like the noise of water ; and the shape rocked down towards them , deliberately treadingthe dust , with a gentle , almost wistful rumbling in its inside . It was enormous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer zone of firelight : a bulging , thoughtful-looking skull and swaying ears , dark grey , with a hypnotic sway of its high shoulders . But as it drew abreast of them they saw the small eye caught in firelight , the sagginglip and hanging trunk , and the tired man who tramped beside it . They could read no expression in the beast 's face ; intelligence in anything so huge would be incredible . But it had seen them by the fence . Suddenly its trunk reached sidewise , straightened , so that the end traveled with a tiny hook along the upper rail , pointing to one after another of the people . When it came to Mrs. Huguenine , the hook raised , straightening , still sideways , and from the end of it came an unexpected brief little puff of hay-smelling wind . The ribbons on Mrs. Huguenine 's bonnet stood straight up.  | She cried , " My stars and body ! " And the trudging man seemed to wake himself . " Hey there , Grace , " he said sharply , striking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh rasping sound . The trunk immediately fell into its former pendent posture , coiled on itself above the dust in the road . The great solemn stride was uninterrupted ; the ears , however , sailed forward for a moment . Then only the hindquarterswere visible . Somehow they looked queerly out of place , and they reminded Chad of a snotty old woman passing Sunday loafers on a hotel porch . " I thought I was going to be killed , " gasped Mrs. Huguenine . " What was it ? " " The elephant , ma'am , " Pete said . She gave herself a shake . " I thought it was . But when it stuck that thing out at me and let it off , I did n't know what to think . What do elephants eat ? " " Hay , " said Bastock . " I 'm glad to hear it , " Mrs. Huguenine said . It was Caroline 's idea that they should have breakfast together , and sitting down at Mrs. Denby 's table that morning , Chad had to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal : the front held her counters ; the back was her kitchen ; and she had laid the places so that Chad and Caroline could look through the door and enjoy the view of canal and fields . Framed by the doorway was Burke and Walsh 's tent already erected . Even at that distance it seemed colossal . " It went up so quick , " said Mrs. Denby , swinging the coffee , eggs , and fried potatoes onto the table . " I wish I had sausage for you . I make the loveliest sausage . "  |p28ICaroline  said , " This looks awfully good , Mrs. Denby . " " They had the elephant in Cheever 's shed back of the relay barn , " said Mrs. Denby . " He came right by this morning when I was sweeping my steps . Swinging his head just like a creature in the Bible , and his little eye was so knowing . I 've baked you some biscuits , though . I hope they 're good . Oh , did you ever see such gorgeous biscuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine vapor of hot baking . " He went over the bridge so careful , " said Mrs. Denby . " A mouse could n't have been delicater . I hate mice , they 're so dirty in their habits . The poor thing rumbled , though . I think he had a bead of wind in his inside by the sound . I suppose he 's old . Wind does overtake persons so when they get older . I make my own butter . It 's delicious . I think I 'll have to see the circus after all . " Caroline and Chad let her follow her spasmodic thoughts . Her food was good , at any rate , and they were hungry . " Are you going to the performance ? " Mrs. Denby asked . " I want to see the performers . Especially the female ones . I suppose circus people do n't get married much . It 's funny the way you ca n't really tell whether a woman 's married or not , is n't it ? Do you think Mr. Van Buren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Chad said he did not know , she nodded . " They say he 's not married , " she said . " My word . Did you read about that canal woman they found murdered over near Newark ? Two months ago . She was young , too . I read about it in the Western Argus . I think murdering is dreadful , do n't you ? Because you ca n't tell who did it half the time . " Her angular face became entranced . " I wonder why creation arranged for women to have children ? Did you ever think of that ? " Chad said , " No . But somebody had to have them . It must have been a toss-up at the time . " " Oh , heavenly days ! " exclaimed Mrs. Denby . She went into the front of the store to deal with a canal cook who had come in with the determined face of a woman who has resolved to forget nothing . Mrs. Denby quickly fixed that . She had the cook floundering after the second item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to have that covered . No telling what might get into it . Frogs , maybe . " She brushed a stray lock off her cheek , and the canal cook in desperation did likewise . " Frogs spit , or is it spiders ? And men , of course . I do n't know about elephants . " " Elephants ? " The woman brightened . " Coming down the towpaththis side of the relay barn I kept seeing it laying right in the road . And I thought it must have been a horse and I could n't understand the fact . You hai n't got any Salvinie 's Colic Elixir ? " " No . But I have a powder for bugs and roaches , and hoarhound candy , and peppermint oil . Peppermint is good for colic . But it ai n't no help with roaches so you 'll need some of both , prob-ably . " " I guess I will . " " Hogs sometimes eat roaches . I 'm always noticing things like that . Maybe you ought to have some salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook . " I made up my mind to get some lard . " " I 've got some preserved gooseberries , " Mrs. Denby said . " Now you 've bought lard , you could make a gooseberry pie , seeing you have the flour . Of course it ai n't rhubarb pie . " When Chad stepped out to pay Mrs. Denby , the canal cook was looking rumpled , weary , and utterly distracted . Outside a boater was blowing the guts out of his horn . " Men like to make a noise when they 're angry , or when they 're happy , or when they 're drunk . I read in a book ostriches do n't do it , " said Mrs. Denby . " I hope I see you folks at the circus . " " I hope so , " said Caroline . She had to stifle her giggles as they went down the steps . They could see the boatman stamping up and clown his boat . Caroline put her hand inside Chad 's arm . " My , you were awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . " Chad was grinning . He had enjoyed himself , Mrs. Denby , the breakfast , which was the best he had had in a long time , and the discovery that Caroline was fun to do things with . A couple ofp283times , while Mrs. Denby was holding forth , he had only had to meet Caroline 's eye to make her buckle . " I wonder if Mr. Huguenine really plans to show , " she said as they walked up the street from the canal bridge . The town was filling already with farm rigs . It was a real circus day , blue sky , white clouds , and just enough wind blowingto make people restive . Chad and Caroline overheard several groups talking about the mammoth arena , and some had had a glimpse of the elephant . The luck boys were working the sidewalks ; a watch and spoon artist , a thimble rig , the seven sights of Pagan Rome . A block farther on they encountered Professor Arganave sadly packing up his solar microscope under the menacing scrutiny of two thick-jawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he complained to Chad . " You talk to them , will you ? " Chad examined the two gents and decided he would n't . " I offered them two dollars , " said the professor , " but they want five . They say you got to be with Burke 's show here . Ai n't I got a right ? Look at the crowd . I could do good business . " On the porch of the big hotel a collection of men and women were looking things over ; they were a noisy , laughing crowd . Even if Chad and Caroline had not been a month with Huguenine 's they would have known them for circus folks . They had the friendly confident aspect of performers who know they are traveling with a going concern . " It must be exciting to be with a big show , " Caroline said . " I wonder where Albany is . " She was not in sight , though Fred Shepley was . They saw him standing in the barroom door . His face was pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a blue coat and flashy polka-dotted waistcoat . When he caught sight of Chad and Caroline in the crowd on the sidewalk he turned his face away . They pushed their way along through the throng to the small hotel where Huguenine 's company had put up . While Caroline went in to change to her ring costume , Chad went round to the barn after the horses . The stablehand was inside sucking a straw . He said , " Morning , " and stuck the dry end of the straw against the cream 's rump . " I been down to look at the big show 's horses . They ai n't got any ring animals any better than yours . " " There is n't a better one than that cream anywhere , " Chad said . " It must be tough being a good horse in a bum show , " observed the stablehand . Chad did n't argue . He said , " We got better riders than they have , even if we ai n't got an elephant . " " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can spit on anybody 's stove ; but you and me we got to use the spittoon , and if it 's the wrong one we get throwed out of there . " He put the straw back in his mouth . Chad took the horses out to the street and waited for Caroline . She came along in a minute , wearing her cloak over the tights . They turned off the main street , going by back ways towards the Iot . Ike Wayfish and the skinners were inside the tent , so Bastock started the ring practice immediately . Chad stayed long enough to see that Caroline was all right . On the way up she had told him that she was n't worried about falling again . It was the lantern light that had made the ground seem out of place , deep down , she said , like the earth in a dream . Moreover Ike had stopped handling her as if she were a hot iron , and he was solid himself on the pad so that she did her poses with confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's going to be an act . " When he emerged from the tent the first thing Chad saw was Mr. Huguenine in the act of shaving . It was a regular domestic sight . Mrs. Huguenine sat on the top step of the treasury wagon with a towel hung over her knees and held a basin of hot water on the towel . A small mirror was hung by a cord round her neck . Her bosom gave it the proper tilt to throw the light upward on Mr. Huguenine 's face , crimson from the effort of bending over . Neither said a word , but her eyes were eloquently solicitous as they followed the course of the razor and her lips kept moving asp285though she conned a charted course like a pilot working a boat down river in a fog . As Chad approached , she moved her head slowly so that the mirror did not move and warned him with her eyes . He stood still , listening to Mr. Huguenine 's short breathless grunts until he paused to wipe the razor . " A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my petticoat . " " So it is , so it is , " said Mr. Huguenine . He erected a hair on his wrist by the simple method of bending the joint , cut it off , said , " You wait a minute , Hanna , " and went to work under his nose . He worked the razor in little strokes , like a turkey pecking crumbs from a bucket of hot mash . In spite of himself , Chad became as absorbed as the man and his wife . None of them paid the least attention to the smart clop of hoofs coming down the packed dirt of the street till the rig spun into the lot and the two horses came down on their pasterns with a quick stop , stamping and blowing . " Hey there , Huguenine ! " " God damn it , " said Mr. Huguenine . " Did you cut yourself , dearie ? " Mrs. Huguenine asked . Mr. Huguenine swept the lather off his lip with the ball of his thumb and looked at himself . " Smarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the horses . It was Mr. Burke 's rig , and Mr. Burke was sitting in it with another man beside him . This second gent was considerably bigger than Mr. Burke , but his clothes were n't as natty and one loop of his string tie had loosened . " Hello , " said Mr. Huguenine . " I brought my partner along . This is Mr. George Walsh . Huguenineand Mrs. " He ignored Chad . " Did you make a good tent in Clyde ? " Huguenine 's eyes stuck out for a minute . " Good enough , " he said . " I expect to pick up business here . " " You do ? " said Burke . " You 're feeling kind of cool . " " Yeah , " said Mr. Huguenine . " I was . " " My partner ai n't , " Burke said . " He wanted to tear your tent down . "  | " Kick them out on their fat ... " Mrs. Huguenine rose up with the basin in her hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked his jaws as he stared at her ; he let go a spit over the wheel . " George is n't feeling so friendly , " Burke said , his blue eyes wanderinground the lot . He listened to the thump of hoofs from the tent . " Working on a new act , Huguenine ? " " You can find out for twenty-five cents , " said Huguenine . " Thanks . If you want to see our show I 'd be glad to offer you and your Missis a free pass . " " Could n't use it , " said Huguenine . " You plan to show ? " " Yep . And you ai n't going to stop me here , Burke , nor your dumb-faced partner neither . I seen the sheriff and the town board and they say I got plenty of right to show when I want to in this town . " " Go ahead , " said Mr. Burke , in an affable voice . " But I warn you not to break in on our parade , see ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huguenine . " Then keep off the main street . " " I 'll parade where I choose . " Mr. Burke studied the reins in his fingers . " All right , " he said . " See what the public thinks when your rundown , two-dollar rigging runs up against ours . " Walsh was still eyeing Mrs. Huguenine . His spit was high and promiscuous . " Kick their fat ... " " Young man , " said Mrs. Huguenine , " I warned you . " Her face blazed . She swung the basin and let the contents strike where they would . Part hit the horses and part hit Mr. Walsh , and Mr. Burke had a share of the floating lather . The horses were not as accustomed to shaving water ; they bolted . They made a wild circle of the lot and hit the opening by a miracle.  | " What did you do that for ? " Mr. Huguenine asked gloomily . " Now I got to get me more hot water . " " I 'll get it , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll boil it for you . By Jerusalem , if you was men you 'd have clawed them two monkeys right out of that wagon . " Chad had to grin . " I do n't believe I could 've run fast enough . " She began to smile . " Them horses do n't like wet when it 's hot , " she agreed . " Oh , A. D. , you 've begun to bleed ! " " Well , I ca n't see if you go jumping that mirror that way . " Chad did n't see much use hanging round . A. D. had made up his mind to show ; not even an elephant was going to move him . He went back to the tent and told the others . While they were talking it over , Fred Shepley came in with the Pamplons , and Fiero . " I was talking to their top-rider , " he said . " He do n't somerset from his feet at all . Just from his knees . What do you think about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ai n't seen you somersetting much at all lately , " Budlong said drily . " Well , I 'll somerset today . " Bastock gave him an eye for a brief instant . " Better pick out the right horse when you 're coming down , " he suggested . " They 're making a star place for Albany , " Shepley said , as if he had not heard . " And we had her below me too , here . God knows how she got her job . " Chad had had an idea rolling around his head for some time and he said now , " Would n't it look good to let Caroline ride the cream in the parade ? " " No , she ca n't , " Shepley said . " A top-rider ca n't walk in a parade . " " You could ride Jerry . He 's a handsome horse . But Caroline had n't ought to ride him till he 's used to it . " " I could ride him all right , " Caroline said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Besides , my tights look better on the cream . "  | Bastock considered it . " I 'll have to ask the gaffer . But it 's a good idea . It 's one more piece to our parade . God knows we need them . Maybe some will look at her . " Mr. Huguenine said he did n't care . He was busy nailing huge sheets of paper to the tent wagon . They had been lettered by hand . They said :  --  HUGUENINE 'S GREAT AND ONLY INTERNATIONAL CIRCUS See Daniel in the Lion 's Den . See Signor Rossello , in his somerset on a galloping Horse . See Mr. Wayfish , the Buffo , who makes Children laugh . See all the great acts , wire artists , refined Juggling . ALL CHILDREN will be admitted free if escorted by i adultFOR THIS DAY ONLY " I thought it up last night , " he told Bastock . " It cost me fifty cents , but by God I 'll have a good tent here if I pay for it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more to force his mule through the crowd that blocked off the entrance to the main street and a tough-looking bezabor was making passes with a tent peg at the mule 's nose . She was parrying nimbly . Chad saw Ike 's top hat rise high as she reared to strike with her forefeet , and the crowd swayed and jammed towards the corners . On top of the tent wagon the three skinners were anxiously banging away at " Long-Tailed Blue , " but their notes were already being smothered by the approaching fanfare of Burke 's full band . Their music was electrifying . Their drums were magnificent . The brasses echoed all over town and the leader with his French horn made notes beautiful enough to stir the heart . " Hell , " thought Chad . " We 'll have to turn back again . "  |p289They  had tried three times to get onto the main street , but each time a posse of Burke 's canvasmen , armed with tent pegs , had made the entrance ahead of them and it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up the length of the town this had happened ; then as Burke 's made the loop and started back , Huguenine had bawled to Ike to cut in ahead . Chad gave Caroline a glance . She was dressed in Albany 's former historical costume of crown and cloak and scepter . She certainly looked pretty sitting on Jerry . And the horse was behaving well , keeping close behind the cream pad . He merely jigged a little when the band came close . As Chad expected , Ike turned back . He looked defeated . Hugueninebawled to him to try again farther along . The skinners clambered off the roof to take the horses by the head and back the tent wagon round in the narrow street . The crowd re-formed across the street , laughing . As soon as the wagon was headed back , Huguenine shouted to Fiero and the Pamplons to get up and ride . All three of them looked completely terrified . " And do n't start playing till we get out on the street , " Huguenine said to Bastock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled around the corner and they started again parallel to the main street . Out of the tail of his eye , Chad saw the opposing roustabout yell and run down the street . " A. D. , " he yelled . " Yeah ? " " Why do n't we turn around again ? They 've pulled foot . " Huguenine looked over his shoulder . " God damn and Maria , " he roared . Laboriously the entire process was repeated . This time they came to the street with only the country people in front of them . Over their heads , Huguenine 's caught sight of the passing procession . It was worth seeing : the plumes on the lady riders , the spangles on a dozen men ; a buggy in which side by side rode the giant and the dwarf in identical uniforms . The dwarf was driving . It was comical , even to the Huguenine troupe . Chad edged the cage wagonp290forward till it was right beside the tent wagon . He could hear a mutter up street . " The elephant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would be moving along to follow the circus in a moment . But there was a gap in the procession . Nobody seemed to know why and the people on the walks started hooking forward into the main street to see what the elephant was doing . Perhaps the cessation , perhaps the smell of the elephant , roused Oscar . He hoisted his old hips shakily and roared . In that narrow space between houses he made a furious din . The bystanders melted away in suddenpanic ; it had never occurred to them , till they stopped trying to see the elephant , that a man-eating animal was right there in their midst . Chad saw it all then . He jumped off the cage wagon and yanked Mr. Huguenine 's paper sign off the tent wagon . Caroline saw what he was doing and moved Jerry up to the other side . Huguenine never knew it had happened till the paper was being trampled in the dirt . He started roaring as loud as the lion , but Chad said , " Go ahead ! " Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confused and in a hurry to fill up the gap . He raised in his stirrups . He could see Burke 's tough tent-peggers still galloping down the main street to the next intersection on the side from which they had driven back Huguenine 's . " Good work , Chaddy . I 'll turn off the other side . " Budlong also was getting the drift . He put his hand over the bugle mouth and grabbed Joe Duddy 's drumsticks . " Will somebody tell me the road to Lyons ? " Ike bawled , and the mule , waggling her ears , pranced into the main street and started after Burke 's first half . She was magnificent now , handling Ike 's hat . In her excitement she took a piece clean out of the brim and had to grab again . The crowd , which this far uptown was mostly from the farms , yelled and cheered . They had n't kept track of the wagons on the way up . It all looked part of the original parade . The tent wagon wheeled in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fred Shepley . Caroline got a hand . Anyone would have . People just wanted to be amused . As the cage wagon made the turn , Chad craned round to look back . He could see the swinging ears of the elephant . She had her coiled trunk high . She trumpeted and came on towards Oscar . The trumpeting took the fight out of the old lion . He crouched right down and started moaning like a tomcat up a tree wondering if his bowels would hold out till the dogs got tired of waiting . There was still a good line of performers behind the elephant . There was the rig with the fat girl and there was a clown in white face working away at a droning hurdy-gurdy while a couple of tumblers threw flips in front of his wagon , and there were some more riders tailing the whole shebang together with the monster tent wagon which was placarded with signs saying : " FOLLOW THE PARADE TO THE MAMMOTH ARENA . BURKE &; WALSH 'S STUPENDOUS MORAL ESTABLISHMENT . SKILL , BEAUTY , AND FUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . " The crowd was already coming along after it , thronging the center of the street , talking , laughing , shouting , eating dust , as happy as hogs hitting home at mash time . Ike Wayfish made the second turn off the main street ; the tent wagon followed suit . The crowd , seeing people up the street already on the move , started moving with the wagon . Chad turned the cage wagon and saw that the elephant was turning , willy-nilly , after Oscar . Oscar was making catarrhal noises and holding fast to the bottom of his cage . The others naturally followed the elephant . If there had been any doubts in the minds of the crowd , the children could n't have been shaken off from the elephant , no matter what . Where it went , that was the place to go . The elephant 's driver may have had some curiosity , but he was thankful enough to have his charge moving again not to be upset by turning one corner more or less . The back of the cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no bars ;  | and because he was on foot , the driver could n't well see beyond . Back of the elephant , nobody had much chance to see ahead . Way down the street , the big band banged away . On top of the tent wagon , Joe Duddy suddenly grabbed his sticks and rolled his drum . It did n't matter now . The uptown crowd was coming after Huguenine 's . The elephant keeper caught on when the show doubled back across the main street once more . But Grace , the elephant , found this procession moving nicely . She was rumbling her bead of wind happily in her inside ; no mere hook was going to turn her away now . And the horses and riders and drivers behind her effulgent rear were too used to being in that position to think much of the direction she took . They attained the Huguenine lot half an hour before show time . But Mrs. Huguenine did n't wait . She rolled across the lot like a ship under heavy sail , unlocked the treasury-wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened the window , and beamed happily on the first-comers . " This way for your tickets , gents . Have your quarter of a dollar ready . Twenty-five cents . The first ten children will be admitted free by the courtesy of the management . " Never had she made change so rapidly . The customers streamed into the tent . By the time the harassed elephant man had persuaded Grace that the hay was not for her , Burke 's rig came galloping in . There was n't time for him to do damage . His own show was starting and he had to have the elephant ; he had to have the clown . Some of the horses had to appear in the grand entrance . But his face was blanched . His eyes looked like blue frozen glass . Even his segar was dead . He passed Chad as he followed the elephant through the crowd , and to Chad 's surprise he nodded . " I warned you folks , " he said quietly ; and then he added , " By Almighty God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying . The show was in hand ; the tent was nearly full ; Huguenine , doffing his hat in the ring , showed a red , perspiring , satisfied , but wondering face . His voice was hearty . " LAY-dies and GENTlemen . . . "  |p293Mr  . Huguenine 's all-out-and-over was hoarse but triumphant . Ike Wayfish , who had come running out to the performers ' fly , turned back with the rest of the troupe to admire the audience filing out . It had been a good show . Fiero 's juggling had been lightning fast ; the Pamplons had worked like grease on the wire ; best of all , Fred Shepley had done his somersault . They all complimentedhim on it and for once he was willing to accept their praise . It was Budlong who pricked their bubbling exaltation . " You want to be setting here admiring yourselves when Burke 's roustabouts come in like a bunch of hyenas ? Or do you want to have got a couple of miles between ? " He was n't wasting time himself . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Duddy were shoving Oscar outside . " Fred , you and Chad get the boards out . You Pamplons ought to have your wire down . Fiero can pack loose tackle . We need every man . " There was something grimly convincing about the way Budlong took over . The only person who did n't feel it was Huguenine . " I got to count my ticket-take , " he said . " You 'd be lucky to be able to count after Burke gets through with you , A. D. " Bastock , who had begun carrying out the seat boards , said , " Yeah . It 's tough enough when rubes start pitching into you . But when another circus gets on your tail , it 's nasty . They know how . " Budlong said , " I 'd rather have a Mississippi township hunting coon up the leg of my pants . " " They would n't dast come in here in daylight . The sheriff told me ... " " A. D. , do you think any sensible sheriff is going to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more , when they 're sorting us out for our coffins , he wo n't even know what happened.  | Neither will Burke . His show will have moved . Do n't make me laugh , " said Bastock . " Where do you think you 're going , Fred ? " " I 'm going to change at the hotel and get my clothes . " " Like hell you are . You come here and try lugging seats . " " Well , I do n't want my show ruined , " Huguenine acknowledged . " What 'll I do ? " " Hitch up the teams , " Budlong said . " Say , " said Chad , " let Caroline take the light rig down and pay the hotel off . She can get the men 's clothes . " Caroline said , " Of course . Mrs. Pamplon can come with me . " " Yeah . A. D. , you hitch up for her . " Fiero , lugging out one of the chests , yelled to Caroline to bring his laundry , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shouted . Caroline waved her hand . With Shepley , Fiero , and Pamplon all lugging seats and jacks they cleared the tent in record time . But Budlong was n't satisfied . " I wo n't feel right till we get the wagons rolling . Wish to God they was rolling now . Suppose he decides to send his hyenas up here before the tear-down . " Bastock shook his head . " He wo n't . You got to run a circus like a habit . You got to allout , and you got to tear down , and roll the wagons . You start doing different and you 're bound to get stuck , just like trying to eat with your back end . Besides , he 'll want to get his wagons out of town before any trouble starts . Then he wo n't know nothing . " Shepley stopped to catch breath . " I wonder what Albany would think if we had bad trouble with them . " " Never does no good to wonder what a woman would think  --  not unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bastock said . " Yeah , " said Joe Duddy . " And when you got her there , if you ca n't keep her from thinking at all , you might as well buy birdseed . " The canvas came down in a billowing cloud . They dashed in to squash the wind out of it and brought the pole down with a run.  |p295The  four skinners loaded it and folded the canvas and stowed it while Fiero , Shepley , and Pamplon pulled the pegs . By that time Huguenine had the horses harnessed and hitched to the proper wagons . They were ready to go . Budlong stood back from closing up the tent wagon and raked the sweat off his chin . " Where 's them women ? " " They 're a coming , " Mrs. Huguenine called . She had appointed herself an armed sentry , with a wagon spoke in one hand and a claw hammer in the other . Now she hiked up her skirt with her little fingers and fairly skimmed the grass to the treasury wagon . Caroline drove the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flushed and her eyes bright with excitement . " We 're ready to go , " said Huguenine . " Which way do we head ? The Newark road 's tother side of the canal . The bridge is close enough to the main one so Burke will see us go over . " This was something that had not occurred even to Budlong . He was stumped . He turned to Chad after a second and asked him what he knew about the country . Chad had been doing his best to remember ; but it was astonishing how little of the country a canal hoggie came to know . " I think there was a road on this side of the canal , " he said . " I remember a couple of bridges between here and Newark . " Caroline came up to them . " There is . I asked the clerk at the hotel . He acted like a real gentleman and helped me pack for Mr. Fiero and Mr. Shepley . He says there 's a back road leads off the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcadia and Lockville . He says it ai n't much good , but it 's been dry now , so we ought to get through . " " You got a think-piece , " Budlong said , but he did n't waste time praising her . He climbed up to his high perch with a tent peg , which he laid under his feet . " Ike , you take the rig . But keep back near us . Put them extra pegs in handy . Get aboard , folks . " Caroline hung back . " I 'm going to ride Jonathan , " she said.  | Chad noticed then that she had n't changed from her ring costume . " I can ride him stride , " she said . Budlong said , " We ca n't be hampered by no women . Get on that wagon . " " No , " she said . " If there is trouble , Chad ca n't just turn Jonathan and Jerry loose . I 'll be there to hold them . " " All right , " Budlong said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past four when they hit the road . The Newark road forked left over the canal bridge on the west side of town ; their own road was an alleyway leading back of a canal barn and a small ramshackle building that reeked of peppermint . Budlong told Chad and Caroline that he could see Burke 's tent between the buildings . " They 're tearing her down . Some of their wagons are rolling up to the bridge . They 'll come by here in twenty minutes . " He glanced ahead . The light rig , the treasury wagon , the seat wagon , and the cage wagon were all in plain view heading straight as a string along the canal bank . " Ai n't there no bends in this road ? " " I do n't know , " said Chad . " There 's some trees ahead , though . " " Looks like a meeting grove , " Budlong said sourly . " Hardly enough underbrush for a rabbit to be decent in . " The light rig , however , trailing dust up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Budlong brightened a little and shook up the four-horse team . He would n't work a trot out of them ; he did n't dare , with the loaded wagon and the uneven ruts . The road was already dwindling . Its grass backbone was high . Turning the corner , Budlong glanced back . " Hai n't showed up yet , " he reported . He looked south over the canal . " That main road 's right in sight . This is the God-damnedest back road I ever saw . " Beyond the grove , the road swung west again , then dipped into a low fold of the ground , and came out on the bank of Mud Creek . Here at last were trees . The piers of the canal aqueduct stood solid in the current to their left ; but Budlong said that none of the mainp297road was visible and the wagons one by one rolled through the shallow ford , roiling the water , and leaving two tracks of frothy bubbles . Caroline and Chad were the last to cross ; and they stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the bubbles drift slowly with the current . The spot was deserted except for a pair of teeter-birds , skittering along the sunny bank . The leaves hung motionless on the trees , and the sun poured a still heat into the creek bed . The groans of the tent wagon laboriously working up through the trees dwindled . A hot-weather bird unwound its heat screech . For a moment it seemed that such a thing as Huguenine 's circus had never existed at all . " I 'd like to stay here forever . " " You 'd get bit awful , " Chad said , slapping a deer fly on Jerry 's shoulder . " I mean just to stay . Not to have to eat , not to think of money , not to think of what 's going to happen to me ; just to be here , like now , in the sun . " " It 's a hell of a idea . Where 'd I be ? How 'd we get married ? " " You 'd be right here , just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . There would n't be any good and bad and the hurts people can do to each other . I 'd rather heaven turned out that way than all marble and gold . " " Ai n't you curious about what 's going to happen to you ? " " Not now , not this minute . " She turned her face and looked at him and blushed . " Well , " she said , " time 's gone by , after all . " " We ought to move , " Chad said , and she obediently turned the cream through the ford . She had let the cloak slip back from her shoulders . Her legs were shaped to the barrel , and as the big horse stamped powerfully through the ford , his motion showed in her thighs . She sat him with a straight back but with her head bent a little . In the tight-fitting lavender costume , against the green of the trees and the desertion of the stream , there was an outlandishnessabout her that prickled Chad : it was almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the trees , riding upward through a green tissue of shade ; and they saw the tent wagon ahead and the outlandishnessevaporated . She was just a small circus performer riding the stage between stands . Budlong was swearing at them for hangingback . " Get up front where I can watch you , " he said . " All right , " Chad said , meeting his eye . Budlong figured they had been muzzling up to each other , but he did n't mind that . They crammed the horses round the wagon and saw the others ahead , traveling slowly across a stretch of flat country . Somewhere to the left a dog was barking cows home ; they could hear a bell or two . The sound kept pace with them in the leveling sunlight and after a few minutes they saw a house and barn beside the road . A man with a milk pail stood near the road . He eyed the caravan suspiciously . " You ca n't camp here , " he greeted them . " We do n't want to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us into Newark ? " " It will , though you 'd better cross over Buxsted 's bridge to the main road . Why n't you take the main road in Lyons ? " " We must 've missed it . " " Nobody but a durned fool could miss the main road , " said the farmer . His cows were coming down his lane , followed by the barkingdog and a couple of children . The nearness of beef on the hoof roused old Oscar 's ambitions . He started coughing to himself inside the cage wagon and the cows stopped suddenly and began to mill in the lane , driving the dog to distraction . " Move on , get out , " shouted the farmer . " Damn gypsies . " He shook his pail at them . " Snotty galoot , " Bastock commented . Budlong said nothing . His eye had lit on a few chickens ahead . They had been prospecting the roadside grass and the high weeds and bushes held them close to it . " Chaddy , " he said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back . " No . He 's all mixed up with his milkers . " Budlong whistled round his spit and let the lash of his black/snake drop close to the ground on the side nearest the chickens . It quivered , twitching up the snapper like a snake held by the tail and forking his tongue . As it came abreast of the first chicken Budlonglifted it . It shot out in a line , the slender end popped softly , and the next instant the chicken was being raised by the neck . The neck was broken . Budlong fished him up and laid him next the tent peg under his feet . " Got to be gentle , " he said to himself . " Got to be gentle . " He snaffled a second , a rousing fat hen . It was like magic . The rest of the chickens just stood and admired . But like other credulous beings , time and the inexorable passage of events preserved them . The tent wagon had gone by and Budlong was contenting himself with delivering a homily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gentle . Got to flick the wrist . You get ambitious and you take the head off . But go gentle , Chaddy , and your pot 's bound to be full . That hen will make good gravy . " He prodded his thumb into her . " Too fat to lay , anyhow ; she 's no loss to that snotty bastard . And that little rooster could n't tread a strawberry . I 'm just saving him feed . " Bastock bawled back , " How many 'd you get ? " " Two , " Chad said . " One 's a fat hen . " Bastock yelled up ahead to Joe . " Two , Joe . One 's a fat hen . " Budlong 's was obviously an old and tried accomplishment . Somehowit heartened Chad . It gave him the feeling that in a riot those three bezabors would turn out better than gold . He eyed the sun , which had begun to sink towards the horizon . " If it starts up sudden anywheres , " he said to Caroline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you keep off , see ? Look out for yourself . In the dark , like that , in tights , a man might mistake you . " She looked at him , her face filled with tenderness . She said , " All right , Chad , " humbly . And he thought , " Christ ! " without feeling profane. p 300 Nobody had thought of asking the man with the milk pail how far it was to the next farm , or whether the next farm was Buxsted 's , where he had said the bridge was . They struck rough hauling . For a quarter mile the tent wagon had to be eased over rocks and into holes an inch at a time if there was n't going to be a broken reach or axle . When they got through the bad piece , the sun was a red ball in the western haze , a balloon balanced on the lip of space . The glowing light it poured across the land seemed to enlarge distances . The track was leading them out into a big farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an apple orchard ; but they pulled beyond it , the road mounting a slight grade towards a hayfield where a few left-over cocks sat on their long shadows . The picture of the land grew familiar to Chad 's eye . A kind-hearted woman here had given a skinny driver boy a drink of switchel from a pail . He remembered how the field sloped over the roll of ground clear to the towpath ; that day a line of men had been mowingthe top of it ; he had seen them against the sky . Beyond , now , would be the bridge , sixty , seventy rods away , and the house and barns were back a hundred yards on this same road . He turned to tell Budlong to look south towards the main road . But Budlong was already looking , watching the crest of the hayfield as his head slowly rose with the grade . He made a quick hissing noise . " Stop them up ahead , Chaddy . " Chad thumped Jerry with his heels ; the first couple of jumps brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , and went by . Joe Duddy happened to be watching . He had stopped the cage wagon already . Huguenine , however , kept right on . He had pulled out eighty feet , with the light rig still ahead , before Chad got to him . Chad risked a yell to Ike and pointed left . Ike pulled up and stared , as did Fiero and the Pamplons , but from the way Fiero flashed his teeth , Chad knew that he had caught them in time.  |p30IWhen  he came up to them , he saw that the road had leveled out and the rise of the hayfield still kept them out of sight . " Budlong said to stay here , " he told them . " I guess he 's seen Burke 's show . I 'll go back and find out . " Caroline had dismounted . She was standing by the nigh front wheel of the tent wagon , staring up at Budlong 's lean brown face . She was shivering a little . " Do n't get scared , " Chad told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . Budlong says they 're hauling past the bridge road . " " They could have seen my head , " Budlong said . " But there 's a line of boats on the canal . They probably thought it belonged to one of the boats . " He raised himself inch by inch to look once more , this time ahead . " This wagon 's too high . If it was a foot shorter we could get right past the buildings . There 's woods on the other side . People on the farm must be eating supper . There 's a couple of kids , though , but they 're crossing the bridge . They 've gone to watch the big show . " Chad 's eyes lit on the haycocks . " We can get by , " he said . " You go ahead , " he told Caroline . " Tell the rest to pull right by the farm and wait for us when they get into the woods . " He gave her a leg up and sent her off . Presently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to do ? " " Your lines are long enough so you can drive standing on the roof , ai n't they ? " " Yep . " Chad said , " I 'll hand you up three or four of them haycocks . It 's far enough off so the hay will make you look like a decent farmer . " Budlong grinned . " Start pitching , sonny . " Chad forked the fence . He dropped four cocks over it and then started handing them up . It was quite a job , without a fork , but the more that stuck to the sides of the big wagon the better . Bud- long spread it with artistic appreciation . " It sure will look like one hell of a big hayload , " he said . " Burke 's people wo n't know the road 's low down . What are they doing now ? " The tent wagon was rolling along now and with perfect unconcernBudlong watched across the canal the procession on the other road . " Must be a dozen wagons gone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three coaches and the rest look like luck-boy outfits . The tent wagons are coming along . They 've got five box wagons . It certainly is a big establishment , " he said admiringly . " Maybe Burke thinks we 've been scared out . By Cripus , there 's his rig ! " They were bearing down on the farmyard now . The bridge road coming in from the left was in sight . " Think you better haul in behind the barn ? " Budlong shook his head . " I do n't think he noticed . The bridge will block his sight . He was talking to the kids . Once we 're by it , we 're all right for a while . " The barn hid their own view now ; then the wagon rolled across the road from the bridge . A battered signpost said : LOCKVILLE 2 miles . Chad , riding in the ditch , saw the bridge bare against the sky . Then they had passed two corncribs and a shed and were in the woods , and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together beside the treasury wagon , and the lay of the ground now allowed them to catch glimpses through the trees of the procession passing on the other side of the canal . " They 're hauling by , " Ike said . " By holy , there goes the elephant . " " Yep , " said Mr. Huguenine . " They play Palmyra tomorrow . I guess they 've give up looking for us . " It was quiet in the woods . They imagined they could hear the roll of the wagons along the other road . Then with the startling clarity of clapping thunder , a team and wagon banged over the bridge . It was Mr. Burke 's rig . He was pointing his whip towardsp303the barn , and the two children , obviously torn with a desire to see the elephant , were pattering along beside him . " God damn it , " said Bastock . " He seen you and he 's asked them something about their Pa and they 've told him Pa was eating supper . We ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a good chance , with the big show already past the bridge and traveling opposite them . If they were out of sight by the time Burke came to the crossroad , he would have to follow along to find them . If he did that , he would have to go back to the bridge , overtake his own show , get his canvasmen , and return round the whole loop . That would give Huguenine 's a head start . By the time they were caught up with , it ought to be dark . They might have found a place to hide . Burke could n't spend the whole night looking for them ; he would need the gang to make the pitch in Palmyra early in the morning . And if he did n't come after them now , Huguenine 's would wait the time out in the woods until near sunrise before moving on themselves . It seemed fool-proof . While the small wagons forged ahead rapidly , the tent wagon slammed through the low branches and not even Huguenine bothered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad watched the diminishing spot that marked the road entrance of the woods . It was getting darker fast ; he doubted if they could be seen , even before they turned the corner . Then he shouted to Budlong to stop . The groaning of the wagon reach would be a dead give-away . They waited ten minutes without Burke or anyone else showingup . Budlong began to feel hopeful . " Maybe he was n't sure he seen me at all . " He unloaded his old quid and got himself a freshstarter . " Bastock 's always imagining things . He had me believing Burke had asked those kids about their Pa . Probably he just went to the house to ask if they 'd seen our circus . They said , No . They ai n't seen anything . " Chad forked his fingers up and down in Jerry 's mane . " He ought to know we took that road , " he said . " Somebody was bound to tell him and he would n't have left without asking . " " That 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better do ? " " Well , we ca n't turn around , " Chad said , eyeing the bulk of the tent wagon . " We might as well go ahead and get out of these woods before it 's black dark . " They got rolling again , but for a while it looked as though they had fixed themselves even if Burke had n't . The road was n't made for a rigging the size of the tent wagon . In one place they scraped the boles of trees on both sides simultaneously , and there were about a hundred yards where Chad had to get up on top of the wagon and chop branches as they came to them . But they pulled out of the woods shortly after and found smooth tracks . Both sides were pasture . They could tell , in spite of the darkness , from the silhouettes of the thorn trees which had waists sculptured by the browsing of cattle . Caroline said they looked like ladies in a fashion plate , promenading ; and the notion delighted Joe Duddy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a corset . He did n't see how the pigeons managed it , anyway . It was funny the way most genteel ladies and the fanciest pigeons wore the tightest corsets . He remembered one he had cut the strings of and it was like . . . . Chad and Caroline let the cage wagon roll ahead , carrying Joe 's memoirs with it . The only thing to listen was Oscar , who was making pleased , snuffling grunts at the smoother going . A fleece of cloud had risen in the west . They saw the moon through it for a moment ; then it dipped under and the blackness settled . In the space of comparative light , however , they were made aware of the opening up of the countryside . And after a little they heard a boat horn and saw the bow lantern approaching not two hundred yards away . Calling a halt , Huguenine suggested getting out lanterns , but Chad and the skinners argued against it . While they were discussing round the treasury wagon , the gliding light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again in an aura of reflectedp305glow . Then it emerged into the night once more , a point in darkness . He said , " There 's a bridge , there . " " Where ? " Chad pointed . Bastock said , " Let 's cross it and get onto the main road . " " It 's just a farm bridge , probably . " " If it is , it was built to carry a hay load . " " The tent wagon weighs more than that . " " Hell , " said Budlong . " We 'll get over . I want to get on a decent road . I get tired snaffling this wagon through all them trees . It wears my nerves down . I knew a skinner went crazy taking a wagon through a woods trace . Started tracking right off into the bushes . " They did n't let him tell what the skinner died of . Suddenly they felt fine . Burke 's show had gone by , or the lights would be in sight . Burke 's show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep to this track all the way into Lockville . But with the bridge handy , the main road had become feasible . Chad and Caroline , leading the procession , scouted for the turnoff . It proved merely a pair of ruts . There was a small hay barn close by , but no house . The farm buildings , they judged , would be on the other side of the bridge . They crossed together , the two horses sniffing the bridge and then stamping over nobly . On the far side the ramp sloped more gently onto the meadowland . Chad handed Jerry 's bridle to Caroline and walked back over the bridge . The wagons were lined up on the north side , waiting for him . " It looks all right , " he reported . " We ought to have a light on the bridge , " Huguenine said . " There ai n't nobody after us now and the horses will go steadier with the wagons if they have a light to look at . " After a moment they decided it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole land was quiet , and the canal , except for the boat that had already passed , was a black and empty trench . Chad took the lighted lantern and laid it on the planking next thep306rail . The bridge top became an island in the darkness , just enough light reaching out to shade the two ramps . Budlong got down and stood on the bridge to feel the timbers as the wagons went over . They shook somewhat under the seat wagon , but he said they were sound enough to prop Jerusalem . He climbed up on the tent wagon and started his four horses . They had a stretch before they hit the grade , and then they started digging . For an instant the wagon seemed to cock against the sky , and Budlong on his high perch reared in darkness . His voice came down in syllables , encouraging the horses . Their bellies were taut and hard with straining . Then the front of the wagon came down ; the whole bridge quivered ; the reach gave an excruciating groan ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bucking its pole up to the wheelers ' chins . Budlong relaxed and looked behind . They could see him curse , but what he said was drowned by a wild yell from the road they had left . " Burke 's , by God . " It was Bastock . " Tent pegs ! " he shouted . " I 'll be back , " yelled Budlong . " Get up on the bridge . " They had no time to think . They grabbed for the tent pegs and ran pell-mell to the bridgehead . They could see the rig coming at a gallop ; it was coming from the west along the road they had just quit . It carried two lamps , and the vent holes sprayed light enough for Huguenine 's little group to see the load of Burke 's hyenas crammingthe open box . Chad tried to count them , a dozen anyway ; they all looked tough . His mind went hastily over Huguenine 's : four skinners , Huguenine made five , Fiero six , Pamplon seven , Ike eight , Shepley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just God that had put the bridge there , or maybe it was the canal commissioner , or the pigheaded farmer who had stood up for his rights , or the Democratic vote . It gave them a chance to make a stand . He felt a small cold spot in his smaller entrails enlarging rapidly . If they had had ap307minute more they could have ripped the planks out of the bridge . But they had barely time to beat the gang to the top . Chad 's feet pounded up the planks with Joe Duddy 's and Bastock 's . Huguenine , blowing in his wake , was crying , " That God-damned foxy bastard . " Then Budlong burst through them and hollered for room . He dropped his tent peg and took the light sledge in both hands , and as the opposing gang milled up the ramp roaring , he swung it from behind his calves , underhand , and let it go . It spun into their legs like a cartwheel lacking the rim . It mowed down three . They heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the men . " Kill the bastards . " Budlong spat into his fist and grabbed his tent peg . The Burke men crashed into them . Chad was spun around by a glancing knock on his head ; and he saw Fiero galloping away . Damn the Dago . Out of the mess a thick-built man materialized , jabbing at his guts with the end of his pole ; he felt it and then a resounding hollow pumpkin sound from the man 's head surprised him . He dropped the pole and covered his skull and Fred Shepley , white as fish belly , gave him a shove and the man 's thick middle buckled uncannilyand he went tail first through the rail , his splash shooting water nearly to the bridge floor . The fight became completely snarled . It made no sense . A head showed up and you brought your peg down and as like as not you hit another head . Pamplon was dropped early . Chad tripped over him where he lay . He looked completely dead , but the blood was comingfrom his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowedjust above him . He knew it was Joe from the size of his legs and the faint smell of Oscar on his shoes . He heaved himself up to see Joe and a red-faced mug wrestling for the same peg . Their faces were absorbed . They were n't doing any damage . They might as well have been counting cats . Chad swung his boot into the man 's rear end with all his might and felt it bounce . The man belched like a steamboat , straightened and turned , and Joe Duddy brought the club down on the top of his head . The man fell against Chad and sat down hard . It was Walsh himself . To Chad it seemed beautiful . Then a stone hit him on the arm , and he saw Fiero poised on the bridge above , with rocks at his feet . His left leg was extended , his right hand back , he heaved , said , " Hah ! " and let her come . Chad ducked . He heard Mr. Huguenine yelp , and whirled to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg and was using his fists . He was doing fine . But a third man hit him with the haft of a sledge and he went down like a post , full length . Chad took the rush of the three men . Budlong appeared with a bloody mouth and cracked one of them . He heard Joe Duddy 's call for help . A great wet mass hit him in the back ; he felt the weight like a bear 's all over him and a pair of hairy arms took him round the waist , squeezing the juices in him , and he knew it was his thick-built antagonist climbed back from the canal . He butted backward with his head , and the man banged him on the planks and fell on top of him . They started rolling . Fiero shouted , " No rocks ! " in a piercing voice and leaped for life . His splash coming up met Chad and the thick man going down and they all three tangled in the water . " Drink , bugger , " grunted the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under water and clawed for his legs . He caught the waistband of the man 's trousers and yanked . He felt the fly open and kept pulling . The trousers came down and Chad let go . The man stood there hobbled . He could n't kick free . Chad reached out and pushed him over as easy as a rotted fence post . He went full length , mouth open , making a wide swell that lapped Chad 's wishbone . Heaving a minute to get his wind back , Chad decided that he need n't bother about him . He could smell mud roiled from the bottom . As he started wading for the bank , the thick man rolled up through the water desperately hoisting his trousers and floundered towards the other shore . An enormous upheaval of water on the upper side of the bridge announced a new arrival . Chad waded to see who it was . It was Mr. Huguenine . He was making feeble paddles with his hands . He kept saying , " God damn Walsh . " They were in pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the water on the lower side . Chad grabbed Mr. Huguenine and started laboriously to tow him out . Overhead the stamping ceased . They heard Walsh say , " I guess they 're licked . Let 's get the wagons . " Mr. Huguenine groaned in Chad 's hands . Chad felt himself gettingsick . He was thoroughly surprised when Mr. Huguenine suddenlyand completely vomited . It seemed as if somebody had made a mistake . He started to grin . He was getting silly . And they were licked . In just a second now Walsh would set fire to the tent wagon and the whole Huguenine show would be done for , for good . There not being anything else to do , he kept on towing Mr. Huguenine to the shore . It was difficult getting him up the slope of the berm , and at the top he dragged him round so his head hung down to the water , in case there was any more draining in prospect . He would be all right there . Chad started stumbling towards the wagons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , if possible , before Walsh 's hyenas reached the horses . But he was stopped short by Mrs. Huguenine 's voice . " You stay right where you are , Mr. Walsh . If you move , I 'll let it off and so will Caroline . I do n't know who she 'll hit , she ai n't never fired a gun before . But I 'm bound to get you . " There she was , just short of the top of the bridge , with an enormousshotgun in her fat hands . Her bonnet ribbons shook as she emphasized her words . Beside her , pale and intent , Caroline pointed a small rifle at the victorious remains of Burke and Walsh 's gang . Mrs. Huguenine continued , " Sundays I set on the porch with the rifle and shoot woodchucks , Mr. Walsh . With this spray gun I can just about pucker you . No , do n't go back . Just your tough boys . I want you to come up here . " The gang showed no intention of moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misread . It was n't the idea of the gun that scared them so much as that it was in Mrs. Huguenine 's hands . To their eyes , the opening of its muzzle must have taken on some of the woman 's own width.  | Mr. Walsh did n't like it either . He said , " I guess we 've had enough , ma'am . We 'll go now . " He could n't keep the satisfaction from his voice . It was fairly obvious that Huguenine 's was in a bad way , even if their equipment did remain . " Maybe . " Mrs. Huguenine drew a snorting breath . " But I do n't trust you . I want to be told plain you 're through . Come here , mister . Come closer . I want to see you , when I talk to you . " It was fascinating . The red-faced Walsh looked as if his mind were leaning backwards . He approached her up the bridge , a step at a time , across the top , and stopped three feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Huguenine said sharply . " Now , Mr. Walsh , you give me your word as a gentleman you wo n't bother us here again ? " " Yes ma'am . I do , " said Walsh . Quick as lightning she lifted the barrel of the gun . She brought it down . She poleaxed him completely . He fell on his face . His chin bounced just once from the planks . " I believe him , " Mrs. Huguenine said complacently to Caroline . " Now you fellers can put him in the wagon . And get going . Tell Mr. Burke I think he is a skunk . And do n't get funny . Me and this girl are staying right here . " She watched them steadily as they took Walsh by the arms and travoised him down the bridge . After a minute the wagon started . Mrs. Huguenine put the gun butt solidly on the planks . It thumped , and in the same instant the barrel belched forth a thunderous report . " Oh my stars ! " she screamed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to Newark was a puzzle to them all for a long time afterwards . Chad had rushed up onto the bridge ; at least he had thought hep31Iwas rushing till Caroline pulled his arm over her shoulder and said , " You lean on me . " " I ai n't hurt , " he told her . " I 'm just sore . " But it was pleasant to let his weight lean on her and feel her slim body using all its strength to hold him up . She said , " I saw you fighting that man and go off the bridge with him . I was sure you were killed . But you licked him , Chad . " With Mrs. Huguenine , they took stock . Joe Duddy was sitting up and rubbing his head . Budlong had a nosebleed as well as a broken mouth and had lost two teeth . Bastock had a lump on his head as big as Chad 's , and when he got on his feet he had to sit down again , suddenly . Shepley had been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no broken bones . Pamplon seemed the worst hurt : he was still unconscious . Caroline found somebody 's hat and fetched water in it while Mrs. Pamplon , who had rushed from the wagons now that it was over , ministered to him with a wet small handkerchief and wailed . Budlong came over to examine him . " He 'll be all right , " he pronounced . " Frenchmen stun easy . " He sat down with his back to a rail upright and said he wished he could chew . Fiero returned . " My rocks were all gone , " he explained . " I look all over but there are no more rocks . " Chad said , " We better fetch A. D. " He and Fiero went down to the canal bank and dragged Huguenineup to the road . Mrs. Huguenine said , " Is he bad ? " " I do n't know , " Chad said . She nodded . " You got to expect it when you go jumping off bridges at his age . Take him up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a hard job , but Fiero and Chad and Joe managed it . Hugueninelay on the bed like a bundle of wet wash . But when they lit a candle , he groaned and opened his eyes . Closing them again , he asked , " Did they burn the wagons , Bet-tina ? " " No . It 's all right . " Mrs. Huguenine poured whiskey into him till he choked . " He 's liable to get a stroke , but he 'll be all right tomorrow , I guess . But you and me will have to get the show to Newark . Bastock and Joe can drive , and I 'll take the treasury wagon . I guess Ike or Fiero could drive the light rig . But you 'll have to handle the tent wagon . Can you ? " " I guess so . " " Any man who 's been hit on the head like Budlong or Joe or Pete would get dizzy that high up , " she said . " Caroline will have to bring the ring horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a painful procession that finally rolled into Newark . Carolinehelped Chad stable the horses and get the other performers to the small tavern . It took some time to persuade the proprietor to let them in , and longer to get him to give them beds after he had seen their condition . Chad was all played out when he got back to the lot . The three skinners were asleep under the tent wagon and Mrs. Huguenine was sitting on the steps of the treasury wagon in the early light of dawn . She held her fingers to her lips . " He 's gone to sleep , Chaddy , " she whispered . " I set down here to see if he would and now I dass n't get off because of shaking the wagon . But I brought a blanket out for you , and here 's some whiskey . Take a good drink and go to sleep . When you wake up we 'll figure what to do . " She was still sitting there when he closed his eyes . Four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage wagon . They could smell the lion and they were trying to see him . Chad chased them out of the lot before going over to ask for Huguenine . The rocking of the treasury wagon showed that Mrs. Huguenine was busy inside ; so Chad sat down to wait in the sun with his back to a wheel . He had a good deal on his mind and nobody to talk to . Budlong , Bastock , and Joe Duddy were still snoring under the tent wagon with a few sun-stirred flies exploring the eddies over their faces ; they ought not to be waked until it wasp313necessary . In the meantime , however , somebody would have to get Oscar his meat ration and find out how Shepley , Ike , and Pamplon felt . Fiero , of course , was all right . It would have to be decided whether they would show . He had n't had time to look around the town to see if any of Huguenine 's paper remained  --  probably none . As he turned the prospects over in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Walsh had had to haul through Newark in the middle of the night . Probably nobody had seen the elephant . Oscar might have some attraction after all : he had had for those little boys . Chad wondered how small boys managed to get up and get to the right place , no matter how early . This bunch had still had sleep grit in their eyes . A basin of water arched through the window of the treasury wagon and Mrs. Huguenine , as usual , looked out after her throw to make sure she had hit nobody . " My stars , " she said . " I did n't wet you , did I ? " " No , ma'am . How 's A. D. ? " She came out of the door , closed it behind her , and beckoned Chad away from the wagon . She sat down on the pole of the cage wagon . " Set alongside , " she invited . But , noticing the bend of the pole , Chad said he preferred solid ground . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's miserable and he thinks he feels worse . I think he 's got some fever and I 'd like you to bring him a doctor . " " What do you think 's the matter ? " " I do n't know . He might have hurt his insides . Falling off the bridge that way . If he 'd only let them hit him on the head , " she said . " Moses on the mountain ! " Chad did n't try to figure out what she meant by that ejaculation . He said he needed money for Oscar 's meat . " I 'll give it to you . I clean forgot about that poor old cat . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . " " Well , I been figuring . Do you think we 'll show here ? " " Show ? We 've got to . " She nodded at him . " I know you boys feel mean . We all do some , ourselves . " There were dark pouches under her eyes . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did the rest of her . " A. D. ' s an old man , " she said suddenly to Chad . " You boys probably do n't figure how old he is . He 's near seventy . When I married him twelve years ago my mother thought I was throwing myself away . She said I 'd bury him inside of five . But I did n't , did I ? " " No , ma'am . " Chad picked a grass blade and sucked the tip . " We can get the tent up all right . I 'm thinking about Shepley and Pamplon . Pamplon got a real lick , and Shepley took a beating , too . I do n't believe he could even vault , let alone Somerset . " " We got to show , Chad . " She folded her hands in her lap , leaned towards him , staring . Her eyes looked large . Chad had never noticed before how good-looking they were . She said to him , " Here 's how it is . We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad , or a hundred and thirty-five every day , just to pay expenses . " She stopped . " No , that was before Albany quit on us . The number of full tickets we have to sell is seven hundred and twenty-five now , or about one hundred and twenty-one . Her board and salary come to $23.25 . Eighteen dollars for salary  --  we ca n't pay like a big show . " Chad looked at her with admiration . " How do you keep all those figures in your head ? " She lifted a plump hand . " Land of Goshen ! The way poor A. D. worries his head and talks figures , I 've got them all by heart . " Chad was interested . " I 'd be curious to hear what they are , " he said . " I do n't mind telling you . We pay out $I24 a week for salaries  --  that includes me at $5 . Then board costs $47.25 . The stock costs $10 and Oscar $15o . We generally have to pay something for lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . The $20 covers all his expenses , and we allow a dollar fifty a week for paper . Now if we miss a day 's show , you see that throws the whole business off , and we have to borrow for that week against the last good one . We been making money ; but lately we 've been losing . It comes pretty close , and it 's getting closer , and it makes A. D. fret so . "  | She looked at Chad . " You see why we got to show ? " He said , " Yes . I hope we can . I 'll see how Shepley is . " He got up and roused the skinners . They complained . They were all sore , and Budlong 's face had swelled out of all recognizable proportion . Chad told them that Huguenine was going to show , and that when he returned with meat for Oscar , they would haul the rag up . Bastock and Budlong merely grunted , but Joe Duddy 's lamentations followed him all the way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Caroline was waiting on the porch . " I wanted to go up to the lot , but I was afraid I 'd miss you . Are you feeling all right ? " she asked anxiously . " Kind of tired , that 's all , " he said . " Have you heard anything about Shepley or Pamplon ? " She shook her head . " Well , " he said , " I 'll have to find out . You know where their rooms are ? " " Yes . " She took him upstairs . The sleepy clerk at the office desk eyed them without comment . The upper hall was a dark channel smelling mustily of bedding . She showed him the door . The Pamplons were awake . Mrs. Pamplon in a ragged but lacy dressing gown , her hair still in papers , answered Chad 's raps . She said her husband was just getting up ; his head ached , but he was all right , possibly . Could he perform ? Oh , it was impossible . Such a blow ! Pamplon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been shaving . His face was white and his forehead showed an ugly swelling . He shrugged his shoulders . He would perform ; maybe not the manual of arms . " Silence , " he said to his wife . And she wilted away from the door . Fiero answered at the next door and Chad went into the room . Shepley was sitting up on his side of the bed , his feet on the floor , his hands braced on the mattress . He would ride , he said , grinningwryly . But he did n't know whether he could vault standing . The show had to be put on . " We wo n't expect a lot , " Chad said.  | " You took a beating . " He felt embarrassed at having to change his opinion of Shepley so completely . " I want to thank you for cracking that feller 's head , Fred . " " That 's all right , " Shepley said . " I guess Ike 's all right . He went out early . " He heaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " It 's funny what a lot of places you can get hit without knowing it at the time . " Fiero said importantly to Chad , " I get him fixed . Me , I am all right . If I had had rocks enough I would have spoiled the attack . " " That 's right , " Chad agreed . " With the knives , I miss , because that is how I learn . With the rocks , never . I throw , I leap , I dive . " He flashed his smile . Chad closed the door and found Caroline still in the hall . " Is Fred all right ? " He nodded . " What about eating ? " " Just a minute , Chad . It 's so warm , I think I 'll leave my shawl . " She walked down the hall to her own room , pausing at the door to look at him . " Do you want to come in ? " She was shy . Both knew what her words meant . And Chad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was lucky , " she said . " I got the room all to my-self . " Chad stared round ; tomorrow night he would be sharing a room like this . The bed stood in the middle of the wall ; there was a washhandstand with crockery that had brown mottles . The cake of soap was thin . Her nightdress was hung over a chair to air . In spite of its mustiness , the room still contained a faint , young-woman scent . Chad stood uneasily while she hung the shawl under the gingham dress-curtain , picked up the nightdress . It must have been one of Albany 's . Practically everything Caroline owned must have come from Albany . He wondered whether it disturbed her , too . " You all ready ? " " Yes , Chad . "  |p317She  had had no time to find an eating place so they hunted one together . As they ate Chad revolved in his mind the feelings he had had in her room . It must be hard for a girl not to have anything of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I ought to make you a present before we get married . A man ought to , when he gets betrothed . I do n't know what a girl would want to buy , but here 's two dollars . " He had figured the amount out carefully . He handed her the bills without looking . " Oh Chad , " she said . " It 's too much . " " No it 's not . " " What do you want me to buy ? " " Something for you yourself . " He could n't tell her outright . " Something pretty , with lace maybe . " She said nothing . When he looked at her he saw tears in her eyes . " You 're so good , " she said softly . " Lord knows what the show will be like . A. D. ca n't move out of bed , Mrs. Huguenine says . She wants me to get a doctor . I better hurry up and find one . " They found a doctor 's sign on a porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Jos . Danvers looked like a good enough man and he came along with them . There was n't room for him and Mrs. Huguenine together in the treasury wagon , so she waited outside with Caroline and Chad , fidgety as a hen hatching eggs . After a few minutes the doctor opened the door and asked for a basin . " What for ? " Mrs. Huguenine asked , turning putty-colored . " To bleed him into , " the doctor said shortly . " It 's under the bed , " she said . " A. D. thought he was going to be sick . I put it there . Is he all right , doctor ? " " Yes . " The doctor closed the door . Pretty soon he opened it once more , to emerge with his hat and bag in hand . " That will be fifty cents , " he said . He was a youngish man and he looked curiously at them and at the other wagons and the skinners.  | " Keep him lying quiet for a week and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on . " What happened to him ? " Mrs. Huguenine had climbed into the wagon for the money so Chad told him that Huguenine had fallen off a canal bridge . He had to explain how Burke and Walsh had tried to run them off the road . The doctor nodded . " I got home late last night and they were passing through town then . " " Chad ! " Mrs. Huguenine sounded faint . Chad went into the wagon and found her sitting on the edge of the bunk with a fiftycentbill in her fingers . She said , " Take that basin away . It makes me sick . Poor A. D. All that blood . Oh my . " Chad took the basin up . It looked as if there were a quart of blood in it . But Huguenine was n't particularly pale . He opened his eyes and told Chad to offer the doc a free pass . " Yes , " said Mrs. Huguenine , cordially . " If he ai n't bled A. D. to death , he 's wel-come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed Joe Duddy the basin to dispose of . " What 'll I do with it , give it to Oscar ? You suppose that old man-eating cat would drink it ? " Joe asked . " It might tonic him some . " The doctor smiled . " I 'd like to come if I 'm free , " he said . " A lot of people have gone over to Palmyra . But I hope you folks run Burke off the route yourselves . " He shook hands with Chad , lifted his hat to Caroline , and stalked across the lot towards his house . " He had n't even had his breakfast , " Caroline said sympathetically . " Oh , he 'll eat it all right , " Joe reassured her . " Doctors never throw up . " " Chad , " Mrs. Huguenine called . " A. D. wants to see you . " " How are you feeling ? " Chad asked him . Mr. Huguenine opened his eyes and said , " Thirsty . " He closed them . " Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell you is you 've got to take my place . You 've got to till I get up . " " I could n't do that . " " You got to , Chad . There ai n't nobody else . If Bisbee was herep319he could . But he ai n't , damn his hide . That feller 's always somewhereyou do n't know where , " Mr. Huguenine said blurredly . " I ca n't argue . Doc said so . You do it . " " I ai n't got the clothes . " " Wear mine . I got the speeches all wrote out . Bisbee done it . You can read if you 've got to . You got to act up with Ike  --  " " Could n't Bastock ? Or Budlong ? " " They 'd look like skinners just the same . No , I 'm depending on you . Get my coat out , Bettina . " The coat went on , but it hung pretty loose and Chad 's arms showed all of the wrists . But Mrs. Huguenine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . " Hold it in your hand . I 'll give you twenty-five cents extry a day , " said Huguenine . " I got to rest . " The idea appalled Chad . In the first place he did not know how Budlong and Bastock were going to feel about it . They were older hands and by rights it seemed to him they should have been chosen for the job . In the second place , it was fun to listen to Huguenine 's confusion , but it was going to be a lot different being out there himself in the ring . His instinct told him that he would have just as bad a time with " gymnast " as the gaffer had . He felt like a fool coming out of the treasury wagon with the coat on his arm and the hat in his hand . But Caroline caught on instantly . Her whole face lighted . " Oh , it 's wonderful , Chad . " " No it ai n't . " " You 'll be fine . I know it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks so too , or he would n't ask you . I 'm proud . " Well , that was nice , he thought , but he ignored her , crossing to the three skinners . They eyed him and his garments and Bastock grinned and said , " Morning , gaffer . " " You ought to get the job , " Chad said . Budlong said , " We would n't want to miss the fun . Besides , we 're musicians . The show ca n't get along without us . " Joe Duddy grinned.  | " Got any orders , Mr. Hanna ? " Chad felt better . " Yes , put up the rag , " he said . The tent went up slowly . But they got her raised and the ring pegged and the seats in about eleven o'clock . They were exhausted . Ike showed up apparently able to ride , so Caroline had a ring practiceand by noon , when the parade started , they all felt a little more limber . As soon as Ike Wayfish started to make his exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited him . For one thing , he could handle a whip better than Huguenine . He did n't miss a snap . He could even get gradations of sound and expression out of it , so that people could tell how he was feeling . He found himself becoming a young , self-important man , with a great notion of how things ought to be run , and this built up Ike 's part better than Huguenine 's obvious confusion and lack of ease . Every now and then the audience was inclined to sympathize with Huguenine . That was all wrong . The equestrian director ought to be a man you instinctively disliked , and the whole show ought to be built up to the moment when he was confounded by the man and the maneatinglion . In other words , everyone should see how fine and efficientthe equestrian director thought himself so that they could gradually come to share with the clown the exquisite ecstasy of making a monkey of the boss . Ike began to play up almost from the start . The back chat had more whip to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by contrast made his determination to get into the show funnier . It was n't long before a little girl in the front row , noticing one of Ike 's attempts to get back into the ring , screamed , " Look out , Mr. Clown ! " at the top of her shrill voice.  |p32IChad  had n't had much time to memorize the speeches . But once he had worked through the opening address , it did n't matter . The acts carried him along . He had been listening to Huguenine for nearly a month , and the words were all in his brain and seemed to come out of themselves . The smallness of the audience helped . It was easier to attract their attention , to make them listen . A big tentful often bolted off on some track of their own , like a batch of calves finding a hole in a fence . A little boy might get sick , and the high-rider could throw a somersaultand break his neck but the whole tent would be looking to see what the little boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , it was easy for Chad to estimate the reaction to the individual performers . For instance , the faces turned to follow Carolinealmost as much as to watch Fiero during the juggling act . And she had almost nothing to do , there . On the other hand , while the Pamplons were at work , they paid no attention to Mrs. Pamplon . They were only interested in Pamplon , but they were n't sympathetic , the way they were with Caroline . Fred Shepley fascinated them , and of course they loved Ike . Chad decided that Caroline , if she managed to become a good rider , would pull the crowd with her as well as or better than Albany had . He studied her to see why . She was pretty ; she was a lot prettier than she used to seem ; and she had a good build . The men watched her . With Mrs. Pamplon , the tights just meant tights ; but with Caroline you thought of the girl in the tights . And she did n't do any of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoeing one foot , or smoothing her short skirt , or pirouetting . Whatever Caroline did , however , showed that she put her heart into it . She seemed to like the people ; she wanted them to like the show ; right now , she showed by the way she looked at Chad that she thought he was being wonderful . At first , it seemed like a mistake . Then he realized that it helped him to build up the picture he was giving them of the cold , exacting ring-boss . It would work out even better when they reached Palmyra and she did her first public riding with Ike . The show itself went surprisingly well , considering what Hu.  | guenine 's troupe had gone through . People forgot the bruised faces of the band players . Though Budlong 's swelled mouth choked the fife notes pretty badly , Bastock was clear enough with the bugle and Joe Duddy had never gone stronger on the drum . Pamplon had had to give up his manual of arms ; he was giddy on the wire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to Chad was Fred Shepley . He vaulted well and he rode , though stiffly , with the kind of fire he had showed during that first ring practice in Syracuse . Chad wondered how he had misjudged the fellow so badly ; Shepley was the kind who lifted when the rest of the world was going down . He said now , as Fred leaped the ribbons , " Do n't clear those garters so high , just clear ' em . You 're making the rest of the show look like monkeys anyway . " Shepley grinned . " You forgotten the spiel about my somerset ? " " Do n't try it . " " You say it or they wo n't know what 's coming . " " You 're a damn fool , " Chad said , really alarmed . Suddenly he became aware of the fact that the audience was listening to them both . He had fallen out of character . He snapped his whip . He had better announce the somerset before Shepley made a complete monkey of him by making the attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted himself for the somerset ; it put a drag on the front muscles and it had got him where he was sore . But Shepley stayed on the horse . He did n't try to make the somerset to his knees . He spread his legs coming down and lit to his fork . Then he leaped off and took a bow stiffly and said out of the corner of his mouth , " What an equestrian director ! " Chad let him go . Ike Wayfish was making his rush , shouting , " Let me ride ! " " That ai n't a pullet , " Chad shouted in excited relief . There was a moment 's silence . This was supposed to be a clean show . But suddenly the men guffawed and Ike spread his arms and crowed and hit the horse and fell comically enough to carry the rest of the audience by . But Chad was sweating when he roared the " All out and over . "  |p323They  congratulated him , Mrs. Huguenine the first of all , crossingthe ring curb with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She kissed him . " My , I wish A. D. could have seen you , Chad . " Chad felt embarrassed . " We want to tear down early , " he said . " We ought to get to Palmyra before dark . " " What 's the hurry ? " Ike asked . " I 'll tell you , " Mrs. Huguenine said . " The equestrian director 's going to get married . Him and the new lady rider . We 'll all have supper after the show in Ludlow 's Hotel . Maybe Ike will arrange it . " " Sure , " said Ike . " I 'll be pleased . Get out of here , you two , so the rest of us can make arrangements right now . " Caroline was flushed bright and near tears . Mrs. Huguenine and Mrs. Pamplon kissed her ; and the men were shaking Chad 's hand . When Ike and Fred Shepley broke away to come over and wish her happiness , her heart overflowed . She had never had any friends of her own , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's with him . She felt so proud . Trid 's house and Canastota seemed a long way off ... . The show pulled into Palmyra to find Bisbee waiting on the lot . His intelligent eyes took them in with one embracing survey . " My God , folks , I 'm glad to see you . Where 's A. D. ? " He clicked his tongue as they told him . His long face became thoughtful . " I guessed there 'd been trouble when I saw their new paper . They got Albany advertised with their show now . " " We knew that two days ago , " Mrs. Huguenine said tartly . " While you was still gallivanting through the west . " " There ai n't a scrap of our paper left here or in Pittsford , " Bisbee said calmly . " A couple of Burke 's men chased me coming out of Pittsford . They acted mad , so I guessed there 's been some kind of trouble on the road . " " Mrs. Huguenine opened Walsh 's head with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bisbee , swinging his eyes admiringly to the fat woman . " I wish I 'd seen it happen . " " Did they chase you far ? " " They had rigs . I cut into a pasture . Nothing to it . " He sat down on the grass . " It sure is hard luck , working a girl like Albany to the top and having her stolen . But that 's business . How 's the show going ? " " We nearly paid in Newark . We had ninety-four . That 's without Albany on the pay list , " Mrs. Huguenine explained . Bisbee nodded . " There wo n't be no profit here , though . It 's hardly worth showing . Now we got to figure . . . " We 'll show here , " Bastock said . " A thin tent 's all the better . We 're putting on Carolina , the female high-rider , in her first public appearance . " Bisbee stared . They had to explain and then his face brightened and he looked at Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she goes well , we 'll do better than we did with Albany . You put a female in tights on top of a horse and every man in the place will get dirt in his eye trying to watch her . Carolina , " he caught right on , " the American equestrienne , riding against Europe 's best . It means new paper . It 'll have to be drawed special . What 's the act ? " Bastock explained . Bisbee nodded . " We 'll have to work her in with Fred , too . It 'll be more exciting , her in tights , him in tights , and Ike trying for a toe hold , just like every man in the audience would want to . How old are you , Missy ? " Caroline said in a low voice , " I 'll be seventeen in a month . " " ' This young and beautiful and talented American girl , the sylphideof the upper air . ' You remember I said that ? I know a printer here that has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the posters printed by tomorrow night . There 's no use showing Pittsford , though . We 'll try Penfield with the new paper . Unique , unequaledattraction . ' We ca n't show Rochester either . Burke 's wouldp325burn us out for sure this time . But there 's a lot of interest out in the west about Oscar and Ike . How is Oscar doing ? " " Not too sassy , " Joe Duddy reported . " That cat , " Bisbee said in a worried voice . " I hope he do n't peter out now . He 's our only card against the Menagerie , out west . Who 's doing the ring announcing ? " " Chad is , " Shepley said . " He 's good . " Bisbee stared again . Chad saw that Bisbee felt the same thing . There was a new friendlinessin the troupe . Fiero bustled forward . " My knifes are all right . Tomorrow I can throw them at Miss Trid . Superb . " " No you ca n't , " Bastock said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll maybe pick up a boy , cheap . It ought to be a good act , too . " " No , no , " Fiero protested . " I throw missing Miss Trid . I miss hittingsome other girl . " " Listen , Fiero . You happen to hit a girl and you 'll get hanged . You hit a boy , and maybe we can get you out of town . " Fiero spread his hands . " Such country , such people . So backside . " " I better talk to A. D. , " Bisbee said . " As soon as I get the paper printed tomorrow , I 'll light out for Penfield . We 'll show there July fourth . We ought to have an American flag for Carolina . " " I 'll get one , " Mrs. Huguenine promised . " But you 'll miss the wedding . " " What wedding ? " They had to tell him about that . " I 've been missing things , all right , " Bisbee said . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying a chew.  | " My heavenly days , " said Mrs. Huguenine . " I wish A. D. could be here to see it . Poor dear silly man . To fall off a bridge that way and miss out on this-here champagne wine . " She raised moist sentimental eyes to look at Mr. Bisbee . Bisbee was , it seemed to her , exactly like a horse her grandfather used to have , a brown horse with a long nose and a very intelligent face . His name was Prince , and if you could have brought him to Palmyra and sat him down right there at the other end of Ludlow'sHotel table , with a black coat on , and a spotted tie round his neck , he would have looked just like Mr. Bisbee . She leaned her elbow on the cloth , inclining her fat red cheek to Mrs. Pamplon , and whispered , with her eyes still on Bisbee , who was getting to his feet , " It do n't seem possible Granpa could have sold him to the glueworks , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pamplon agreed politely , watching her husband . It was obvious that he was only drinking the champagne out of politeness . Mrs. Pamplon wondered how these strange Western people made their champagne wine anyway . It lay down in one 's stomach as if it never wanted to get up . Henri would have a headachemost positively . She would have no sleep , because Henri 's headaches were savage ; she would have to tend him with cold towels . If he would merely pretend to drink . But Monsieur Wayfish kept asking him to say it was good . One had to please . She shuddered , as a dizzy image came into her mind of wild hogs trampling out grapes in a vat while they chewed apples and a careless wine maker spilled molasses . " What do they do to him in the glue factory ? " she asked Mrs. Huguenine . " Why , I never asked . They grind bones and fry fat , I think . It smells terrible . It does n't even smell like glue .... " Mrs. Pamplon stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded : " He never kicked , even when I pulled hairs from his tail . Shhhhh ! He 's going to make a speech . " Bisbee was on his feet . He arranged his wineglass and his brandy glass neatly in their places . " Ladies and gentlemen , my good friends ... " He raised his face . The table in Ludlow 's dining room had been tastefully arranged . He and Mrs. Huguenine faced each other down the length of it . On one side sat the three skinners , new-washed , new-shaved , their coats brushed . On the other were the bridal pair , flanked by Ike Wayfish and Shepley . Mrs. Pamplon and Fiero kept Mrs. Huguenine company . Pamplon was next to him . Everybody was wearing his best clothes . It was astonishing , he thought , that Chad could look so respectable . He wore a blue silk necktie round his neck , and a pink rose in his lapel . Caroline , as was proper , looked enchanting , with a bit of white gauze round her head and pansies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make his speech short . " It gives me great honor , on this nuptial occasion , to have been voted the chair . I appreciate my inadequacies . The one sad note of this matrimonial engagement is that the man who should properly preside is now in bed , I am thankful to say , not suffering , and soon , I trust , able to resume his accustomed sphere of activity in the great world of entertainment exemplified so happily by Huguenine 's Great and Only International Circus . I refer ,  --  " Bisbee bowed the length of the table ,  --  " as you may suspect , to our respected proprietor , equestrian director , and shall I not add universal good friend , A. D. Huguenine . Shall we drink his health ? " The tears rolled out on Mrs. Huguenine 's cheeks , as she rose with the others , to drink , at a public gathering , her own husband 's health . " Was n't that elegant , though ? " she asked Fiero . The Italian nodded . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of that stag . It would divert extremely , I think . " He gazed at the mounted head upon the wall over the fireplace , a deer of good horns , with an appearance of having caught cold , for there was a slight leakage of sawdust from the nostrils.  | Fiero was feeling fine : such food , the brandy free , this champagne wine . He was glad he had been seated at the ham end of the table . Though the turkey was all right when some of it managed to filter past those horse-skinning men who drove the wagons . There had also been two ducks , a large whitefish with a sauce of cream and eggs , and a piece of beef a la mode . The ice cream was vanilla . Now the cake had been set down before Mr. Hanna and Miss Trid ; but no , he should say Mrs. Hanna . Signora Carolina . He had thought of the name , or had someone else ? It was on the new posters , however , and tonight , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed virgin . That was not to be said aloud , but he had not intendedprofanity . If he thought about knife-throwing maybe he would not say such things even in his thoughts . Ah , virgins , he thought . He had never thrown his knife at a virgin ; probably he never would now . " Mr. Fiero , do you feel all right ? " asked Mrs. Huguenine . He smiled . " I feel so sad and so happy , " he told her . " Shhh , " she said , loudly , feeling the small occasional bubbles in her nose . She had better say " hist , " next time , she decided ; no tellingwhat this champagne wine might do to a woman if she was n't accustomed to it . Bisbee rapped on his glass , and the kitchen door swung open and one of the tavern help , a girl lacking a front tooth , bawled , " What do you want ? " Bisbee was flustered . " Nothing , thank you , my girl . Nothing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out back , to the left , in case you want to know . " Bisbee hemmed a moment before he regained his stride . " It is auspicious , " he said . " An auspicious occasion , that our acting equestrian director and our new and unique star , Carolina , the only lady high-rider now traveling New York State , should on the night of such a happy debut also , in the more sentimental if not wider field of matrimony , make another debut , which I am certain will be even more happy , if such were possible . May these conjoined careers continueas long one as the other and both be pursued as they havep329started under the benevolent and celebrated aegis of Huguenine 's Great and Only International Circus . " " What 's an aegis ? " asked Joe Duddy . " It 's a bird , I guess , " Bastock said . " I 've heard it before . " " Like a pigeon , maybe ? " " Bigger . . . " " Hist ! " said Mrs. Huguenine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eluded her . " Mr. and Mrs. Hanna have already damped their toes in the sea of matrimony . They are about to wade in , " said Bisbee in a loud voice . " It is a sea some of us are lucky enough to have adventured in ourselves . And those who have not had parents who embarked before them . I wish to propose a toast to matrimony ... " He raised his glass , motioning the others to their feet . " To Matrimony ! The immemorial institution of mankind  --  its foundation is the female form divine  --  its support is love  --  its consummationjoy ! " He drained his glass . " He do n't include the pigeons , " Joe Duddy started to point out . " Shush ! " said Mrs. Huguenine . Mr. Bisbee remained standing over the applause . " To the happy couple , Mr. and Mrs. Chad Hanna ! " Everyone shouted . The kitchen door swung open . " Mr. Ludlow says to please be careful with the glassware . " The door closed . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption , " the bride must cut the cake . " " Oh dear , " said Mrs. Huguenine , rising again like a rubber ball . " I must see Caroline make the cut . It reminds me of my own weddingso . " Caroline 's hand was shaking . Chad whispered to her to bear down . He wished the dinner was over . He had drunk a lot of champagne wine and it was n't what he thought it would be like at all . It made him feel heavy ; he longed for the end of the dinner , when they could escape , get into the light rig , and drive to Fairport . It was eleven miles to Fairport . They would n't reach the tavern till ten o'clock , if they started this minute . It would be terrible to get there and find themselves locked out . Bisbee had suggested their going to Fairport . " You 'll like it better , going away . That 's what you do at a wedding , anyhow . You take the bride away . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home like that . It 's a dandy little tavern , too . Not costly but real comfortable . If you tell Mr. Lusk you know me , he 'll give you a room on the back if you 'd rather not face on the canal . " It was a good idea , Chad thought , if they ever managed to reach the place . Besides , Fullam 's Basin was only a mile farther west on the canal , and at Fullam 's the Penfield road crossed north . They could rejoin the circus there at eleven o'clock on Sunday . Caroline made the first cut , blushing as she said , " I want Mrs. Huguenine to take this , so she and Mr. Huguenine can eat it to-gether . " " Now ai n't that sweet ? " demanded Mrs. Huguenine , reaching for the plate . " I 'm going to take it right up now so I can tell A. D. what Mr. Bisbee said and what you 've just said . I 'll say good-bye , now . " She hugged Caroline with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe from harm . " I got to kiss you both . My , my , my . It 's worth it traveling two hundred miles just to have a thing like this happen . I got to kiss you , too , Chad . " Her cheeks were wet . Caroline took up the knife . " Now , Mrs. Pamplon , " whispered Bisbee . Chad watched her cutting the cake . It made him self-conscious to have to stand beside her . He glanced apprehensively at the skinners , but they were all eyeing the cake , fingers ready on the plate rims . Cakes did n't come often , not cakes with white icing and made with raisins , currants , citron , nutmegs , and lemon brandy . " Got to chew a wedding cake good , " Budlong admonished the company . " Knew a feller choked to death eating one . Wedded by the ministerp331one day , buried the next . Double money for the church . I carried the coffin so I heard the funeral speech . Minister got mixed and called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiero frowned thunderously . " Has everybody been helped ? " Caroline asked , glancing round the table . " I  --  Chad and I  --  want to thank you all . It 's been a wonderfulwedding supper . I hope you 're all as happy as I am . " " Bravo ! " exclaimed Mr. Bisbee . Chad wondered whether this was the time to go . Caroline seemed waiting . She was wearing the same light print dress , but it seemed to him that she looked older in it , more fashionable . Her waist was narrower and her hips and breast fuller . He wondered whether gettingmarried changed a girl 's appearance . Looking at her now , one would hardly suspect that a few hours ago she had been making her first public appearance on a pad . She had ridden well , too ; but now , when she met his eyes , the color flooded her cheeks , and her eyes dropped ; and standing close to her he could hear her shivery intake of breath . She was pretty . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Albany Yates around the show , and he wondered for an instant what it would have been like to have stood where he was now , with Albany . He and Caroline had just seemed to drift to this ; but he was n't sorry . He was excited . Shepley touched his elbow . " I 've got the rig ready , " he whispered . " Your things are in it . Come on . " Shepley 's face was pale . As Chad shook hands with him , he suddenlyknew that Fred also was thinking of Albany . Ike Wayfish gave a shout . " Come on , folks . We can finish the cake and champagne after we 've got rid of these two . " They made a stamping , trouping out of the front door . A stablehand , grinning , held the heads of the odd horse and Ike 's mule , hitched to the light rig . Shepley helped Caroline over the wheel . She said , " Why , Fred ! What 's this ? " " Surprise , " bawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a huge carpet satchel , with a great medallion of flowers onp232one face . The colors showed red and yellow and blue in the light . " It 's from the members of the troupe , " explained Ike . " Wishing you all well . " Chad did n't know what to say , but Caroline called in a choky voice , " I think you 're all sweet people . I love all of you . " She burst into tears . " Get going , you fool , " Shepley muttered to Chad . Chad took the lines . Somebody threw a handful of rice , but the horse and mule were already trotting . He glanced back ; he saw Fiero , in the middle of the road , left leg extended , right arm back . " Duck , " yelled Chad . The shoe whizzed after them , but Chad had been too late . The wheeling toe caught Caroline 's fluttering veil , tore it off her head , and the whole mess hit Alice , the mule , square in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a gallop . " Did it hit you ? " Chad asked . " No . " Caroline shook her head . " I 'll certainly never let that Dago throw a knife at you , " Chad told her grimly . It was half-past ten when they came along the road into Fairport . They had been following the canal bank for several miles , seeing few boats , but moonlight traced the water for them . Then it picked out the low belfry of the church ahead , even before the village came into view . A dog was barking , working up a hatred with the moon . Neither Chad nor Caroline had said a thing for some time past  --  the faint coolness in the air , the stillness of the road , their own wheels , making a mutter in the sand . There was one loose felloe that had a small rattle when it came around . It made them realize how tired they were ; and for a while Caroline had leaned against Chad 's shoulder when he raised his arm suggestively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to stay there , and after a bit he let her go . Now she straightened up on her side of the seat , her eyes ahead , on the belfry , and the upraised ears of the mule . " I guess this is it , " Chad said . " It 's been far enough . " They saw a small cluster of houses along the canal . It was easy enough to find the tavern , which fronted on the towpath , with a small section of second-story porch over the front door . As they rolled up to it , they saw a faint light from one of the windows . " Thank God , " Chad said . " Somebody 's awake . " " You 're lucky people , " Mr. Lusk told them when he opened the door . " I was just going to get to bed . " " Mr. Bisbee said he thought you could give us a room tonight . " " Horse-faced feller ? " asked Mr. Lusk . " He 's been here before . You from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lusk examined them , breathing hard . He had a round face full of pale fat ; he sounded asthmatic . " Yes , " he said , " I 'll give you a room for fifty cents , a fine feather bed . " His eyes creased . " There wo n't be anybody else coming into it either . This place is empty , only me and my colored cook . You 'll have to put up your own horses , mister . But will you sign the book , first ? " He went slowly , carrying his lamp , to a small desk in the hall under the stairs , squeezing himself behind it , opening a thumbmarkedledger , dipping a pen , holding the feather towards Chad , and placing his forefinger , with a long exhalation of breath , on an empty line . Chad wrote , " Mr. and Mrs. Chad Hanna . " " Now , " said Mr. Lusk , " if you 'll fetch in your bag , I 'll take the lady upstairs while you stable the team . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Lusk breathing hoarsely , and he saw Caroline , following , her face lifted towards the light . When he had put up the horse and mule , though , there was light on the towpath from the upper window . He looked up at it and saw Caroline pull the curtains shut . " Turn that key , will you ? " Mr. Lusk asked as Chad came through the front door . " The Missis likes the room all right . You new mar-ried ? " Chad said they were , sheepishly . " Come into the bar and have a drink on the house , " said Mr. Lusk . " ' Tai n't often I get a bridal pair . I always feel like wishing a man luck . It 's the least I can do for him . " He poured two small glasses of whiskey . " Well , here 's to haying weather , " he said . " It 'll make me roar some , but you wo n't hear it ; I sleep downstairs . You can have breakfast at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll hold the light for you going upstairs . Good night . " " Good night . " The hall was dark , but Caroline had left her door open a crack . He pushed it open slowly . She was sitting in a big bed , wearing a nightdress with small frills round throat and wrists . Her eyes looked large . She said , " Is n't it nice ? " in a queer tentative voice . Chad said it was . It was the nicest room he had ever been in , with gold-bordered crockery and a picture of a shaggy bull and cow and calf by a river under a castle wall . A boat horn blew way down . He put his hand over the candle , and in the darkness undressed , standing by the window , with the cool air drawing over his skin . He saw the bow lantern creeping along the endless thread of water . He could hear the slow hoofs of the horses . A driver boy 's voice said tiredly , " God damn you lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . Poor kid , he had an hour on his trick . But Chad could go to bed , with his own wife , in a hotel room . He climbed under the coverlet beside her , feeling her tremble . She was his wife now ; he felt a pride of ownership , of having got somewhere , of beginning . He wondered if she was scared , but she came right into his arms , the rising feathers behind her walling her in against him . " Oh , Chad . " He knew then how she had wanted to be married ; she made him think of the way he first remembered her , sitting on the kitchen table back in Trid 's house , slowly raising her bare leg as if for his inspection . " Bridge , " came the driver boy 's thin cry . The horn answered . " I love you so , Chad . " Her face following his in the darkness.  |p339CHAD  stopped the mule and horse under a shade tree beyond the bridge at Fullam 's Basin . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust . The leaves hung heavy and the canal teams struggling on the towpath were wet to their fetlocks with sweat . Chad looked lazily at Caroline . It had been wonderful , waking up at seven and knowing they did not have to get up till eight . He had waked Caroline so she could enjoy the fact , and she had , and they had made love to each other all over again , lazily , and slowly , the way you supposed the people did on Quality Hill . About halfpasteight they went downstairs to find the colored woman ready to take their breakfast orders . They chose sausage and fried eggs , and fried potatoes , and bacon cut thin and cooked crisp , and cuts from a peach pie . They ate in the small dining room . The windows opened on the towpath , so that passing canal teams blocked off the entire view , even darkening the room , and the drivers looked in on the couple eating at leisure like gentry . It was a wonderful feeling . Afterwards they went upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lusk , sat out on the porch while Caroline packed their new bag . He could hear her humming , light and soft . She sounded happy ; and it made Chad feel satisfied with himself to hear her . She brought out the bag , carrying it open with both hands for him to see their things packed together , explaining to him , " My nightdress is on top of your things , so it wo n't get mussed so badly . Is n't it a beautiful bag , Chad ? " " It 's not too bad , " he agreed , knocking the ash of his segar over the porch rail , and seeing her , all eyes , watching him . So they paid their bill and got out the rig and took their time coming along to Fullam 's . But this was the end of the honeymoon : they would be getting back to work , now ; and Chad said , " I wonder how much pay Huguenine will offer you ? " " Probably not much , " Caroline said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes later and squalled . They got out of the rig and went up on the bridge to see the caravan crawling towards them through the glare of sunlight : the treasury wagon in the lead with Mrs. Huguenine and Mrs. Pamplon on the front seat ; the cage wagon , with Pamplon riding beside Joe Duddy ; Bastock and Ike on the seat wagon , and the great bulk of the tent wagon in the rear . Then they made out Bisbee , trotting his brown horse beside the treasury wagon . He drew way ahead of the procession , riding up the bridge ; and , stopping beside them , he looked down with his long face sober and only a slight glint in his eyes . " How are you ? " he asked . " Fine , " Chad said , grinning . Caroline blushed . " I bet , " said Bisbee . He fished in his poster case and pulled out a slightly rolled sheet . " Here 's the new paper , " he said . " I got to get on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the route . Mrs. Huguenine 's taking A. D. on to Rochester right after the show tomorrow . She wants to give him a bath at the springs . But you 'll camp in Gates . Then the rest of the route is Parma , Spencer 's Basin , Brockport , Clarkson , Murray , Gaines , and Albion . I 'll meet you there . " " Do we show in Gates ? " " No . We 'll show in Parma the sixth . You can kill time in Rochester , and A. D. can get a double dose of bathing . So long , " Bisbee said . " A. D. will talk to you about pay . But one thing : Caroline ought to keep right on practising . " " Oh yes , " Caroline said . " I know that . " Nodding to them , Bisbee kicked his horse in the ribs , and moved off through the village . He was well out along the Penfield road by the time the wagons reached the bridge.  |p341Mrs  . Huguenine hollered greetings as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a month 's time . But the performerswere equally glad to see them , and especially the light rig , for they were tired of the lumbering box wagons . They climbed in beside Caroline with their bags . Before Chad had unhooked the ring horses from the treasury wagon , the rig was rattling ahead along the road . It looked just the same as any other stage they had made ; except that Caroline turned to wave to him . Chad mounted and moved up beside Mrs. Huguenine to ask for A. D. " He 's some better , but he 's so terrible stiff . You let a heavy man like him get knocked around and he feels worse than London Bridge . " Mrs. Huguenine adjusted the cotton stocking she had wound round her neck for a dust cloth . " Mr. Ludlow showed me an advertisement in the paper , though . About them Rochester baths . They only cost fifty cents to get into and Mr. Ludlow said some of these springs , if they 're genuine mineral , can do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You too ? " " Do you think I 'd let A. D. try something I had n't ? " she asked . " They let in females . I got the advertisement right here . " She fished a clipping out of her shelflike bosom . " Listen to what it says :  --  " Ladies and gentlemen can be accommodated with a warm or cool showering . Ladies are respectfully informed that a number of rooms have been fitted up especially for their use . For better accommodation of those who may not be acquainted with bathing , and for those who may need assistance , arrangements have been made to have female attendance in readiness . " There ! Seems to me that ought to do him good . " She shoved the clipping back into her bosom . " Do n't mention it to A. D. He 'd get balky . I ai n't told him yet . " There were quite a few people on hand when the circus rolled into Penfield . Being Sunday , and past noon , people were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot to watch the tent being raised . Some of the younger men were ambitious enough to help lug seats from the wagon ; in that way they could see the inside of the tent before anyone else . Joe Duddy was good at organizing such volunteer efforts . " You boys done fine , " he said . " But you 'll have to clear out now . The lady performers have got to practise . " Dressed for practice , Caroline brought the new poster into the tent . Chad had observed people studying it on the inn porch , but this was the first chance he had had to see it close to . The poster showed Fred Shepley doing his somersault on the right top , but in the left top , galloping towards him , poised on one toe , arms delicately raised , was a female - figure whose one defect was a blot on the left knee . " It 's me , " Caroline said , tense with excitement . CAROLINA , the American equestrienne , the only female principal rider now performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equaling the most difficult feats of equitation now performed by the leading equestrian females of Europe and Asia . Already her talents have earned for her the Universal title of The Sylphide of the Upper Air . Her beauty , grace , and talented mastery of this difficult art , as well as her modest and refined manners , both in and out of the ring , have made her a favorite in all the cities in which she has appeared . Bastock interrupted them . " That do n't mean a thing , " he said . " It 's time you got practising . Ike 's here and Shepley 's coming . The gaffer wants to talk to you , Chaddy . But bring the cream in first . And you better bring in Jerry too . It 's all-fired hot out there . " Mr. Huguenine had heaved himself out onto the steps of the treasury wagon , from which post he had been watching the erection of the tent . His face was blotchy and he breathed hard in spells . But when Chad asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better if Bettina quit fluttering all the time . You got that tent up fast . Seems like good times again to be off the main road and people anxious to see the show . Maybe we 'll do better now . If I had a drink , by jeepers , I 'd drink it . " He ruminated over his wrists.  | " Bettina says you done fine . We raised your pay . But Bisbee says we 'll have to pay your wife . " He paused again . " You got to know we ca n't pay her much . She 's just prentice riding really . " " She ai n't bad , " Chad said . Huguenine pursed his lips . " Bisbee says she 's pretty good . We put her on the poster , that 's something . A lot of young girls would be proud just being on the poster . " Chad sat down on the grass . He said , " Most of the proud people I ever saw made good money . " Huguenine eyed him . " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , petulantly . " You need n't act so chesty . I 'm going to pay her . But you could give me time to work up to it . It 's just as hard to work up to paying out money as it is to work up to get paid . Bisbee says maybe she 's worth five dollars a week . That 's what Bisbee says . " " He 's kind of a funny feller , " Chad said . " First he puts her up with Shepley on the paper , and then he offers her five dollars . What do you say to that , A. D. ? " " I ai n't said . I 'm telling you . Five dollars is a lot of money . Specially when you think how I carried her along , feeding her , free gratis for nothing . And let her use my horses and allowed a man to teach her when I was paying him for other work . " " Well , she 's equal to what Shepley is on the paper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , " Huguenine said testily . " My back hurts . Say , did you marry a girl or did you marry a topriderwith money ideas ? " " The girl suits me . " Chad dug his knife into the grass between his legs . There was a worm there ; he held it up ; and Huguenine looked at it too and said it was a puny kind of worm . " Five dollars is puny , " Chad said . Huguenine groaned . " Bettina only gets five , " he pointed out . " Yes . But she shares the show 's profits . Caroline do n't . You make another offer and maybe we can talk . " " Talk ? You mean you 'd quit ? "  | " Oh , I 'll stay . But Carolina , well it might not be worth while her risking her neck for five dollars . Would you risk yours for five dollars ? " " There 's no call to talk that way . My neck 's just about bent off anyway . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that way . Suppose she broke her neck , I would n't have no family . " " That 's one trouble . You 'll probably fix her so she ca n't ride . That happens to a lot of married people . Women especially , " said Huguenine , driving the point home . " Well , if you 've promised Bisbee to not pay her more , why do n't you pay me two dollars extra ? That makes seven dollars and a quarter a week . " Huguenine swore at him . " A. D. ! " cried Mrs. Huguenine . " The doctor said you was n't to strain yourself . " " He wants seven dollars . God damn it , that hurt , " said Huguenine , straightening his neck . " As soon as I saw your face , Chad , I knew you was going to give me trouble . I ca n't argue . But I 'd rather pay her seven dollars . " " Either way , " Chad said , grinning . " It 's cheap enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Bettina 's taking me to see a doc in Rochester , so you 'll have to bring the treasury wagon . You 'll have to sleep in her . Tell the boys I want to talk to them . Tell them to come right out . I want to lay down . " Fred Shepley was practising vaults with Caroline on the pad . It was something that Bastock had not dared let Ike Wayfish attempt . He was fine with his comedy mounts , but he was used to using the entire pad . It was exciting enough with Fred Shepley working . His face was intent . He had to time the vault exactly to a hair or he would knock her off like an apple in October . She could not wear the pratique as the strap would have got in Shepley 's way . The tent was completely silent , only Bastock in the ring , his eyes anxious . Chad did n't dare interrupt , but standing beside Ikep345and the other two skinners , he saw that Bisbee had the right idea . Shepley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they made much more of a picture than Caroline and the clown . Ike 's crazy doings would be used merely to set off the topriding . Shepley had his heart in the business . He was taking chances himself to make sure of Caroline 's safety , hitting the pad so far back that it looked as if he might miss it altogether . They were so completely absorbed in their work that neither of them had noticed Chad 's entrance . It was only when Bastock called for a rest that they saw him . When the others had gone out of the tent , he sat down on one of the seats , waiting for her to come over to him . " Did Mr. Huguenine speak about my pay , Chad ? " " Yes , " he said . " You 're going to get seven dollars . " " Seven dollars ! " " Yes . " " Are n't you glad ? " " Of course I 'm glad . " " You do n't sound so . " She studied him a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real nice room at this hotel . It 's not as nice as Mr. Lusk 's . I do n't think we 'll ever have one as nice as that . " " You ca n't tell . You and Shepley were certainly doing good . " " He 's wonderful . I feel a lot steadier with him than with Mr. Wayfish . " " That 's fine . " She said , " It 's hard to smile . I feel funny trying to , but Pete said I 'd have to learn . He said male riders do n't have to but female riders have to smile all the time . He said people expect it . " Chad said , " You look fine up there . You both do . You make Fred look better . " He kicked at the grass . " A. D. says I have to run the show until he gets better . We 're taking the treasury wagon into Gates for him . I got to sleep in it . Maybe you 'd rather go to a hotel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon ever since I saw it . It 'll be fun . Just think , it will be like having our own show . And we 'll be making twelve dollars a week , fourteen , I mean . How much is that a month ? " " Fifty-six dollars , " Chad said , after some figuring . " We 're rich , almost . " Chad had n't considered it in monthly pay . It was a lot of money . He began to feel better . He figured it out  --  suppose Huguenine 's managed to keep on the road to the middle of October , that would be three and a half months , nearly a hundred and ninety dollars . They could live a year on that much money ; they could stay in a hotel . They could go back to Canastota and put up in the Yellow Bud , and Mrs. Mott would have to take his orders for a change , and would n't he run Diney ragged ? He saw it all : he and Elias Proops sitting out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd take the corner room next to the old man 's , the one Albany had been in . The recollection stopped him short . " What 's the matter , Chad ? " He turned to Caroline . " I was wondering about Elias Proops , how he was . I thought maybe you and me could spend the winter in the Yellow Bud . Would you like that ? " " What would you do there ? " " Nothing , " Chad said . " Just have a good time . You would n't have to work , either . We could hire a horse and go over to Syracuse once in a while . We could take Elias along . I guess you never saw him . " " He looked something like an old goat , did n't he ? " " That 's him . Regular old goat . Just about as knowing . " It would be fun , all right . He could imagine himself standing off Elias 's comments every morning . " Well , you better get riding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more we 'll make Huguenine pay . " The others had come back to the tent , Bastock saying facetiously , " Can I get back on this practice , gaffer ? " " Go ahead . " Chad made his voice sound important . Then Fiero spoiled it all by coming up to congratulate him sincerely . " Nowp347you are the boss , now maybe I can begin throwing the knives , hey ? I have not killed her for three days , except one hole by the arm . I am good , superb , " he said humbly . " We 'll see , Fiero . Maybe when we get to Rochester we can pick up a boy for you . " " When do we reach this Rochester ? " " Tomorrow . " Fiero turned pale . " So soon . Oh , it is wonderful . I get on the poster . You wait . " " What 's troubling you , Joe ? " Joe coughed into his hand . " Maybe you 'd step outside , Chaddy ? " " Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline . He performed another cough . " It 's something I got to show you , " he said . " All right , " Chad said . " I 'll come along . " He followed Joe out into the sunshine . Joe said , " I wanted to tell A. D. , but he said he could n't be bothered . He said you was running the show for a while and to see you . You just come over here and look at it . " He led the way to the cage wagon , lifted the panel off , and , putting his face close to the bars , beckoned Chad forward to do the same . Chad looked in . The old lion was stretched out on his side , panting in the heat . " I do n't see anything , " he said . " Do n't you see nothing ? Nothing at all ? " " No , " said Chad . " I could n't mention it in there with Caroline . That 's the whole trouble . There ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just that . I ai n't cleaned his cage since yesterday morning . There ai n't anything in it . That old cat ai n't moved his bowels all day . " " You sure ? " Chad looked back in . " Well , smell . "  | They stood cheek to cheek , inhaling . " I guess you 're right , " Chad admitted . " But I do n't see it means much . " " Do n't you ? I guess you never been troubled that way . But if you was , just imagine how a cat his size feels . I been nursing that old animal , " Joe said . " I been swamping out his place . I know him . Maybe he ai n't so active , but he never missed doing his business . 1 guess it was the most fun he had . No sir . " Joe wiped his forehead . " That-there 's a sick animal . " " What 's the matter with him ? " " I do n't know . He do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he 's just old . He was old when I see him first , and he ai n't got younger . Maybe a doctor could tell us . " " I do n't know what a doctor would know about a lion , " Chad said . " Probably all he needs is a physic . " " Yeah ? What kind of physic you going to give him ? He ai n't nohorse , Chaddy . You do n't even know how many stomachs he 's got . " " Maybe Budlong can think of something for you to give him . " " I ai n't putting no physic into that animal , " Joe said . Chad studied Joe for a minute ; but it was obvious that Joe had passed a law . " Well , " he said , " he may come round by tomorrow . We 'll wait and see . There 's no sense worrying till then . " Chad had n't discussed Oscar 's puzzling condition with anyone but Caroline . As soon as he came to their room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying over something . It was easy enough to tell Joe Duddy there was no sense in worrying ; he could n't help it himself . Any time an animal went wrong a man had a right to get upset ; animals ' insides were something one tookp349for granted . With a lion in a cage , however , nothing anyone knew about dosing seemed to have a reliable foundation . The problem spoiled his whole built-up notion of how it would be coming into a bedroom at the end of the day to find Caroline waiting for him . He was more like an old married man whose best cow has developed a milk fever . He hardly looked at Caroline , who was waiting up beside the airless window in her new nightgown . He said , " Hello there , " and sat down on the bed and started taking off his shoes . She watched him for a minute without speaking . Last night he had told her the nightdress was pretty ; he had said she was pretty . The nightdress had ruffles round the throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feel dainty ; it made going to bed with Chad an exciting thing , feeling nice like that , knowing she was nice , because she felt nice . She had spent some time extra combing her hair , so that it curled from the center part , softly , over her forehead . She had fixed up the room a little , cleaning the old soap from the soap dish and the fingermarks from the washbowl , and moving the chair to the window , so that he could see her sitting there the minute he opened the door . But he had hardly looked at her . " Chad , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Yes , there is . " " What makes you think there is ? " She flushed . She could n't tell him why . She could n't say , " Last night you liked me so , you practically ate me up , like a lion eating a human , but I like being eaten . I was fun , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , instead , " You look all tired out . You 're frowning . " " Ca n't a man feel tired ? " " Of course he can . So can a girl . " She came over to the bed , sitting beside him , so he could feel her with his shoulder . With an appreciation of her own artfulness , she made the touch light , and his reflex , putting his arm round her , was automatic . " Something 's worrying you . I can tell it . Why do n't you tell me ? Maybe it 's not so bad , if you tell me. "  |  " It 's Oscar , " he said , and he told her what Joe Duddy had told him . He had been to look the last thing . She gave a low laugh . It was a relief to know Chad was n't just used to her in one day . " Men are funny , " she said . " As soon as anything goes wrong with their insides they get scared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be all right in a day or two . You 'll see . " Chad had to grin at her grown-up tone . She was trying to look grown-up too , she was fetchingly womanly , sitting upright inside his arm , long and slender with the nightgown shaping her . " Poor old Oscar , " he said . " I wonder if he ever got married before he was taken ? " Caroline had a smile , the inward-knowing feminine kind of smile , that made a man wonder whether he ever got inside of her at all . She let her head tilt a little , so he could kiss her mouth if he felt like it . " I wonder , " she said . " I wonder how a lioness would feel . " She knew she could handle Chad , a while anyway . She wondered how long it would last . He was a roamer by nature . It still seemed incredible that he had found her roost at all . A foot-loose man , she thought he was ; and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , kept guessing all his life . It was all right now , anyway . The first firecracker for the Fourth woke them in the pre-dawn . They lay in the bed , whose old cords rolled them back downhill into a mutual valley whenever they tried to move at all , and listened to the tentative bangs , let off by small boys at the risk of parental wrath , spreading like a mild disease across the village . There was no point in trying to sleep after that . Daylight brought courage to small boys . They got up in time to see the tavernkeeper raising the American flag on the liberty pole , with a soiled British pennant underneath it , and a ragged squad of militia loosed a stuttering rifle salute practically in their faces . After that the Fourth of July took form with the increasing heat . The militia trouped into the bar to reward themselves for theirp351patriotic early rising . Firecrackers gained force and frequency . The local company appeared before the tavern and rested their rifles against the porch rail waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the lot . He looked at Oscar , who had been roused by the noise and was nervously shifting round the cage wagon . Joe Duddy said nothing had happened . " But maybe he 'll get something scared out of him anyway . You going to tell A. D. ? " Chad shook his head . He did n't want to worry Huguenine , who was worried enough about his own condition ; and he doubted whether Huguenine would have any worth-while ideas about a lion anyhow . Caroline and Shepley practised riding for two hours , and afterwardsthey worked Jerry with the cream . The grey was getting a good gait ; he went steady even when some boys loosed some crackers outside the tent . Then , having stabled the horses , the circus troupe returned to the tavern to watch the drill and listen to the oration . The oration was properly hoarse , loudly patriotic , and mostly concerned with saying what a low article the British nation was . The pauses were frequent and timed for applause that allowed the orator to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . He wound up at a sort of hand gallop after three quartersof an hour , evoking considerable admiration with his finishing powers , and then reviewed the militia , who presented arms , shouldered them , did the manual , formed squads , and marched away down the main street behind drums and fifes . They looked spirited as they went off , they returned dogged , dusty , and dry ; and the whole adult community adjourned to their porches , leavingthe streets to the younger generation , who started loosing the more expensive crackers . Every now and then during the meal hour the shout of " Runaway " brought the porch-sitters to the sidewalks to cheer or screech advice to a farmer sawing the mouths of a wall-eyed team as they pelted down the street , the womenfolk clutching the smaller children on the bucketing seat , the wheels spinning a glory of dust . The village was in fine humor for the circus . They liked everything . For once Pamplon doing his manual on the wire received so much applause as almost to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caroline was followed round the ring with an almost tender anxiety . Chad thought she and Shepley would practically bolt an audience like this one to their seats once they had perfected their double act . Shepley 's ride was perfect . This audience might have read about Burke and Walsh 's mammoth arena , but never having seen such a thing they thought Huguenine 's round-top was immense . Ike Wayfish , of course , was the life of the whole show . Penfieldloved him . He was what every man felt like but did n't dare act like , and the womenfolk could laugh because Ike was no relationand it was all make-believe and nonsensical . His surreptitious attempt to bandage the lash of Chad 's whip was greeted by roars of laughter ; his rendering of the ballad , " Sally of the Green , " moistened eyes visibly ; he had a good voice and he had done some mellowing of his own . " My girl wants to marry a banker , instead of me , " he confided to Chad sadly at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold . " Yes , sir . Do you know why ? " " No ; why ? " " Because when she deposits a kiss , she expects to get some interest . " Ike clambered out of reach of the lash . " And do you know what she says , Mr. Equestrian Director ? " " No , I do n't know what the person you call a girl ' says . " " She says  --  " " Well , " impatiently , " what does she say ? " " Would n't you like to know ? " The old saws went wonderfully . Ike 's final emergence in hisstars and stripes brought down the tent , and as he climbed in withOscar , Chad could hear the indrawn breaths . He watched closely . Now that the firecrackers had died down , Oscar was logier than usual . He would n't even lift his head . He just lay there , panting and slitting his eyes at the audience , and Ike even lifted his head aside . But Penfield thought it was wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . A man lying down with a lion was one sight nobody had ever seen . But after the all-out-and-over Ike came over to Chad . " What 's the matter with that cat , Chad ? " " I do n't know , " Chad said . " He 's got indigestion , I guess . " Joe came horning in . " Chaddy , could n't I let that critter out of his cage ? " " No . " " My Cripus ! He would n't hurt nothing . " " Suppose he run off and fell in the creek ? " " He would n't . He hates water . Just think , that cat 's probably never had sand between his toes since he was captured alive in Africa . Maybe if he ate some grass , it would help . I 've seen genuine cats eat grass . " " Try it . Put some in . " " A cat ca n't eat mowed grass , " Joe said scornfully . " That 's why I said let him out  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got different grass in Africa , " Chad said . " This might just make him sicker . " " I had n't thought of that , " Joe admitted . " Maybe some spring lamb would digest easier with him . Or maybe some venison . It 's a wild meat . It might activate something in him . " " No , " Chad decided . " Lamb costs too much . We got to tear down now , so we can get to Gates before dark . " " Why do n't you tell Huguenine ? " Ike said , and there was a murmur of agreement from the company , who had realized that something was wrong with Oscar . " Him and Mrs. Huguenine have left for Rochester in the light rig , " Chad pointed out . At the name of the city , Joe pricked his ears . " Rochester is a good place . You can flush pigeons up and down both sides of the river for nearly half a mile . " He eagerly closed the sides of the cage wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could take that cat along with me tonight , maybe that would make him feel better . " It was a wonderful notion . All during the tear-down he and Budlong and Bastock worked on it . Taking Oscar into some of those Water Street Houses would make a sensation , probably . Even a cross-eyed man without a nose could get action taking Oscar with him . Chad made a count of the day 's take . They had pulled in 157 full tickets . Sitting in the treasury wagon , Caroline helped him with the count . Then they locked the cash in the chest and shoved the chest under the bunk . Everyone else was ready waiting . Chad said , " I 'll drive between Bastock and Joe . Rochester is a pretty tough town . " Sitting on the seat of the treasury wagon , with Bastock ahead of him and the sound of the other wagons rolling the dirt behind , he was conscious of his responsibility . " How does it feel , Mr. Gaffer ? " Caroline 's face was pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " I just found it , " she said . " If you lean back I can kiss you . " He did , after making a survey of the road , and she kissed the edge of his ear . " I wonder if Mrs. Huguenine ever did that to Mr. Huguenine , " she said . Chad nodded . He wished Oscar would manage something , even only a little . It was a stony road . That might help some . Chad looked through the bars of the cage wagon at Oscar . The dingy old lion was lying on his belly as if he still felt in it the jolting of the eleven-mile haul from Penfield.  | " You think it would do any good to make him stand up ? " he asked Joe . " No . He wo n't get on his feet till he 's sure he 's quit moving . If you lit a fire under his tail , he 'd just lay there and let the smoke come out his mouth . " " I wish it could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have picked up something that 's got lodged in him ? " " Pick up something ? " Joe asked . " I mean a stone or a rag or something . " " Listen , " Joe said indignantly . " I swamp that cage just as carefulas they do the bar in the Astor Hotel . You could n't find a better-swamped lion cage in seven counties than this one is . If you ai n't got anything better to think about I 'll just pull my foot for town . " Chad looked round . Up a slight slope he saw the backside of the post office at Gates , an apple tree , a privy , and a small hog pen . It was n't much of a place to stop in , but the postmaster , an inquisitiveman who said his name was Sturgis , had told them they could use it for nothing if they would let him and his kids look at the lion . They were all staring at Oscar now . " Boys , " the postmaster was telling them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have seen him , either , if I 'd took you to Rochester . " He looked pleased with himself . His oldest son , a replica in small size , swayed his jaw like his father , and said , " Could I bring the Tomlin boys to see it , mister ? " " Go ahead , " said Chad . " Only do n't pester him . " As the boy scuttled off , his father said , " I was n't going to wear out horseshoes going to Rochester . No , sir . Nor pay out eightysevencents seeing a God-damned circus . My Pa did n't allow me no nonsense , and I do n't figure I 'll allow my boys any . You feed him pork ? " " No , " said Chad . " That 's too bad . I got a half pig hanging up side of the house . "  | Chad left him . Bastock was coming back from putting up the stock . The tavern stable , he said , did n't look like much more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weather did n't look too threatening . Chad told him , " I guess I ought to let Huguenine know about that lion . Maybe I 'll go back to Rochester tonight . " " Might be a good idea , Chaddy . " " Will you stay here ? Joe 's going off . I would n't want to leave Caroline alone with the treasury wagon . " " Sure , me and Budlong will stay , and I 'll keep sober . " Chad went to tell Caroline . When he had broached the idea , she had agreed that it would be better for her to stay with the treasury wagon , taking his place , since he was responsible . " I 'll be back before midnight , " he said . He felt a little mean , for she had picked up some cold meat and a jar of pickles and planned a picnic supper for them . " Bastock will look out for you , " he said . As he walked out to the road he heard a familiar tunk . Fiero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent wagon and was employing the last minutes of daylight in industrious practice . Caroline 's silhouette was completely hedged with knives , except for the finishing one above the head . Fiero caught sight of Chad and brandished his last blade in greeting . " All perfectoes , " he shouted happily . " Now you go to the big city to find me a little boy , or a little girl , hey , Mr. Chad ? " He wheeled back magnificently for the throw . He let the knife fly . It glittered in the air , and the point found home square in the forehead . For an instant Fiero stood transfixed . Then his chest heaved and he spun round and pointed an accusing finger . " The sun ! " he shouted . " See how it gets low too . " At the sound of his voice , Joe Duddy , who was already out along the road , turned , and seeing Chad waited for him to catch up . He said companionably , " That crazy Dago will kill somebody yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad said . " I 've got to see Huguenine about Oscar . "  |p357Joe  nodded . They started walking the three miles back to the city . They had pulled through it about half-past six , crossing the river on the Buffalo Street bridge . Then , the sight of the trim streets and all the crowded houses had depressed them . It did n't seem possible for even as big a show as Burke and Walsh to exhaustthe patronage of a place that size . But it would have invited complete disaster to have pitched in open competition with them now . Grunting a little as he walked , Joe kept up a snappy pace . He was anxious to hit town before all the pigeons had found roosts . " I wish we could get a ride in , " he said . He had put on a coat and had a cravat round his neck . His face was earnest and his thick legs plugged away at the road purposefully . Seeing him , no one would have thought that he could raise the devil . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , if somebody picked us up , Chaddy , we could make town before eight , maybe . " Chaddy grunted . " Yes , sir , " Joe said after another hundred yards . " I think I 'll just go to Burke 's lot . The pigeons ought to be plentiful there . And if I found a purty , I might take her in to see the last half of the show . " " They showing at night ? " Chad asked . " Sure . I seen it in the posters in Palmyra . For those unable to attend our exhibition here , ' it said . It 's too bad you 're a married man , " Joe said virtuously , " or we could find two purties and have a real party . I bet you and me could straighten out the street corners if we got started right . Well , Caroline sure is a nice girl , Chaddy . But you take a pigeon and you can make progress before you get started . " " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Joe had planted the seed of an idea . He could take in the rest of Burke 's show and still get to see Huguenine before half-past nine . And there would be an opportunity to watch Albany  --  if she was riding in the last half . Caroline would n't have to know about it . He had the idea she would be upset . " I 'd kind of like to see how Albany 's doing too , " Joe chatted on . " They 've got her placed in the last half . I read that paper right through . Wait a minute . I hear a wagon coming . " He suddenly went lame . " Hurt yourself ? " Chad asked . " It 's the sciatica , " Joe said , seriously . " I had it ever since I got shot in the knee at Plattsburg . If you 'd kind of let me lean on you , maybe I could get along better . " When the wagon overtook them , Joe was in a bad way . The driver pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe hissed . " just keep on going . If you ask for a ride , nine out of ten wo n't take you on . " The man said , " You two going my way ? " Joe looked up innocent as a spring lamb . " We 're going to Rochester , mister . " " Well , so am I. Climb on . You 've got a bad leg ? " asked the man , when he had his team going again . Joe turned bashful . " Kind of , " he admitted . " It 's a ball wound I got to Plattsburg . Seems like , when I hear the guns going off again on the Fourth , she always acts up on me . " " Oh , you 're a veteran . I 'm proud to lift a veteran . " It was a quick and pleasant ride . " Where 'll I drop you ? " Joe , who had been listening for the music , said , " This is fine . I can get to my sister-in-law 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own doctor . Thank you , mister . . . . " Chad was wondering how he would get away from Joe , but he need n't have worried . As soon as the man who had given them the lift had driven out of sight , Joe 's bad leg limbered and he started full steam ahead for the circus lot . " We can walk along till we get to the Rensselaer House , " he said . " You 'll want to turn off there to find A. D. " He took it for granted that Chad was not coming to the circus . " I 'm just as glad you ai n't going.  |p359A  married man among pigeons is worse than cinders in your pants at a camp meeting . " He waved as they came near the hotel . " So long , Chaddy . " Chad let him get well ahead before he went on towards the lot . It was out of sight behind the baths , or what Chad took to be the baths , a building back of the hotel . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center pole appeared to wrap the stars . The canvas glowed with the light inside , like a palace , and the music from the big band issued stirringly and strong , with a clear sweet note of the French horn over it all . The lot was nearly empty ; three or four women and a few small boys hovered near the entrance . Joe Duddy had obviously made his choice . He was stamping into the tent with his hand buoying the elbow of a female in carnation-colored silk . Chad had to grin . Joe had often said he liked them curvy , and this one certainlyfilled the bill . The three or four women fluttered towards the entrance as Chad approached , but he shook his head , grinning at them , watching their faces fall . A constable stepped up to him . " You meeting anyone , mister ? " Chad shook his head . " All right , you , " growled the constable . " Get back where you belong . " The ticket seller looked at Chad . " You 're coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got . " " Reckon you 'll have to stand . " Chad did n't care . He did n't want to sit where he could be seen . " I 've got a reserved seat , though . " Chad shook his head again . The ticket seller took back the ticket and waved him on . He went inside , feeling the music enwrap him . It was like going into a fairy meetinghouse . The audience up on the highest tiers looked larger than life . There was only a narrow alleyway ahead glowing smokily from rings of tallow candles . There were hundreds of them , they seemed like thousands , and as he looked at them ,  | the candle flames seemed to Chad to fuse and become one solid breath-taking illumination . The roll of the drums over his head deafened him . It brought a dead silence . Out of it , the voice of the equestrian director announced the scenic rider . " Ladies and Gentlemen . . . It is our honor to present .. . for your attention . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . appearing successively as Don Quixote , the crazy . . . Robert Macare , the pickpocket . . . the Monk of Mexico . . . and Andrew Jackson , in full uniform , bearing the American Flag . . . Old Hickory Never Surrenders . . . Lad-ies and Gentle-men ... your attention . . . . " Craning his neck , Chad saw an aisle halfway round the tent where only one or two people stood , and stepping under the seats he made his way to it . He reached it just in time to see the scene rider galloping round the hippodrome . In this enormous tent there was a wide space outside the ring , and the horse had plenty of freedom . It was a good horse , a bright bay , and the scene rider rode him standing in the saddle . But after the first change of costume , Chad let his eyes roam . He picked out Joe Duddy on the opposite side : Joe 's pigeon had , a plump face with a crimson small pursed mouth that opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plain that Joe was wasting no time at all . In the midst of their palaver , the band broke into " Yankee Doodle . " The Monk of Mexico was shedding his robe ; epaulettes flashed on his shoulders . From the breast of his tunic he drew a peaked hat , donned it , and from his sleeve an American flag which he waved with stirring , patriotic yells . Chad wondered if General Jackson yelled that way at New Orleans . But it did not matter . Roll upon roll of applause deadened the fifes and drums . In spite of himself Chad felt a thrill at Mr. Ainsworth 's stern eye , set face , and gallant bearing . Still fluttering the flag , he galloped off , through the draped red hangings of the performers ' entrance , and the equestrian director was soliciting their attention for the unique , graceful , talented riding of Lady Lillian , **28;6145;TOOLONG , the toast of Europe , the wonder of Asia , the delight of the United States ... . The band struck up a dance tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders entered , horses prancing , once round the hippodrome , and then , taking stations inside the ring , faced out towards the audience . They all looked handsome in their costumesand tights , and at a pause in the tune they suddenly in unison drew fans from their saddles , opened them , and began to fan themselves like ladies sitting out a dance . Then the curtains parted , and Albany appeared on Buck . Chad 's critical eyes went over them . Buck was in good shape . He looked beautiful with his white saddle and bridle , and he made the entrance waltzing . But Albany was a vision in white . Her whole costume was white . Even the high hat with its ostrich plumes . She wore white gloves , and the toes of her boots showed white when the white habit swung off them with Buck 's changing step . The only color was in her face and in her black hair . Black hair , black horse ; the rest was white . He had to admit it was beautiful . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came round to his side , the smile bright on her lips , and he studied her close . Her face , he thought , had changed . There were lines at the corners of her eyes . The wide mouth showed the smile , but it was n't excited . And Chad saw suddenly what it was . The lovely music , the big tent , the costumes of the other pretty girls . It was an act , all right , but it was n't Lady Lillian , the titled English equestrienne , who struck wonder to village audiences with her mastery of a horse . Here only a few of the better-dressed were moved to applaud ; the rest of the audience sat still , stoically accepting what seemed to them a pretty interlude that was interrupting their real fun . Albany was n't the top class after all . He realized suddenly that Caroline would have gone better , beginning though she was . A girl pad-riding , a long-legged girl in tights who might fall , was exciting . Here there were too many girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her speech , her voice sounded small , and the rhyme , ending with General Jackson , was an anticlimax . It ought to come before Ainsworth 's ride . He felt suddenly angry and hurt : angry at Burke for not knowing better , for not seeing that he was bleeding her act ; and hurt becausethe crowd did not see how good she was , how exciting and beautiful it was for a girl to control a horse like that . He remembered the maneuvers she had performed with the horse in the maple grove that Sunday morning . She brought back for him the same feeling of something more in it than merely horsebackriding . She was making her circle of the ring for her applause . Though he knew that she had seen him , he could n't clap his hands . They felt too empty . He just stood there and let her ride off . A minute later the buffo came on astride a little donkey , doing the Tailor Rides to Brentford . . . " Your old friend , Cabbage MacPickle , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indubitably indebted to the Bard of Avon . . . " And the audience howled with delight to have finished off the lady rider . Chad lost heart for the show . Let them laugh . He went back to the canvas , lifted the flap , and crawled under . He wished he had not come . Chad walked moodily to the hotel . He felt mean . But he could not have helped himself for a month of Sundays . After all , AlbanyYates had left Huguenine 's without warning . There was no sense saying Burke had bribed her . It was her own choice . It was what she had wanted to do all along . He walked up onto the porch , found the office , and inquired whether Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Huguenine were staying there . Thep363clerk glanced at him and finished some unimportant business and then made a show of consulting his book . Yes , there was a Mr. and Mrs. Huguenine . Did Chad want to see them ? Chad felt like knocking his head off his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes he was taken up a carpeted stairway of dark wood . It was quite an establishment ; he had never been inside a buildinglike it ; and he could not imagine people like the Huguenines staying there . It must cost plenty of cash merely to sleep there , let alone taking baths . The clerk tapped on a door down a long corridor and Mr. Huguenine hoarsely bade them enter . " A young man says he wants to see you . " The clerk spoke through the door without bothering to look inside . " He says his name is Hanna . Do you want to see him ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Huguenine . " Come in , Chaddy . " He was lying on a big bed in a flannel nightshirt , with three or four extra blankets . Just lying there he was sweating . He waited till the clerk had closed the door before he started swearing . From the sound of his voice , Chad judged that Huguenine had been keeping right at it , too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bettina 's gone off into the city . She figures she 's got a relative , a half-cousin or something , living here . There 's a whiskey bottle under the mattress under my feet . Get it out , will you ? There 's a couple of mugs on the wash basin and they say the water in the pitcher is all right to drink if you want water . " " How are you feeling ? " Chad asked . " You look kind of hot . " " Got to do it , " Mr. Huguenine said . " It 's part of the baths . I got to go out there every morning and every afternoon and let them pour water onto me out of some kind of nozzle or something . It sprays like a cow 's tit you take too low down . God damn it , and then they bring you back here and they make you sweat it all out again . I tell you , Chad , it 's a tough business . First time I walked in there a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes off . I thought he wanted to look at my back , but he said drawers too . Yes sir , drawers and shoes come right off . Even my hat . Honest to Christmas . God damn it , they put the water right onto your head . You stand there and you hold your breath so you wo n't get drowned , and they just lean on it and douse you . Think they 'd ease up ? No sir . And the steam comes off your feet . And then when you begin to feel like a boiled oyster with your shell off , they give it to you cold . And then they walk you out naked and running water onto a table and wrap you up in the God-damnedest big towel . I was pretty scared . The first time they put the water cold , I just about wetted . But I figure they could n't see . Now , " he said , his voice sounding hardier as he downed his drink of whiskey , " I 'm getting used to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water hits me . I guess I 've got it pretty well beat now . " " That 's fine , " Chad said . " How 's Mrs. Huguenine ? " " She 's only had one bath . I heard her holler in the female quarterswhen they hit her . But it stands to reason when you wet a woman like Bettina she feels it a lot . She 's been cantering round the city and spending money and having a fine time . She even went to Burke 's show . She did n't see Mr. Walsh , but you know what she did see ? " " No , " said Chad . " Albany . Says she looked pretty , too . They got her rigged out all in white . But she thinks Albany ai n't doing so well , notwithstanding . It 's too bad . She was fine for us . " " She 's probably making money , " Chad said . " I guess so . " Mr. Huguenine quickly changed the subject . " You got to Gates all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's minding the pay wagon ? " " Caroline . Bastock and Budlong are with her . I wanted to see you . " " What for ? "  | " It 's about that cat . He ai n't well . I do n't know what to do with him . " Mr. Huguenine 's face sobered as Chad told him the details . He demanded a second drink . " Put the bottle back under the mattress , " he said , absently . " No telling when she 'll get back ; and I ai n't supposed to drink liquor . Just that God-damned water . Inside and outside . Rinse the mugs out , and if she smells whiskey say you been drinking . Does he act bad ? " " He do n't do anything but just lay down , " Chad said . " Do n't bloat up when he eats ? " " No , but he do n't eat much . Joe wants to try him on lamb . " " That wo n't do any good . If he ai n't bloaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . I 'd put a teaspoon of turpentine down him . Turpentine sure does bore the gas loose from man or beast . Perhaps he 'll be all right when you get back . " " I do n't think so . He looked bad when I came over . The road must have shook him up , too . It was rough . " They confronted each other from chair and bed with the same bafflement on their faces . " Oh Lord , " Huguenine said finally . " If it ai n't one thing , it 's another . If I could get him in here , maybe we could fix him . I had a drink of that water and I felt it flowing the minute I swallowed . Say , Chaddy . I 'll buy a bottle of that water for him and you give it tomorrow if you see he ai n't better . " Chad was dubious . " You think it 's all right ? " " Why not ? I took it , did n't I ? It 's natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Oscar , did n't he ? Seems to me if he ai n't fixed to cure him , we ai n't . You pull that wire in the corner and they 'll fetch us a bottle . " Mr. Huguenine 's face brightened . " Ai n't it wonderful what they do in a hotel ? That invention rings a bell somewheres and after a while a feller shows right up . But you pay for it , too . " Chad pulled the wire . " Do n't hear a thing , do you ? " asked Huguenine.  | " No . " " That 's it . Now you just come and set down and it will hap-pen . " Chad did so , and sure enough , in about three minutes the door opened . But it was Mrs. Huguenine , all breathy from coming upstairs . " Why , Chad Hanna ! Ai n't this a pleasant surprise ? " She sniffed . " A. D. ! " she said sharply . " Yes , Bettina . " " You been sneaking likker again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Chad . " Mr. Huguenine said you were hunting relatives . " Huguenine cast him a grateful glance . " Oh yes . I saw my name , Billings , over a little store when we were coming into town . So I went down there tonight and found it . It was a little place where they make clothespins . You know what I found ? " She giggled . " Ca n't guess ? Colored folks ! I walked right in and said my maiden name was Billings and I 'd come looking for my cousins , and this female colored woman came out and said I was welcome ! " Mrs. Huguenine giggled all over . " She was nice as can be , too . She said Mr. Billings worked here . I visited there quite a while . She showed me her baby . And you know what ? The little thing was just as black as she was . Only two weeks old and coal black . My , I wish I 'd had a baby ! " Someone knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . It was a waiter , colored . Huguenine looked at Chad . " I been telling Chad about that wire , " he told his wife . She said , " My stars . You been pulling that again ? They complainedat the office to me about you pulling it just to see these fellers show up . " Huguenine breathed heavily . " I want a bottle of that spring water , " he said to the waiter . " Yessuh . " In her relief Mrs. Huguenine felt chatty . " Your name Billings ? "  | " Yes ma'am ! " The darkey showed his teeth . " Mine is too , and I saw the name on your wife 's store and went to visit with her . I saw your baby . My , she 's pretty ! I just loved her . Do n't you ? " " Yes 'm . Which one was it , ma'am ? " Mrs. Huguenine looked baffled . " Mrs. Billings said she was two weeks old . " " Oh , that one . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I guess she 's nice , all right . " He beamed duskily at Mrs. Huguenine . " They comes so often I don ' get cotched up with them till they 's one or two years old . " " Say , " Huguenine exclaimed . " You ought to know something about lions . " " Lions , suh ? " The darkey stared at Huguenine and scratched his head . " Well , you come from the same country , do n't you ? You ought to know . Mine 's constipated . " " I done come from Virginny , suh . Ai n't no lions there . " " Well , I thought maybe you 'd have some kind of instinct or something . " " The onliest instinct I got about lions is to stay away from them , suh . " Huguenine lay back on the pillows . " Well , we 'll try some of that water on him . You fetch it . " Billings rolled his eyes as he departed . " Seems funny one African do n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't , that 's sure . I guess we 've just got to kind of feel our way . You take it back , Chaddy , and you give him half a bottle before his meat tomorrow . If he 's all right you can maybe give it to someone else . It costs money . " It was pitch dark when Chad started out of town . Burke 's show was over long before , and he got no lift . he had an hour of walking before the smell of pigs identified the Gates post office . He saw the candle shine from the treasury wagon faintly . Caroline had tacked some muslin over the window to keep the mosquitoes out . When he went in , she was lying on the bunk , fast asleep , the blanket half thrown off . He put the bottle on a small shelf , watching her as he undressed . She turned in her sleep , as if to meet him , and said his name . It made him feel guilty , thinking of Albany Yates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his going to see Burke 's show . He pinched out the candle and she said his name again as he let himself down gently on the bunk beside her . It was astonishing to Chad how Huguenine 's troupe revised their opinion once they understood that the old lion really was sick . Though Joe Duddy , in spite of his complaints , had always felt a kind of sentimental attachment and interest in his doings , nobody else had had much use for him . It was natural enough for the skinners and Huguenines to show interest ; but Caroline reportedthat Oscar was practically all the performers discussed in the light rig between towns . When the cage wagon rolled into Parma on the afternoon of the fifth , it looked like a reception committee waiting for him in the lot to see if he had accomplishedanything . Ike Wayfish had volunteered to administer the spring water that morning in Gates . But it had proved no trick at all . Oscar had been lying on his side at the time . They had worked nooses round his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneouslyand feeling like a bunch of fools when Oscar made no fuss at all . Ike had gone in and stroked him , holding the bottle behind his back with his free hand so as not to make him wise before they hauled his head into position . Ike looked a little like a doctor called out on an early morning case the day after elec-P369tion . He slid the neck of the bottle between Oscar 's slack jaws and the old lion took a swallow . He just about had to if he did n't want to strangle ; and he opened his eyes and looked at Wayfish like Julius Caesar in the play . When Mrs. Pamplon admired MonsieurWayfish 's bravery out loud , Ike said shortly : " He done the swallowing , " and walked away from her . Later he confessed to Huguenine that he had done some mean things in his life , but he had never felt sorry about one till he saw Oscar 's eyes . " He trusted me . He must have thought we was friends . " Joe Duddy drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At noontime , he drew the wagon into the shade for an hour to let him rest , and the other wagons stayed by for company . They took off one flap to give the cat some breeze , and he lay there , with the side of his head against one paw , sniffing it . Huguenine said , " I wonder how long it takes to work through something like him . " Nobody knew . That evening in Parma , he was just the same . They put up the round-top and held a practice in the ring , as usual ; but during rests , instead of just standing round , they would go over to the cage wagon and visit with the lion . That was another thing . They had stopped thinking of him as the cat . He was Oscar  --  almost the way , for instance , that Fiero was Fiero . Looking at him , the Italian said sadly , " What a pity . I have just this minute thought . If a lion could be trained to stand for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiero said it was his worrying about Oscar that had turned his eye . The queer part was that Joe thought Oscar appreciated the concern they felt for him . He would lie there watching Caroline and Shepley double on the pad , his eyes unwinking while they rode , only closing them again when another halt was called . " You see , he feels anxious like . The way you might , Chaddy , being married to her and all . " Caroline had made a big step forward in the few short sessions she had worked with Fred Shepley . " I feel a lot more confident . It 's easier to learn what to do with my feet when I 'm on the pad with Fred . I was always scared to lean in enough with the horse , before . " Fred said , " You 've got an instinct for it . " He was walking back to the tavern with her and Chad . " Do you think I 'll ever be really good ? " " You 're good now , " Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding you 'll be known all over this country some day . " His evident admiration for her seemed to fluster Caroline . She turned red , trying now to turn it off . " Let 's go and have supper together . Will you come , Fred ? " " I 'd love to . " Chad , who had been wondering if there was n't anything that could be done about Oscar , realized that Fred was looking towards him . " Yes , " he said , " come along . " When they were alone together in their room , Caroline told him that he had n't sounded friendly at all . She spoke stiffly . " It 's only decent to ask Fred sometimes , " she said . " Now he and I are working together . " " Well , " Chad said , " I do n't care if he does come . " " Do n't you want me to ride well ? Would n't you like it if I got to be the best female rider in the country ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . " " You do n't think I will , though , do you ? Well , Fred does . He said I could . " " When did he tell you that ? " " Tonight , " she said . " You 'd have heard him , too , only you were so busy thinking about that old lion . " Chad said , " If Oscar dies we wo n't stand a chance to draw in Albion . That 's where we meet up with the Menagerie . We 've got to draw there . " " We did all right in Penfield . And it looks as if we were going to do all right here . " " We 've got to draw every day this week , or the show will break down . We 've got to get a crowd in Albion . That 's a bigP371town . Huguenine 's counting on money there . " He turned on her . She was standing in her underclothes , her dress limp in one hand . " I do n't doubt you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Fred said . But the show do n't hang on one act . Not on yours , either . We could get along without you . But we 've got to have that lion act . " " I believe you do n't care . " Her voice was muffled by the dress . She had got caught up in it somewhere . In trying to get it up again she hiked up her petticoat with it . She was helpless inside the bundle of clothing with her long legs in their snug drawers entirely exposed . " I believe you think more of that lion than you do of me . I hate him . " She sounded near tears . Chad started to laugh . " I hate you , too , " she said . He took hold of her , bundling her , petticoat , dress , and all . " Let go of me , " she cried . But he would n't . It struck him as a delightful novelty . He picked her up off her feet . " Chad ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad . " " I bet you think more about Fred than you do about me , " he said , imitating her voice . " But Fred ca n't do you any good now . " He could hardly hear her voice . " If I could get my head out I 'd bite you . " " All right . " He set her feet on the floor and with one sweep of his hands drew dress and petticoat over her head . He dropped them on the floor . " Now bite , " he said . Her face changed . She started to smile . Then she moved up close , saying , " I ca n't reach you like that . Bend down . I dare you to . " He did so , grinning . And she suddenly clamped her teeth on the lobe of his ear . It made him jump . " You bitch ! I bet you drawed blood , " he said , feeling of it . She nodded . " I tried to . " With a quick stoop she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head .   " By God , you 're vicious . I ought to take it out on your hide . " " I feel vicious , " she said , pursing her lips . " Real vicious . No you do n't . I 'm dressed now and probably Fred 's waiting for us this minute . " " You ought to be punished , though . " " All right . You can after we come home . " Her smile widened . " I 'm nice to punish , are n't I ? You can spend the evening thinking about it . " She picked up her shawl . " Get your coat on , Chad . " When he joined her at the door , she put her hand in his arm . " Does it hurt ? " she asked . " Really ? " " You bet it does . " " Well , I was mad . We 've only been married three days and you had to go off and stare at Albany Yates and spend the rest of your time thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll remember you for a while , " Chad said , making his voice grim . " How did you know I 'd seen Albany ? " " Joe Duddy told me . But he says she 's not doing well a bit . I feel sorry for her . Was she riding bad ? " " No , " Chad said . He would have liked to twist Joe 's neck . He glanced sideways at Caroline , but her face was sweet . He decided to tell her the truth . " That tent 's just too big for Albany . " " Well , do n't tell Fred . He still thinks she 's wonderful . He told me yesterday they had planned to get married once . " She sounded almost maternal to Chad . " Why do n't you ask Fred what he thinks about Oscar , Chad ? He 's been with other circuses . He might know something . " But Fred Shepley said he had n't ever paid any attention to the lions . He wished he had , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along without Oscar . They had come back to their own tavern as the only other place in the village looked dirty to Caroline . Parma was a tiny place . The keeper of their own tavern told them that since the canal had been put through he had lost a lot of trade . He had to depend now on the farming people . It was a good township though , more than two thousand people in it ; and the farmers were benefiting from theP373canal , so he supposed if he hung on he would do well enough in the long run . Mostly , though , he was interested in telling them of William Morgan 's abduction and he swore he had heard the death carriage going through . What was more , he claimed to have heard it on September 12 several times since , driving like mad through the middle of the night towards Niagara . He said he had heard the ghost of Morgan calling for help . It showed Thurlow Weed was right . He had no doubt Morgan had been drowned . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not , he said he was glad to hear it . He said he did n't believe in Masonry or the Democratic Party . He said some people knew how to make money and some did not , and the thing was to let those that could make it , like Nicholas Biddle , make as much as possible or it would n't be made at all . That made sense , did n't it ? Unless somebody made money it stood to reason there would n't be money , did n't it ? Now the country was getting throwed out on the dump heap . They 'd see . Or their children would , if they had children  --  he did n't suppose circus people did have many children . It stood to reason that a woman doing queer things all the time was n't going to be much of a breeder , did n't it ? He supposedthat was their business though . He heard they had a sick lion . If he had a sick lion he would give it ginger . He would dissolveginger in pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almighty tonic and what it did n't reach , whiskey would . It was getting to be impossible to buy good whiskey cheap around here any more now that farmers were drawing all their wheat to the canal . Distilleries were going out of business . The whole country was getting changed all around . When the tavernkeeper finally left them alone , they moved out onto the porch . It was too hot to walk , and anyway there was nothing to see in Parma . Ike and Fiero joined them , but Fred Shepley did most of the talking . Even Chad had to admit that Fred made good company , and he had a lot to say about circuses and riding . It was Fred 's theory that the day of classic riding was over . You could never develop great riders traveling round the countryP374the way Huguenine 's did , or even the way Burke and Walsh did , for all their huge tent and the money they had . Good riding demandeda permanent ring , where the equestrian could always go for practice . Ike broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that Mateer , though traveling the west with Brown 's Circus , played exclusively in theaters and circus barns . It amounted to the same thing as the Pearl Street Theater in Albany . Moreover , he said , look at the way the taste of the country people went . They were as much interested in menageries as in riding . Burke certainly would not have bothered himself with an elephant and hyenas if it had n't been necessary . But city crowds had the chance to go again and again and so learned to appreciate the fine points . While they were sitting there , a creaking wheel in the direction of Rochester caught their attention . It came on slowly ; and after a few minutes Professor Arganave appeared . " Is this Parma ? Where is Parma ? " he demanded before he recognized them . His relief was intense . He had had a bad time in Rochester . Burke 's tough boys had driven him out of town . He had set up three blocks away and shown the man-eating lion blood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great spiel about the tusks of the big bull dipping through a man 's ribs when the creature was amok . This was the only slide of amok elephant blood in the world . The dangers of procuring it had been incalculable . . . . Amok meant mad , like a mad dog on the one hand , and a rutting buck deer on the other . The professor said he had gone to the Athenaeum and read a piece about elephants , so it was nearly all correct . The trouble was that a little boy who saw the slide happened to ask Mr. Burke himself what they had done with the elephant 's tusks . How did Arganave know the elephant was a cow ? He had n't dared go to see himself for fear of being recognized . Now his microscope was all bent up and he would have to straighten it out . But it was good to be back with the lion . How was he ?  |p375His  face became dismal when he heard that Oscar was ill . He inquired the price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten cents , he sadly drove his creaking wheel off down the south road towards Spencer 's Basin to find a convenient field . " Poor man , " Caroline said softly . " We have to take Burke 's leavings , and he takes ours , " Ike said . " I wonder who takes his . " " His wife , probably , if there are any , " Fred said . " Is he married ? " asked Caroline . " Yes . He showed me a miniature of her once . Sometimes he rigs his microscope so he can look at it life-size . He told me once he did n't think she was faithful . She works for an umbrella maker , who boards with her . " Fred smiled . " She re-covers Arganave 's umbrella every season when he leaves home . That 's what makes him suspicious . " At eight o'clock they broke up . Chad said he was going over to the lot to see that everything was all right for the night . Caroline went up to their room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to come along . They had gone only a few houses down the road when they met Joe Duddy pounding along toward them . " Chad ! " he yelled , waking echoes . " That you , Chad ? " Chad said it was . " Oscar , " Joe said . " He 's begun . . . Caroline ai n't with you ? " " No , just Fred . " " That water 's working . " Fred Shepley whistled . " Maybe he 'll come round then . " " He 's coming round all right , " said Joe . " Hurry up . " When they reached the lot , they found Bastock and Budlong holding lanterns up to the cage wagon and Huguenine , with Mrs. Huguenine 's assistance , moving painfully towards it . " He 's quit , now , " Bastock said.
