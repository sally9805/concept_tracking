To a drab backwash of the ' 80s in downtown Minneapolis one day last week went erect , seamy-faced Mayor George E. Leach . At the corner of Fifth Street and Hennepin Avenue , clangorous with streetcar traffic , he stood up before a nostalgic crowd . Said he : " I was here when the first brick was put in and I am here now to take the first brick out . " Then , with a crowbar he pried one from the faade of an imposing seven-story Moorish-Victorian pile . <P> Thus with ceremony usually saved for a new building , Minneapolis said good-by to an old : the famed 400-room West Hotel where Jim Hill had eaten , slept and drunk while building his northwest railroad empire ; where Ruby Bob Fitzsimmons once demonstrated his solar plexus punch with a bellboy for a sparring partner ; where popeyed crowds had gathered , in the reaches of the spreading , pretentious lobby , to watch Booth , Mansfield , Bernhardt , Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson and many another pass . <P> After the brick-busting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has made more buildings disappear than all the raiding bombers of modern warfare : the sprawling Cleveland Wrecking Co . <P> For the five Brothers Rose , owners of Cleveland Wrecking , it was another in a series of thousands of jobs of erasing oldfashioned , tax-eating structures to make room for new buildings , parking lots , Government housing projects . Like many another well-built oldtimer , the West Hotel promised fat profits in salvage as well as a decent fee ( reputedly $20,000 ) for demolition . <P> Broad-shouldered , heavy-jawed President Louis Sanders Rose was 18 when he opened his first office in 1908 . In his first year he did $25,000 worth of business in salvage sales , began to spread out , reached into his own family for executive help . <P> Into the firm went Big Brother William , Little Brothers Mose , Sidney , John , Charles . To Mose death came in the early ' 20s , but the five Roses rode on , destroying for profit and progress . <P> After the war the Roses razed Camp Gordon in Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 U. S. cities , spotted executive offices in five other cities from coast to coast . String-savers on a grand scale , they also bought army goods-everything from McClellan saddles to cots and hospital equipment-opened Army- &-Navy; stores to resell them . They wrecked buildings by the thousands , branched into new lumber . In 1928 they incorporated . The company was named Cleveland in honor of Father Rose 's home ; its technical headquarters were based in Cincinnati because it was an Ohio corporation ; its home office stayed in Minneapolis because that was where Louis got his start . <P> Scattered from Philadelphia to San Francisco , the Brothers Rose meet only two or three times a year . Once they meet as stockholders , tot up the profits , split them five equal ways . Several times a week they meet by telephone , manage to pile up tolls of $10,000 a year in shop talk , family gossip .
