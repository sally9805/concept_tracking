txt The order of the War ProductionBoard for a 20 per cent cut in sales by retail gasoline distributors , except on " preferential " demands , will go into effect this morning . Approximately 125,000 filling stations will be affected . The order applies to the entire Eastern area as well as the States of Oregon and Washington . Coincidentally with the rationing of gasoline sales , John E. Hamm , Acting Federal Price Administrator , issued an order in Washington last night freezing prices of gasoline at Friday 's levels in the same areas . The order is effective Monday . The rationing of gasoline sales will be enforced through a 20 per cent curtailment of gasoline furnished to retailers by suppliers . Details of the order have been mailed to supply agencies by the petroleum industry 's marketing committee . Retailers are to be allotted quotas based on an average of sales for the last three months combined with an average of the seasonal factor and sales a year ago . The order requires that service station hours for gasoline sales are " not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than seventy-two hours of any calendar week , " except to the " preferential deliveries " group . The last-mentioned group includes vehicles and boats necessary for public safety , including ambulances and vehicles operated by ' physicians , surgeons , nurses and veterinarians ; vehicles engaged in civilian defense in an area under martial law , enemy attack or immediate threat of enemy attack ; vehicles and boats owned and operated by or in the service of Federal , State or local governments ; commercial vehicles so classified by law , including cabs and commercial boats ; equipment for commercial , industrial and agricultural uses and school buses . Violators of the order may have their deliveries stopped on instructions of the director of industry operations of the WPB and are subject to prosecution under the Criminal Code . The order forwarded to the 125 , - , 000 filling stations in the areas affected covers eight closely typed pages and will require careful study . It provides for the delivery of additional supplies for " preferential " demands in the event the monthly quota proves inadequate to meet such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are entitled to more gasoline than suppliers are willing to furnish under the order may appeal by letter  --  not in person  --  to the regional director of the division of marketing in the Petroleum Coordinator 's Office in the Chanin Building , Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue . They must furnish detailed information as to the reasons for their appeal . Each case will be investigated in an effort to bring about an adjustment . In instances requiring such action appeals will be- forwarded , with recommendations , to the director of marketing in the Petroleum Coordinator 's Office in Washington , who will transmit the cases for final decision to the director of industry operations of the WPB . Sellers Criticize Order Criticism of the gasoline rationing order was expressed yesterday by spokesmen of both suppliers and retailers . Those speaking for the former pointed out that while the order aims to curtail gasoline sales by 20 per cent , the actual curtailment achieved will not exceed 13 per cent because of the exceptions made on " preferential " demands . It was pointed out also that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transients , since the average dealer will be concerned principally with meeting " preferential " demands and serving regular customers . Stations catering entirely to transients will be compelled to cut their sales materially . But the main objection offered by spokesmen for suppliers was that there will be no real control of sales under the order , except through the quotas to be allotted to retailers . It was pointed out that a more practical method of cutting sales would be through the introduction of a card rationing system , as proposed by the gasoline companies . Another objection raised was to the exclusion from the order of the entire interior of the country , the point made being that if the order I were to apply generally to all States the curtailment of sales would be only 6 per cent , thus making possible the release of additional cars for the transportation of gasoline to the East . Attention was called to the fact that the Eastern States , where more than 50 per cent of war production is centered , will be hard hit by the order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline for their cars used in traveling to and from work . In many instances , it was pointed out , workers travel fifty to sixty miles daily to their places of employment . The rationing of gasoline and tires will prove a serious handicap for thousands of these workers . Since the rationing order is silent on the question of the exact hours of opening and closing of gasoline stations , retailers yesterday urged the adoption of a uniform 7 P. M. to 7 A. M. curfew and Sunday closings to insure that the restrictions will affcst large and small operators alike . Officials of the Gasoline Council of Metropolitan New York , representing between 5,000 and 6,000 filling station operators , will submit a resolution to Petroleum Coordinator Harold L. Ickes opposing any " stagger system " of hours . Announcement of this was made yesterday by Michael Goldstein , president of the council , after a I conference of the council 's executive committee at the Hotel New Yorker . The executive committee drew up a proposal containing five major contentions in favor of uniform closing hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ickes by Mr. Goldstein and Hyman Rapps , secretary of the council . Council 's Proposals The five points were outlined as follows : 1 . Proper enforcement of a stagger system would require such a large staff as to make the system wasteful . 2 . With a uniform curfew , gasoline-station operators could foresee possible increases in operating costs and decreases in gallonage and could offset this to some extent through savings in such items as light , power and machinery . 1 There would be little labor problem involved because the dealers would utilize much of their night I labor for increased daytime operating demands . 3 . With all service stations closed 1from 7 P. M. to 7 A. M. , all or most of their specialized equipment , such as tow cars , acetelyne torches , tools and rolling stock could easily be made available to recognized civilian defense agencies for emergency use . 4 . All-night closing of gas sta-tions would naturally result in an ultimate conservation of gasoline and oil , the ultimate aim of the government at this time , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust his fuel during the closed hours . I This would result in restriction of night driving and less congestion on the streets at night , while pub- , lie needs could adequately be met I in the daytime . 5 . A stagger system would present an unfair advantage to chain operators , who could locate their stations or regulate their hours in such a way as suited their needs , while the small operator might be driven out of business through loss of his permanent trade . Working Hours Plan Scored Objection to permitting stations to select their opening and closing hours was voiced also by Sol A. Herzog , general counsel of the Eastern States Gasoline Dealers Conference . The WPB 's order as far as the hours of operation are concerned will make it difficult to supervise the filling stations , Mr. Herzog said . - The executive committee of the conference will meet at the Hotel New Yorker today to consider various problems of operation arising from the order and its enforce , ment . Complying with the WPB order restricting sales to seventy-two hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night at the Marillon , Church Avenue and East Twenty-first Street , Brooklyn , adopted a reso- ' lution whereby their stations would be closed from 7 P. M. to 7 A. M. daily and all day on Sundays . The schedule will go into effect at 7 o'clock tonight . The New Jersey Gasoline Dealers Association recommended yesterday Sunday closing of stations throughout the Eastern seaboard . John Dressler , head of . the group and chairman of the Eastern States Gasoline Dealers Conference , said the recommendation would be forwarded to John W. Frey , director of marketing in the Petroleum Coordinator 's office . Other recommendations of the New Jersey retailers were that dealers in the restricted fuel area be , required to post their hours of operation conspicuously and that the daily operating hours run con- , secutively . The traffic division at Police Headquarters received reports yesterday showing that policemen issued warnings to 739 motorists on Tuesday for exceeding the fortymile speed limit urged by President Roosevelt to save tires .. Total warnings were 1,410 since Sunday .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
