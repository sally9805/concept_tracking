Brooklyn Dodger fans are used to great suffering . With particular anguish , they can remember the time Hack Wilson was hit on the head by a fly ball while sassing the bleachers ; the time three Dodgers tried to slide into the same base at the same time ; the time Babe Herman 's pants caught fire because he forgot to douse his cigar before putting it in his pocket . <P> But such sorrows were-a , pleasure alongside the unnatural disaster which threatened last week . Leo ( " The Lip " ) Durocher , the natty and cultivated friend of the great , the famed radio guest star , the manager of the hottest Dodger team Ebbets Field has yet known- " Mr. Brooklyn " himself-was in court facing five years in jail just because he was accused of slugging a heckler . <P> The home-grown jury was chosen with the utmost care . One talesman was summarily rejected ( by the prosecution ) because he thought " no Dodger can do wrong ' ' ; another was peremptorily waved away ( by the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court that he had never seen the Dodgers play . Headlined the New York Daily News : DUROCHER TO BE TRIED BY JURY OF HIS JEERS . <P> Kicks &; Blackjacks . " The Lip " tightened noticeably as pudgy , Dodger-hating ex-Serviceman John Christian , 23 ( a Brooklyn resident in address only ) , put forth his Brooklyn-shaking testimony . He said that after a night game on June 9 , 1945 , Durocher and Joe Moore , an Ebbets Field policeman , had beaten him with fists and a blackjack , and broken his jaw so badly that it had to be wired together . As further evidence , the Assistant D.A . said that Durocher had paid Christian $6,750 to settle out of court . <P> Durocher was visibly hurt . He said Christian had broken his jaw falling into a water trough . He described Christian 's heckling as inhumanly abrasive-worse than that of the gifted stentor , Ebbets Field Hilda , whose loon-like cries are supposed to carry to the Mississippi . Patiently , almost demurely , he recalled : " As we say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On June 9 , the night of the alleged beating , said Durocher , softly , Christian had ridden the Dodger pitcher , Curt Davis , into a lather : * " Davis is an elderly gentleman in the vicinity of 42 today . " Durocher explained . <P> The jury understood , perfectly . In 38 minutes , Leo was free . Brooklyn justice had prevailed . Actually , the . verdict had been agreed on in five minutes . But , as one juror explained : " We wanted to have a smoke . We did n't want to rush into this thing blindly . " <P> * Ben Chapman &; Victor Lombardi pitched for the Dodgers the night of June 9-not Davis .
