A job requiring intellectual guts was handed out last week by a university which has notably displayed that quality . For Stanford 's new School of Humanities , announced three months ago as the university 's challenge to profounder troubles than war , a Professor of Humanities was chosen : Author-Critic Lewis Mumford ( Sticks and Stones , The Culture of Cities , Faith for Living , etc . ) . <P> New York-born Lewis Mumford is no intellectual opportunist . He was long a disciple of the late Sir Patrick Geddes , the **33;14823;TOOLONG who gave him his enthusiasm for sound city planning . A self-styled " basic communist , " Mumford disapproved of Marxists but writhed when he was called a " liberal . " A man of parts , he wrote excellent architectural criticism for The New Yorker , lectured at Columbia , Dartmouth and Harvard , got himself denounced as " a sublimated recruiting officer " when he called for a U.S. break with Germany , Italy and Japan in 1938 . <P> Big Machines , Little Men . Lewis Mumford has been concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values by which modern men can live . One certainty about U.S. universities is that , despite their present absorption with wartime training schemes , they can not evade the ultimate problem of " value . " In the light of that long-term prospect , Humanist Mumford , now 46 , goes to Stanford with determined ideas of what has to be done . <P> " If our free democratic world is saved , " declares Mumford , " it will be saved , not just by machines and guns , but by our capacity to produce a higher type of human being , whose will and purpose are superior to that of the enemy . <P> " Big machines are of no use , " Mumford points out , " if they are run by little men . During the last two generations , in particular , the community has been paralyzed by the fact that our material organizations have outrun our moral and intellectual capacity to make good use of them . In their technical refinement , our machines have often approached perfection ; but no similar development has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary : the typical human product of our time , especially among the leaders of our society , is either a paranoid personality , warped by delusions of grandeur and an insatiable lust for power , or a split personality , in which the intellectual , the emotional and the practical sides are divided into watertight compartments . The first type tends to be destructive ; the second , trivial or impotent . " <P> In his basic courses , Mumford sees " a chance for me to put into practice the concept of education I have had for many years , which is that the humanities and science are not in inherent conflict but have become separated in the 20th Century . Now their essential unity must be re-emphasized , so that 20th-century multiplicity may become 20th-century unity . " One technique will be to acquaint " students with " the great masters of reality , " not politicians , businessmen and economists , but Sophocles , Shakespeare , Isaiah , Dostoevski , St. Paul .               @ @ @ @ @ @
