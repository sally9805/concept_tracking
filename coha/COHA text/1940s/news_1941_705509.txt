txt Reaction in Britain to continued Allied military setbacks in Libya and the Balkans is taking the form of a growing demand for more hard facts , no matter how disagreeable . There is increasing evidence of distrust in the over-optimistic newspaper reports and enthusiastic radio bulletins about " highly successful withdrawals " and " soft soap " pronouncements . This is in contrast with comments of the American newsagencies , one of which , referring to the Mediterranean situation , writes to the effect that the ominous word of a British retirement on the main Balkan front shattered British hopes that the battle line had been established . Nevertheless , said this commentator , the extent and purpose of the withdrawal is not yet clear . It appears to have been made according to plan and not to have been forced by German or Italian successes . Despite German claims that the British were giving up the struggle , it remains to be seen whether the Allies were doing anything more than contract their defensive front to conserve manpower and shorten their communication lines Military Necessity On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident that the British com- : mand is acting on the word of Prime Minister Churchill when he said that neither British prestige nor home morale reasons , but military necessity alone , would govern the conduct of operations . The British High Command ap // British Demand Hard Facts In Reports of War Activity LONDON . April 15 ( fP ) ? Though the War Office communiqu ? announcing the withdrawal in Greece told of " severe casualties " inflicted on the Germans , the British public still recognized it for what it was  --  another setback . The withdrawal was made April 12 , with the Germans reported maintaining continuous pressure . The lack of official information recalled the dark days of last spring . The full impact of the Libyan and Balkan reverses has hit the British public slowly . A bright side , it seemed , could be found in every setback . But today two powerful London papers , the Daily Mail and Daily Herald , demanded fact-facing in strong language . Colossal Task Said the Mail : " It is common sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing a colossal task , and it is no service to them to pretend otherwise . A good deal of nonsense has been written and spoken about Germany 's extended and vulnerable lines of communication . The same thing was heard when they thrust deeply into France . " The Herald charged that the people had been " constantly distracted by writers and speakers who seek quite superfluously to cheer them up . " " The present is dark and the immediate future not bright , " admitted The Times . Reaction to the current setbacks probably is keener because they came so soon after the British naval victory over the Italians in the Battle of Matapan , Yugoslavia 's pro-British revolution , and the crushing of Italian East Africa . The only criticism heard here so far of Gen. Sir Archibald P. the better we 'll be .

Confusion has been caused in recent days by an apparent misunderstanding between authorities in London and Cairo , Egypt , as to which was to release certain news .
