The merchant seaman is doing a huge job in the war . Last week a conference of Government medical officials and top-rank psychiatrists at the New York Academy of Medicine considered what a grueling job it is also . Cases were presented from the War Shipping Administration 's five rest homes for seamen ( in Long Island , New Jersey , Maryland , Louisiana , California ) . Samples : <P> &gt; One man , picked up from a life raft , had several shrapnel wounds . When the hospital discharged him he " just wanted to get away from everything . " But after a month , during which he was scared stiff whenever he rode on a public conveyance , he shipped on a 29-day coastwise trip . One night " I was in bed and it was the first alarm I heard since I was torpedoed , and I practically froze in my bed . I did n't want to get out . I was musclebound , you might say , for several seconds . " After that trip , he was sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still afraid of crowds , and a short jaunt by train and ferry almost unnerved him . But after a good sleep , without nightmares- " I feel very good , " he said . Soon he would be back at sea . <P> &gt; A middle-aged Negro chief cook , on a ship torpedoed at night , was apparently knocked out by the explosion , finally struggled into his life belt in the dark , found his way to the deck , got into a lifeboat . Said he : " My head began to grow very , very large and I could n't sit up and I commenced to throw up in the boat . " His head felt " as large as a chair . " Later he had hand tremors , a " pendulum pain " in the left side of his head , wrist weakness , stiff hands with palms that felt very thick . After treatment on Long Island he felt better , did not have his headaches so regularly . Said he : " As soon as I am healed , I propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedoed seamen have the jitters for a while . Most cure themselves , but many need treatment . Until last autumn , when the War Shipping Administration , aided by the United Seamen 's Service , established its homes , many a man sailed again into dangerous waters still suffering from tremor , double vision or sleeplessness . Chronic alcoholics , chronic psychoneurotics are not admitted to the homes . Any other bona fide seaman needing treatment can get in . <P> Psychiatrist Daniel Blain , 44 , is in charge of the homes , mapped out the treatment . Average stay is three weeks . Average population of a home is 35 to 50 . At this rate the homes can rehabilitate 4,000 men a year . Treatment is of two kinds : 1 ) " supportive , " i.e. , food , rest , quiet , sedation , vitamins , personal attention , recreation , exercise , occupational therapy ; 2 ) psychotherapy by personal interview and group talks , to help a man understand his condition and bring about his own cure .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
