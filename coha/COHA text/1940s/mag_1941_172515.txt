SEC finally used its power last week to order a utility 's common stock wiped out . Victim was New England Public Service Co . ( NEPSCO ) , an Insull stray which has kept going under Maine management since the crash . Two companies previously threatened have started to recapitalize voluntarily on a common-stock basis before the order could be issued . They are Standard Gas and United Light &; Power . <P> With $18,850,000 arrears on five issues of NEPSCO preferred , SEC decided that the common was too far under water to have any present or future equity left , declared the common had no right to keep 74% voting control of the company . Preferred stockholders were given the choice of accepting common in a new holding company or liquidating NEPSCO into its component operating companies . Since some of these are textile and paper mills , SEC suggested that this latter course would speed up integration proceedings under the Holding Company Act .
