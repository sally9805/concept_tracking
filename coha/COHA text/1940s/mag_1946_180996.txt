How long will the postwar boom last ? The rosy estimates of three to five years have been based on one solid economic fact . During the war , U.S. consumers piled up $90 billion in savings , now hold $130 billion . This huge hoard , according to the economic witch-doctors , would be poured out-to fuel the boom . But last week , in a gloomy and significant report , the conservative U.S. Bureau of Agricultural Economics said " Not so . " <P> In the June Federal Reserve Bulletin , BAE reported what it had found in a representative survey of 3,000 spending units ( all the members of a family living together , pooling their income for major expenditures ) in the nation . On the basis of its survey , BAE made some startling estimates for the entire U.S. Most significant : the 50,000,000 people living on the lowest salaries , who had been counted on to do much of the buying , have only 1 % of the savings . And they plan to hang on to most of them . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top fifth of the salary brackets received almost half the national income , said BAE . Moreover , this same top fifth already held three-quarters of the savings and liquid assets . The bottom 40% had saved only $1 billion during the war . More than 50% having bank deposits decided not to touch their holdings this year except for emergency use . <P> Who Wants the Goods ? How big , then , is the postwar market ? BAE estimated that only about 2.8 million people definitely intend to buy cars in 1946 ; another million will probably buy . Another 2.6 million plan to buy a house this year ; a half million will probably buy one . But they plan to pay only $5,020 , a price few houses are selling at . For other consumer durable goods , 9.9 million consumers expect to spend $320 each ( $3 billion in all ) . But they expect to spend only about 25% from liquid assets ; of the rest , 40% will come from current income ; 35% from borrowing . <P> <P> The prime point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instalment buying , was already proving true . In April , charge accounts were up 40% over a year ago . <P> Actually , the picture was not all dark . Those in the low income brackets were able to expand instalment buying rapidly because they had paid up so many of their debts during the war . Even without savings they can buy many things they formerly had to do without . <P> Nor was the survey able to find out how much cash was tucked under mattresses and other favored " banks " of low income groups . Nevertheless , the survey might well cause businessmen to revise drastically their estimates of the size of the market , the length of the boom . If BAE was right , and the bulk of the cash was held by a comparative few , then the boom might run out of gas earlier than most economists anticipated .
