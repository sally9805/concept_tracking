At his new , Seabee-built headquarters on Guam , Chester William Nimitz sat at a shiny new desk . He wore khaki shorts , and an open-necked shirt with the five stars of a fleet admiral on the points of his collar . He was waiting . Radio Tokyo went off the air , came on again , screaming about the approach of U.S. planes . Then the Navy signal was flashed . Mitscher 's attack had begun . <P> Nimitz reached for his pen , gripped it in a hand gnarled by rheumatism ( from submarine service a quarter of a century ago ) , and wrote in a neat , upright hand : " This operation has long been planned , and the opportunity to accomplish it fulfills the deeply cherished desire of every officer and man of the Pacific Fleet . " <P> The disciplined language of the communiqu was scarcely an emotional outburst . But in those words Nimitz had allowed himself to unbend , for the world at large , more than at any previous time in his three years under the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pacific Ocean Areas . <P> The Darkest Day . Within an hour after the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor , Nimitz had impressed his superiors as a man well suited for the Pacific command . He had been summoned to Frank Knox 's office on the second " deck " of the barracks-like Navy Department on Washington 's Constitution Avenue . There were gathered the Secretary , Under Secretary Forrestal , Assistant Secretary Bard , Admiral Harold R. ( " Betty " ) Stark , Chief of Naval Operations . Nimitz , then a rear admiral and chief of the Bureau of Navigation , was the calmest man present . <P> Soon , Knox went to President Roosevelt to decide the appointment of a new Commander in Chief , Pacific Fleet . A year before , Knox had submitted two names : Husband Edward Kimmel and Chester William Nimitz , in that order . Franklin Roosevelt had picked the first name . This time , said Knox , he would be satisfied with the second name from the same list . The President agreed . Nimitz himself demurred ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Pye , who had taken over temporarily from Kimmel after the disaster . But he accepted his orders , and started west in civilian clothes , under the pseudonym of " Mr. Wainwright , " by rail to San Diego , and thence by air to Pearl Harbor . <P> Light in the Darkness . There Nimitz found , in his own concise summation , " too many people and too much pessimism . " His attitude toward his luckless predecessor , Kimmel , was that of a professional who sees a brother officer under the lash of defeat : " There , but for the grace of God , go I. " <P> He met Kimmel 's staff , and the scratch staff which had served Pye during the last days of December . In particular , Nimitz had to appraise balding Captain Charles H. ( " Sock " ) McMorris , Kimmel 's war plans officer , who had said ( a week before Dec. 7 ) that Japanese airmen would never surprise Pearl Harbor . In BuNav , Nimitz had seemed a hard executive , despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had made it taut . The officers whose careers had seemed blasted by Jap bombs and torpedoes expected Nimitz to sweep them all out to some naval Siberia and to bring in his own team . They trudged to the new CinCPac 's conference .
