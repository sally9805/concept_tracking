txt The utility industry 's hand in working out integration proceedings under terms of the Public Utility Holding Company Act was strengthened yesterday by U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals action here . In a decision which sent a utility merger proposal back to the Federal Power Commission for redetermination , the court held that the FPC , in denying approval of the absorption of inland Power &; Light Co. by the parent , Pacific Power &; Light Co. , has " ascribed a meaning to the statute not borne out by its language . " The decision was regarded as curtailing authority of the Commission to withhold approval of utility company mergers on the basis of its own interpretation of the intent of Congress in passing the Federal Power Act . The opinion was written by Circuit Judge William Healy and concurred in by Judges William Denman and Clifton Mathews . The case now decided originated in 1937 , when Pacific Power &; Light sought to absorb Inland , a wholly owned subsidiary which operates three hydro-electric generating plants in Oregon and Washington and either leases its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Authority to effect the merger was granted by state utility commissions in the two states but was denied by the FPC on grounds that no showing of promotion of public interest had been made . The commission also held in its denial that " it is not shown here that the proposed transfer will tend toward more economical and more efficient development of an integrated public utility system . " Appeal from the FPC denial was taken by the two companies to the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which in September , 1938 , dented the commission 's motion for dismissal of the case . In January , 1939 , the commission sought a writ of certiorari from the U. S. Supreme Court . an action in which the two companies joined . The supreme court affirmed the cir-. cult court in April , last year , and remanded the case to the circuit court for rehearing on the merits . This rehearing is the one now decided by the circuit court , opinion of which has sent the original merger application back to the Federal Power Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turning point of the case came in the commission 's interpretation of section 203 ( A I of the Federal Power Act , which established ' procedure of notification and hearings on proposed mergers or acquisitions . The section says that " if the commission finds that the proposed , disposition , consolidation , acquisition or control will be consistent with the public interest , it shall approve the same ' The commission s denial of the company s application interpreted this section as " requiring something more than a showing of convenience to the applicant " and as " reasonably to be interpreted as indicating that the Congress intended there be a showing that benefit to the public will result from the proposed merger of facilities before it should receive commission approval . " The Circuit Court opinion holds that the " thought ( of the act ) conveyed is merely one of compatibility " and that " the statute does not require a showing that positive benefit to the public will result " The statute does not , the court says , " disclose a policy hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as presumptively hostile .
