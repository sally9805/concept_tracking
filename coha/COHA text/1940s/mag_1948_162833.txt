One radio star who is not much disturbed about the threat of television is Comedian Fred Allen . Last week , filling in for vacationing Columnist John Crosby of the N.Y . Herald Tribune , Allen struck some ambiguous blows in radio 's defense , managing at the same time to get a few elbow-jabs and nose-rubs into radio 's face . Sample Allen opinions of the " romp , revel and enlightening fare " that packs the average radio day : <P> Husband &; Wife Programs : " Cleverly blending commercials with gossip . . . the husband and wife mate the trite with the trivial and foal the drab . " <P> Soap Operas : " The plot usually concerns a character named Just Simple Sam , who-although his house is on fire , his daughter has just eloped with a man who was seen coming out of a Henry Wallace rally . . . and he has had an automobile accident that has broken his back , fractured his skull and crushed both legs-is still able to crawl to the microphone and help the announcer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops . " <P> Quiz Shows : " . . . Hastily establish the ignorance of the contestant and give her a refrigerator , an airplane , or $20,000 to get away from the microphone . " <P> Round Table Discussions : " They are . . . like boring a hole through the wall of a Turkish bath-all you get is hot air . " <P> Disc Jockeys : " Often called ' nocturnal non sequiturs . ' To be a disc jockey you have to have insomnia and a collection of records . " <P> The Marriage Programs : " . . . Enable cretin couples to take their marriage vows over a coast-to-coast network and later to raise children who will become contestants on quiz programs . " <P> Allen 's heartening conclusion : " I am not worried . While television is making up its mind , radio marches on ! It may be a treadmill-but RADIO MARCHES ON ! "
