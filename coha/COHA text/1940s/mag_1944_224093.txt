Wendell Willkie 's 1944 future seemed to be staked on the Wisconsin primary of April 4 . If he wins a majority of Wiscon sin 's 24 delegates , he is still in the running for the G.O.P. nomination . If he does not , practical politicians were ready ( &; eager ) to write him off . Willkie himself chose the battlefield , and it was a tough one . He chose a state partly within the reading orbit of the Chicago Tribune , a state that pledged its votes to Dewey in 1940 . <P> He chose a state raised on LaFollette progressivism - but also on LaFollette isolationism . He went into battle against enemies who were not there : Dewey , Stassen , MacArthur-men who by choice or necessity were " ghost candidates . " It was uphill work . <P> Willkie began poorly in Richland Center , deep in dairyland . Farmers gave up their Saturday night shopping to jam 2,400 strong into a red-brick high school . They sat apathetic through a long farm speech , delivered without fire . Then Willkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lac . His party , including 25 correspondents , rolled along snow-covered countryside in seven shiny rented 1942 Dodges . Veteran Scripps-Howard Newsman Tom Stokes was reminded of a " glamorous Broadway star going back to the five-a-day ... or a major-league pitcher back to the minors . ... All the trappings of the big time still cling , but it 's all in miniature . " <P> G.O.P. Birthplace . In Oshkosh , where 400 persons left their midmorning work to listen , Willkie first warmed up . For the first time , too , his hearers warmed . He lashed at Tom Dewey , at those who think it " clever to be silent , that it is smart poli tics to manipulate the nomination . " In Ripon , birthplace of the Republican party , he put the argument on a scholarly plane , in a speech acclaimed by Columnist Marquis Childs as " one of the vital docu ments in our political history . . . . Our grandchildren may be reading it in history books 50 years from now . " <P> Said Wendell Willkie at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Whig party before it " men sought to trim and hedge rather than to face the dangers , or talked trivialities , remaining silent on the basic issues , hoping thereby to avoid offending divergent elements . ... A certain cynicism characterized the politics of the day - a cynicism which has had its parallel in our own time . <P> Nobody expected much of the politicians . . . . Yet we can triumph only if the people find in our party not a mere instrument for personal ambition , but the representation of principles . " <P> To the Grey-Hairs . Willkie himself hedged not at all to win isolationist support . In Appleton , he said that any Republican who had the narrow nationalist support of the Chicago Tribune would go down to defeat . In Green Bay , he declared " I am in complete disagreement with the President 's Vichy policy , his Darlan policy , and his dealings with the Fascist forces of Italy . " But he forthrightly defended his own international sympathies , his early espousal of Lend-Lease ( " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
