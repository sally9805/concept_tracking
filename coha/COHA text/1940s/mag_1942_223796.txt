Two soldiers discreetly retreated when a strangely dressed figure emerged from the woods near Fort McPherson , Ga . Clad in heavy garments , with goggles and big asbestos gloves , he toted a bulging burlap sack . Even technicians at the fort 's medical laboratory shrank back . " Unclean , unclean , " said one of them . " Phooey , " replied Sergeant Seymour Shapiro . From his sack he pulled one of the long , leafy , hairy-stemmed vines of poison ivy he had been gathering , cut the vine into 3-ft. lengths and hung the pieces in bundles , like curing tobacco , from the ceiling . <P> From dried poison-ivy leaves Sergeant Shapiro concocts a unique extract which cures ivy poisoning , cause of 15 to 30% of summer and fall casualties in Southern Army posts . The dried , crushed leaves are soaked in pure alcohol until it turns an intense green . This solution is then filtered , put up in 50 cc. ( 1 ? oz. ) bottles and shipped to Army camps throughout the Fourth Service Command ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , one-tenth of a cc. of the extract ( diluted with one cc. of salt solution ) is injected intramuscularly . Burning sensations vanish within two to 24 hours , all blistering within two to five days , and no hospitalization is needed . The average untreated case suffers from one to three weeks , often in a hospital . Sergeant Shapiro 's extract can not prevent ivy poisoning ; it desensitizes skin only after an attack . Applied externally , it produces a fine case of poison ivy itself . <P> Sergeant Shapiro , who before the war was a chemist for a New Jersey flavoring-extract firm , has already brewed 50,000 cc. of the poison-ivy inoculant-enough for half a million injections . But the extract is not his invention . It was developed by Colonel Sanford Williams French , a longtime Army doctor who commands the medical branch of the Fourth Service Command . French , one of the 40% of mankind who are relatively immune to poison ivy , can safely gather the plant barehanded . Sergeant Shapiro can not . Paradoxically , he is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . He has suffered five poison-ivy attacks this year .
