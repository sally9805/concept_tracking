txt Librarian Lydenberg Praised Of the many public and semi-public institutions to come within range of Commissioner Moses ' latest remarks , the Public Library needs least of all to reply . Its record of service in the main building alone , where upward of 4,000 , - 000 visitors are welcomed each year , its ever-expanding material , its marvelous acquisitions , have been carried on in the face of a chronic shortage of funds . The library 's plight needs greater attention from the city . Dr. Lydenberg has brought to the library not only scholarship of the finest kind but a lifetime of library experience and a deep sense of obligation about the library 's function and duty to the city . He has fought vigorously against the notion that libraries in hard times are a luxury . Gentle , kind and generous , he is an extremely modest man whose capabilities have endeared him to booklovers , students and citizens everywhere . CARDHOLDER .
