txt A presidential veto of the labor bill does not look very formidable today . This means that the danger of a legislative stalemate over the major domestic issue before the present session of Congress is greatly reduced . This means that a new labor law has a good chance of getting on the statute books shortly . Only one barrier now stands in the way of its successful enactment . It is this : The House-Senate versions of two labor bills now are in conference in the hands of a committee made up of five Senators and five Representatives . If the House conferees succeed in imposing the provisions of the Hartley bill upon the Taft-Ives bill , then a presidential veto would have a very doubtful chance of being overridden by the Senate . It most likely would be upheld . If , on the other hand , the House acquiesces in the milder measure which the Senate passed this week , then labor legislation is almost certain . Conceivably  --  but not likely  --  Mr. Truman might not veto the Senate version of the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at hand in the Senate , as well as in the House , to override the . veto . In other words , the Republican-Democratic support of the Taft-Ives bill is sufficient to defeat a veto , but the necessary two-thirds vote would be hard to muster if any of the major House provisions are added to the Taft-Ives bill . * There is much to commend the Senate bill . Though its critics , including the President if he decides upon a veto , properly can . find fault with some of its provisions , the measure is broadly constructive and corrective . In view of the fact that union leadership opposed all legislative action to correct past abuses. , it is remarkable that the bill is as restrained as it is . It is hard to see where it is punitive or vindictive . The fact that in its final form it won the support of political liberals such as Senators Ives , Aiken , and Hatch shows that the middle-road friends of labor count the bill , as it passed the Senate , better than no bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . The Congress which was freshly elected last fall is decisively in favor of important changes in the nation 's basic labor law . The 68-to-24 vote by which the Senate passed its measure showed that support for the bill was substantially bipartisan . The Republican support was almost unanimous . The 42 Democratic votes were divided evenly for and against it . No new piece of labor legis- Dowhnr . M New York Hered Tribune . Inc .

It might as well be taken for granted that big labor , like big business , is going to resist any degree of Government regulation . But the large unions , now exerting a great power in the nation 's economy and certain to become more powerful , are going to have to be regulated just the same as other institutions of our economy , like credit and the corporation , have been regulated .

Its central purpose is to proscribe unfair labor practices on the part of unions as well as on the part of employers . It is directed toward restoring the legal balance between the two sides in collective bargaining . Primarily , it seeks to correct , not to punish . It seeks to protect the country from paralyzing national strikes . It should leave labor free to organize effectively and to bargain collectively within the framework of national safety  --  and if it does n't , it should itself be cor-rected : The Senate measure can not be put down as either a reckless or an extreme bill . The real threat to its becoming law is not a presidential veto but the possibility that the extreme provisions of the Hartley bill will be imposed on the Taft-Ives bill in conference . If the Senate conferees can preserve their own bill , both houses can defeat a Truman veto . if there is one , and a , sterile deadlock will be averted .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
