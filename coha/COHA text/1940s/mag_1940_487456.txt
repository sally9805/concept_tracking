THE hour of decision was over before the election . On the one essential point , the defense of liberty , the two candidates were of one mind . We are committed ; the danger lies in our refusal to admit it , even to ourselves . We are drifting fast into world action , but we are drifting sideways or even backward , still crying peace , neutrality , and isolation when not a shred of these remains . It is this insincerity that Albert Carr would dispel . Isolation is gone ; participation as a mere auxiliary is the kind of entanglement most contrary to our traditions , our interests , and our principles . The remaining alternative , the only one worthy of our power and of our ideal , is leadership . We alone can " end war " and " make the world safe for democracy . " This is our great opportunity , our second chance . It may be our last . " End war ! Save democracy ! " We have sneered for twenty years at these promises . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking and determined action . We must first confess that our cynicism was wrong , and that the despised " idealists " were the only true realists . " America , " says Mr. Carr , " betrayed the world and herself twenty years before the inadequate old gentleman with the umbrella tried in good faith to postpone Armageddon . " " For the American betrayal of 1919 there can be no extenuation . Each year that has elapsed has made the crime against humanity blacker , more sinister . " Yesterday this would have been vox clamantis in deserto . Even today these are courageous words . We are still hampered by the anti-Wilsonian propaganda of the last two decades . We are hampered also by the activities of those men who are at heart with the Nazis and against the democracies , those fifth columnists who paralyzed and betrayed France . As in France , they are an odd coalition , and the most insidious elements among them are those conservatives who " fear that the defeat of Germany would give over Western Europe to a socialist revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Smashing dangerous organizations , " however , is perilous in a democracy . Carr offers two excellent rules . The first is637 that " a democratic government , even in peace time , has every right to insist upon a monopoly of force . " " It should not hesitate to suppress groups set up for organized intimidation , like the Ku Klux Klan . " The second is that " no organization should be dissolved unless it has proved its menace to democracy by a record of overt acts . " Let this have a place in our Bill of Rights . The worst cause of confusion , according to Carr , is our " tender-mindedness , " the wishful thinking which prompted us to " outlaw war " without first creating world law . His longest chapter is entitled We Need to Get Tough . I gladly indorse the idea , but , with all respect to William James , I object to the words . " Tough " is too easily confused with " rough , " " raw , " or " coarse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We need to make our thinking stronger through greater refinement . Reality is tangled . It is " tough " in the wrong sense of the term to dismiss Nazism as " the revolution of nihilism . " Much of the excellent and very definite program proposed by Albert Carr was anticipated by the Nazis ; on this point Mrs. Lindbergh has a lesson for us . It is " tough " to bracket together Germany and Russia ; in Russia the dictatorship is not a permanent principle , and the imperialistic virus has been reduced to a minimum . I fully agree with Carr that " in fact , if England with American aid can throw back the Nazi attack , it will be important to have an understanding with Russia well before the collapse of Germany . For America to reject Russian cooperation would be a piece of ignorant folly . " Frankly , Carr 's book is journalistic in tone , and certain references to history , literature , or philosophy are rather crude . But the thought is cogent and the presentation vigorous . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle treatment . But I know how hopelessly wrong the sophisticates are apt to be . Between the exquisite culture of the French Academy and the avowed " toughness " of Albert Carr I do not hesitate . As La Bruy  --  re said more than two hundred years ago : " If it comes to a choice , je veux " etre peuple " ( I want to be with the people ) . ALBERT GUERARD The Talk of Ezra Pound ccTCANTOS LII-LXXI . By Ezra Pound . New Directions . $2.50 . HERE is no other poetry like the Cantos in English . And there is none quite so simple in form . " So Allen Tate has written and then added of Ezra Pound : " The secret of his form is this : conversation . " To take this view of the Cantos is very valuable , for no other explains so well the power of Pound 's allusions . The formal approach is conversational ; the secret of the form is another matter and as yet hidden in the recesses of Pound 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talk of men and of arms , of men who fought and got the credit for it , and of those who also fought , as desperately and as bravely fought , and got no name for it , the companions of Ulysses who did not hear how sweetly the sirens sang , and for all their pains had only the recollection of ear wax and of pulling at the oars . And they wanted to know what we talked about ? " de Ittteris et de armis , praestanttbut ingentis , Both of ancient times and our man , books , arms , And men of unusual genius Both of ancient times and our own , in short the usual subjects Of conversation between intelligent men " An epic , Pound has said , " is a poem containing history " His poem , which slowly attains the length of an epic , contains a great deal of history  --  not the text of the historians , but only so much of history , of ancient times and our own , as may agreeably enter the conversation of intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter ; only a bore would think of bringing it in . What is best in conversation is the marginal comment , the text itself being taken for granted among the listeners . At most a complete anecdote may be introduced , because it is pertinent , or simply because at the moment it seems amusing ; a singularly happy or telling phrase may be quoted , a document or a translation of a poem brought out and shown ; the rest is all illustration , personal exposition and interpretation  --  and , in Pound 's case , imaginative marginalia . The new Cantos are longer-winded than any that have gone before . Chinese history is sustained as a subject through the first ten Cantos of the present volume ; through the rest the character and career of John Adams are under consideration . All depends here upon allusion ; not to know the text of Pound 's talk is to miss most of the points he is making . The Cantos are not imaginative as they once were . And yet to read them is to hear again the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio back of the courtyard , under the high window that cast no shadow until twilight , with Pound lolling in his home-made armchair , with an air of weariness , like a strong man worn out by the stupidities of the world , his mind unwearied , his soul unbelieving , but still his own . Pound has his own particular hubris , his pride , not lofty like that of Capaneus , to whom he once compared himself , but still unpersuadable , not to be put down . " There 's not a wheel , " he once said to me , " can go low enough to crush me . " Out of his rut he utters his defiance , not against the gods , for there are no longer gods to defy , but against the great of this world , against the powerful who have put " money-lust above the pleasures of the senses . " There was always something about Pound of the sailor returned to tell of the strange sights he had seen , airing as he talked the strange tongues he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair betrayed that it was not from actual seas he had come . The mind was his Mediterranean , whose shores are alive with antiquity , above whose islands the clouds still seem to rise in mythopoeic shapes . There history accumulates and none can quite escape the presence of the pest , which strikes , like light from a wall , at the passer-by Outside , as we talked , was Paris , and that present which has now become a past . That was in the winter of 1922-23 , when I was trying to read the Provencal poets , word by word , with the aid of an incomplete dictionary . And Pound told me how he , as a young man , had pondered over one word whose meaning he could not make out or find anywhere , and how at last someone had told him that there was one man in Europe who would know if anybody did , and how he had set out and The NATION crossed half of Germany to find old Levy , all for that one word . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its place in the Cantos . And I remember one night after dinner , when the Beaune was finished and we had begun on the brandy , that I told Pound the story of the British and the goddamned Portagoose . And that , too , is now in the Cantos , and the word , which was a corruption of soldiers in the last war , has become a permanent part of the Pound vocabulary , so that it now appears , even when it is with the seventeenth-century Chinese that the Portuguese have to do . And the Portagoose king sent an envoy and they cured Kang Hi with wine from the Canaries w'ich putt ' em up a jot higher It is hard to get the point of the spelling in the last line , as it is to understand why John Adams of Braintree should from time to time drop into the drawl of a West which did not exist in his day . It is hard , thatis , when we receive the words from the printed page , and yet it is precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me the unforgettable voice , so determined in the midst of Europe not to lose its native accent that it constantly assumed a speech which might well pass for American among Europeans , but which , to a compatriot 's ear , belonged to no America that ever was . In those lines I hear the talk , impatient and unwearied , polyglot and full of queer quirks , surprising and in the long run consistent , either wonderfully right or preposterously wrong , always generous and always limited . It was limited , no matter who the listener , to what Pound was interested in . I remember once discussing with him , those passages in the " Divine Comedy " which are in themselves so dull that I could only conceive that Dante had brought them in because they in some way contributed to the structure of his poem . " Wa'al , " said Pound , " they may not interest you But I think you can be sure that Dante put nothing into the ' Divine Comedy ' that did not interest him " Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is there that has not at some time interested Pound , and It is probably vain to look for any other reason for its being there . The complexity of the poem is due to the complexity of a contemporary mind ; and so is its incoherence . He has long been interested in Chinese civilization ; he is now , like everybody else , interested in what constitutes good government . His account of China , covering all the dynasties , from the first , which is more or less mythical , down to the Manchus , is constructed so as to set forth Pound 's distinction between good governments and bad . His John Adams is presented as " the clearest head in Congress , " as the man who at certain points made us at certain points saved us by fairness , honesty , and straight moving . Adams is also presented as a man who at certain points was in complete accord with Ezra Pound Pound has recently been credited with being a fascist . It is true that he continues to live in Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , for one , would have expected . But no man can be a consistent admirer of December 21 , 1940 fascism who holds John Adams in admiration . And that Pound cleaky does . Whether he is speaking of Chinese emperors or of Adams and his contemporaries , Pound sees the misuse of money on the part of the governors as the root of most of the evils with which the governed are afflicted . It is not only on the opening page but throughout these Cantos that he pleads for an understanding of the true base of credit , that is , " the abundance of nature/with the whole folk behind it . " Somewhere behind the poet is Major Douglas . How sound Pound 's position may be as an exponent of Social Credit , I can not say ; what can be said is that his concentration on economics has simplified his morality , which was already a little too simple , while his concern with the money-lust of others has caused him , as a poet , to neglect the pleasures of the senses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving up poetry in order to write economics . He has not given up his poetic method In these Cantos the poet has compromised with the economist ; it is a proof of Pound 's superb versatility that the poet comes out as well as he does .
