txt Jay B. Nash , chairman of the Department of Physical Education and Health of New - York University , ends a letter in the Dec. 21 issue of THE NEW YORK TIMES with the warning : " We are setting the sails of our ship of state for many years . Let us be sure that these sails are set to take us in the direction in which we really want to go . " He suggests a goal , but his article implies one horn of a dilemma . The other is suggested by an article I will quote that does not mention compulsory military training but shows why people are flying " banners " around military training . Dr. Nash says " I vigorously object * * to having advocates of military training hide behind the banners of physical fitness , training for citizenship and discipline . " He goes on to hint that such a course will divert power from the State to the Central Government . It would tend to initiate a national youth movement . The example of Germany needs no explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aptly described by Dr. Coleman R. Griffith , Professor of Education at the University of Illinois , in " The Psychological Adjustments of the Returned Service Men and Their Families " : " Vast numbers of our youth were found to be physically unfit for service . This is a defect-in our national life much of which can be easily remedied by better food * * * and stronger programs of physical fitness . " But vast numbers of our youth were also unfit in mental make-up , in attitude , in mood , in emotional balance . They left home without resources sufficient to govern their own conduct . The number of men broken in spirit is greater than the number broken in body . And the facts that have led to so much maiming of mind and spirit can not be changed as readily as those which may be responsible for physical weakness . * " Youth are not thrown on their own resources under conditions that make them responsible for the consequences of what they do . " There is more to this article that comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the street is aware of failure , and today he looks to military training to cure the weakness of home training . Apparently we must be hooked on one horn , or the other of the dilemma , unless we can educate Americans to become home-conscious of the importance of early home training . Home is basic ; school and church are strong as the influence of the home allows them to be . That is obvious as far as church is concerned . Over-Indulged Children Parents have children for the first five of six years , and through control or indulgence shape the way the young twig shall bend . The young tree is already much inclined before the school can work upon it . Today we have a crop of much indulged children , from indulged parents , with little or no concept of useful work habits . They entertain the popular idea that if a teacher is good , there will be no work at all . Many adults subscribe to the same idea also , and we have the result Dr. Griffith has described . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has seen a shadow growing long over the homes of our communities , and if our next generation is not to be in the eclipse of a youth movement , today 's home will alone be to blame . There is a way in which schools may help . Let them install courses in child care and family relationships , with psychological emphasis in the junior and senior years of high school , years when girls are shaping their ideals of womanhood . Let them learn nutrition straight , as a science , not as a scrap book adjunct to a cooking class . Most schools can or will do this only with the backing of parents . Let both home and school teach that there is need of a higher philosophy and a God beyond that of our whims and desires , if we would keep our heads in the present Tower of Babel . In religion we find the unifying element in a chaos of ideas ; and here again the parent may lead the way . Paper is a vital war need . Paper bags in food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit upon a very simple idea to help our Government and myself as well in the matter . I made a roughly sewn cotton bag out of some strong , discarded material . This I fitted into a strong large-size paper bag and fastened both together with common safety pins . Almost daily I use this lined paper bag when marketing anc the paper bag lasts a month or more . The cotton inter-liner will last a couple of years . In this way I save about 250 bags a year and can comfortably carry the bag by hand , not on the arm , as is necessary with a paper bag alone . We are , I think , beginning to get a little perspective on Mr. Churchill in Greece , Italy and Belgium . It is one of the tragedies of a democracy that while it may produce great leaders it can not always follow their leadership in times of crisis . As was the case with Mr. Hull in Algiers , many or most of our professed authorities treat each situation as though it stood alone and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military mind which in time of - war should govern our decisions if we wish to win the war . We were in Africa , as the British are in Greece , for a military purpose and as a part of the whole war . Each liberated country is not to be judged alone , nor is its liberation complete until the war is won . As in Africa , which so far has worked out well , and indeed in Italy , we must first deal with those in a position to aid in the liberation . We must then seek a civil government that is loyal to the war leadership and also , so far as may be possible , representative of the liberated country people ; it should not include men who will use their temporary power for group or personal gain . It is as simple as that , and yet how quick some of our best minds are to confuse it , to embroil ourselves and our allies in quarrels which threaten the safety of all . However necessary as a war measure , economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Treasury has been perked up by substantial revenues from *organized sports , notably from racing , whose " take " has been enormous . The loss will be felt . The ban itself is inflationary , for two reasons in particular . First , it will increase Government borrowing ; secondly , it closes doors to huge non-iaflationary spending . The vast potential purchasing power that flooded through admission gates and betting windows was diverted , in large part , from competitive bidding for wartime goods . We have lost an ally in our fight against inflation , safely assuming that racing fans will not buy war bonds as lavishly as they invested in parimutuel tickets . Increasing our spendable income by putting more people to work , at the same time curtailing non-inflationary outlets , weakens , to that extent , our ability to hold the line . More pressure on price ceilings and a greater impetus to undercover marketing are now probable . The reminder is pertinent that we are fighting not only two distinct , widely separated wars , but two separate , totally different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against an equally dangerous intangible . The more we increase production to destroy our enemy in the field , without draining off or sterilizing excess purchasing power , the more possible it becomes for our ? invisible enemy to destroy us . Banning sports is merely a transfer of emphasis ; it helps to solve one problem by intensifying another . The general ban is at the expense of Federal income and civilian morale , with possible repercussions on our financial stability . As one of the many thousands of mothers who are waiting in anguish to hear from their sons on the western front , I can not understand the complaining of those who resent the most trivial sacrifices asked of civilians . It is easy to see their thoughts are not with out fighting men , but on their own insignificant selves . Why ca n't they eat oleomargarine when butter is short , and why ca n't they make a practice of getting along as much as possible on unrationed food ? I was left with many voided coupons ; but I look upon that as a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making . I was startled by the letter of Anita De Mars when she suggested using German prisoners ' blood plasma for our wounded American men . Please , anything but that ! We women will hurry to the nearest station to donate all the blood that is needed . Good pure blood , full of the clean corpuscles of love , charity and kindness , but never must we permit our menfolk to be injected with the fiendish and ruthless blood of the enemy . Spare them that humiliation .
