txt The establishment of an international agency to . regulate world air transport after the war will be the prime purpose of the three-power aviation conference soon to open in Washington between American , British , and Canadian officials , it was learned today . Advance agreement already has been reached on the desirability of creating . an international air-transport authority . It was announced in London that an agreement has been reached between Great Britain and the British Dominions as a first step toward broader international - accord on postwar civil aviation . The basis of the Empire arrangement is that each nation have control of its own domestic airways and that sovereignty of the air over each country remain with that country except insofar as it consents by international agreement to limitation of its sovereignty . The extent of the powers which shoUld be invested in the proposed new agency is the only main pointof issue between trie three countries , and at present , at least , it appears that Britain and Canada are disposed to give it larger authority than the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? The right of transit . 2 ? Competitive practices and rates , the standardization of communication and navigation aids , the use of airports and facilities . 3 ? The setting up of an International Civil Aviation Commission and the definition of its functions . : Washington is not formally committed to these proposals but enumerates them in the outline of its prepared agenda for the conference . British officials would have the " International Air Transport Authority , " as they name the projected agency , go much farther . Beyond control of safety regulations , licensing of aircraft and personnel , standarization of communications and meteorological facilities , etc. , they specifically recommend that the " Authority " : " Provide for the elimination of uneconomic competition by the regulation of frequencies of services and rates in relation to speeds and standards of passenger accommodations . Subsidies should be kept in reasonable bounds . " One American reaction to this proposal came today from Wayne W. Parrish , Editor and Publisher of American Aviation , who said : " It is quite clear that the trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elaborate international regulatory organization . It has been pointed out in Washington that the British have never desired control of shipping , but since they are substantially behind in their aircraft equipment program , they may feel that they can not compete in the air on a free and open basis , hence the desire for restrictions and equitable operations among the various nations . " Both the British and U. S. agendas envisage a full scale international conference on aviation . The Canadian document , on the other hand , is not an agenda in the full sense of the word inasmuch as it is a definite proposal  --  although " tentative and preliminary " ? for the formation of the International Air Transport Authority . As submitted to Washington officials last January , the proposal was 23 pages long . It set forth the purpose of the Authority as being : " 1 . To make the most effective contribution to the establishment and maintenance of a permanent system of general security . " 2 . To meet the needs of the peoples of the world for efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , so far as possible , international air routes and services are divided fairly and equitably between the various member states . " The Authority , as outlined by Canada , would consist of an Assembly , an International Air Transport Board , and Regional Air Transport Councils . The Assembly would be composed of representatives of all ratifying member nations , each being entitled to from one to six votes . The Assembly would elect the International air transport Board and also elect the President of the Board who would serve for six years . The Board would be a permanent body composed of 12 members and a President who would have a vote . Each Board member would serve six years , with two retiring annually . The Board would set up a series of Regional Air Transport Councils and would define the area of each Council . These Councils would consist of from six to nine members , one-third appointed by the Board and hold office at the pleasure of the Board . Other members would be appointed by member States in the areas supervised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air service within their regions , have jurisdiction over schedules and the number of trips which the airlines of any member state might make . Above the Councils in power would be the Board , which would have the decision on routes falling within the territories of two or more Regional Councils . In order to put the International Air Transport Authority into effect , Canada suggests that countries now operating international routes discontinue them within two years unless licensed by the Authority . One hitch in the Canadian proposal from the Birtish point of view is that the Authority quite definitely would not have any jurisdiction over service between two neighboring states , although such states could place their air , services under the Authority if they chose . The British see this as perhaps akin to Canada 's having her cake and eating it , too  --  regulating air ' service all over the world , while excluding others from regulating her service with one of her best friends and biggest neighbors , the United States              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
