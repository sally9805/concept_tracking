Once a week , as a respite from soap operas , NBC offers U. S. womankind a program known as Luncheon at the Waldorf . Broadcast from the Empire Room of Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria , the show is aimed at matrons with better-than-average bankrolls , is as sedulously shallow as a column by Lucius Beebe . Clearly responsible for the tenor of the Luncheon is Actress Ilka Chase , who not only serves as aerial hostess but writes the scripts as well . Last week before a free-feeding audience of 50 , Luncheon at the Waldorf was fluttering smartly through its third 13-week period on the air under the sponsorship of Camel Cigarettes . <P> Hostess Chase 's scripts are full of chitsy-chatsy on what the smart little child will wear , how to get along as a weekend guest , the importance of wearing hats that please men . Included in the verbal menu is a resume of Miss Chase 's gay activities since she was last on the air-luncheon with Lady Mendl ( Elsie de Wolf ) , cocktails with Cond Nast , dinner with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant doings , Miss Chase brightens her Luncheons by interviewing a couple of guests of honor . She has gaily discussed man 's reversion to the ape with Harvard 's Earnest Albert Hooton , the worries &; woes of picture-making with Walter Wanger , the business of editing fashion magazines with her mother , Mrs. Edna Woolman Chase , editor of Vogue . She is fond of titillating her listeners with attacks on too too noble women , descriptions of summer romances gone sour because " in the flush of the rush he may have neglected to tell you of his wife . " <P> Luncheon at the Waldorf was thought up by Miss Chase 's husband , William Murray , radio director of the William Morris ( theatrical ) Agency , originally had a hard time getting on the air because sponsors considered it too bright for day time audiences . Now it moves along so briskly that sponsors are thinking of letting the general public gape while the Luncheons are in progress . Only outsiders permitted to join the pressmen and sponsors ' pals who now attend the Luncheons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On no such stock was one of the letters Miss Chase received from a Midwest housewife , who wrote : " You and your mother must both reek of cigarette smoke . Such carryings on ! "
