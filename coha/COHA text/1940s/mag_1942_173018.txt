The news was too magnificent . The British held in Libya , the Russians held , and now the U.S. had held , by smashing the Japs at Midway . And there was more to it than just holding : the British were beginning carefully and thoroughly to do their job of destroying Germany from the air . <P> All over the U.S. the optimism which the Administration had first inspired , and bad then hastily quenched , bubbled back again . The reason was simple ; there simply was no important bad news , except submarine sinkings on the East Coast-which , although very serious indeed , were something the public had got used to . <P> Hope &; Merriment . Throughout the land the belief was strong now that the war was not only being won but would end soon . In Texas , naturally , the biggest-sized rumors sprang up : that Washington believed the war would be over in six months ; that auto dealers had been told to hold on to their dead business for a few more months , because the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped expanding war plants was that the U.S. did not need any more to whip the Axis . <P> Meanwhile to New York 's Belmont race track went the alltime greatest crowds . the carriage trade , lush with furs and brilliant with jewels ; fashion models , dressed carefully to provoke envy in the thousands who came in merely their best clothes ( see p. 63 ) . It was all very much like the race meet at Auteuil , in the suburbs of Paris , in the spring of 1940 , when Parisian couturiers worried about the proper cut and color for gas-mask containers . Shut Out whipped Alsab in the famed Belmont Stakes , and Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews , Commandant of the entire Eastern Sea Frontier , came graciously to the microphone to make a neat little speech , in which he promised that the U.S. Fleet in the Pacific would win as Shut Out had just done . The thousands gave him a rolling cheer ; a railbird shouted ' Atta boy , Admiral ! " <P> Death &; Poverty . But the fact was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment out on the Pacific the Jap and U.S. Fleets were smashing at each other in a death lock ; squadrons of the finest young American men were taking off carrier decks and off land bases , many never to come back . <P> And in Washington responsible men knew that civilians too would soon have to face a new unpleasant aspect of war . When it comes , it is true that no one will starve . Practically no one will be unemployed . The great majority of people will find far more money in their pay envelopes than they ever found before . But for all practical purposes there will be a major depression . For the comforts of life will go glimmering , and most necessities will be as hard or perhaps harder to get than in 1932 . <P> Having been the richest people on earth , the citizens of the U.S. have long had more goods about their homes and shops and warehouses than any other people . But less &; less civilian goods are being manufactured . Soon there will not even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time will come in a matter of months , not years , for many kinds of goods wear out in a few months . So far the U.S. public 's war sacrifice has consisted of living on its economic fat . The next sacrifice will be to live without fat-to fight a war and a new kind of depression at the same time- as Britain and Germany and China and Japan have been doing for years .
