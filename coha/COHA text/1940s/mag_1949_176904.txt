Near a sandy beach in the Concepcion suburb of San Vicente , Chilean and U.S. engineers and technicians were working last week to make a 20-year-old Chilean dream come true . Two years ago , San Vicente had been a peaceful fishing village sought out by tourists for its seascapes and broad vistas of green forest stretching to the banks of Chile 's largest river , the Bio-Bio . <P> Now , where fishermen 's cottages had stood , workmen were building the blast furnace and rolling mills of Huachipato , the No. 2 steel plant in Latin America ( No. 1 : Brazil 's Volta Redonda ) . Where fishermen had spread their nets to dry , there was an 890-ft. dock . Modern brick houses for 4,000 workers were springing up in a planned industrial city which Chileans proudly compared to Oak Ridge . <P> Cats &; Rats . A project of the Chilean government 's Corporacin de Fomento de la Produccin ( Development Corporation ) , Huachipato will be the west coast 's first completely integrated steel plant . Under construction since early 1947 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans totaling $48 million , by stock sales to Fomento and private Chilean interests , and by credits from U.S. firms ( e.g. , Pittsburgh 's Koppers Co. , Inc. ) , which are supplying equipment and technical know-how . <P> Chile 's mountain riches will supply the raw materials : ore from Bethlehem 's El Tofo mines , 500 miles up the coast ; coal from the undersea veins of nearby Lota ; power from Fomento 's hydroelectric plant at neighboring El Abnico . Only limestone has been a problem . To get it , a crew of 130 men , with rat-hungry cats , is now setting up installations on rainy , rat-infested Madre de Dios Island , 900 miles down the coast . <P> A Shot in the Arm . Huachipato 's pig-iron capacity of 205,000 metric tons makes it only half as big as Volta Redonda , and tiny by Pittsburgh standards . But the 235,000 tons of steel it is expected to turn out each year when full production is reached will make Chile virtually self-sufficient in steel . <P> Besides giving impetus to new mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $15 million a year in foreign exchange formerly spent on steel in the U.S. Said Huachipato 's General Manager Desiderio Garcia : " This is the beginning of Chile 's real industrial revolution .
