Death 's final cadence this week closed the long career of a frail , wispy-haired Pole , the greatest pianist of his time , and one of the three greatest who ever lived . Patriot , man of affairs , bon vivant , philanthropist , Ignace Jan Paderewski had not played publicly since Poland fell . ' " I simply could not stand it , " he said . <P> But to the last he had labored for his beloved Poland . Poland 's Premier after World War I , he was now the figurehead President of its parliament in exile . On his 80th birthday , last November , he arrived in the U.S. from his villa in Switzerland . Since then , Paderewski spent himself making public appeals for money for starving Poles . Last week , ill of a cold , against his doctor 's orders he made one more appearance in New Jersey . As a result he contracted pneumonia and two days later , in his Manhattan hotel , he died . At the suggestion of President Roosevelt , he will be honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transferred to a peaceful Poland . <P> Fifty years ago Paderewski made his U.S. debut , a glamorous figure with a red-gold mane which excited the Pre-Raphaelite painters of the day . Red-blooded males snorted at " this Paderooski , " but everywhere he drew adoring throngs , from whom policemen sometimes had to rescue him . <P> He traveled up &; down the land in a private railroad car , with an entourage to look after him , a cook to provide dishes to his gourmet 's taste . Altogether he earned an estimated $5,000,000 in the U.S. alone . <P> Once he commanded $5,000 for two numbers at William Waldorf Astor 's home in London . But Paderewski gave his money away lavishly-$2,700,000 to Poland during World War I. <P> For five years ( 1917-22 ) , because of that war , he did not play , " in case the old habit comes back and demands my time . " Paderewski put Poland back on the map at the Versailles conference , and Clemenceau told him : " So now you are the Premier . <P> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was a pushover for hard-boiled Marshal Pilsudski . Embittered , Paderewski resigned in 1919 . <P> Like the best-beloved of fiddlers , Fritz Kreisler , the best-beloved of pianists hated the radio . A Paderewski recital was something to see as well as hear . Even when he was past his prime , showering wrong notes in capricious rhythms , he sat , leonine and imperious , flailed and rippled at the keyboard with his stubby $50,000 fingers . He was lavish with encores , modulating continuously from one piece into the next , sometimes for as long as an hour . <P> Said Paderewski : " When I miss practice one day , I know it ; when I miss two days , my wife knows it ; when I miss three days , the public knows it . " When Paderewski practiced , he had no peer , and only the late , mighty Liszt and Rubinstein ever equaled him at a piano .
