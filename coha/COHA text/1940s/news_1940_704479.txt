txt Our Capital Growing Wary Denial of Brazil 's Bid for Steel Plant Viewed as an Indication To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Effect is treading swiftly , inexorably and damagingly upon the heels of cause , in connection with the confiscations of the property of American investment-developers in Mexico and Bolivia . A recent example may well provide the government of Brazil , in fact all South American governments , and our Departments of State and Commerce , with food for serious and bitter meditation . Publication has just been made of the facts . As a by-product of the barter-trade flirtations with the Nazis , indulged in ? with small gain , if not direct loss to them ? by Brazil and some of the other South American States , Brazil was stirred to constructive enthusiasm by the possibilities , as exposed to them by the Germans . of developing a large-scale national steel industry . Decision was made that it was feasible to set up works comparable in size , output and diversity of products to the huge Skoda munitions plant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in steel but would be able to purvey it to all South America . American Company Shy Despite the opposition of the Brazilian Army heads , who were keen to have Brazil commit itself to a bizarre proposition from Hitler that the Skoda works be transferred to Brazil , the Brazilian President and his Foreign Minister concluded that if a steel industry was to be set up , it should and could be done only in cooperation with Americans and American capital . Quoting from press accounts of the affair , it was arranged for one of the great American steel companies to " send experts to Brazil , study the ore deposits ( in the State of Minas-Geraesl , plan for a railroad and dock facilities to the sea . The experts brought back a glowing report . All Brazil began to prepare for the new American steel mill . " But the American company 's finance committee " decided not to build the plant and not to cooperate with Brazil . * * * So the State Department is conversing with other steel companies . hoping to persuade their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative decision might have operated to a minor extent , the major consideration that shaped it unquestionably must have been supplied by the treatment to which American investment property rights have been subjected by Mexico and Bolivia . Coupled , of course , with these other controlling and correlative factors : Failure of the United States Government to bring the rulers of these countries to a realization and fulfillment of their responsibilities to foreign interests , under international law , and to cause them to undo the wrongs they have inflicted upon our national rights and the rights of our individual nationals . Also the neglect of Brazil or any other Latin-American country to decry the confiscatory policy and program of Mexico and Bolivia and publicly and officially to pledge themselves as harboring no covert design to follow that lead . Action Deemed Wise The declination of the American steel company to risk no money in Brazil seems to have been wise , and in pursuance of ordinary business . prudence . To have done otherwise , in face of the circumstances , would have been folly . Brazilian authorities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of our Department of State , will be dense , indeed , if they fail to heed the implications of this blow to the economy of Brazil and to the chances of American investors responding to the appeals that are going out from most of the countries of the Southern Hemisphere to risk their money there . The stark truth of it is they are afraid to . The sword of arbitrary , illegal and unchecked confiscation having fallen so heavily and inexorably upon American property in Mexico and Bolivia , and depending over it so menacingly throughout South America , the difficulty under which Latin-American economy in general is laboring will not soon be mitigated by injections of the elixir of investment life from the United States . ROBERT HAMMOND HURRAY . New York , Jan. 30 , 1940 . Finland 's Debt Payments To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recent statistics given on this  --  page of the slow progress made by Finland in liquidating its 1923 debt to the United States ? an inevitable consequence of the terms of interest  --  have brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay in full . If this splendid people continues , as invariably in the past , to meet its obligation , payment will require forty-four more years , ending in 1984 . By that time on a funded debt of $9,000,000 they will have paid us a total of $21,695,055 , of which $12,695,055 will represent interest . Thus far Finland has remitted nearly $5,000,000 in interest on its debt of $9,000,000 and still owes more than $8,000,000 . A. K. Washington , Jan. 30 , 1940 .. Auto Horn Technique Condemned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I believe an ordinance forbids the use of automobile horns except in ease of danger , and such a rule is certainly reasonable . But is there any danger to a parked car waiting for passengers to emerge from an adjacent building ? This situation , where the person behind the wheel is too indolent to move from the automobile in making a personal call , is responsible for much of the noise made by modern horns . The practice seems to be particularly . popular at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic lights , especially in congested neighborhoods . Here the motorist solves the blind intersection problem with his horn . Loud blasts precede his full speed arrival at the crossing . It is a remarkable technique . Barring children in the street , and so long as two drivers do not use it simultaneously at right angles , it works almost as well as brakes and the old-fashioned courtesy of slowing down . Each year the manufacturers produce louder horns . If the police continue oblivious to the situation and to the law , the deaf will be envied . Q. D. New York , Jan. 30 , 1940 . A Spa in Our Own Back Yard Lebanon Springs Is Suggested as Resort for Infantile Paralytics To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now that every one is thinking and talking about infantile paralysis and helping the foundation with its march of dimes , the time seems ripe to call attention to the fact that New York State itself has a warm spring only 150 miles from the center of New York City , easily accessible by parkway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center for the hundreds of stricken children . This once famous spring , located on the south side of a mountain in the Berkshires , flows 500 gallons a minute at a constant temperature of 73 degrees Fahrenheit . Could there be a finer combination ? Throughout the nineteenth century Lebanon Springs was a very famous spa , and well-known people from all over the world traveled there to drink the water , to bathe in it and to find in it renewed health and vigor , but , alas ! now that the once famous Columbia Hall has been torn down , the crowds of healthseekers journey thousands of miles to other spas and only a few of the faithful ones continue to renew their health at Lebanon . Each Summer when I go there I look at the foundations of the old hotel , built on two sides of a square around the spring , and at the overflow roaring down the mountainside , wasted , and when I think of the comparatively few thousands of dollars it would take to reclaim this garden spot and build a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools for hydrotherapy and a covered pool for Winter , it makes me wonder why New Yorkers send their money so far afield when they have this perfect set-up right at hand  --  practically in their own back yards . At one time , while President Roosevelt was Governor of New York State , he was very much interested in building a State hospital for children at Lebanon Springs , but politics evidently entered into that dream and killed it , for the little backwater town of Lebanon , with its handful of voters , turned out to be Republican , and that was that . But now , while the dimes are marching , why do n't New Yorkers insist that the National Paralysis Foundation look into this natural health center and divert a few of the millions of dimes that way ?

Income-Tax Questions To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Before the New York State incometax returns are due it might be well to inquire concerning the validity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the bottom of Page 2 , Form 201 , there are three questions the taxpayer is informed must be answered : " Did the Federal Bureau increase your tax for 1937 , or 1938 ; how much and why ? " It is time to strike against any such inquisition . The Federal return is supposed to be inviolate , and I see no more reason to notify the State as to any part of my Federal return than to notify any other person . If the State relies on the Federal Government to do its checking for it , I am not compelled to assist , whether it be to my advantage or detriment . Some years ago there was a " pink slip " strike , and the State gave up its snooping into private matters . This is another opportunity for a strike . I shall ignore the impertinent questions . Who " else will ? TAXPAYER . New York , Jan. 27 , 1940 . Workmen 's Circle Membership To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a recent issue of THE NEW Yoax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grand Master of the Independent Order B'rith Abraham , carried the information that the I. 0 . B. A. is the largest Jewish fraternal order in the United States . According to statistics , the largest Jewish fraternal order in the United States is the Workmen 's Circle . It has a membership of 72,000 distributed among 650 branches and is being constantly increased . I am sure that research would reveal that the Workmen 's Circle is not only the largest in point of membership but also in point of benefits and facilities ' for its members . It has a large sanatorium for tubercular patients in Liberty , N. Y. , and an up-to-date adult and children 's camp in Pawling , N. Y. It owns some of the finest cemetery ground in the country .
