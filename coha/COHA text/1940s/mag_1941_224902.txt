Kiss the Boys Goodbye ( Paramount ) left Broadway in the form of a satiric comedy devoted to the triumph of an egomaniacal Southern belle over a house-partyful of intellectual Yankee drunkards . It emerges from the Hollywood wringer in the guise of a musicomedy burlesque of professional Southernism . <P> Cindy Lou Bethany of Authoress Clare Boothe 's play was a syrupy Southern blue blood who went to a Connecticut house-party with a Hollywood director to meet a Hollywood producer and salt away the screen role of Velvet O'Toole , the Confederate heroine of the national best-seller Kiss the Boys Goodbye . Paramount 's Cindy Lou ( Mary Martin ) is an out-of-work Broadway chorine who scurries to her ancestral Southern home after learning that a Broadway director ( night-blooming Don Ameche ) is Dixie-bound to scour the South for a sure-nuf Southern belle to play the lead in a Broadway musicomedy . She gets the job after butting into a swimming pool a rival actress with a very high cruising speed . <P> These high jinks pan out into an acceptable and amusing musicomedy . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart Belongs to Daddy manner . She also carries the ball around the Hays office right end with a song about how she got her start , which permits her to repeat her strip tease that first lit the domes of Broadway 's Bald-Head Row in 1938 . Connie Boswell and Rochester ( Eddie Anderson , Jack Benny 's valet ) run first-rate interference for her with a punchy song &-dance; number called Sand in My Shoes . <P> Typical gag from the Harry Tugend-Dwight Taylor script : a songwriter ( Oscar Levant ) trying to converse with Cindy Lou 's fire-eating aunt ( Elizabeth Patterson ) in the midst of her relics of the Confederacy : " My mother had a lot of General Grant 's things in her home . " She : " Bottles , I presume ! "
