Out of her Rolls Royce popped a peppery dowager . She crossed the sidewalk to the sedate five:story pile , a block from Government House in Buenos Aires . Two policemen , instead of the usual two liveried flunkeys , stood in the high-arched doorway . Head high , shoulders back , Dona Zelmira Paz de Anchorena turned , walked stiffly back to her limousine . She had come to see with her own eyes what she and many another Argentine had believed impossible : La Prensa , one of the world 's great newspapers , had been forced to close for the first time in its 74 years . <P> The incredible happened last week by personally signed decree of President Edelmiro Farrell . His high-handed Government , had long sought an excuse to suppress Dona Zelmira 's paper , * had found a flimsy one : that an editorial criticizing proposed economies of Government-run municipal hospitals had failed to confine itself to " constructive criticism " ( a decreed requirement of the press ) . <P> Five days later La Prensa 's Director Alberto Gainza Paz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the Government 's price for lifting the suspension : it printed the Farrell regime 's defense of its economies ( one item : rats had been exterminated , thus saving the cost of feeding them to prevent their nibbling at hospital records ) . <P> Meanwhile the Army-ruled Federal Commissioner in Entre Rios , taking his cue from the Big Boss in B.A. , forbade provincial newspapers-at cost of permanent suppression-to make any mention whatsoever of such dangerous subjects as the Constitution , freedom or religion . <P> * Few Argentines know that she is co-owner , with her ailing , 73-year-old brother , Don Ezequiel Pedro Paz .
