txt A general legislative overhaul of the Administration 's farm program has been charted by the Department of Agriculture The department wants authority to promote exports by going into world markets and barter ing agricultural products for non-competitive commodities of foreign countries . It proposes to continue this year 's 85% of parity loans on the five basic commodities ? cotton , wheat , cctrn , tobacco and rice  --  through 1844 or until the effd of the present emergency whichever is longer . It would tighten up the marketing quota restrictions so that the minimum allotment for wheat could be 50 million instead of the 55 million acres in existing law and the minimum acreage allotment of cotton could be cut on it prorata basis until production dropped to 30 million bales by 1945 . Would Provide Full Parity Return It would take the " if " out of parity funds by authorizing yearly appropriations sufficient . when added to farm prices , to provide a full parity return to those producers of the basic commodities who cooperate in the adjustment program . Such supplements to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp and rehabilitation loans and grants to farm tenants would be made permanent . These are the outstanding features of a new farm bill " to promote the national defense and security " which the department has prepared and is circulating among members of Congress from agricultural districts and among farm organizations . The bill was prepared with the idea that it would be introduced and acted upon at this session of Congress . Department officials , however , are afraid their plans may be sidetracked . They fear that the , large farm bloc in Congress . pretty well worked up over the threat of a Presidentia. veto of the bill freezing government owned stocks of cotton and wheat . may revolt and decide to write its own ticket Vtickard Favors Freezing Bill Veto Secretary of Agriculture Wickard , barring an eleventh hour change in plans , will recommend that President Roosevelt veto the cotton and wheat freezing bill . This measure also would permit farmers with wheat produced on acreage outside of their AAA allotments to feed this grain to livestock and poultry without paying the penalty tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pried up the lid on the price control bill by forcing in a section that ceilings on agricultural commodities can not be less than 110,4 ' of parity , threaten to put a rider in the price bill to prohibit the government from selling its cotton and wheat . ? I The Department of Agriculture is still hopeful . however , that its new bill can be used to weaken this threat All present indications are . nevertheless , that concessions leading to higher prices will have to be made As the law now stands , the 85% of parity loan program , put through by the farm bloc this year over the protest of the Administration , will expire at the end of the year . Seeks to Avoid Trouble Next Year By continuing it now , the department thinks it can avoid trouble next year ? an of year election season . Unless the program is continued this year , the department is afraid the 85% of parity will grow to 90% or 100% next spring when the farm members are trying hard to impress their constituents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Agriculture and the State Department . it is in direct conflict with the policy the State Department has followed in its trade agreements . Cotton has been traded for British rubber , but this was done by special act of Congress . The change proposed in the authority for parity appropriations is. in effect , a liberalizaand may open the door to larger farm program expenditures . As the law now stands , parity payments are made " if and when " appropriations are provided . Under the bill , appropriations sufficient , when added to farm prices , to bring the return to farmers to parity would be made in order , specifically . Under its present powers , the farm administrators can not cut the wheat acreage allotment below 55 million acres . This bill would reduce this floor by 5 million acres , making the minimum permissible 50 million acres . The cotton allotment system would be changed so that it would aim at output equal to the domestic and export demand instead of an amount equal to a " normal supply . " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
