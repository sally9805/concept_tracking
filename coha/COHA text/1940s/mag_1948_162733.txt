For the past nine years , every time Columbia recorded a major work , it made two master records , salted one secretly away for LP ( Long Playing ) day . Last week , LP day arrived . <P> In a Waldorf-Astoria suite , music critics gaped eagerly at Columbia 's new LP Microgroove record-which might soon make present record changers obsolete . By tripling the number of grooves on a record ( from approximately 100 to 300 to the inch ) and by cutting turntable speed more than half ( from 78 to 33 ? - r.p.m . ) , Columbia had produced a record that would play 45 minutes , include an entire symphony or concerto on one record . Columbia had a first batch of 101 Vinylite records ready ( at $4.85 for a 12-inch classical and $2.85 for a 10-inch popular record with six to eight pieces on it ) . <P> The catch : present phonographs would need a new attachment to play records at the new speed as well as the old . Philco and Columbia were both ready to provide it-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Columbia will still turn out standard records .
