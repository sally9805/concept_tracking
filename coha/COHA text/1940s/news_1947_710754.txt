txt THE 16-NATION PLAN In outlining the policy for the rebuilding of a war-shattered Europe which has since come to be known as the Marshall Plan , in his now historic speech at Cambridge last June 5 , the American Secretary of State summed up the essence of the proposal in these words . Our policy is not directed against any country or doctrine , but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social " conditions in which free institutions can exist . Such assistance I am convinced must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop . * * * The initiative , I think , must come from Europe . * * The program should be a joint one , agreed to by a number , if not all , the European nations . Broadly speaking , this plan for implementing the Truman Doctrine rested basically on the twin principles of self-aid and mutual aid . European nations accepting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation . This called for a pooling of resources , breaking down ' economic barriers and determining their needs on a continent-wide basis . Next they were to draw up a program outlining the aid required from America . The United States would then examine the proposals in the light of its own resources . Finally , Congress would decide how much this country could supply and how best it could - be given . Efforts to obtain agreement among the principal three countries of Europe , for the time being at least , failed when Foreign Minister Molotov pulled out of the Big Three Conference called for that purpose on July ** when Britain 's Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin and French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault jointly invited the governments of twenty-two European countries to meet inParis for the purpose of charting a coordinated plan for European reconstruction , sixteen nations accepted . The result was the creation of the Paris Cooperation Committee , under the chairmanship of Mr. Bevin . The committee got do'vn to work on July 12 . Yesterday it announced the results of its labors . The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their dependent territories and western Germany with the American continent for the four years 1948-1951 , will come to 322,400.000,000 , of which roughly $16.000,000,000 would be vis-avis the United States . If imports of certain categories of equipment were financed by loans from the International Bank and by other credit operations , the over-all deficit for the American continent remaining to be dealt with would be reduced from $22,400 , - 000,000 to $19,300,000,000 . But while the subject of the " costs " of the Marshall Plan has been a continuing topic of discussion here since the latter was first broached , not until now have the American people had an opportunity to look at the other side of the ledger  --  that side setting forth concretely what the Plan means in terms of Europe 's cooperation and production and reconstruction . We believe that these will constitute a genuinely thrilling revelation to those who had been thinking of this under waiting operation as simply so much more stop-gap financial aid to Europe . Pointing out that the purpose of the report is " to formulate an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting Europe on its feet by the end of 1951 , " the signatories lay down four " lines of action . " These are : ( 1 ) A strong production effort by each of the participating countries ; ( 2 ) the creation of internal financial stability ; ( 3 ) the maximum cooperation between the participating countries , and ( 4 ) a solution of the problem of the participating countries ' trading deficits with the American continent , particularly by exports . What do these policies mean in physical terms of Europe 's - rehabilitation ? On the basis of the reports of technical subcommittees , set up to study the situations in agriculture , fuel and power , steel , timber and transport , the committee reports that they are designed to achieve , among others , these " targets " by 1951 : Restoration of prewail bread and grain production ; increases over the pre-war level in sugar , potatoes and oils and fats ; coal production 30 million tons higher than in the last pre-war year ; an expansion of electricity generating capacity to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to two and one-half times the 1938 level ; a rise in crude steel production ' to 55 million tons , or 10 million tons higher than the pre-war figure , and an expansion of inland transport facilities to the point where they can carry a 25 per cent greater load than in 1938 . One observation in the report is calculated to visualize this effort in terms understandable to all Americans . " These production programs on a whole , " states the report , " represent an expansion of output similar in general scale to that achieved by the United States in the ( wartime ) mobilization years 1940-1944 . " These production results would not be achieved solely by the self-help activities of individual nations . They contemplate , in addition , a maximization of nooperative effort . Apart from mutual help designed to increase supplies of scarce commodities and to expedite the flow of trade among the sixteen nations , they assume concerted action on numerous special projects , such as the joint development of resources cutting across frontiers , standardization of utilities and the interchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with the first blueprint thus far available of the economically strong and united Western Europe toward which the Marshall Plan looks . It is a prospectus which warrants the careful consideration of every American who regards world peace and security as transcendentally the - most important investment of our time .
