On the boss 's 57th birthday , the mighty House of Bemberg was raided . In Buenos Aires last week , over the protests of Otto Bemberg , Argentine federal police ransacked the vaults , carted off records , securities , correspondence , bars of gold and sacks of coin from the Crdito Industrial y Comercial , banking center of the Bemberg empire . Later they frisked other Bemberg strongholds in Buenos Aires . <P> The seizure shook Argentina , for the Bembergs are the richest family in the country , one of the richest in the world . Otto Bemberg came from Germany in 1868 . His son , Otto Sebastian , made big money in brewing , banking and real estate . Retiring to Paris , he directed his ever-growing Argentine affairs from an inconspicuous office on Boulevard St. Germain . When he died in Monte Carlo at 75 , he left four sons to increase the family fortune . Two of them , Otto and Federico , stuck to the job . Argentine society boasts of its rock-bound exclusiveness , but the Bembergs married aristocratically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Circulo de Armas , they blossomed ornately in prewar Paris , where their salons were famous for social glitter . <P> With beer as the original source of its fortune , the House of Bemberg acquired a near-monopoly of brewing in Argentina , then branched into public utilities , cotton , dairy products , wool and yerba mate ( Paraguay tea ) . Sum total of the family fortune was anyone 's guess , for the Bembergs kept their mouths shut . Hostile estimates ran as high as a billion dollars . <P> Even if the Bembergs should lose all their Argentine holdings , they would not starve . The family has enormous investments abroad . In the U.S. the Bemberg holdings include a sizable share in the Liebmann Breweries of Brooklyn ( Rheingold beer ) . According to one of its responsible officers , American Bemberg Corp . ( rayon ) has no connection with the Argentine Bembergs.
