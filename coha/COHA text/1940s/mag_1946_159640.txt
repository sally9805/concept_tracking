The mighty roar from 100,000 unparched throats dribbled off into silence . In the Churchill Downs jockey room skinny , Brooklyn-born Warren Mehrtens sponged the dirt off his face . Said he : " I knew I had ' em all at the head of the stretch-and oh , what a wonderful feeling . " <P> From the start of last week 's Kentucky Derby , 26-year-old Jockey Mehrtens suspected he had quite a horse under him . For seven furlongs he sat tensely tight-then he began laying the whip into chestnut , Texas-born Assault . An 8-1 white hope whose home base is the 900 , - ooo- acre King Ranch of Texan Robert <P> Kleberg , Assault bolted through on the inside to take command . In the excitement of riding his first Derby , Mehrtens forgot to stop whipping . Assault flashed under the wire all by himself , an eight-length winner of the richest Derby ever ( first-place money : $96,400 ) . <P> Front-running Spy Song and stretch-driving Hampden were closest . Elizabeth Arden Graham 's even-money entry finished out of the money . Knockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with usually shrewd Eddie Arcaro up , twice ran into pockets on the backstretch . This week 's $100,000 Preakness at Baltimore would tell whether Assault was really that good .
