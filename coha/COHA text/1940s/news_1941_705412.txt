txt Present and prospective freight traffic promises the railroads their best earnings in more than a decade during the first six months of 1941 . January produced the best net railway operating income for any comparable month since 1929 . This net operating income enabled a number of roads to cover all fixed charges and taxes for the month and left an estimated net income of about $20 million for the whole industry . ( Usually a number of roads , particularly those serving the Southwest . report deficits during the first four months of a year . ) While February earnings , both gross and net operating income , probably fell below January , due to the shorter working month and the holidays , the carriers as a group likely had a net operating income of some $45 million and a net income of around $5 million . Net operating income in January amounted to $62.357.404 . It was only $32,617,743 in February , 1940 . Further Gains Seen for March March , which has 26 working days , should see further improvement over the two preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will be higher than in the earlier periods . A large part of the gain in gross revenues this month undoubtedly will carry through to net operating income and to net income . The railroads have expenses under control , although no slackening in the pace of maintenance , particularly of equipment , has as yet appeared and is not likely to appear in the coming months . As a group , the railroads now seem able to cover their fixed charges and taxes with weekly revenue freight carloadings of around 700,000 cars . Loadings in the next 16 or 20 weeks , except for holiday periods , should not fall below thin total . Factors Pointing to Upturn They are more likely to expand , because of the follow ing facto 's : 1 . Some stocking of bituminous coal should occur before the end of March because the soft coal wage agreement expires on April 1 . Also , coal shipments will be accelerated when the Great Lakes open to navigation and lake cargo coal begins to move . 2 . Iron ore will start moving with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after April 15 , although some times ice has delayed shipments until as late as May 1 . Because of the high rate of operations , the steel industry this year probably will require one of the heaviest shipments of iron ore on record . 3 Proposals to move wheat and cotton now stored at interior points to the seaports . This would give the railroads an off-season movement prior to the winter wheat harvest in June and July and cotton-picking time somewhat later . 4 . Shipment of manufactured products should show further improvement as the capacity of existing plants is stepped up and new plants come into production . ( These shipments yield a high revenue per car . ) Open Winter Reduces Operating Costs So tar this winter the railroads have been aided by open weather . This has helped to keep transportation costs down . Certain individual roads , some despite larger tonnages than a year ago . have been axle to show cuts in transportation expense . The latter is made up principally of wages for train crews and fuel costs . The open winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the comparatively warmer weather Las necessitated the use of switch heaters less than usual . In addition . double-heading of trains and loss of steam brought about by intensely cold weather did not occur . The longer-term factors which have enabled the roads to reduce expenses substantially under those of the late 1920s and early 1930s are the improvements in equipment , both freight cars and motive power . Freight cars have been made lighter , yet carry greater tonnages than before , increasing the revenue per car . The efficiency of motive power has progressed tremendously in recent years in steam power and now the western railroads are beginning to purchase road Diesel electric locomotives for freight service . Passenger revenues during much of 1940 ran under those of the preceding year and cut down to some extent the large gains being made in freight revenues . However , in late November . 1940. passenger revenues began to show improvement and so far this year have continued ahead of a year ago . This improvement is believed to have been due principally to greater industrial activity , higher national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , the drag of passenger business on railroad earnings seems to have been lifted .
