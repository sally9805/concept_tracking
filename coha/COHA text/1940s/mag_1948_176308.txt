The trim little Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield , Mass , was fairly bursting with sculptured emotion last week . Some figures wept , some prayed , some chewed their nails . Another sat on a pedestal and seemed to scream . <P> Even those who thought some of the bronze , wood and marble figures a bit stagy admitted that they were masterfully carved , with an unfailing simplicity of line and form . Ivan Mestrovic , the man who made them , was there himself to help install the show . <P> About half the pieces on exhibition had been seen before at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum ( TIME , April 14 , 1947 ) , which had never before exhibited a one-man show of a living artist . The rest , all done withinc the past 20 years , had been brought from Yugoslavia by his brother Petar . The hit of the Metropolitan show was a 5 ton Pieta done in the muscular , dramatically contorted tradition of Michelangelo , and too big to transport to Pittsfield . The Berkshire exhibition emphasized Mestrovic 's carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Strobl 's vaster ideas look blown up ( see below ) . <P> A shepherd boy who inherited his father 's passion for whittling , and grew up to be one of the best sculptors alive , Mestrovic has two closely related reasons for staying away from Yugoslavia : 1 ) he knows what the inside of a jail looks like ( the Fascists jugged him at the start of the war , released him only at the Pope 's request ) ; 2 ) he is no Titolitarian . <P> Mestrovic has finished nine major pieces in the past year . When a reporter asked him last week what he did for relaxation , the sculptor looked puzzled for a moment and then blurted , " Work ! "
