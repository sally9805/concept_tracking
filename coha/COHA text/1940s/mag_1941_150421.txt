The OPM-automakers ' agreement to curtail 1942 production ( TIME , April 28 ) was last week worked out in detail . The over-all reduction was set at 20.15% , from 5,289,972 new . cars this model year to 4,224,152 next . General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , which produce 90% of the nation 's autos , agreed to cut their production 21.5% so that their medium-sized competitors would have to cut only 15% , their smallest competitors not at all ; thus no company would be forced by quota below the break-even point . It was a good plan , with one failing : it was already obsolete . <P> Detroit itself felt so . Chrysler 's President K. T. Keller said of the 20.15% cut in a letter to his stockholders : " Attainment of this volume of production . . . may prove to be difficult because of materials shortages . . . It appears that the activities of your corporation are destined to become increasingly diverted to the needs of the defense program . " In Washington , with President Roosevelt calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another look at the materials-consuming auto industry , began talking about a 40-50% reduction . Some of them thought the day was not far off when no new automobiles would be manufactured at all . <P> But cutting production was only half the battle . It dislocated the supply , but left demand untouched . How were even 4,224,152 new cars to be rationed to consumers , when increasing national income has sent guesstimates of next year 's potential market for autos up 10% over this year ? The gap-1,594,817 people who will want to buy nonexistent new cars-would normally be closed by higher prices . But the Administration is determined that in this war prices shall stay down . Its scheme : a stiff excise tax and a heavy brake on installment sales . <P> This pincer plan was outlined in a memorandum prepared for the War Department last summer by Rolf Nugent of the Russell Sage Foundation , who since has been doing further work on the problem for OPACS Chief Leon Henderson . Nugent suggested a 25% excise tax on automobiles , coupled with larger down payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : time purchases of automobiles ( which now account for about two-thirds of all new car sales ) could be cut in half by requiring a 50% down payment and the balance in ten months . <P> Last week the tax half of the pincer was laid before the House Ways and Means Committee by Leon Henderson . He urged a 20-25% excise tax on all sales of automobiles , old and new . The installment-sales half was still being studied by OPACS and Federal Reserve economists . Since so many finance companies , dealers and banks compete for the business , best guess was that some form of Federal regulation of installment sales was likely . Possible first move : limitation of installment contracts to 18 months . Consumption of other durable goods besides autos-refrigerators , stoves , furnaces , etc. - could be controlled by the same device .
