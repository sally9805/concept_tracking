Matthew Fox has a solid reputation as an expert kibitzer and operator , with an inordinately sharp eye for a fast buck . A movie man by trade , he has backed such side bets as Bub-0-Loon , three-dimensional pictures , the " everlasting match " ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) . Last winter he quit his $150,00b-a-year job as executive vice president of Universal-International Pictures to make side bets his life work . One of them turned out to be a new main chance : the Indonesian Republican government heeded $80,000 fast , and Matty Fox thought he could arrange it . He did . Then he , got down to cases . <P> The Indonesian archipelago looked to Matty as if it would soon gain its Independence from the Dutch . What the budding republic needed , he decided , was a man like Matty Fox to brace up its economy . The Indonesians , who thought themselves friendless , were enthusiastic . <P> Plenty of Stockpile . By last week the enthusiasm had bloomed into the American-Indonesian Corp . Its guiding spirit , needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corporation 's voting stock . He will do all the Indonesian government 's bulk buying &; selling in the U.S. and will try to find U.S. risk capital to build up the islands ' mines and industries . Says Dr. Soemitro Djojoadikoesoemo , Indonesian trade commissioner to the U.S. who negotiated the deal : " We need U.S. capital and skill ... We like Matty . " <P> Matty likes the prospects . His company will take a 5% cut on every ton of goods that it moves . First haul in sight : $170 million worth of rubber , tin , pepper , tapioca , etc. , already stockpiled and ready for shipment as soon as the Dutch lift their economic blockade against the islands . <P> Meanwhile , the Dutch have argued that Fox 's contract violates the Renville truce agreement under which they keep full sovereignty ( and the right to negotiate foreign agreements ) until 1949 . The State Department , always sensitive to the more enterprising doings of its nationals abroad , has said nothing officially yet . <P> Plenty of Room . Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to profit by unfair " monopoly " or " state trading . " His contract , he says , affects only about 25% of the islands ' total trade ( $450 million in 1940 ) , and private Indonesians are free to deal with whom they please . Competitors , he insists , are welcome-particularly from the U.S. <P> There is method in Matty 's seeming madness about U.S. competitors . Before the war , Indonesia was the hallowed preserve of Dutch and British traders and cartels ( notably tin and rubber ) , which all but shut U.S. business out of the islands ' billion-dollar-a-year ( at ' 48 prices ) trade . Matty Fox is determined to keep them from regaining their hold . Last week he was making the rounds of U.S. companies , inviting them to step right through the archipelago 's open door-when it opens .
