Year ago a shrewd , rich St. Petersburg , Fla. real-estate promoter named Clinton Mozley Washburn picked up a subtropical island for a figurative song . Three hundred acres of tangled mangrove , pine , palm and sandy beach , just off the Florida Gulf Coast 23 miles northwest of Tampa , the property ( Hog Island to the natives ; Caladesi to mapmakers ) apparently was n't worth much in the nude . Promoter Washburn , who holds a big backlog of Florida real estate ( including some $250,000 worth of cheaply bought Gulf Coast property ) , saw possibilities in Hog Island . <P> With the onset of World War II and the promise of a whopping diversion of tourist business to Florida , Mr. Washburn last fall took a full-page ad in the New York Times , offered Hog Island to anyone with a tropical yearning and $150,000 to spare . The ad brought scores of queries , a few prospective buyers , including an Italian from Manhattan who wanted to found a new Roman Empire . <P> Rejecting all bids , Promoter Washburn took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-week honeymoons in the Gulf Coast paradise . In no time they had hit him with applications for some 2,000 suites . Laying out $15,000 to clean up the island , build shacks and a recreation hall , Mr. Washburn , a quiet , thin man with brown eyes , greying hair and the demeanor of a deacon , set out in search of a king &; queen for Hog Island , rechristened Honeymoon Isle . <P> Last week the royal couple ( Newlyweds Mary Beauvais , 20 , dentist 's helper , and Airline Clerk Tom Phelps , 22 , of St. Louis ) moved into one of a row of board huts-not much bigger than bathing houses but thatched over to give them a romantic air-and settled down to honeymoon . By June 1 Promoter Washburn expects to have enough huts to accommodate 50 handpicked couples every two weeks , which will scarcely dent the application list . <P> Meantime , Promoter Washburn has been flooded with offers . A bus company is willing to put up $5,000 for the sightseeing concession . Baptist Washburn scorned a $2,000 offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to start a new business , you would n't prepare for it by getting drunk every night . " At present he is angling for a commercial radio tie-up to let the U. S. know how the honeymooners are doing daily . After the honeymoon season , the city of Tampa is interested in taking over the island for a tourist playground . One unromantic newspaper photographer visited Honeymoon Isle last week and wryly observed : " Not a thing on the island but huts , soldier crabs and pelicans . It 's going to be tough if they do n't know how to play cards . ' '
