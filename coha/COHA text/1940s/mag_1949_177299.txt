The precious little china dogs , fruit baskets and coy shepherdesses that decorate the drawing rooms of the prosperous are not so very different from the glazed nudes and fauns on 5- &-10; store counters . <P> They all derive from the same source : 18th Century Europe. *Last week Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum explored the source with an exhibition of 18th Century porcelain figures and tableware drawn from Italy , Germany , France , England , Austria and Spain . <P> The patronage of Louis XV in France , and a series of German counts , Italian dukes and British businessmen made porcelain manufacture a thriving industry-and something of an art . Then , as now , porcelains were valued more for their sentimental qualities than for their measure of esthetic worth , but sometimes they had both . The Met 's figure of a girl frightened by a snake , done at Hchst about 1770 , might be ill-proportioned , but no one could miss its rococo liveliness . The flowery Music Lesson , modeled at Chelsea from a painting by Franois Boucher ( see cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XIV 's doctor ) neatly blended wit and workmanship . Five hundred such pieces , crammed into three small rooms at the Met , made a sparkling show . <P> <P> *China had been exporting the finished product to Europe for two centuries before an alchemist named Johann Friedrich Bttger , a protege of Augustus the Strong of Saxony , succeeded in cracking the secret of porcelain making in 1709 . His success made it possible for Augustus , an avid collector of the Chinese article , to manufacture his own .
