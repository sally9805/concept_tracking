Lies , rumors , jokes , canards , insults , obscenities , denials , bluffs , excuses , exhortations , explanations , reassurances , trial balloons and grotesque distortions continued to spew from the world 's radios last week . Most of it was Axis concoctions ; some of it was Allied counter-propaganda . Behind the radio barrage fell a blizzard of newspaper squibs , handbills , pamphlets , posters . In free countries men speculated aloud with laughter and curses ; in Europe they whispered behind their hands in dim cafes and shuttered homes . It was a big week in the battle of babble . <P> Propaganda for home consumption may be intended as a stimulant , a sedative or a cathartic . For enemies it should be poison . Either way , German propaganda works less well than it used to . The German people are tired of constant medication , and the non-Axis world is learning to reject poison , acquiring immunity to what is absorbed inadvertently . But the Axis poisoners were trying harder than ever , and enlightened immunologists issued warnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Archibald MacLeish of OFF declared the Axis campaign to spread discord among the United Nations to be " as shrewd , as ruthless as any plot of the Borgias . " Axis radio spray to the U.S. : " American policy is dictated in Downing Street . . . will leave America holding the bag . " To Brit ain : " The British Empire is dissolving like a lump of sugar in the Roosevelt teacup . " <P> Rx for Latin America . As unity grew out of the Pan-American conference at Rio , said Director MacLeish , the Axis beam to South America became a frantic torrent . Since most Latin Americans are Catholics , the Italian radio portrayed " Protestant Roosevelt " in an alliance with " Atheist Stalin " against " Catholic Fascism . " Another Axis broadcast asserted that the Vatican had urged Latin America not to break with the Axis . This the Vatican promptly denied . <P> From Unoccupied France , the Vichy radio chimed in on the South American beam . Vichy 's Ambassador to Paris , Fernand de Brinon , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greatest enemy of all , and therefore earnestly desires a German victory . . . . Washington leads the alliance of Jewish capitalists and Soviet Communists . " This must have made curious listening for the U.S. State Department , which still sought to avoid giving Vichy " excuses " for falling inert into Hitler 's arms . <P> Rx for the Home Folks . Yet men with keen ears thought that Axis propaganda weapons were getting blunt from over work : global war to the death was just too big . German setbacks in Russia were al most too big for the master propagandist , Adolf Hitler , himself . His address to his people , on the ninth anniversary of his leadership , sounded like an old phono graph record grinding away under a groove-stuck needle : " Russian winter . . . many . . plutocratic . Russian warmongers . . . winter . . . . " innocent Ger Hitler almost said in so many words that it would do the German people no good to throw the Nazis out of power and conclude peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated Germany when there were no Nazis .
