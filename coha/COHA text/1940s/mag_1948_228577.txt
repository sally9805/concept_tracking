He considered that Israel 's King Saul should have pitched his camp in the same spot , instead of in the valley below . In time , Wingate 's " S.N.S. " grew into Haganah 's shock troops , Palmach . But that was after Wingate 's day . The British government , which thought him too friendly to the Zionists , recalled him from Palestine . <P> The scholar-soldier ( he spoke fluent Arabic and Hebrew ) went on to military glory in World War II-in Ethiopia , where his raiders disrupted the Italian army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Japanese-held territory .
