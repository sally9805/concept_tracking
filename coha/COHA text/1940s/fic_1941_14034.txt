SCENE : A corner of the gardens behind the palace at Versailles . A number of high box hedges seclude the place . A flight of steps runs upstage . It is very early morning , sometime in September , 1940 . FARGEAU , a workman , sits on the steps , reading a newspaper . HENRI , broom in hand , stands beside FARGEAU , looking over his shoulder . FARGEAU Impossible ! They are not Frenchmen ! They are not men ! They are  --  Slaps the paper HENRI They are politicians . FARGEAU If the state could act  --  if it could carry through a policy  --  HENRI It would not help much to act now . FARGEAU Oh , God  --  let our memory perish  --  but let France be free ! DESEZE , a park attendant , enters . DESEZE Henri ! Move around ! Circulate ! Are you going to sweep all day in one spot ? HENRI He reads the decrees to me , the decrees of Paris . DESEZE You sweep in one spot because you wait for a pourboire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why do you carry chairs so early in the morning ? For the same lady and her pourboire ! FARGEAU Throwing down paperTraitors ! DESEZE There is too much said of traitors . Who are the traitors now ? FARGEAU Whoever writes these things ! The reporters , the journalists , the editors ! The dirty liars and traitors ! DESEZE Do you have a test for truth and falsehood , little Fargeau ? FARGEAU I say every fool knows the Germans sit in the offices with guns and say what must be written ! DESEZE There 's no law that a man must read it . What do they say this morning ? FARGEAU Look at it ! Take it in ! Mix it with your breakfast if you can ! " German Forces Occupy All France . Little Resistance Offered . " DESEZE Yes , God help us ; it 's true . FARGEAU I tell you they should be shot down , the traitors who write such things , and those who print them ! DESEZE The journalists are merely the historians of the present , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly choose . p. 4 FARGEAU Why , you fool , do you believe these lies ? This is all the doing of the secret agents ! This is how they win ! Up in Belgium their secret agents ran through the villages crying , " All is lost ! Fly ! The Germans have broken through ! They are butchering the peasants ! " And the peasants believed them , and clogged the roads  --  and the nation was destroyed ! And now you believe them ! DESEZE We saw them take Paris and march on south . It 's not difficult to believe the rest . FARGEAU I know they took Paris . They can take a city ! They have done that before . But France is not taken in a day nor a week ! Nor in a hundred years ! HENRI My son came home from the south last night . DESEZE He was discharged ? HENRI He was lost from his company . He says there is now no army of France , even in the south . No army , no command , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FARGEAU Do you know what I would do if I believed that ? I would kill a few of these Germans . HENRI It 's true . DESEZE Yes , it 's true , and you will kill nobody . A German CAPTAIN is heard speaking off stage. p. 5 CAPTAIN Schoener Morgen heute ! CAPTAIN and LIEUTENANT enter and start to pass through . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Ja ! Wenn wir uns beeilen , knnen wir das Trianon bis mittag besichtigt haben . CAPTAIN Ich muss sagen Potsdam interessiert mich mehr . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Dem Baedicker nach mssten wir auf dem rechten Wege sein ! I beg your pardon , this is the way to the Trianon ? DESEZE does not answer . Is this the way to the Trianon ? DESEZE Yes . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Danke . Finden Sie es denn nicht huebsch hier ? CAPTAIN Ja , nur die Zustaende gefallen mir garnicht . GERMAN LIEUTENANT As they go toward the exitIch verstehe nicht was sie daran auszusetzen haben . CAPTAIN Rennen Sie doch nicht so . Wir haben doch Zeit . They go out . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uhr zurueck sein . FARGEAU Yes , I would kill one or two of them . I 'm too old for many things , but not too old to die . Better to die , if thereby France is free . p. 6 DESEZE The gates are open , go find your mop and bucket . FARGEAU goes out . CHARLOTTE and MERCY enter . CHARLOTTE Sister ! MERCY Yes , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE I have found a park attendant  --  one who looks intelligent . MERCY Oh , yes ! Oh , if you please  --  DESEZE turns , looking up to them . DESEZE Yes , madame ? MERCY Perhaps you would be willing to help us . We are attempting to reconstruct the past , with the most inadequate evidence . DESEZE To reconstruct the past ? MERCY Yes . DESEZE Madame , I wish you all success . CHARLOTTE But we need assistance desperately ! DESEZE For that project you do indeed ! CHARLOTTE It 's only  --  there was once a lake here at Versailles . Lilies grew at the margin , mingled with sedge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell us where it was ? DESEZE When was that lake here , madame ? p. 7 CHARLOTTE In the time of Louis XVI . DESEZE I fear I can not help you . Ancient as I appear , and old as is my uniform , my recollection stops this side of Louis XVI . CHARLOTTE Oh , and so does ours , so does ours . DESEZE I have not yet finished the morning routine , so if you will excuse me  --  MERCY Please listen . We are school teachers from New Hampshire , and for many years we have made a study of the life of Marie Antoinette . We have read and reread the memoirs of her life , and we have pored over all the available maps and pictures of the period . Now at last we have saved enough to visit the shrines of our interest . But here at Versailles , we are utterly disappointed . DESEZE Will you tell me why , madame ? CHARLOTTE Because it 's been changed ! It 's not as it was in the days of Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the lake , we could use it as a key , and then we could locate accurately all the missing features of that old landscape .  --  CHARLOTTE And then we thought perhaps the government would help to reconstruct it as it was  --  so that travellers from far away could enter here and look back into that beautiful old world . p. 8 MERCY So that modern men and women could see these gardens as they appeared to Marie Antoinette , when she walked among the orange trees long ago ! DESEZE The whole earth is at war , mesdames . All nations are in danger , and mine is already over-run . The Germans take Paris and pour down to the Pyrenees , and you hunt for the ghost of Marie Antoinette , in the gardens of Versailles ! MERCY He does n't understand . CHARLOTTE But how could he ? MERCY No , it could n't be expected . CHARLOTTE No . Have you the map , my dear ? MERCY Yes , here it is . CHARLOTTE We will have to proceed with our search alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeline  --  MADELINE runs on from the right , and down the steps . DESEZE Good morning , mademoiselle . MADELINE GUEST Good morning , Deseze.  --  Will you do something for me ? DESEZE Yes , mademoiselle . p. 9 MADELINE GUEST There is a tall and broad American woman entering by the gate just above , wearing a green cape . If she asks for me , will you say that I have gone toward the palace ? DESEZE Yes , of course , mademoiselle . MADELINE GUEST Thank you ! She gives him a coin . DESEZE Going up the stepsMerci . You are early this morning . MADELINE GUEST Yes . She sits , concealing her face . DESEZE It 's a beautiful morning , that 's one thing the Germans have n't taken from us . He meets MAISIE . If you will forgive me , madame . MAISIE TOMPKINS Excusez-moi  --  mais avez vous voyez une dame passez par ici  --  Oh ! C'est la . Il n'ya pas de quoi . Depechez vous , vite ! She avoids DESEZE and goes toward the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I can do ! She sits on the bench beside MADELINE . Madeline ! It is Madeline ! MADELINE GUEST Maisie ! Oh , Maisie , my dear ! I thought I heard someone calling  --  p. 10 MAISIE TOMPKINS Do n't apologize , and I wo n't . MADELINE GUEST For what ? MAISIE TOMPKINS You ran like hell when you saw me . MADELINE GUEST I ran from you ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , ma cherie , but I ran like hell after you , so we 're even . Darling , I sold you that dress , and as for your figure , I know it as well going away as coming toward . It has n't changed since high school ! MADELINE GUEST I could say I did n't recognize you . MAISIE TOMPKINS I 'm also unmistakable . Look at my proportions . You knew me , lady . You had a reason ? MADELINE GUEST I thought I had . MAISIE TOMPKINS Shall I go ? MADELINE GUEST But now that you 're here , please stay if you can . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do apologize , darling . You should be allowed to live your own life . But you left Paris four months ago , you know . MADELINE GUEST Yes , I remember . MAISIE TOMPKINS Left for New York in a shower of headlines . I saw you off on the boat-train myself . p. 11 MADELINE GUEST Yes I remember that , too . MAISIE TOMPKINS Now I catch a glimpse of you , calmly strolling down an avenue in Versailles . Do you wonder I gave chase ? MADELINE GUEST I must be fascinating . MAISIE TOMPKINS You are . You meant to disappear ? MADELINE GUEST In a way . MAISIE TOMPKINS Did you do something unprintable ? MADELINE GUEST I 'd rather it was n't printed . MAISIE TOMPKINS Oh well , I wo n't repeat it . MADELINE GUEST No . I 'm sure you wo n't . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 're not saying ? MADELINE GUEST No . MAISIE TOMPKINS Starts to riseNow I really should go . MADELINE GUEST No , Maisie ! Stay if you can ! It 's such a relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horrible news , Maisie ! And these sickening Germans ! They 're everywhere ! They 're even here ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , I got up early this morning to say good-bye . MADELINE GUEST Good-bye ? p. 12 MAISIE TOMPKINS To Paris and the things I 've loved here . We may never see them again . MADELINE GUEST Can they make France a province ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I only know what the correspondents say in the Ritz Bar . Some maintain that conquest ca n't be permanent  --  that it 's only skin deep . Others say that this is the beginning of the new ice age , and the Nazis are coming down like a snow cap over civilization . As for Americans , they were given their last warning months ago . MADELINE GUEST And you 're going tomorrow ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Going tomorrow . I 've been saying that for two weeks now , but this time I really mean it . Business loyalty is all very well , but I simply ca n't face the prospect of fitting a Berlin hausfrau into a Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I mean fundamentally . So  --  tomorrow I sever my very profitable connection with Nicolet et Cie . If I can get a seat on a plane . If I can get two , will you come with me ? MADELINE GUEST I ca n't . MAISIE TOMPKINS Obligations ? MADELINE GUEST I just ca n't . MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , I 'm not exactly a psychologist , my dear  --  but I should say there was only one answer . You 're suffering from a madness peculiar to women  --  you 've fallen in love . p. 13 MADELINE GUEST Peculiar to women ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I see . You believe he loves you in return . Well , that may be true in rare instances . I 've never known a case . MADELINE GUEST You 're probing . She rises , and goes up the steps , looking about . MAISIE TOMPKINS I guess I 'm clumsy with a probe , but I 've been worried about you a little  --  MADELINE GUEST Oh ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , we ran through our fifteens and twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your back is that I 've watched you so often walking away with the young man I wanted . Then we went on the stage together , and you walked away with the parts I wanted . Now I 'm selling frocks and you 're a star , and I still see you through a rosy mist of adoration . MADELINE GUEST Maisie , Maisie  --  you were always an angel . MAISIE TOMPKINS By Rubens , I know . So , if you 're in love , out with it , and if he 's a no-good like the first one I 'll tell you . MADELINE GUEST You guessed this much  --  that I fell in love . MAISIE TOMPKINS You can tell me how , even if you ca n't tell me who. p. 14 MADELINE GUEST How ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I saw you start off on that boat-train , darling , and your destination was in all the papers . How did you get here ? MADELINE GUEST I got off the ship . MAISIE TOMPKINS They wo n't let you . MADELINE GUEST Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or malice aforethought ? MADELINE GUEST I may as well tell you the whole story . MAISIE TOMPKINS That 's right , darling . MADELINE GUEST Sitting on the balustradeWell , it started with that radio Midas in New York  --  who wanted to marry me . Rich as the Mint , very smooth . MAISIE TOMPKINS Like a soap commercial on the air . MADELINE GUEST Yes . Well , the theory is that an actress ought to marry money while she can , and I was tempted . MAISIE TOMPKINS Tired of trooping ? MADELINE GUEST No , it was n't that I wanted to quit the theatre . It was just that  --  when once you 've been poor a multimillionaire has a special glamor for you . We scrimped so hard in that 47th Street room that I used to dream of finding money . In great piles and fortunes . Security forever , even when you 're old . And the radio man was very nice , and everything he touched turned to gold , so I was tempted . But something warned me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . p. 15 MAISIE TOMPKINS Some other city might have been better . So , while you were thinking ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS Perhaps I saw you about with him once or twice . He wore an officer 's uniform , and once you rode in the Bois ? MADELINE GUEST Possibly . MAISIE TOMPKINS Very sudden , no doubt ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't know . I went to the Comdie Franaise one night and an officer sat beside me . He lent me his opera glasses , and walked to my hotel with me afterward . That was all  --  nothing romantic , nothing said . Only I went to Molire again the next night , and so did he . MAISIE TOMPKINS Is he handsome ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't know .  --  I do n't know . MAISIE TOMPKINS O , dear  --  this is serious . MADELINE GUEST We saw more and more of each other . Then , before long , we were seeing nobody else . I told myself that this would never do , so I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat deck , and watched the Mediterranean waters open between me and the pier . Then I knew I could n't leave France , so I opened negotiations with the pilot . Next morning I was back in Paris . I came here  --  and Raoul was here . Did you know that this was an enchanted place for lovers , this corner of the gardens ? Raoul told me the legend . Lost things are found here . And if a woman waits here , and wishes hard enough , her lover will turn , wherever he is , and come this way . p. 16 MAISIE TOMPKINS I 'm not superstitious . Well , it 's made one alteration in you . In New York I never knew you to rise before noon . She looks at her watch . Exactly 6:30 A.M. MADELINE GUEST I know . I ca n't sleep . She rises , looking about . So I get up and come here , hoping . MAISIE TOMPKINS There came an end to this idyll ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , he was on leave . MAISIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with a French officer . MADELINE GUEST He 's a journalist really . He was in the naval reserve . MAISIE TOMPKINS Raoul ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS Nice name . But it must be Raoul St. Cloud . MADELINE GUEST Yes , it is . MAISIE TOMPKINS I did n't know you went in for politics . MADELINE GUEST I do n't . MAISIE TOMPKINS But St. Cloud writes political comment for L'Evangile . The best written in Paris . Do n't you read it ? p. 17 MADELINE GUEST I do now . MAISIE TOMPKINS He certainly told the Germans what an honest man thinks about them . I hope he 's not among the absent or missing . MADELINE GUEST He is , though . MAISIE TOMPKINS Darling , you 'd better let go and come back to America with me . MADELINE GUEST Why ? MAISIE TOMPKINS They say very few will come out of those prison camps , and those few wo n't be all in one piece . MADELINE GUEST I think he 'll come back . MAISIE TOMPKINS Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His destroyer was used as a transport to take men out of Dunkirk . Since then I have n't heard . She sits . MAISIE TOMPKINS You have n't ? Well he may have come through Dunkirk , some did . MADELINE GUEST For God 's sake , Maisie , I hate staying here ! I 've thought of all this ! What do you suppose think about sitting alone in an empty park ? I do n't want to be caught and trapped and helpless . But there 's nothing I can do . I ca n't go  --  I have to stay . p. 18 MAISIE TOMPKINS My sweet , I 'd better leave you . I 've run into something holy here . I 'm treading on sacred ground , and I 'll get out . MADELINE GUEST Do n't be silly . MAISIE TOMPKINS Maybe you do n't know what 's happened to you . Maybe you 've never been in love before . MADELINE GUEST Maybe not . It feels as if maybe not . Oh , Maisie  --  you know how it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fun  --  and you can be deep in love , so that you think of him first in the morning and last at night , and that 's wonderful . But this time  --  it is n't fun , and it is n't wonderful  --  it 's  --  oh , darling , when he 's gone life 's one endless misery  --  and he 's been gone so long ! MAISIE TOMPKINS My sweet , if I leave you here , it 's like leaving a drunk on a railroad track . MADELINE GUEST I know I should go . I 've known it all the time . There 's no hope  --  and yet beyond reason I keep on hoping . My mind tells me right now , if you love your life go with Maisie . MAISIE TOMPKINS Then you have some sense left , and in the end you 'll come . RAOUL. appears above in the distance . MADELINE GUEST Maisie  --  p. 19 MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes ? MADELINE GUEST There . MAISIE TOMPKINS It 's  --  MADELINE GUEST Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS The Gods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaza Athene  --  MAISIE TOMPKINS If I had a tail , it would hang in the traditional position  --  and if an elephant can slink , I 'm slinking . She goes out . RAOUL enters and stands for a moment motionless . MADELINE GUEST I 'd come toward you , but I ca n't move . Did you go to the hotel ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I did n't dare venture there . I hoped you 'd be here . MADELINE GUEST You 're not wounded ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD No . Did you pray for me ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . RAOUL ST . CLOUD I knew you must have . I 've been through miracles . I 've prayed to you so long , from so many unimaginable places , I must worship you a moment before I touch you . I think there must be a God . MADELINE GUEST There must be . I was afraid your ship was lost . p. 20 RAOUL ST . CLOUD It was . MADELINE GUEST They said it would be impossible for a man to come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible , that 's how I knew you prayed . MADELINE GUEST Let me look at you .  --  She goes near him , then into his arms . RAOUL ST . CLOUD How I have wanted you ! MADELINE GUEST How I have wanted you ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD I 'd have died in the sea if it had n't been for you . How did you do it , darling ? MADELINE GUEST You had time to think of me ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Every time it got desperate , I found I was thinking of you  --  and that saved me . You were a goddess , with your hand stretched over me.  --  I could feel you there , saving my life .  --  But I ca n't stay here . There may be mopping up operations . MADELINE GUEST I did n't know there was fighting still ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD Here and there , where men are stubborn . HENRI enters . RAOUL wheels around , about to draw his automatic . MADELINE puts her hand on his arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raoul . Oh , Henri  --  HENRI Yes , mademoiselle ? MADELINE GUEST Are there German soldiers about ? HENRI Only the two in the Trianon . MADELINE GUEST If they come near will you let us know ? HENRI Yes , mademoiselle . RAOUL ST . CLOUD You know him ? MADELINE GUEST Henri ? He 's an old friend . He 'll keep good watch . HENRI goes out . RAOUL puts a hand over his eyes . Darling , what is it ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Do n't laugh . But I 'm probably still a little drunk . MADELINE GUEST Drunk ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD You see , when I came out of the ocean I was as blue as a mackerel . And they poured me full of hot rum , and thawed me out in the engine room  --  so if I sound a little maudlin  --  or stumble a little  --  MADELINE GUEST I 'm a little drunk myself just with seeing you , so I would n't notice . But maybe you 'd better sit down , darling . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAOUL ST . CLOUD By plane . We happened to steal a plane , another man and I. It was a German plane . MADELINE GUEST But how could you ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD It was quite illogical , like everything else these days . And we were all pretty desperate , too . MADELINE GUEST But these are not your clothes . RAOUL ST . CLOUD No , I came naked out of the sea this morning . An officer lent me these things . You see , our captain refused to surrender when the Germans took over the port , and the destroyer fought a lonely battle against four submarines . I do n't know quite what we did to them , but in the end they sank us . Somewhere around the middle of the Channel . That was  --  why that was yesterday ! MADELINE GUEST You say these things so calmly ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD I was a little nervous at the time . After they sank us , well it was dark , nothing to be seen but black sky and black ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me you did n't pull me through that , because I know . A man can swim just so long in a frigid sea with water chopping over him and no notion of east or west . I got rid of my clothes , and my coat , with the one letter I ever had from you  --  then I lost my precious piece of plank and had nothing to cling to  --  so I clung to you , darling , just to you , and without you I 'd be frozen and drowned and dead ! p. 23 MADELINE GUEST It 's unfair that men go through such things , and women ca n't help them . RAOUL ST . CLOUD But you have n't listened ! You could n't have helped more with a lifeline ! And it was n't only that once ! It was many times I 'd have gone down into some blackness , but then the thought of you would nerve me up , and I 'd make a decision , and take courage , and stumble on . It was always the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , always that miracle . You know I 'm sane enough ; I like to see things as they are . But coming straight out of it this way , with no sleep and no breakfast , it seems like more than mortal . MADELINE GUEST No breakfast  --  come . She rises . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Taking her in his armsNo , not yet  --  do n't go yet  --  it wo n't matter  --  I 'm a bit irregular in my habits , anyway  --  lately . One meal a week like an anaconda . MADELINE GUEST But there 's a restaurant nearby , where I can get coffee and croissants . So , please  --  RAOUL ST . CLOUD What I need most of all is a change of clothes . You see , in these I ca n't go anywhere  --  MADELINE GUEST I 'll try . p. 24 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Just anything  --  any workman 's clothes . MADELINE GUEST Going toward the stepsCan you wait here in the park ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I 'll have to chance it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MADELINE GUEST I think so . Do you want me to send a message ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I have it written out here . It 's a private code . But what it says is that I 'll be in Dijon tomorrow . MADELINE GUEST In Dijon ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD A few of us are starting south tomorrow to try to find the French fleet . We still have a fleet , you know , though we have no country . MADELINE GUEST But the war 's ended ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD Not for me , dear , not for any of us who is n't helpless . MADELINE GUEST No  --  no.  --  What do you mean ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Madeline darling , I must go back . MADELINE GUEST Go back ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , dear  --  p. 25 MADELINE GUEST Into the war ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , somehow  --  with what weight I have  --  with whatever I can do  --  MADELINE GUEST When ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I 've promised to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD Oh , darling , you just do n't know the difference between today and nothing . Between one night more and death in the sea . MADELINE GUEST SittingRaoul ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes ? MADELINE GUEST Sitting here waiting , it seemed mad to hope that you would come at all . But not once did I ever imagine anything so mad as that you would come  --  and then go back into it . What good will more dying do ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I count on you  --  to keep me from dying . MADELINE GUEST Then I have no part in the decision  --  and nothing to say ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD If you were to choose my course , dear , and your one voice decided what would you say then ? MADELINE GUEST I 'd say come with me. p. 26 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Where , dear ? MADELINE GUEST Anywhere , away from here . RAOUL ST . CLOUD To your country ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , if you would n't mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , because it 's yours . But it 's not mine . What if America were sometime in desperate straits , and the men of America ran away ? What would you think of them ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't know . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , you do know . Every woman knows the answer to that . MADELINE GUEST Yes , I suppose so . RAOUL ST . CLOUD His hands on her shouldersWe fell in love so quickly  --  we were so sure of each other  --  that I hardly paused to think of what world you came out of  --  or you to question mine . Now we face these things sharply , in an hour of battle . I am a Frenchman  --  and fight for France . For many years I fought with my pen against them , but not well enough . Not well enough , darling , and so now we must all fight as we can  --  desperately  --  with whatever arms there are . MADELINE GUEST Oh , I wonder  --  I wonder  --  how many chances we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth had changed  --  and you were lost in a world you did n't know ? p. 27 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Not quite that . MADELINE GUEST It 's been a nightmare with me lately . Sometimes it came to me as I sat there in the park to wait for you  --  the streets all different , nothing familiar  --  rivers and roads change places  --  the maps are all wrong , and I 'm alone in the world  --  searching over this unknown landscape for you . We 're to meet at Versailles  --  but there 's no way to find it . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , last night was like that . MADELINE GUEST And then what if it 's so long and so cruel , and the iron cuts so deep , that we change too ? It 's such a fragile thing , the meeting of lovers . There must be a place and a time for them to meet  --  and they must somehow stay alive and somehow reach that tiny focus in eternity which is all they have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame must survive the wind . How do we dare part , Raoul , knowing how all the chances are against us ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Most of the lovers of the world are parting just that way these days . MADELINE GUEST But those lovers have no gulf between them ! Oh , Raoul , Raoul , you 're willing to die for something I do n't understand ! And that comes between us ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD You 'd die for it too , if it came to a choice . p. 28 MADELINE GUEST I , Raoul ? What would I die for ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Rather than live ignobly . MADELINE GUEST I do n't know . RAOUL ST . CLOUD But I know . I saw you from a long way off  --  when I was there in the sea . And I know . MADELINE GUEST You always do this to me . Make me believe in miracles . They kiss . I 'll bring the breakfast , and what clothes I can find . She goes up the steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLOUD What is it ? HENRI You must hurry , sir , they 're coming back  --  MADELINE GUEST What have you seen ? HENRI They came so quickly , mademoiselle ! They were not here , and then they were here . They have set guards at this exit . Forgive me , there is still time . He goes out . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Is there a guard at that gate ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Perhaps this way  --  He goes out to look and returns after a pause . No  --  p. 29 MADELINE GUEST What can I do ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD You must walk rapidly to that exit  --  and turn right from it along the avenue  --  MADELINE GUEST You 'll fight with them ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD I do n't know . MADELINE GUEST But it 's senseless to die this way ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD They may not find me  --  but if they do , it 's this way or a labor camp , Madeline . MADELINE GUEST But if you die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive there 's at least a chance ! A chance to get free ! A chance to live ! She runs to him . Even for France it 's wrong to die ! It 's giving up , saying it 's no use any more ! GERMAN LIEUTENANT OutsideWissen Sie gestern abend war ich im Ball Tabarin , diese Maedchen dort das ist ja toll . CAPTAIN As he enters with the LIEUTENANTDas Leben hier gefaellt mir so gut , dass ich nie mehr fort moechte . CHARLOTTE and MERCY appear . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Sit a moment . He sits on the bench , MADELINE between him and the soldiers. p. 30 CAPTAIN Na , das wird sich schn einrichten lassen , warum denn nicht ? MERCY I grow more certain the lake lay here to the left . CHARLOTTE I should have thought a little further on . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Schauen Sie , sind das nicht Amerikaner ? CAPTAIN Scheint so ! Sonderbar , treiben die sich noch immer hier herum ? GERMAN LIEUTENANT Und dieser Mann da , in der Uniform , wollen wir doch mal sehen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haben . He goes down the steps . MADELINE rises . Your pardon , sir ; you wear the uniform of the French aviation forces ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , I do . It 's not mine , however . I am a lieutenant in the navy . CAPTAIN May I see your papers ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Unfortunately , I have not my papers with me . CAPTAIN Where are they ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Somewhere in the shallow sea between France and England . I was forced to leave them there last night . CAPTAIN You will stand up , please . RAOUL rises . This is very unfortunate . We are obliged to arrest all stragglers . We had hoped to find none , but unfortunately for both of us , you are here . Also , we have placed a patrol at each exit , and you will therefore not attempt to use your arms , for you are a sensible person . Your automatic , please . p. 31 RAOUL ST . CLOUD To MADELINEThis is a tame end for a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raoul , you must listen to me . Please ! RAOUL sees that he is covered by the LIEUTENANT and gives his gun to the CAPTAIN . RAOUL ST . CLOUD For the moment . CAPTAIN You see , every man 's luck runs out sometime . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Even Hitler 's ? CAPTAIN We shall see . GERMAN LIEUTENANT Das wird uns aufhalten . CAPTAIN Das macht ja nichts . Come on , this way . MADELINE GUEST He 's not serving against you ! His ship was sunk ; he 's here only to see me ! CAPTAIN I can well believe you , my dear . MADELINE GUEST But you ca n't take him now ! There 's to be an armistice now . The war 's ended ! He 's no danger to you , one in so many millions ! CAPTAIN I 'm sorry ; we have our orders . MADELINE GUEST Then we must have a few minutes  --  to say what must be said . p. 32 CAPTAIN If there 's nothing against him , he will be released tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not true ! CAPTAIN Will you show me your passport ? She takes the passport out of her bag , hands it to him . He glances at it , and returns it to her . An American ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . CAPTAIN This gentleman is in my custody , mademoiselle . I prefer that there is no interference , no argument , no outcry in the streets . Will you go quietly to your hotel , or shall I detail a soldier to escort you ? MADELINE GUEST I will go quietly . CAPTAIN Good . Vorwaerts ! MADELINE GUEST Taking RAOUL 'S armDarling , till I see you  --  RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , Madeline  --  He goes out with the soldiers . MERCY and CHARLOTTE enter above . MERCY Charlotte ! The soldiers  --  ask her if we can help her  --  CHARLOTTE Can we help you in any way , mademoiselle ? MERCY If there 's anything we can do  --  MADELINE GUEST Thank you , no  --  there 's nothing . She goes out . CURTAIN p. 33 Act 1 , Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outskirts of Paris , now the office of a concentration camp . Within the concrete walls the Nazis have set up gates , barriers and run-ways built of new wood and heavy wire fencing . In the midst of this inferno a delicate chair and table have been set for the commandant , COLONEL ERFURT . ERFURT is ensconced in the chair as the curtain rises , and LIEUTENANT SCHOEN sits at a plain table to the left . COLONEL ERFURT Are there others waiting who should be taken care of today ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN This list , sir , and a new guard sent from headquarters . COLONEL ERFURT I will see the guard first and then the others . SCHOEN rises , pushes a button on his desk , and crosses to ERFURT as a GUARD enters through the wire cage from the left . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN To the GUARDCorporal Behrens . The GUARD goes out. 1ST GUARD OutsideCorporal Behrens ! The GUARD reenters , followed by BEHRENS . SCHOEN unlocks the gate , admitting BEHRENS into the room. p. 34 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN This is Corporal Behrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have his commission . COLONEL ERFURT Yes . In what specialty have you been trained , Corporal ? CORPORAL BEHRENS In punishments , sir . COLONEL ERFURT What punishments ? CORPORAL BEHRENS In all degrees , sir . COLONEL ERFURT You have had experience ? CORPORAL BEHRENS Two years , sir . COLONEL ERFURT You will take over the examination , Lieutenant . BEHRENS turns to SCHOEN . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , sir . Why are men punished in the Third Reich ? CORPORAL BEHRENS Because they are guilty . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN And how do you know they are guilty ? CORPORAL BEHRENS Because they are condemned by the state , and the state makes no errors . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN If you discovered that the state had made an error , would you report it to the proper authorities ? CORPORAL BEHRENS It is impossible , sir , that the state has made an error . In any conflict between the state and the individual , the state is right , and the individual is wrong . p. 35 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN But suppose God whispers in a man 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and the state is mistaken ? CORPORAL BEHRENS It is impossible , sir . There is no God except the state , and the state carries out our Fuehrer 's will . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN But suppose , for example , that you are right , and I am wrong ? CORPORAL BEHRENS It is impossible , sir , because the state has set you above me in authority . COLONEL ERFURT Good . Very good . You will assist with punishments in the third tier . Give this to the guard ; he will conduct you . BEHRENS salutes . The GUARD opens the door and he goes out right . COLONEL ERFURT We must make a census of the vacant cells in the reception tier . A consignment of prisoners arrives today . Transferred from unoccupied France . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I took such a census yesterday , Colonel Erfurt . This report shows the cells vacant , and also those not used to capacity . COLONEL ERFURT They appear to train you fellows well in Moabite . You anticipate me . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I believe the system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERFURT Yes . However in the future you will kindly inform me before you proceed with such a matter . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , sir . COLONEL ERFURT Besucher siebenundzwanzig und achtundzwanzig . SCHOEN pushes buzzer , GUARD appears in cage . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Besucher siebenundzwanzig und achtundzwanzig . He unlocks the gate. 1ST GUARD OutsideAusweiskarte vorzeigen  --  passiert ! A GUARD enters , followed by MME . FLEURY and M. FLEURY. 1ST GUARD Folgen sie mir . Besucher siebenundzwanzig und achtundzwanzig . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Your card . MME . FLEURY hands him her card through the wire door . M. and Mme. Fleury ? They nod . Heil Hitler ! They lift their hands but do not speak . SCHOEN opens the gate. 1ST GUARD Schnell ! Schnell ! He pushes the FLEURYS into the room , and follows them . SCHOEN closes and relocks the gate. p. 37 COLONEL ERFURT Stuhl fr die Frau . The GUARD brings a stool , places MME . FLEURY on it . Sit down . Sachen abnehmen . The GUARD takes her pocketbook . Handschuhe . The GUARD takes her gloves . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLONEL ERFURT How old is your son , Mme. Fleury . MADAME FLEURY He is twenty-seven . COLONEL ERFURT We had thought him older . MADAME FLEURY Then I may see him ? COLONEL ERFURT You live at Tours ? MADAME FLEURY Yes , sir . COLONEL ERFURT What is your position in the city of Tours ? MADAME FLEURY We are poor people , sir . My husband has a little farm . COLONEL ERFURT Listen to me carefully . It is my custom to use kindness , but it is not my custom to repeat my words . This camp is here for a special purpose . It does not contain all grades and varieties of prisoners . We have here only political or philosophical offenders who have given us reason to believe them dangerous . It will not be possible for you to see your son . p. 38 MADAME FLEURY But he is the gentlest of men . COLONEL ERFURT Of course . I know . MADAME FLEURY M. Director , we have walked here this hundred miles , for there was no transport , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERFURT I 'm sorry . MADAME FLEURY We must go ? COLONEL ERFURT Yes . Unless there were some excuse for the interview . MADAME FLEURY Excuse ? COLONEL ERFURT These are not my rules alone . Interviews are permitted only in the public interest . Would you be willing to ask your son a question ? MADAME FLEURY What question ? COLONEL ERFURT Unfortunately , there is nothing your son can tell me which I do not know  --  but for form 's sake ask him how you can communicate with him without the knowledge of the authorities . MADAME FLEURY My son told us , never  --  even to save his life  --  we must never assist you . COLONEL ERFURT Your son is ill  --  he is confined to his cot . He will be up and about in a few days , but he is ill . If you wish to see him  --  p. 39 MADAME FLEURY Yes , yes  --  we will ask the one question . COLONEL ERFURT Good . Follow the guard , you will have fifteen minutes . MADAME FLEURY Maybe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little , perhaps I could bring him food  --  COLONEL ERFURT Maybe . A GUARD ushers the FLEURYS through the inner door . Besucher neunundzwanzig . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN To a GUARDBesucher neunundzwanzig. 1ST GUARD Off stageBesucher neunundzwanzig . COLONEL ERFURT Who is Madeline Guest ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN An American , sir . He lays a folder on ERFURT 'S desk . I have made a digest of the available information concerning her , if you wish to see it . COLONEL ERFURT Examining the dossierOh yes , the American actress . I know the name . It is the American actress ? You have made sure ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Quite positive , sir . She has been here several times , and we have looked into her background . A GUARD appears with MADELINE behind the wire barrier. p. 40 1ST GUARD Besucher neunundzwanzig . He goes out . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN May I see your card , please ? MADELINE hands him her card through wire door . Your name is Madeline Guest ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Heil Hitler ! MADELINE GUEST I have an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MADELINE GUEST I am an American citizen . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It is still essential . MADELINE GUEST I ca n't  --  no  --  COLONEL ERFURT Do n't be an ass , Lieutenant . Lassen Sie sie doch herein . SCHOEN unlocks the gate . MADELINE enters . You are really Madeline Guest ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT The American actress ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT It 's incredible . Now how in the world would you happen to be here ? p. 41 MADELINE GUEST You 've heard of me ? COLONEL ERFURT I have indeed . That 's why it 's incredible . There is a certain incongruity of associations . Please  --  He offers her the stool . SCHOEN shuts the gate . You have come to examine us ? MADELINE GUEST No . COLONEL ERFURT There is someone here  --  in whom you take an interest ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT What evil fortune . Good for us , for it brings you here , but bad for those who have friends within . MADELINE GUEST Always ? COLONEL ERFURT No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom penetrates the walls and the bird is free . MADELINE GUEST You make it sound easy . COLONEL ERFURT It is easy . And I assure you , Miss Guest , I shall be as helpful as I can . Come , sit down .  --  MADELINE sits . What mortal man has so mingled good luck and bad as to be here and bring you here to seek him ? MADELINE GUEST I have come to ask permission to visit a prisoner who is held here . p. 42 COLONEL ERFURT Yes ? MADELINE GUEST Raoul St. Cloud . I think I have filled out all the necessary forms . COLONEL ERFURT Yes , indeed you have . You are not related to this gentleman ? MADELINE GUEST You will find that answered in the questionnaire , I think . No , I 'm not . COLONEL ERFURT You wish to see him for sentimental reasons ? MADELINE GUEST I wish to see him . COLONEL ERFURT Are you married , Miss Guest ? MADELINE GUEST No , I am not . COLONEL ERFURT You have a romantic interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not answer you . COLONEL ERFURT Why ? Do tell me why . MADELINE GUEST It seems to me that any answer I might make in this place , and to you , would lessen both him and me . COLONEL ERFURT Yes , perhaps . Yes  --  I see . I will put the question another way . You would make sacrifices to see M. St. Cloud ? Important sacrifices ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . p. 43 COLONEL ERFURT I think this answer may be regarded as satisfactory . MADELINE GUEST He is here ? COLONEL ERFURT St. Cloud ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT Yes , Raoul St. Cloud is here . MADELINE GUEST May I see him ? COLONEL ERFURT I am not entirely a free agent , Miss Guest . There are rules . I must look into the case a little further before I can answer that question . And a little earlier or later in the day does n't matter . Or does it ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , it does matter . COLONEL ERFURT I should have thought the lover would reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over  --  the later I see him the fewer hours of absence left in the day . But no lover reflects . MADELINE GUEST As you know , Colonel Erfurt , if you wish to make conversation I must listen . COLONEL ERFURT Ah , you think I am wasting time ! No , no  --  there is a purpose . It is true that I take an artistic pleasure in the beauty and vehemence of a passion , but as I study it I think always of the value it may have , not for me , but for the state . p. 44 MADELINE GUEST I understand you . COLONEL ERFURT Excuse me . Lieutenant ? There is a scream off stage , MADELINE rises . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , sir ? COLONEL ERFURT I need the papers concerning Raoul St. Cloud . Will you bring them ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN At once . There is another scream off stage . SCHOEN goes out . COLONEL ERFURT Do you feel unreal here , Miss Guest ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , I do . COLONEL ERFURT Do you know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will not offend me . No , I should like to hear . MADELINE GUEST I have a horror of prisons . Of being shut up . And of those who shut people up . COLONEL ERFURT But is that all ? Surely it goes deeper ? MADELINE GUEST I once visited an asylum for the insane . Here  --  COLONEL ERFURT Here it seems to you that the lunatics are in charge and those who are normal are restrained ? p. 45 MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT You see , I 'm familiar with the notion . It recurs among those who come here for the first time . It 's the natural and usual reaction . Because you have stepped , when you enter this room , from one world to another  --  from the old world to the new . You have stepped from freedom and chivalry and legend , into science , reality and control . SCHOEN enters with the dossier . Please  --  ERFURT sits , examining the dossier . Yes , I thought I remembered . M. St. Cloud is by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . COLONEL ERFURT He has found relief from the journalistic routine by examining the facial index and tracing the ancestry of mankind ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT It would be easier if he had stuck to journalism . MADELINE GUEST Why do you say so ? COLONEL ERFURT I have a review here of Mein Kampf , written by St. Cloud in 1931 for Le Journal des Dbats . Unfortunately he analyzes our Fuehrer 's theories somewhat to their disadvantage . He also takes occasion to comment on the Fuehrer 's anatomical construction . p. 46 MADELINE GUEST This was printed in 1931 ? COLONEL ERFURT Yes . MADELINE GUEST And it is still held important ? COLONEL ERFURT Unfortunately again , there were recriminations in the press , and , to make matters worse , our leader was subjected to personal attack  --  which he remembers . MADELINE GUEST Does this  --  have a bearing  --  on my request for an interview ? COLONEL ERFURT Miss Guest , this dossier carries a stamp , which might be interpreted : No Privileges . Now a visit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . MADELINE GUEST I may not see him ? COLONEL ERFURT I 'm sorry , you may not see him . MADELINE GUEST There was-a promise . COLONEL ERFURT From whom ? MADELINE GUEST He refused his name . But he was a German official . COLONEL ERFURT You should have insisted on the name . Would you accept such a commitment from a stranger ? MADELINE GUEST But he knew you . He has influence with you . COLONEL ERFURT How do you know ? p. 47 MADELINE GUEST It was he who arranged this appointment . COLONEL ERFURT At a price ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT There is a Latin adage-Caveat emptor . MADELINE GUEST But if he was not a responsible official  --  how does it happen that he can arrange a meeting with you ? COLONEL ERFURT Ah , yes  --  I understand . There perhaps we should be willing to acknowledge a defect . State control is the only efficient control , but it requires a large corps of officials  --  a bureaucracy , if you like . Under a bureaucracy , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a modest amount of bribery becomes necessary to the functioning of the state . MADELINE GUEST Then your government is for sale ? COLONEL ERFURT No , no , no  --  not at all . But the government , being wise , accepts this unavoidable bribery as a new form of taxation . Of whatever you paid the officer for the interview , he will keep only a part . The government will take its share . And thereby we convert a weakness into a source of strength . You are an American citizen , and therefore not taxable , yet we have collected a tax from you . MADELINE GUEST RisingIt was promised me that I should see Raoul St. Cloud . p. 48 COLONEL ERFURT Going through the papers , I find that it can not be arranged . MADELINE GUEST I 'm willing to pay for that , too . COLONEL ERFURT You have misunderstood , Miss Guest . Not for a principality , not for half a kingdom , would any one of us run counter to a decision from Berlin . MADELINE GUEST But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? COLONEL ERFURT Very seldom . The rules are against it . There are special cases . MADELINE GUEST It happens somewhat at your discretion ? COLONEL ERFURT I interpret the rules , but the rules are not elastic , Miss Guest . The inner door opens , and the FLEURYS are led through to the outer door . When she has passed through the inner wire door MME . FLEURY collapses and is carried out by a GUARD . What they have seen within has broken them down to speechless , whining animals . They can say nothing , hardly know where they are . ERFURT speaks in German to SCHOEN . Verdammt nochmal , konnten Sie das nicht verhindern gerade wenn die Amerikanerin hier ist ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Sie sagten fnfzehn Minuten , Herr Oberst. p. 49 COLONEL ERFURT I 'm sorry about the interruption . Please sit down  --  MADELINE GUEST Facing him across his deskColonel Erfurt , I can not accept what you have said as final . It 's not easy to speak of love in this new world you have made  --  this wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love . I only know that since he was taken , I have had no hope save in the hope of his return , no rest from torment save in seeking him . Since I have known that he was here  --  the walls of the cruel and ugly prison have gone with me wherever I am . Since I have believed that there would come a moment when I would see him-I have loved only in the hope of that one point in time . COLONEL ERFURT I believe you , Miss Guest . And I would help you if I could . MADELINE GUEST Others go through that door . COLONEL ERFURT No one will ever go through it to see Raoul St. Cloud . That is , and will remain , quite impossible . There is a terrible word written on these papers . The word sterben . It is not often used . I do not often see it . But when I do , I know that all decisions in that case are out of my hands . MADELINE GUEST I can not believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your hands only if you wish it so . You must let me see him- p. 50 COLONEL ERFURT It 's impossible- MADELINE GUEST Nothing 's impossible ! Perhaps I make a difficulty for you , perhaps it is easier to put me aside and go on with your work ! But I will not be put aside ! You shall not stop me ! I shall haunt this prison ! I shall appeal to your superiors ! I shall not leave France till I have seen Raoul St. Cloud ! COLONEL ERFURT Shall I tell you what will happen if you stay in France ? MADELINE GUEST I know what must happen ! COLONEL ERFURT You will say to yourself , there must be a way out ! There must be a weakness ! There must be somewhere a corrupt guard ! These hastily constructed camps can not be impervious ! You will go to work to find this one weakness you need , this little crevice which may widen to a crack in our system ! You will use all the ardor and the ingenuity of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your talent , your time and your money will be wasted ! And now that you have heard this , now that you know this-will you be sensible ? Will you give up this living dead man , and your dead love , and go sensibly back to America ? MADELINE GUEST No . COLONEL ERFURT No ? You are spoiled and soft , you Americans . You have never come up against sharp iron . It is your destiny to be beaten ! Schoen , lassen Sie sie doch raus. p. 51 MADELINE GUEST I will never be beaten . Never . I will stay-and I will win ! COLONEL ERFURT If you are wise , you will go home now . Nobody wins here . This is a camp of dead men . MADELINE GUEST I will stay , and I will win ! She turns and goes out. @x SCENE : The sitting room of MADELINE 'S suite in the Plaza Athene in Paris . An inner door to the left , an outer door to the right . Curtained French windows in the center . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is September , 1941 , one year later than Act One . CISSIE sits on couch at center , mending a stocking . A chair is wedged under the handle of the door . There is a knock , and CISSIE listens instead of moving . There is another knock . MAISIE TOMPKINS Off stageCissie ! CISSIE RisingI do n't know you . MAISIE TOMPKINS Do n't be an ass , Cissie . It 's Maisie Tompkins . CISSIE Who ? MAISIE TOMPKINS It 's big foot . You know , the American big foot . CISSIE Yes , madame . She removes the chair from under door handle and opens the door . MAISIE enters . MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , perhaps you wanted to be alone ! CISSIE replaces the chair under door handle . You 're an incredible ass , Cissie . That flying buttress is no good . It intimidates your friends , and arouses your enemies . p. 53 CISSIE It 's very useful , madame . MAISIE TOMPKINS And do n't call me madame ! In spite of my height , size and reach , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . CISSIE Yes , mademoiselle . MAISIE TOMPKINS Is Miss Guest in ? CISSIE She goes all day to see German officials , but she will be here soon . MAISIE TOMPKINS Do n't you know that if any German soldier wants to come in here he will ? CISSIE I have had experience with German soldiers . MAISIE TOMPKINS Where ? CISSIE First in Vienna , because I am Viennese . I was there when they took Austria . Then I was in Prague when they took Czecho-Slovakia . And I was here when they took France , bad luck . Always in hotels . MAISIE TOMPKINS And out of this wealth of experience , you learn to set chairs under door handles ? CISSIE Look , mademoiselle . A German soldier works by what is on his little card . He has orders on a little card . What to do with the proprietor , what to do with the guests . What to do when the door is open , what to do when the door is locked . But what to do when a chair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes away to find out . p. 54 MAISIE TOMPKINS But he comes back . CISSIE Then you have time . You can get the hell out ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Where to ? CISSIE Maybe another hotel room . MAISIE TOMPKINS But sooner or later he catches up with you ! She goes to the window . CISSIE Later , yes . But any time you have with no German soldier in your room , that is cake ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Looking outI get you . They 're goose-stepping again . About seven million of them . As far as the eye can see both ways . It gives me nausea . CISSIE It 's better not to look out ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Where did you learn that wisdom ? CISSIE In Prague . One is tempted to drop things on them , and that 's bad . MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , I suppose it might lead to misunderstanding . CISSIE Also maybe somebody next door drops something on them . Then they see you in the window and they shoot you ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Stepping back from the windowYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want you to look at them . Why do they kick their feet so high ? They think it 's very attractive ! MAISIE TOMPKINS Any luck with your marketing today ? CISSIE The usual luck . MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , I heard a rumor of meat at the new market , so I went over and stood in line . They offered me a quarter of cat meat . I do n't mean meat for cats-no , part of the carcass of a slain cat . I wish now I 'd bought it . I do n't know what I had to go and get squeamish for , at the wrong moment . What do you mean by the usual luck ? CISSIE Turnips . MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , I was at the wrong counter , and did n't even get turnips this morning . You could n't feed a third party-with an appetite like a diplodoccus ? She sits . CISSIE Yes , we could . MAISIE TOMPKINS When you studied history was there a paragraph about the Parisians eating horse during the siege of 1870 ? CISSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAISIE TOMPKINS I used to be horrified ! But by habit I 'm a meateater , Cissie . It keeps running in mind-if I only had a horse . A whole horse to myself . It makes a lady shiver to think what she 'd do if pressed ! You 're the next thing to a cannibal , Cissie ! p. 56 CISSIE I ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I 'm on the verge of cannibalism , and you 're very handy ! CISSIE No-no . I have two water crackers , that I was saving . She opens a drawer of the desk , takes out a paper bag , and offers one cracker to MAISIE . May I offer you one ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Bless you . Takes the cracker , bites into it is that a place for food ? CISSIE In the kitchen somebody might take them . The maid comes in to clean . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 're not hungry ? CISSIE Everybody 's always hungry . MAISIE TOMPKINS I had no breakfast-nor lunch-nor tiffin , nor tea . We 've got to get out of this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CISSIE Is n't Miss Guest going back to America , mademoiselle ? MAISIE TOMPKINS She says she is , but then she puts it off from week to week . CISSIE I came to work for her because she was American . She promised to take me with her . MAISIE TOMPKINS She has finished the cracker and starts picking up crumbs from her lap and eating them . Well , I 've been sitting around this modern version of hell long enough now , waiting for her to give up and go back with me . But she 's a monomaniac now . It 's really an obsession with her . She wo n't give up , and she wo n't go . p. 57 CISSIE If she waits for the officer in the prison camp , then perhaps we stay a long time in France . MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . Tell me , did you ever know anybody to escape ? Does it happen ? CISSIE Yes , once . It was somebody I wished him to stay where he was . That kind could escape . MAISIE TOMPKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move heaven and earth to get out ? CISSIE I should say never . MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , I should say never . That 's what she wo n't believe . There is a knock at the outer door . CISSIE puts her finger to her lips . There is another knock , then the door handle moves . A pause . CISSIE WhisperingYou see , he goes away . MAISIE TOMPKINS Rising , crossing to the doorWell I 'm not going to be found here when he gets back ! She opens the door . Yes ! Yes ! You wanted something ? MUELLER OutsideI wished to find Miss Guest . MAISIE TOMPKINS She 's not in. p. 58 MUELLER Thank you . Could you tell me when she is expected to return ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Within a few minutes , I think . CISSIE Yes , she should be here by now . MUELLER Thank you . I 'm sorry to trouble you . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 're quite welcome . She closes the door . Only I wish you 'd explain why you come trying people 's doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CISSIE No . He 's not a soldier . MAISIE TOMPKINS Perhaps one of Himmler 's boys . CISSIE It could be . CISSIE replaces the chair under the handle of the door . MAISIE TOMPKINS It 's getting too thick around here for comfort . What kind of devious business are we in now ? I wonder- CISSIE Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS I wo n't stay any longer . And I shall make that very clear . Today . By the way Cissie , do n't worry too much about getting out of France . If we ca n't get a passport fixed up for you , the fishermen are still carrying passengers from Brittany to England . p. 59 CISSIE Oh , thank you mademoiselle . There is a knock on the outside door again . It 's Miss Guest . She removes the chair from under the handle , and opens the door.MADELINE enters . CISSIE closes the door after her . MADELINE GUEST Thank you Cissie . Oh , Maisie , I hoped you 'd be here . MAISIE TOMPKINS I wish you lived on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man just now to see you . MADELINE GUEST Oh ? CISSIE Not a soldier , but with a uniform . MADELINE GUEST Oh , I must have passed him . But it does n't matter . He 'll be back , I think . MAISIE TOMPKINS I think perhaps I 'll be leaving . MADELINE GUEST Oh no , Maisie . It 's not an official visit . MAISIE TOMPKINS He did try the door handle . MADELINE GUEST He did ? Well , I 'm beyond objecting to that . Is there anything for the inner woman , Cissie ? Any slight thing ? CISSIE I 'm afraid- MADELINE GUEST Any tea ? p. 60 CISSIE Birch bark tea . MADELINE GUEST That 's all right-and just a trace of- CISSIE There 's a water cracker . She holds out the paper bag to MADELINE . MADELINE GUEST That 's your water cracker , Cissie . I wo n't take that . CISSIE There 's nothing else except the turnips , and they 're for dinner . If you would share the water cracker with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUEST That 's immoral . Yes , I will share it with you , Cissie . CISSIE I 'll get the tea . She goes within . MAISIE TOMPKINS You look tired . MADELINE GUEST Lying back on the couchNo , not tired . Just shabby , and down at heel , and completely out of cold cream . MAISIE TOMPKINS Tired too . And hungry . MADELINE GUEST Not beyond bearing . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 've been going it like a soldier for a whole year , Madeline . And whether you 'll admit it or not you 're tired and hungry , and just about done in . I can remember four distinct plots to get Raoul out of that camp . Four times you 've built up a fantastic and elaborate machine-complete with corrupt guards , escape , transportation , fake passport , underground passage out of occupied France , and God knows what all , and then it always crashed because somebody squealed and he could n't get out of the camp after all . It 's about to happen again-I can see that same feverish hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it wo n't work , and then you 'll be in despair again . p. 61 MADELINE GUEST This time-we have a chance . MAISIE TOMPKINS It 's come to that now . This time you have a chance . You used to be sure , remember ? MADELINE GUEST Maisie , the chance was never so good before . Never once . There are three guards on the inside , helping . Because I 've promised to get them to America if things turn out well . MAISIE TOMPKINS You believe they 're helping ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 've believed it before . MADELINE GUEST Oh , Maisie-they torture people there-and they die under it . Suppose we came a day late . And then suppose we came just in time , when they were about-to kill him . I want to come in time , Maisie . MAISIE TOMPKINS I know , Madeline-that 's why I stayed with you- MADELINE GUEST You were wonderful to stay . I could n't have kept on without you . MAISIE TOMPKINS And yet we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of my money a good while ago , and you helped me out . But that ca n't go on forever. - Even you- MADELINE GUEST No . I 'm nearly at the end . p. 62 MAISIE TOMPKINS Would n't it be wise if you were to turn over to me what we 'll need to get out of France and to America , we three ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . I 'll do that . I 've been going over what I have . Would three thousand take us home ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I think so , with a little to spare . MADELINE GUEST But with bribes , we might need it ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . MADELINE GUEST You shall have it tomorrow. - Only-  MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes ? MADELINE GUEST That means that-with what I 'm spending tonight-that 's all we 'll have . MAISIE TOMPKINS You see , if we 're caught here without money , then it 's completely hopeless . If we get out-you might earn enough to come back and try again. - MADELINE GUEST Yes , I 've thought of that- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rises and embraces MAISIE , as CISSIE enters with the tea tray . Oh , thank you , Cissie . Shall I break it ? She picks up the one remaining cracker. p. 63 CISSIE Please . MAISIE TOMPKINS No , no , not three parts . CISSIE goes within again . MADELINE GUEST Do n't be silly . You 're having tea with us . MAISIE TOMPKINS I 'm weak ; I accept . There is a knock at the outer door . MADELINE rises , puts tea tray down on the desk , and opens the door . MADELINE GUEST Come in . CORPORAL MUELLER stands just outside the door . Come in . MUELLER enters . You wish to see me alone , of course . MUELLER I could return , perhaps ? MADELINE GUEST No , no- To MAISIEIf you do n't mind , Maisie- MAISIE TOMPKINS Not at all . Starts to go toward the bedroom MUELLER I would rather there was no one in the apartment . MAISIE TOMPKINS Shall I wait in the hall ? MUELLER Please . MAISIE crosses to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out by the hall . MUELLER closes the door after her. p. 64 MADELINE GUEST You did n't come to the Tabarin . MUELLER I was being followed . This afternoon they lost me , so I came here . MADELINE GUEST You 're distrusted ? MUELLER I think not . They have us watched from time to time , just to make sure . MADELINE GUEST You promised to bring a note from M. St. Cloud . MUELLER Here it is . Forgive me- He starts to look about , opens the bedroom door . CISSIE OutsideWas wollen Sie ? She comes in . Mademoiselle- MADELINE GUEST Oh , Cissie-I forgot- CISSIE goes out to the hall . MUELLER shuts the door . Now I must know all the plans in detail . MUELLER What do you want me to tell you ? MADELINE GUEST I have a slight anxiety-please sit down- MUELLER sits. about a daylight escape . Why must it happen in the afternoon ? MUELLER Is it necessary for you to know this ? p. 65 MADELINE GUEST Before I give you any money , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at three tomorrow because we take advantage of something which will happen at the camp tomorrow at that hour. - MADELINE GUEST What will happen ? MUELLER Sometimes the state wishes prisoners to be free , but can not dismiss them publicly . Tomorrow it is arranged that certain prisoners depart under fire . MADELINE GUEST And how do you know this ? MUELLER I am one of the guards ordered to assist . MADELINE GUEST Tell me how it will be done . Do you mean-in the confusion-M . St. Cloud will somehow slip out of the enclosure with the others ? MUELLER Something like that . The fence is being repaired at one point . Guards and prisoners go back and forth through the opening . Now at exactly three o'clock , an automobile will be drawn up across the road , and certain prisoners are instructed to jump into the car , which will drive away . The guards will fire over the car . M. St. Cloud will be among the prisoners chosen for the work at the bridge , and he will slip into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will take M. St. Cloud to the room you have specified in the Bordeaux Apartments . p. 66 MADELINE GUEST And the men for whom the escape was planned ? MUELLER I will tell them at the last moment that another is to join them . MADELINE GUEST And the guards who are helping you ? You are sure of each of them ? They are all ready and willing to go through with this ? MUELLER Do n't worry ; they will carry out their part . MADELINE GUEST And you have made my appointment with Colonel Erfurt for three ? MUELLER Yes , there is an appointment made for you with Colonel Erfurt for three o'clock . We count on you to keep him at his desk with a discussion of the prison rules . MADELINE GUEST Have you brought the book ? MUELLER Yes , and I have marked the page . It would be better if you could be there a little before three , just to keep him in his office . MADELINE GUEST I shall keep him there if I can . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in this one envelope , as I promised . The other half I will give to the driver of the car when he comes to the apartment . MUELLER I will have to have that now . MADELINE GUEST That was not our bargain . p. 67 MUELLER The others refuse to take part unless I can put the money in their hands tonight . You see , after the break , we must all three leave France instantly . We have no wish to die here . MADELINE GUEST Very well . She hands him another envelope . MUELLER If there is anything else I can do ? You have n't asked about passports . MADELINE GUEST I 've arranged that separately . MUELLER Good . Good-bye . MADELINE GUEST Good-bye . And thanks from my heart for this . MUELLER Thank you . But it is not a matter of sentiment . He clicks his heels , opens the door and goes out . MADELINE stands looking at the letter from RAOUL . The door opens again , and MAISIE and CISSIE enter . MAISIE TOMPKINS Does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In his own hand . No one could write like that . This time it comes true . She kisses MAISIE . Tomorrow at three  --  something will happen ! MAISIE TOMPKINS In broad daylight ? p. 68 MADELINE GUEST Yes . MAISIE TOMPKINS It sounds unlikely again . MADELINE GUEST We must choose what we 'll take , Cissie , and be ready to go tomorrow . CISSIE Yes , mademoiselle . She goes out . MAISIE TOMPKINS That passport factory wants an enormous sum for Cissie 's visa . MADELINE GUEST Please do n't quarrel with them over money , Maisie . There must n't be any delay ; we 're leaving in the afternoon . MAISIE TOMPKINS You and I go by plane ? MADELINE GUEST I suppose so . MAISIE TOMPKINS And Raoul by underground ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . Underground to the coast , then with a fisherman to England . MAISIE TOMPKINS Will he be safe ? MADELINE GUEST Safe ? No , not safe , but cared for and watched over . When a prisoner escapes , the whole French nation hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All those that help him will put themselves in danger of death  --  but they 'll help him . The peasants and shopkeepers that give him shelter and food and pass him through the lines are all likely to be shot the next morning , but they 'll help him anyway . How could anybody give up when there 's courage like that around us ? There are such gallant , such wonderful people in the world ! They make one believe in so many things , that England will win , that France will be free , and that he will be free tomorrow ! Only , Maisie ?  --  p. 69 MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , darling  --  MADELINE GUEST It 's been a year , and I begin to find so much gray in my hair . When I look in the mirror , there are deep lines in my face that he never saw . Will he turn away from me , Maisie ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Nonsense . There 'll be plenty of gray in his hair , and lines in his face . MADELINE GUEST One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily , lightly even , but I shall never see beyond it while I live . CURTAIN p. 70 Act 2 , Scene 2 Act TwoSCENE II SCENE : The office of the Concentration Camp again . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN sits at his desk . ERFURT 'S place is empty , but a GUARD stands as usual at the door at the right . CORPORAL BEHRENS look in through grating . CORPORAL BEHRENS Ist der Alte hier ? 1ST GUARD Nein . He opens the door , admitting BEHRENS and CORPORAL SCHULTZ . CORPORAL BEHRENS Lieutenant ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes . CORPORAL BEHRENS Got a cigarette ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN The Commandant is due here any minute . CORPORAL BEHRENS We have a tough job , and my comrade gets a little sick . Let him sit here and have a smoke . SCHOEN gives SCHULTZ a cigarette . CORPORAL SHULZ Thanks , that 's better . CORPORAL BEHRENS He do n't like it in there any more ; he goes green around the edges . CORPORAL SHULZ You lie , I do like it ! A man can ask for a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 CORPORAL SHULZ You lie ! I like it well enough . At first I did n't at first it made me sick . But now I find there 's a kind of  --  yes , there 's a kind of joy in it  --  a kind of joy in the workmanship  --  it 's a thing you do for the state , and therefore you do it well . CORPORAL BEHRENS Tell him what we did this afternoon . CORPORAL SHULZ This afternoon , yes . A funny thing we did this afternoon  --  we took one of them  --  LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I do n't care to hear it ! You will sit quietly , or go back inside . CORPORAL SHULZ Yes , Lieutenant . COLONEL ERFURT Off stageNein  --  auf keinen Fall  --  BEHRENS and SCHULTZ hurry to the inner door , as ERFURT enters , and go out with hasty salutes . What are they doing here ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Should I be stricter with the guards , Colonel Erfurt ? COLONEL ERFURT When you keep bloodhounds , you must let them run . Once take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink their teeth with the same gusto . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Good . I 'll take my cue from that . p. 72 COLONEL ERFURT I 've sometimes wondered if you were set here to watch me . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I hope I have not deserved that imputation . Why do you say this ? COLONEL ERFURT I 'm wondering why I said it . One ca n't always say what 's expected of him . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Have I displeased you in some way , sir ? COLONEL ERFURT Whether we like it or not , there 's a barrier between those who were men when our Fuehrer came to power and those who were children . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN But not between us , I assure you . COLONEL ERFURT Have you never looked at men of my generation , thinking : They are not pure ? They have lived under a loose , degenerate regime  --  they may long for it again  --  may prove untrue to the spartan thought and ascetic way of life that must prevail if we are to win ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN This has occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our great leaders are among the older men , our greatest leaders . COLONEL ERFURT And so that doubt is cancelled ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It is cancelled . However I have reflected on National Socialism , Colonel Erfurt , and it seems to me that I observe something . p. 73 COLONEL ERFURT What is it ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It seems to be the heart of our system that no man works alone . We hunt in pairs , or run in packs . One man alone is dangerous . COLONEL ERFURT You mean to say that no man is given complete responsibility ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I have not said that . I have said that two men together are found more dependable than one alone . COLONEL ERFURT It could be said then that we watch each other ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You are my superior officer , Colonel Erfurt . It is your duty to watch me , no doubt . As for myself , I am placed here under orders . COLONEL ERFURT Then why do you make each week a supplementary report to Berlin ? PauseYou do make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ? You might at least have told me . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I was directed not to tell you . COLONEL ERFURT Of course . I should have known . I am irritable today . You will kindly overlook my rudeness . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Surely . He looks at his watch . It 's five minutes to three . Should I admit Miss Guest now ? p. 74 COLONEL ERFURT Oh , Miss Guest  --  Looks at his watchYes , let her come in . SCHOEN pushes a buzzer and a GUARD appears . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Bringen Sie Miss Guest herein . 1ST GUARD Jawohl , Herr Lieutenant . He ushers MADELINE in . COLONEL ERFURT RisingCome in , Miss Guest . This must be a short interview , for I have much to do . Please sit down . MADELINE GUEST Seating herself I shall make it brief , Colonel Erfurt . There are two things of which I wish to speak . COLONEL ERFURT Come then . MADELINE GUEST First , I shall not be able to remain much longer in France . COLONEL ERFURT Yes , I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to interview a certain prisoner ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT The situation is unchanged . p. 75 MADELINE GUEST Second , I have been allowed to read a copy of the book of orders issued to the directors of prisons by the authorities of the Third Reich . In the third section , page 57 , it is distinctly stated that you may grant interviews with inmates at will . COLONEL ERFURT Picking up a small book from his deskIs this the volume ? MADELINE GUEST Looking at the bookYes . COLONEL ERFURT It is forbidden to laymen ; however you are quite right . Turning pagesPage 57 . Only you should have read further . I have the power to allow interviews without check , but I am responsible to my superiors for any abuse of that power . Starts to close book MADELINE GUEST May I see the paragraph ? COLONEL ERFURT Please . He hands her the book . MADELINE GUEST And how is abuse of that power defined . COLONEL ERFURT It is not defined ; that 's the point . Each man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUEST I have had legal advice concerning your responsibility , Colonel Erfurt , and , unless I have misunderstood , the commandants of camps or prisons are given wide latitude in the treatment of inmates . p. 76 COLONEL ERFURT Miss Guest , for a little fee you can obtain any version of our laws you wish  --  MADELINE GUEST There are political prisoners under your supervision  --  who live in their own homes  --  who  --  GUARD enters from the left . COLONEL ERFURT Excuse me  --  To the GUARDWas giebst ? 1ST GUARD Corporal Mueller . COLONEL ERFURT Herein mit ihm . The GUARD exits as MUELLER enters . MUELLER Herr Oberst , Sie haben befohlen sie zu erinnern . He lays a report on ERFURT 'S desk . ERFURT stamps a pass for him , and he goes inside . MADELINE GUEST Is M. St. Cloud still here ? COLONEL ERFURT Yes . MADELINE GUEST Is he well ? COLONEL ERFURT Yes , he is in excellent health . Partly as a consequence , I may tell you now , of your continued interest in him . MADELINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that you were in touch with friends in your own country . We thought it to our advantage that you should not be able to report ill treatment in this instance . Also , while he lived , and you were well to do , you sent tribute to Berlin . p. 77 MADELINE GUEST Yes , I see . COLONEL ERFURT However , the attitude of your government is now so definitely hostile , that we have nothing more to gain by leniency , and we note each withdrawal from your account . You understand ? The clock strikes three . MADELINE GUEST Yes . There is a pause , then a machine-gun begins to bark in the distance . A siren and a bell are heard simultaneously . MADELINE rises . SCHOEN also rises and opens the gate for a GUARD who passes through rapidly to the inner door . As the siren dies away SCHOEN 'S telephone rings . SCHOEN picks it up and listens . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Alles in Ordnung . COLONEL ERFURT Do n't be disturbed . This is not an alert . Once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the siren and do a great deal of shooting and running about , and certain prisoners drive away in a car , but we want them to go . It is all prearranged . It 's a political matter . MADELINE GUEST How happy they must be to leave this place . She rises . I fear there is nothing to be gained by prolonging this interview , Colonel Erfurt . This will be my last visit here . She turns to go. p. 78 COLONEL ERFURT You are leaving ? MADELINE GUEST I  --  yes  --  you gave me my answer long ago  --  nothing that I can say to you brings me nearer to him . I 'll go now . She lifts a hand to the gate . Please  --  COLONEL ERFURT Not yet . You have kept a long and bitter vigil here in France , I know . Even I am not insensible to that . There is a character in Shakespeare who says  --  " Some good I mean to do , despite of mine own nature . " Well , I shall take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN RisingYes , sir . MADELINE GUEST Quickly , to SCHOENNo , not now . COLONEL ERFURT Not now ? Did I hear correctly ? You do not wish to see M. St. Cloud ? MADELINE GUEST Let me come tomorrow . COLONEL ERFURT Why tomorrow ? MADELINE GUEST Leaning against the cageIt would be better . I had n't expected that you would say this . You 've made it so difficult , and now suddenly  --  I 've waited so long  --  I 'm afraid I 'll be ill  --  please let me come tomorrow . p. 79 COLONEL ERFURT Not tomorrow , today . Have them bring in St. Cloud at once ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Into telephoneOffizier , St. Cloud vorfhren . Hangs up phone COLONEL ERFURT When I read Shakespeare nowadays , I come to the reluctant conclusion that he is essentially alien to us . He makes , for instance  --  Edmund the villain in Lear . SCHOEN looks at MADELINE , sees her sway  --  rises  --  takes a glass of water from his desk and offers it to her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk , and sits . And what is Edmund ? A Machiavellian , a clever young fellow with no illusions , and only those scruples proper to a sensible young man . But Shakespeare makes him the villain of the piece , and kills him off in miserable fashion . No , Shakespeare 's got the whole moral system upside down . In real life the strong and ruthless win , and the weak suffer . And that 's how it should be , or must be . The right hand door opens , admitting RAOUL and a GUARD . MADELINE and RAOUL look at each other for a moment . MADELINE GUEST Oh , God . She bows her head , and starts to cry quietly . There is a pause. p. 80 COLONEL ERFURT You were n't expecting this , I know . You thought him elsewhere . Now I could have arranged that too , only it would have meant the end of my career , very definitely . An ordinary escape might be forgiven , but M. St. Cloud I must keep safe , or step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps I should warn you now to look well at each other , for this may be your last meeting . MADELINE GUEST Raoul . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes Madeline . MADELINE GUEST Crossing to him You know  --  how hard I 've tried ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , I know . MADELINE GUEST We 've been betrayed , I think . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , many times . And again today . You must leave France and take up your life . You 've wasted too much time on the impossible . MADELINE GUEST Are you in pain , Raoul ? You moved as if you were in pain . RAOUL ST . CLOUD No , no . We 're well treated here . Do n't worry about that . MADELINE GUEST Moving a step closer to himCould I kiss you ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD No , not here . It 's enough to see you . That 's what I prayed for . p. 81 MADELINE GUEST You received my messages ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD No , they allow no messages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known where you were . Sometimes I 've even known what you did . In a strange way I 've walked with you daily . MADELINE GUEST And I with you . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Remembering you , and the days we had together . When it was ugliest here , the days and nights were filled with words from you to me . MADELINE GUEST I know . COLONEL ERFURT After a pauseIf you have no more to say , perhaps we may go on to other matters . Is that all ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD You must not think we 've lost ! Even though we should lose , we have won ! They know what they are , and no words can cover it ! MADELINE GUEST We 've not lost yet ! Never believe I 'd say we 've lost ! COLONEL ERFURT Take him back to his cell . They lead RAOUL out . You are dismissed . MADELINE turns on him . And do n't say that you 'll strike me , or that you 'll die , for I speak from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go home again , for the last time . p. 82 MADELINE GUEST Yes . COLONEL ERFURT You are dismissed . MADELINE goes to the gate . SCHOEN sits watching her , not moving . Schoen !  --  SCHOEN rises and opens the gate . MADELINE goes slowly out . SCHOEN closes the gate and looks out after her . And yet something perishes with them when they are exterminated . A kind of decadent beauty one hates to lose . CURTAIN p. 83 Act 2 , Scene 3 Act TwoSCENE III SCENE : The sitting room in the hotel again . MAISIE is sitting at desk addressing tags . CISSIE sits on the couch , tying a tag on a small leather case . Several suitcases are lying on the floor , ready for the journey , Early evening of the same day . CISSIE If I get the visa , mademoiselle , then I wo n't need the passage on the fisherman 's boat . MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , it wo n't be wasted . There 's always somebody waiting to get out . CISSIE Mademoiselle , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets in New York ? All you want ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . CISSIE From open wagons on the streets ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . CISSIE Could one person buy all that was on the wagon ? MAISIE TOMPKINS If he wanted to . CISSIE Have you seen this yourself ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Oh , yes . CISSIE Have you ever bought all that was on a wagon ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Well , in my time I 've made a terrible consumption of butterfats and cheese , but never by the wagon-load. p. 84 CISSIE I think if I ever saw it I 'd buy a whole wagon-load , and take it home . I shall never stop being hungry . MAISIE TOMPKINS You 'll find that you ca n't eat much at a time . Woman wants but little food and drink , she just wants that little fairly regular . CISSIE Of course , for me , America is only a dream . MAISIE TOMPKINS I used to walk around on it , so it must be solid . CISSIE It may be that you walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . They say when you dream in English , then you are no longer German , then you can be an American . MAISIE TOMPKINS There may be something in that . CISSIE I dreamed once that I walked among the food wagons , and spoke English  --  spoke it clearly  --  and asked for ice cream . And the man filled a great vase with ice cream , and it piled up and up and up  --  like a white cloud , and when I reached for it , it blew away . I woke up , and now I 'm always hungry , and I can not dream in English again . MAISIE TOMPKINS It 'll come back . CISSIE Mademoiselle ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . CISSIE I wonder if they would ever arrest an American lady ? p. 85 MAISIE TOMPKINS What makes you say that ? CISSIE It 's after four o'clock , and she has n't come . MAISIE TOMPKINS They sometimes arrest Americans , but they do n't keep them long . They 're very careful about Americans . CISSIE But when she tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that  --  MAISIE TOMPKINS High treason ? It certainly is . It 's high treason in this country to steal a cake of soap  --  it 's high treason to think Hitler walks like a woman , but he does . We 're all guilty of that . CISSIE Yes , I suppose . The right-hand door opens . MADELINE enters . CISSIE rises . Oh , no  --  we do n't go ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't . MAISIE TOMPKINS What happened ? MADELINE GUEST It was as you predicted . He 's still in the camp . I saw him . MAISIE TOMPKINS He 's well ? MADELINE GUEST He says so . MAISIE TOMPKINS There 's nothing to do ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't know , not at the moment . p. 86 MAISIE TOMPKINS RisingSit down , darling . You look ready to collapse . MADELINE GUEST I 'm not tired . MAISIE TOMPKINS Going to herBut sit down anyway . Is this the end of our string ? MADELINE GUEST Unpack my bags , Cissie . CISSIE picks up the bags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been trying to think , but I ca n't think yet . He 'd been beaten . I could see it . MAISIE TOMPKINS I hate to say this , Madeline , but it 's hard fact , and we must face it . They 'll never let go of Raoul . MADELINE GUEST They must , Maisie . MAISIE TOMPKINS And you must go now . Do n't have the bags unpacked . You ca n't help Raoul without money ; you ca n't even live . There 's another cable from California today . They 're still offering you a fortune . MADELINE GUEST I feel that if I let go , just once , for a day  --  it might be deadly to him . MAISIE TOMPKINS But the sooner you 're home , the sooner you can return , the sooner you can help . MADELINE GUEST Maybe .  --  Yes I suppose so . We 'd better try it . She sits wearily. p. 87 MAISIE TOMPKINS I think we should . MADELINE GUEST And yet , what if  --  I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd have to face that . MADELINE GUEST And what if  --  I could n't return , and could n't save him  --  and had to try to forget ? Is n't that possible ? MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes . MADELINE GUEST What if I did forget , Maisie ? Because I had to ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I just think going is your only chance . MADELINE GUEST You do n't say his only chance . MAISIE TOMPKINS Yes , his only chance too . MADELINE GUEST Yes , perhaps  --  There is a knock on the outer door . MAISIE opens it . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN is standing in the doorway . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I 'm Lieutenant Schoen . I wish to see Miss Guest . MADELINE GUEST Yes , come in . SCHOEN enters . MAISIE closes door , and stands below it . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You remember me , Miss Guest ? I 'm from the prison . p. 88 MADELINE GUEST Yes , I remember . You have a message for me ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN No . I wish to see you concerning a personal matter if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHOEN If you will permit me , it would be easier to speak if we were alone . MADELINE GUEST What personal matter do you mean ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It would be easier  --  MAISIE TOMPKINS Shall I leave you with him , Madeline ? MADELINE GUEST Not yet . Do you wish to see me about Raoul St. Cloud ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I would rather say nothing . MADELINE GUEST Miss Tompkins is an American , as I am , and an old friend . She stayed in Paris to help me , if she could  --  to help secure the release of M. St. Cloud . If you have any honest business with me , you may speak it out quite frankly before her . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Is there a telephone in this room ? MADELINE GUEST Indicating the phoneIt is not attached , and we have insulated the outlet with books . p. 89 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes . MADELINE GUEST If you can not speak while Miss Tompkins is in the room , I 'll ask her to leave . But frankly I should prefer that she be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to say . I have seen you , as you know , many times in Direktor Erfurt 's office . I have also seen M. St. Cloud there . I feel that I know you both well , for I have listened carefully , and you are not ordinary people . MADELINE GUEST Thank you . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You have seen me only with your enemies , and so you think of me as an enemy , yet perhaps I can help you . MADELINE GUEST In what way ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN To set your friend free . MADELINE GUEST You are offering to help me  --  to help M. St. Cloud escape from the camp ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I think I can advise you concerning it . MADELINE GUEST Do you expect me to trust you ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , I see . Others have come too , offering to help , and you have trusted them  --  to no purpose . MADELINE GUEST Unless I am mistaken they came to me , one and all , from your superior officer , Colonel Erfurt , for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Forgive me if I place the matter on a realistic basis . You know who I am . In the Third Reich , and in our service , there is little money , as you know . I have at the moment , a desperate need of money . Perhaps you will forgive me if I do not go into the reason , but money I must have . MADELINE GUEST I have no more money . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Can you say that when you wear such a ring on your finger ? MADELINE GUEST I ca n't sell that . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It came from him , perhaps ? Could there be a more fitting use for his gift ? MADELINE GUEST You say you need money , but money wo n't be much good to you if you are caught aiding an escape ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN My need is such that I have not looked beyond it . I will somehow cover what I do . MADELINE GUEST What plan have you in mind ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Erfurt goes to Berlin tomorrow . I shall be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place M. St. Cloud in solitary confinement , and place with him the tools wherewith to free himself . There is a defect in our solitary system , and it has several times occurred to me that I would know how to escape from it . p. 91 MADELINE GUEST You could dispose of the diamond ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , easily . MADELINE GUEST And it would bring enough to cover necessary expenses ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I would think so , even in the present market . MADELINE GUEST It always comes to this in the end . A certain amount of money , a plausible plan of escape . But something always goes wrong . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN How could I prove to you that I am not like the others ? MADELINE GUEST Could it be proved ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I have glimpsed something in you  --  and in M. St. Cloud  --  that I admire . I do honestly wish that M. St. Cloud might have his liberty . MADELINE GUEST Going to MAISIE , taking her handMaisie  --  Maisie !  --  MAISIE TOMPKINS What position does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him always in Colonel Erfurt 's office . MAISIE TOMPKINS Are you the Director 's secretary ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN His assistant . p. 92 MAISIE TOMPKINS The game grows fairly obvious , Madeline . They 've run out of messengers . They think you may have saved a few dollars  --  no doubt they 've noticed the diamond on your finger , but they ca n't find a new face in their Gestapo to collect from you . The Director looks round him , and here 's his old stand-by , Lieutenant Schoen , as reliable as they come . " We 'll send Schoen , " he says . " But she knows Schoen , she 's seen him a dozen times ! " " Never mind , tell a big enough lie , and it 's always believed . " That 's out of the horse 's mouth . You do n't know how to dramatize your story , Lieutenant . I 've heard several of Erfurt 's little prattlers , and you 're easily in last place . MADELINE GUEST I have tried to believe you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ them . But I have heard the story too often . It no longer convinces me . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I 'm sorry . I have never been a good salesman . I 'm truly sorry . And I can not give up so easily . Perhaps you will think better of it later this evening . When you are alone . It must be this evening , or not at all . Let me leave a telephone number . Goes to the desk , writes a number on the padI can be reached at this number at any time before six . MAISIE TOMPKINS Would an honest man dare to leave his telephone number about ? Certainly not ! p. 93 MADELINE GUEST I shall not deal further with Colonel Erfurt or his agents . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You believe me his agent ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You are right , Miss Guest . I was sent by Erfurt ; believe none of us . MADELINE GUEST Thank you . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I speak the truth when I say that I wish you well . MADELINE GUEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night . He bows and goes out . MAISIE TOMPKINS He was n't lying about who sent him . That was gospel . And so ends that chapter . You ca n't bribe anybody on the inside of the camp . It just does n't work . MADELINE GUEST Is there any other way to go to work ? MAISIE TOMPKINS I have n't been able to think of any . Should we try to arrange about Cissie 's visa now ? MADELINE GUEST I suppose so . MAISIE TOMPKINS Cissie  --  we 're going ! CISSIE EnteringYes , mademoiselle . p. 94 MADELINE GUEST Would you mind  --  if I stayed here ? They know you , these people . They 'll do what they can . MAISIE TOMPKINS Are you sure you want to be here alone ? MADELINE GUEST I 'm sure I do n't want to go out , and face people . MAISIE TOMPKINS Would n't it be good for you , though ? MADELINE GUEST No darling , truly . MAISIE TOMPKINS Cissie and I will go then . Come , Cissie  --  MADELINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CISSIE Yes , thank you , I know . MAISIE TOMPKINS There 's only one thing  --  a girl has to go on , has to . No matter what happens . MADELINE GUEST Yes , no matter . MAISIE TOMPKINS We 'll come back as soon as we can . MADELINE GUEST Right . MAISIE and CISSIE go out , closing the door . MADELINE opens her bag , takes out a mirror and stares at her reflection for a moment . Yes , Madeline  --  you must learn to live without Raoul . If there 's to be no Raoul , you must learn to live without him . He would forgive your gray hairs , for his own is graying now . He would forgive those crow-tracks around your eyes , for the crows have torn at him too . But nobody else would forgive you , Madeline . The crowds wo n't forgive . They will say that you are old . Raoul would forgive you , Madeline , but there is no Raoul . Wipe out these lines , and weep less in these sleepless nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your lesson , Madeline . Learn it by heart , and never forget . I ca n't , I ca n't  --  I ca n't . She picks up the telephone slip from desk . Passy 6340  --  p. 95 CURTAIN p. 96 Act 2 , Scene 4 Act TwoSCENE IV SCENE : The same , except that the velvet drapes at the windows have been drawn , and the books have been removed from the telephone outlet . MADELINE is standing , looking out window as curtain rises . There is a knock on the outer door . MADELINE GUEST Come in . SCHOEN enters , closing the door behind him . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You asked me to come . MADELINE GUEST You said something before you left , as you stood in the doorway ; that you wished us well , that I should trust none of you . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes . MADELINE GUEST But now I know I can trust you . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You can trust nobody . MADELINE GUEST You told me that you came to betray me . You spoke the first honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all in from the world . Perhaps you did n't intend it , but you became my friend with that word . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I fear there is nothing to gain by further discussion . MADELINE GUEST Why did you speak the truth to me ? p. 97 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I have been sorry for you for many months . And for M. St. Cloud . One must look on at many things  --  but there comes a time when one wishes to put the victim out of his misery . It 's not a crime , even in the Reich , to feel sympathy with suffering . MADELINE GUEST But to help , that 's a crime ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Even in your own country , it is a crime to aid a criminal . MADELINE GUEST Have you thought what it would be like to live in another country ? Where there is freedom of thought , where the state allows all possible freedom ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I have thought of it . You must remember that we regard that as a diseased condition . MADELINE GUEST Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELINE GUEST Then you must have wished for freedom . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Why must I ? MADELINE GUEST I have been thinking of these things too . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Then tell me why ? MADELINE GUEST Because no wild thing was ever shut in a cage without wishing for freedom . And of all wild things in the world , the most uncontrollable  --  the least tameable  --  is the human mind . No king or priest or dictator has ever tamed it . It can not rest in captivity . It can not sleep . It has no relish for prison food . And the mind of Germany is caged . p. 98 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Caged by our enemies . MADELINE GUEST Do you believe that ? SCHOEN looks nervously about the room . No . You are free here . In this room there is no compulsion on you to lie . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN This is not a useful conversation . MADELINE GUEST I have seen many men in the world you live in who hate that world . There is a certain veiled regard in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare speak out . And of all those who carry this look about with them , you have seemed the most unhappy . From the first day I saw you in Erfurt 's office that look has been on your face . I did n't know what it meant then , but I know now . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You will forgive me , but I must go . He turns , and crosses to the door . MADELINE GUEST I wish you to take this ring  --  the one you asked for this afternoon . She offers the ring . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Why do you offer it now ? You have had every warning . MADELINE GUEST Holding it out to himYes. p. 99 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN If you offer it , I shall take it , for those are my instructions . MADELINE GUEST Yes . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You have no hope for recompense . MADELINE GUEST Yes , I have . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN None whatever . He takes the ring from her . MADELINE GUEST The best hope I 've ever had . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN What hope ? MADELINE GUEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather you took it back . MADELINE GUEST No ; you 're to do with it as you like . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You know what I must do with it . Yet how can I , if I remember you here , hoping that it 's used for him ! Take it back . You do n't know what you ask of me ! Suppose it 's true that I 'm caught in a net , that I hate it ? It 's evil to be in prison , but if you escape , you 're an outlaw everywhere . So  --  one sticks to the prison , and turns the torture machine , and by and by we shall conquer the earth , no doubt , and give it a rest from torture . MADELINE GUEST Is it true that Erfurt goes to Berlin tomorrow ? p. 100 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , that much was true . MADELINE GUEST True that there 's a chance of escape , that the solitary cells would let a man through ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes . A little truth was mingled with the fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you dare not , for you will never know when my words are lies . You could never be sure that I had ceased to be your enemy . MADELINE GUEST I 'm sure of it now . I was sure of it when I called you back . And if you wished to keep your old life , if you wished to thrive as Lieutenant Schoen in Erfurt 's camp  --  you should not have come when I called , for you knew why I called you . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN It is my duty to keep the ring . He puts it in his pocket . I must go . MADELINE GUEST I shall wait for your message . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I think there will be no message . Good night . MADELINE GUEST Wait , let me look at you . She looks into his face . You see , there are tears in your eyes . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , but I have seen tears in Erfurt 's eyes , when a man lay dying . And he let the man die . You must not depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on yours . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Turning away from herIf I call you tonight , then we shall try to work something out  --  we shall try to work something out together ! But if I do n't call , then put it all out of your mind , for there 's nothing to be done ! MADELINE GUEST But you will call ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Good night . He opens the door and rushes out . MADELINE GUEST Good night . She stands at door a moment , then sinks to a chair. @x SCENE : The scene is the corner of the gardens at Versailles , as we saw it before . It is early evening , two days later . HENRI sits on the steps reading a newspaper . DESEZE enters from above , carrying two park chairs . DESEZE Coming down the stepsYou should not read in this fading light , Henri . Or do you look at the pictures ? HENRI Every day I spell out the list on the last page . DESEZE What list is it ? HENRI The names of those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look for ? HENRI I 'm not sure . For the names of those I know , perhaps . The name of our Fargeau is there this evening . DESEZE Fargeau ? HENRI He kept trying to buy a pistol , but there were no pistols to be had . So he did it another way . He took one German with him . DESEZE He did what we have all wanted to do . Yes , I remember what he said to me : " I am too old for many things , but not too old to die . " HENRI I have a kind of envy of Fargeau . He was a common person like myself . His work clothes still hang beside mine in the pavilion . Now he has become something good to remember . But I have a fear of torture . p. 103 DESEZE Yes , I have a fear of torture , and of death . Yet sometimes I hope I will do it . I hope that some night a large German will sleep with his boots on . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spoonful of blood . It 's time to put things away . HENRI RisingYou will save the paper for me ? DESEZE Yes  --  we must save it . This is an honorable epitaph , though on perishable material . SCHOEN enters from the right . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN To DESEZEIs your name Henri ? HENRI My name is Henri . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Will you come with me for a moment ? HENRI I  --  I have in some way offended the authorities ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN No , this is not such a matter . I ask it as a favor of you . Come with me for a moment , please . HENRI To DESEZEShould I go ? DESEZE One has no choice . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You will come at once . HENRI and SCHOEN go out to the right . DESEZE looks after them . MADELINE enters above and comes to the steps. p. 104 DESEZE Mademoiselle ! MADELINE GUEST Yes ? DESEZE Surely it was you who came early in the mornings . It was you who met the officer here . MADELINE GUEST Going down the stepsYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen you . MADELINE GUEST Sitting in chair at centerA year , I think . More than a year . DESEZE Will the gentleman be here this evening ? MADELINE GUEST No . DESEZE I should not have asked . I 'm sorry . MADELINE GUEST He 's a prisoner . DESEZE Oh , God ! So many are prisoners . What a day it will be when they are set free . MADELINE GUEST This one they will not set free . DESEZE I am sorry . He was a gallant gentleman , mademoiselle . Sometimes these prisons are assailable , if you will pardon me . If one has money , is there not a possibility ? MADELINE GUEST I have tried for a year . I think now I would have done better to dig a tunnel under Paris with my own hands , till it came up under his cell . p. 105 DESEZE I understand too well . My own two sons I shall not see again . MADELINE GUEST They are in prison ? DESEZE They are dead . I have received the little printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come it is always possible to believe . I shall pray that as you sit here in the twilight , your hope will return to you , and that it will come true . MADELINE GUEST Thank you . CHARLOTTE and MERCY enter from above . DESEZE goes out to the right . CHARLOTTE No , my dear , I can not give it up , and you can not . MERCY No , no . We will omit our little luxuries .  --  Surely we have seen this lady ? CHARLOTTE Yes . MERCY Surely we have seen you here , many times ? MADELINE GUEST Yes ? Yes , I remember . MERCY Only you hardly knew us at first , because we are changed . MADELINE GUEST A little , perhaps . CHARLOTTE No , a great deal . In our faces . I know I see it in my sister 's face . Something shining and secret . p. 106 MADELINE GUEST You have had good fortune ? CHARLOTTE Wonderful fortune . MERCY Shall we tell her our secret ? CHARLOTTE I think so . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these gardens . But nothing came of that . And something has happened to our money . It brings so little , and we are hungry . MADELINE GUEST Yes , I know . MERCY Many days we walked here in these gardens . A little sad , and a little hungry . And then suddenly we saw the lake . I think I saw it first . CHARLOTTE Yes , you saw it first . MERCY The lake was there , with the swans , and the sedge , and the water-lilies , and the path to the Orangerie . Oh , all as it was . CHARLOTTE And now we no longer need help with the restoration , for we walk here in that old world daily . MERCY And every day as we stand at the entrance we see the lake and the old buildings , and the servants carrying fruits and sweetmeats into the Trianon . And so we have escaped these new soldiers . We 're quite beyond them now . That is our secret . CHARLOTTE Yes , that is our secret . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . And so we have eluded them , have n't we ? p. 107 MADELINE GUEST I do n't know . Perhaps we 've all tried to evade them , each in his own way . I 'm afraid we have n't succeeded , any of us . SCHOEN enters , and walks through , looking at MADELINE . MERCY We should not have told it , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE No , we should not . MERCY Something goes out of it . Some of the shining goes from it . CHARLOTTE Yes . CHARLOTTE and MERCY turn to go . SCHOEN returns toward MADELINE . MERCY But we thank you very much . CHARLOTTE Yes , we do thank you . They go out . MADELINE GUEST Why am I followed here ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I was sent to look for you . MADELINE GUEST Yes ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN M. St. Cloud told me I would find you here . MADELINE GUEST No , it 's not true . I waited a night and a day , and another night . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Yes , I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 108 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN No , I could n't . MADELINE GUEST I have nothing more to give you , and you 've taught me to believe nothing . LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I 've known what you would think of me , and for a time I have deserved your thoughts . But not now , for I have done what I could to help you . MADELINE GUEST What have you done ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I have taken the step . I have set him free . It has all gone well . MADELINE GUEST This Could be a lie !  --  I 've schooled myself to believe nothing  --  I must n't put faith in these things , or I 'll go mad ! And yet  --  you 'd have nothing to gain if it were a falsehood ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Nothing . MADELINE GUEST Going to himThen where is he ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN He 's here , hidden in this park . MADELINE GUEST Here ? Then why  --  LIEUTENANT SCHOEN As she turns away , he puts a hand on her arm . Please  --  he came this far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have found a workman who will lend him clothes , and he makes the exchange now . We planned to meet here , for he hoped you might be here . p. 109 MADELINE GUEST But he 's in grave danger ! They must have discovered the escape ! They must have followed him ! LIEUTENANT SCHOEN I made an official inspection of the empty cells this morning . He was gone , and I carefully sent the pursuit in the wrong direction . It has all gone well . You have only to wait here until he comes . MADELINE GUEST Oh , forgive me , forgive me , for any evil I have thought of you ! It was unfair to ask this of you ! I knew that , and I 'll never be able to thank you or to repay you ! Why are you trembling ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN Is it so easy to break with all you 've ever known ? To thrust your neck under the axe ? I have seen too many executions . But I have come to the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to be what you are and die for it , or to be what they would have you , and live . Perhaps I have found a sort of courage . MADELINE GUEST Where will you go ? LIEUTENANT SCHOEN You must not worry about me , I have my own private war to fight . But , however it goes , not everything is lost . For I am a soldier against what I hate , and it 's good to fight alone . Good  --  bye , and thank you . MADELINE GUEST Good-bye Lieutenant . Whatever happens , you 've brought him out of prison . God keep you , and help you through . p. 110 LIEUTENANT SCHOEN God keep you both , and help you through . He goes up the steps and out to the left . Then DESEZE enters from the lower right , and crosses to MADELINE . DESEZE Forgive me , mademoiselle , but a workman will pass this way , slipping through in the shadows toward the west gate . MADELINE GUEST Deseze ? Will he dare to pause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DESEZE Going up the stepsThe park is deserted in the evening , mademoiselle . Take what time you need . MADELINE GUEST I still have his passage with me . I must give him that , and tell him how to go . DESEZE At the top of the stepsWe 'll watch the paths both ways , Henri and I. If anyone comes we 'll warn you . He goes out left . MADELINE waits , looking off to the right . After a pause , RAOUL enters from the right , takes a quick look about him , and holds out his hand to MADELINE , who runs to him . They embrace . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Dare I believe it ? MADELINE GUEST Dare I believe it ? So many times I 've thought I saw you , so many times I 've heard a voice behind me , and turned , thinking it was yours . p. 111 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Darling , if I could hold you forever . It 's been a year . MADELINE GUEST Only a year ? It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid you should n't have come here . RAOUL ST . CLOUD No place is safe . And I had to see you . This is a miracle  --  a miracle like the others . If you had n't been eternally true , if your love had n't been stronger than all of them , I 'd have been lost long ago . I do n't think I can leave you again . MADELINE GUEST Oh , but you must , if we 're ever to meet again  --  you know you must  --  RAOUL ST . CLOUD Yes , I must  --  but not yet . I ca n't go yet . Do many pass this way ? MADELINE GUEST The park 's not used in the evening . We can take a few minutes . RAOUL ST . CLOUD I have a habit of keeping in the shadows . Come . He draws her back toward the hedge . The Lieutenant tells me I must climb the steps and turn right when I 've passed the gate . Beyond that I know nothing . You must tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only one way out of France , and that 's England . I have your passage . She opens her bag and takes out an envelope . You can still reach Cherbourg by tomorrow evening . Yes , with a little luck I 'm sure you can . p. 112 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Luck never fails me , when you remember me . MADELINE GUEST Then it wo n't fail you now . You 'll reach Cherbourg in time , and find the little boat , and the Captain will take you across safely ; and I think there must be a God , as you said long ago , for I carried that about with me even after I 'd given up ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD There must be . Because you 're here  --  and you 've somehow got me out of that hell . Your arms are real . Takes her in his arms I 'm risen from the dead . MADELINE GUEST And I 've been dead , and I 'm alive again . They kiss . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Forgive me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit I keep looking about . MADELINE follows him half-way up the steps . All dark and quiet . He goes down to her . One thing more . Where can I go after England ? I 've come out of such darkness , sweet . What 's happened in the world ? Or is there a world ? Is it all Germany now ? MADELINE GUEST No , darling . They 've trampled many but they 've conquered none . Even when the nations give up , the people fight them with their bare hands everywhere . p. 113 RAOUL ST . CLOUD Even here ? Even here in France ? MADELINE GUEST Here and everywhere . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Thank God , thank God , then ! Oh , Madeline , I know what they 're like in their horrible souls ! They mean to make the whole world like the inside of that prison camp ! It 's desperate , this war to save the earth ! As desperate as the fight you made to save me ! But you and I , we 're together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made soldiers of us all  --  women and children and all . They 've even made one of me . But you must go . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Could you come with me ? MADELINE GUEST No , those who travel underground have taught me the rules : Travel fast , travel light , and travel alone . But do n't worry about me  --  I know all the ways there are , and I 'm in no danger . RAOUL ST . CLOUD When will I see you ? MADELINE GUEST There are three pencilled words on the outside of the envelope I gave you . Go first where they direct you . From there they 'll know . Oh , Raoul , do lovers never have long years together ? RAOUL ST . CLOUD It used to happen . It will happen again . MADELINE GUEST For other lovers . Lovers to come ! p. 114 RAOUL ST . CLOUD No , dear , for us ! MADELINE GUEST Keep safe . RAOUL ST . CLOUD Keep safe , darling . He kisses her , then goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps you should wait here a moment , then leave by the other gate . MADELINE GUEST Yes , darling . Till England ! RAOUL ST . CLOUD Till England ! He goes out to the left . She runs up the steps , looking after him . HENRI enters downstage right . HENRI Mademoiselle ? MADELINE GUEST Yes . Yes , Henri . HENRI He 's gone ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , he 's gone . HENRI I burned the prison clothes . There 's no trace left . MADELINE GUEST He should be through the gates by now . She comes down to him . Will you look , Henri ? I do n't dare . HENRI climbs the steps and meets DESEZE , entering . DESEZE He 's gone . MADELINE GUEST Yes ? p. 115 DESEZE He will be safe . He went through the gates , and I closed them after him . There was nobody east or west . It 's early to close the gates , but it seemed better if they were shut . He turned east along the road under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUEST Thank you . It was impossible , and it 's happened ! She starts to cry , takes a handkerchief out of her bag , and wipes her eyes . I thought I had no tears left , but for happiness I have . You 've put yourselves in danger , both of you . HENRI He 's a soldier of France , mademoiselle . MADELINE GUEST There are no two people in all France I shall hate so much to leave . DESEZE You will leave us , mademoiselle ? MADELINE GUEST I want to be in London when he comes . And somehow I will , somehow I will . Once when he came safely out of the sea , he said that my hand had been over him there on the water . Now I know what he meant  --  for his hand is over me now . Good  --  bye , Henri .  --  She starts up the steps . A whistle blows in the distance . What does that mean ? HENRI I 've never heard it here before . I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are soldiers entering the park . p. 116 DESEZE It 's dangerous for you to stay here , mademoiselle . I have the key to the other gate . I 'll let you through that way . He starts up the steps . MADELINE GUEST Following him upYes , please , if you will . She stops . No , I 'll stay here . HENRI Please , mademoiselle . DESEZE They wo n't see you , if you come quickly . MADELINE GUEST No , you go , Deseze , and you , Henri . I 'll stay here . The longer they spend with me , the further he 'll be on his way . DESEZE Then we 'll stay , too . They 'll find nothing against us , mademoiselle . MADELINE GUEST You 're sure you 're safe ? HENRI There 's nothing left , not a footprint . They all stand waiting . Off stage to the right a German OFFICER is heard giving orders . Another replies . Then a whistle blows nearby . CORPORAL SCHULTZ enters . CORPORAL SHULZ It will be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You too , Fraeulein , wait here . MADELINE GUEST How long must we wait ? p. 117 CORPORAL SHULZ You must wait here to be questioned . MADELINE GUEST Crossing to himCan you tell me why we are being detained , Corporal ? CORPORAL SHULZ I believe there has been an escape from the prison camp and the pursuit comes this way . But do not be alarmed , Fraeulein . We seek only the fugitives . A German CAPTAIN enters above , followed by GUARDS . CAPTAIN Fuehren Sie sie herueber . Some GUARDS cross the stage , some take positions on the steps , one examines the papers of those detained . Papiere von allen Personen untersuchen . Vorwaerts ! 1ST GUARD Zu Befehl , Herr Hauptmann . He goes down the steps . CAPTAIN To MADELINEWe are bringing together all the people in the park . 1ST GUARD Your papers . HENRI and DESEZE show their cards . May I see your papers , please ? MADELINE shows her passport . A GUARD re-enters from left. 1ST GUARD Kein Mensch im Park . p. 118 CAPTAIN Niemand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Es ist mir einfach ein Raetsel , wo der Kerl hingekommen ist . Two more GUARDS enter and are directed by the CAPTAIN to take positions on the steps . CAPTAIN Ist alles fertig fr Herrn Oberst ? CORPORAL SHULZ Jawohl . Wir haben drei Personen hier . CAPTAIN Gut gemacht . ERFURT enters from the upper right . COLONEL ERFURT Hat jemand den Park verlassen ? CAPTAIN Wir haben niemand gesehen . COLONEL ERFURT Wo ist St. Cloud ? CAPTAIN St. Cloud ist nicht im Park . COLONEL ERFURT Warum warten Sie noch ? Good evening , Miss Guest . He goes down two steps , sees HENRI and DESEZE . Wer sind die ? Haben die ihre Ausweispapiere ? CORPORAL SHULZ Jawohl , Herr Oberst . COLONEL ERFURT Verhoeren Sie sie. 1ST GUARD Come with me . HENRI and DESEZE are led out. p. 119 COLONEL ERFURT Wer sind die zwei ? CAPTAIN Parkaufseher . COLONEL ERFURT Vielleicht knnen Sie aus denen etwas heraus bekommen ? CAPTAIN Jawohl , Herr Oberst . COLONEL ERFURT Going down stepsMiss Guest ? MADELINE GUEST Yes , Colonel Erfurt ? COLONEL ERFURT We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . When I returned from Berlin this morning , there had been an escape at the camp . Lieutenant Schoen was connected with it . He has disappeared , and we have traced him to Versailles , and to these gardens . You have n't seen him today , by chance ? MADELINE GUEST No . COLONEL ERFURT Now it may be I have lost Schoen , but you , my dear Miss Guest , could be quite as useful . Wachen abtreten . CAPTAIN Wachen abtreten . The CAPTAIN and the GUARDS go out . COLONEL ERFURT Where is Raoul St. Cloud ? MADELINE GUEST I do n't know . COLONEL ERFURT You do know , of course . You told me once that you would do this . Now , by a combination of chances , you have succeeded . Where is he ? p. 120 MADELINE GUEST Suppose I did tell you  --  how would you know I had n't lied to you ? COLONEL ERFURT Of course , it will be necessary to hold you until your lover has been recaptured . MADELINE GUEST You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are guilty of a major crime . Your name will not protect you . MADELINE GUEST I was not thinking of my name , but of my nation . COLONEL ERFURT If you had been a French woman , you would have been arrested , and your money confiscated , a year ago . We let you alone because of your nationality , and your name . But we no longer care greatly what you think of us . You will help me to recapture this prisoner or you will face trial for aiding in his escape . MADELINE GUEST You could let me go . I am only to meet him  --  sometime  --  a long way from here  --  if I can find him . There 's so little chance of any happiness . You could let me go . COLONEL ERFURT Only if I have him in your place . Ask anything you like for St. Cloud , except his freedom , and you shall have it . I 'll make his captivity light . I 'll save his life if I can . You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom he must not have . p. 121 MADELINE GUEST But he is free . COLONEL ERFURT Very doubtfully . We 'll catch up with him , wherever he is . MADELINE GUEST If you 're so certain of that , why do you ask my help ? I think you 've lost him , and you think so too . As for your promises to treat him well , no child would believe you . COLONEL ERFURT No ? As yet you have not understood me . I must have him or I must give an accounting to Berlin . I do n't think I could find the words to say to my superiors : St Cloud is free . They might be my last words , my last in office , my last as what I am . MADELINE GUEST But you will say them . COLONEL ERFURT No . I can not say them . I shall have to employ whatever means I have to make you speak . MADELINE GUEST And you believe you could make me speak ? COLONEL ERFURT There is no human will  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  that can hold out against us . MADELINE GUEST I have been told that the lovers are a great trouble to your tribunals . That the beaters are inclined to throw down their whips when a woman in love is brought before them . COLONEL ERFURT Yes ? Where did you hear this ? p. 122 MADELINE GUEST I 've made a study of you this year past . COLONEL ERFURT I 've spoken very gently , because my power is absolute . My fear is that I must use it . I beg of you , do not make me use it . MADELINE GUEST Your power is not absolute , Colonel Erfurt , because you must answer to your government for what you do ! And your government is not absolute because it must answer to the world ! You will not hold me , and your government will not hold me ! You dare not add to your enemies , for already you are surrounded by enemies . A cold wind of hatred blows at you from every corner of the earth ! You have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means that you will lose . You wear these gorgeous uniforms and stage yourself so elaborately and talk in such loud voices to cover your emptiness and your fear ! COLONEL ERFURT There is no need to discuss your civilization or mine ! We are hard here because we must be , and your case is like another and must be dealt with ! MADELINE GUEST Very well ! He 's free . Raoul is free ! Do as you like with me ! Take your revenge ! But you must still go to Berlin and tell them Raoul is free ! COLONEL ERFURT Hauptman ! The CAPTAIN enters with three GUARDS . Take a last look about you at your free world ! I have not yet spoken the word that will shut you up , but when I do speak it I will not take it back ! p. 123 MADELINE GUEST Looking at the GUARDS , then at ERFURTI came into this fight tardily and by chance , and unwilling . I never thought to die young , or for a cause . But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I 'd give my life gladly to gain one half inch against you ! And I 'll never again be worth so much against you as I am now , if you arrest me here this evening . If you think you have anything to gain by it , arrest me , imprison me , put a final end to me ! It will be known ! And it will not be easy to explain ! Berlin will not thank you ! There is a pause . Lash out and give the order if you 're not afraid ! There is no answer . She turns and goes up to the top of the steps . COLONEL ERFURT It is true that it is not expedient to arrest you now . But give me your passport . You are now a prisoner in France . She gives him her passport . We take our enemies one at a time , and your country is last on the list . But your time will come . MADELINE GUEST Yes . We shall expect you and be ready for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wars between men and beasts . And the beasts have always lost , and men have won . She goes out.
