Migrating birds are excellent navigators , hitting small oceanic islands like radio-guided airplanes . But some of them seem to cross unnecessary oceans . The Arctic tern , for instance , nests in summer in North America ; when winter approaches , it heads for Antarctic regions near South America . But instead of flying south , the most direct route , it heads eastward across the North Atlantic to Europe , then down the African coast and across the South Atlantic . Other birds that migrate long distances take similar detours . All this tends to vex and confuse the ornithologists , who want to know why birds behave that way . <P> In ! ast week 's Science magazine , Dr. Alber Wolfson of Northwestern University advances his explanation : that they are led astray by the earth 's fickle geology . According to a fairly well established theory , says Dr. Wolfson , the continents were once bunched together in two main masses : " Laurasia " ( North America and Eurasia ) and " Gondwana " ( South America , Africa , Antarctica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see map ) . During the Cretaceous period , 60 million years ago , both masses broke up and drifted slowly apart , their light granitic rocks floating on the heavy , plastic basalt that underlies both the oceans and the land . <P> By the time this movement got under way , birds had already evolved into modern types . Dr. Wolfson thinks that some of them had learned to make comparatively short seasonal migrations between feeding and nesting places , that generation after generation , for millions of years , they stuck to the same routes . New oceans appeared and widened under their beating wings . New mountains reared up . The climate changed as glaciers crept forward , then melted . The birds , more steadfast than the earth , kept to their ancient flight plan , though their journeys became much longer than at first and twice as long as need be .
