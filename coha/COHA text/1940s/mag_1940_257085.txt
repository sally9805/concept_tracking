The little Dutch boy who saved his country by plugging the dike with his fist was missing last week . His duty this time would have been to blow up the Moerdijk Bridge , longest on the Continent , connecting Rotterdam and the heart of The Netherlands with south Holland across the 1 ? mile wide Hollandsch Diep ( joint estuary of the Maas and Waal Rivers ) . A gallon of well placed nitroglycerin would at least have delayed the German armored column which , having raced 85 miles westward in less than 86 hours ( TIME , May 20 ) , clanked across to reinforce Nazi parachute and air ferried troops beleaguered on the river islands south of Rotterdam . <P> But no one set the charge , or no one fired it . British troops which had reached Flushing to the southwest and Amsterdam to the north , a French mechanized force which had reached Breda to the southeast , were all too slow , powerless or witless to intervene . Dutch Foreign Minister Elco van Kleffens said German parachutists disguised as Dutch police prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrent of air bombs upon Rotterdam , which stubborn Dutch fighters had twice cleared of Nazis , the invaders rolled over the bridge and into the city . <P> At 6:58 p.m. on May 14 , The Netherlands was told she had capitulated to her first " protector " since Napoleon Bonaparte set up his brother Louis as her King in 1806 . <P> General Henri Gerard Winkelman , Commander in Chief of the Dutch armed forces , made the announcement in the absence of Queen Wilhelmina and Premier Dirk Jan de Geer , who had fled to England : <P> " There was no other way . ... If we had fought on , not only our Army would have been destroyed but all civilians , women and children . . . . Today Rotterdam had her terrible share of what bombing means , and Utrecht , Den Helder and other centres were threatened likewise . . . . Our Air Force was too weak . . . . We were left to ourselves and so I had to make a grave decision which was a very difficult one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say is , trust in the future , behold your traditions . Long live Her Majesty the Queen ! Long live the Fatherland ! " <P> Safe in London , Dutch Foreign Minister van Kleffens announced that one in four of his country 's 400,000 soldiers was killed , the Royal Guard 80% wiped out . Military men had difficulty believing these high figures , concluded they must have included deaths anticipated if the fighting had gone on . When it stopped , the Dutch , who had given up the northeast half of their country with little resistance and retired in good order from their first line of defense along the Ijssel River , still held their Grebbe Line ( second defense ) and Holland Water Lines ( third ) . They had mopped up most of the parachutists in and around Amsterdam . They still had The Hague , Leiden , Utrecht , Den Helder . They still held , with British and French , the island province of Zeeland in the rivers ' mouths . But further resistance did indeed seem hopeless . Whole towns were bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the main causeway roads . Dutch glumness and anger at the surrender was directed chiefly at the Allies for not coming more strongly , Queen Wilhelmina for not staying .
