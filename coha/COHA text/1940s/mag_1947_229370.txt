Those horrible little imps who badger bewildered ball players were after Stan Musial . They lock-stepped up &; down his bat and chanted in his ear : " You 're in a slump . . . you 're in a slump . " <P> For three weeks , the mighty hitter of the St. Louis Cardinals had n't been able to hit . Though not overly superstitious by nature , Musial began spitting over his left shoulder and looking for good-luck hairpins in hotel lobbies . That did n't help . Said he , desperately , " I 've had the whole team advising me , and I all but take the bat to bed with me . " His batting average sagged to .174 . <P> By itself , Stan Musial 's slump might not have been so bad-but most of his teammates were following his example . And the pitching was poor too . The proud Cardinals , World 's Series winners last year and favorites to repeat this year , tail-spinned into a nine-game losing streak-their worst in nine years . It was too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying . <P> When it came to rehabilitating Stan Musial , the usual rules did n't apply . He is a " hip hitter " who does his best when ignoring the copybook : holding one shoulder lower than the other , hugging the rear of the batter 's box , crouching forward with a ready-to-pounce stance , putting a lot of body wiggle behind his swing . Musial himself blamed his slump on too much golf during the winter and spring ; he put his golf clubs into the closet . A slim , conscientious player , who at 26 earns about $27,000 a year , Musial spent hours in the batting cage . <P> But he knew as well as anyone that a slump is mostly mental . Every inning , when the Cards came off the field , he carefully put his first baseman 's glove face down in the grass . Then he always touched the bag with his left foot . At breakfast , he made sure never to order the same thing he ate the morning before . <P> This week in Boston , Musial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . The slump might not be over yet , but everyone breathed a little easier .
