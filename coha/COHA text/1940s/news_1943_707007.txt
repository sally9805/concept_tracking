Gasoline rationing has not stopped the - West Englewood keglers from attending their weekly sessions at the Valley Brook Club in Englewood , N. ' J. They reach the ' club by several methods . Seven . members of the group arrive on bicycles . It is quite a sight to See them pedaling - furiously along the darkened New Jersey roads . They ride .. ne block - and walk two , then rest for an hour . Two others appeared one night on a tandem dressed in Gay Nineties costumes . - It is even more humorous to see the robust cyclists homeward bound , almost out of breath , pushing their bicycles before them . However , some of the group , per- haps more dignified , make the trip by bus or on foot . P. E. B. West Englewood , N. J. , Feb. 28 , 1943 .
