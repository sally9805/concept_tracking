FLAGS aboard workaday craft hung at half mast all over Puget Sound and the people of our city turned out in such numbers that the funeral was the largest ever given a private individual in Tacoma . That was fitting and proper , for we were burying Tugboat Annie . The strange thing was that we did n't know we were burying Tugboat Annie , and neither did the woman we were burying . Then Foss never lived to see the day she became Tugboat Annie . When Theo . Foss was buried in 1927 , Norman Reilly Raine had not yet met her sons . and the exploits and adventures which those sons recounted to him had not yet been spun into the now-famous Tugboat Annie series by his fertile plotting brain . From the day she bought a rowboat , which she and her man parlayed into the great tugboat fleet ( heir 8011S now operate between San Diego and Nome , until the day of her death , Thea Foss never had the faintest suspi-cion she would become the prototype of a famous fiction character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't go into that now . The story of the sons of Tugboat Annie does not begin with her transition into a character of fiction . Neither does it begin with the high adventures of the tugboat fleet operated by the sons , who are Arthur , Wedell and Henry Foss , of the Foss Launch and Tug Company , Inc. , Tacoma , Washington . Rather , it begins with the rowboat their mother bought . Andrew Foss , a Norwegian ship 's carpenter , arrived in Tacoma a stranger , with about two dollars in cash , no credit , and his tool chest . He had one other asset  --  a wife , Thea . Accommodations were scarce . All necessities commanded boom prices . But Theo . and Andrew together salvaged two huge cedar logs for floats , beachcombed lumber lost overboard by the tidewater mills , and built themselves a float shack . They moored it at the foot of a street five hundred yards from their fresh-water supply , a small creek spilling into the hay . For years this was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lillian . Andrew Foss worked at odd labor jobs . Finally he obtained a contract for building a house down the sound . Here was a real break . Ho left his wife with a cooky jar half full of silver for grocery money and set out joyfully . Tacoma was wide open . Roistering seamen fought along the water front- . Stag-trousered lumberjacks roamed the streets , their calked boots shredding the wooden sidewalks , between saloons . Alone , Thea was not afraid . As she walked through town , her clear eyes , heavy flaxen hair , high-colored cheeks and erect carriage commanded . respect . One evening she bought a silver salmon from a passing Siwash . She was cleaning it For supper when a casual acquaintance rowed up to the float . " Know anybody who wants to buy a boat , cheap ? " he asked . " I 've got to sell this skiff , because I 'm going East . " Andrew had taught Thea to know good workmanship in a boat . She saw it in the skiff . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift at that . " Thee , looked sad . The boat would have freed her from the drudgery of carrying fresh water over the beach . But the shrinking hoard of grocery money could n't stand the loss of ten dollars at a clip . Well " Five dollars is all I am able to offer you . " It was a sale . Andrew Foss came home from his completed contract , unknotted his handkerchief and spread his gold and silver pieces on the deal table for his wife to see . Two tens , two fives , and two silver dollars , the net for sixty days of hard work . Thea took down her cooky jar . She counted out forty dollars in small change before her bewildered husband . " I buy , sell and rent rowboats now , " she told him . She explained how she had trebled her money on the resale of her first skiff , hod bought two others , and had sold them at a fine profit . Now she had four rowboats for hire to fishermen at fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiffs , " she concluded in flushed enthusiasm . " People like to know they can hire boats right here at the float at any time . No matter what time of the day or night they come , I am always ready . " ALWAYS READY today is the copyrighted slogan of the Foss company Thee , founded . A captain who wants his vessel towed need only blow the Foss call  --  two long and two short blasts  --  and begin to count . Day or night , from some bay or estuary , a Foss tug will appear before the count reaches a hundred , so legend has it . How a Fleet Grew Up A NDREW FOSS was not the man to deride his wife 's business acumen . Ile was intelligent enough to complement her sagacity with his skill and capitalize both . Andrew began to build rowboats . Much of his lumber he beacheombed . His fine eye for small-boat design enabled him to turn out- skiffs and clinker-built rowboats that were praised as " easy running . " His competitors furnished their boats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his with homemade oars of featherweight spruce , which increased their popularity . Normally , milled spruce is not strong . But Foss had brought front the old country the knack of riving his oar material from the whole spruce log instead of using sawed lumber . His finished oar incorporated all the strcngt of the natural grain of the wood . During the World War this trick was revived in turning out spruce airplane spars . Thea helped build boats . When they were finished , she painted them green and white  --  still the Foss house colors . The filial Foss boys today carry out the color scheme in religious detail . All their tugs , barges , buildings and equipment are painted green and white . Their white stationery is printed in green , their typewriters equipped with special green ribbons , and their books kept in green ink  --  except when the hazards of their business force an entry in red . The boat business expanded as the three Foss sons and the daughter grew up . In the BO's. men fished in Tacoma harbor or hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Foss brothers dug worms , which they sold to the fishermen at , two cents a dozen . A dime 's worth in a day was big business . About this time a competitor wished to sell his boat-livery business . Thea Foss carefully watched his float , keeping track of the volume of his business . She noticed that delivery boys from various stores rented the competitor 's boats to deliver packages to the sailing vessels at anchor in the harbor . " Brown wants to include that small naphtha launch in the deal , " Theo . Foss told her husband . " I 'm sure that our boys could learn to run it and /mike two deliveries a- day to the skips in the harbor . stores should be glad to pay ten or if teen cents package for the service . " Ones again Andrew Foss took his wife 's business tip . He made the deal . lie hail the cash to swing it . Throughout their lives , Theo , and Andrew held rigidly to the principle of saving their money during good times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be had , they spent their hoarded cash freely to build their business . They always gambled their all on their conviction that booms and depressions move in cycles . The launch delivery business not only prospered but produced a byproduct . Picnic parties pa-id to be deposited in some nook on the wooded shores of the sound in the morning , and then picked up at night . The Hope . as the temperamental two-horsepower naphtha launch was named , sometimes earned twenty dollars a day . Even the infidelity of sound winds did their hit . for the Foss boys . Many a sedate Tacoma grandpa and grandma today recall how Arthur . Wedell and Henry saved them from pretty serious compromising situations in the strait-fatted early days of this century . As soon as the twilight wind died on a slimmer evening , the Foss boys would mount to the roof of their boathouse and train a battered telescope on becalmed sailboats in the harbor . Whenever they saw a boy and a girl alone in a catboat , they knew they had a potential customer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an early hour in those days , and to be marooned all night in a boat with a boy was unthinkable . When darkness fell , the Foss brothers would ; tut out in the slope and tow in sailboats rented front their mother and dad . Even if the sailing swain had begun to row in. he usually was glad to abandon this sweaty , unromantic performance . The Foss boys always refused gratuities from those who had rented Foss boats . In refusing , they never failed to deliver a speech on the advantage of this follow-through Foss service , After they had taken care of their own customers , the boys would head out with the 1 n1 once again 7gaiL and , for a set teseri fee , offer their services to those becalmed in boats rented from competitors . " Sometimes we 'd come in with six or eight catboats lined out behind us , " Arthur recounts today , his eyes ativinIsle at memories of this juvenile racket . " At two bits apiece , we were doing all right . " Business seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly the pleasure-boat business went into one of its periodic slumps . There were more launches than customers . Instead of hauling their boats ashore or selling out , Thea and her man resourcefully looked around for a new market for the services they could offer . They found new customers in the sawmills . These had eaten their way into the hills , exhausting timber within easy reach of ox teams . It was much less expensive to raft in logs cut at distant tidewater than to build railroads . Thea and Andrew began towing log rafts with their underpowered pleasure launches . It was a task to tax even Scandinavian patience . The launches did not have enough power to buck the tides . When the tide turned against them , they tied up and waited for the next run . Thea and Andrew knew they needed powerful tugs that would enable them to ignore the set . of the tides . Tugs with gutty engines , and hands to relieve them at a kicking wheel . Their banker , realizing that Andrew and Thea were a gilt-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , saying , " Now , if a boat sinks or burns , I have only one worry . But if you held a mortgage on it , I 'd have to worry for both of us . " All of their own money went for new engines . Eight , sixteen , thirty-two , sixty-four , one hundred and twenty , the horsepower increased . The long hours of towing shortened as the power of their converted pleasure launches increased . The Teardrop Tug Log towing still accounts for the greatest volume of the Foss business . In their log-storage basin are millions of feet of saw logs , huge booms gathered on Puget Sound , Hood Canal , British Columbia , the coast of Oregon , and even as far north as the panhandle waters of Alaska . The Foss tugs tow these logs to their storage basin , where the logger-owner has them sealed and sells them to the mill . A Foss tug then tows the logs to their final destination . As the lumber emerges , it is often loaded on Foss barges and towed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogged scrap are loaded on barges and towed to waterside industrild plants , where they are utilized us fuel or wood-pulp material . The Foss boys collect on both ends and in the middle of almost every log they tow . From the first , Andrew Foss , whose profile resembled that of Henry Ford , realized that the converted launches which he and Thea were using were inefficient . Naturally inventive , he commenced to whittle a model of an ideal tug . The Foss boys tell how their father would return from a lung , exhausting tow , and then spend the evening hours caressing the smooth lines of the hull he was developing with his deft fingers . Somehow , he could sense the slip stream of the water about the hull , which , as he worked on it with knife and sandpaper , came more and more to resemble a teardrop . Only , to Andrew Foss , it did not resemble a teardrop , but a salmon , a fish that nature had perfectly streamlined by millions of years of evolution . Satisfied with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped it with homemade power tools , and began to build tugs , paying for them as he went along . They were the first of the snub-nosed , roundsterned , low-squatting tugs with teardrop hulls that are now standard on Puget Sound . Andrew Foss also invented a balanced type of rudder which greatly facilitates the handling of tugs with awkward tows . It never occurred to him to patent his inventions . Some similar devices later were patented by inventors working in other parts of the country . Andrew Foss did not believe the others stole his ideas , but thought they developed their own ideas independently . This probably made Andrew Foss unique among inventors . The Cow With a Foghorn With the tugs increasing , it was nec-essary s to hire more help . It was Thea Foss who originated the system that has made the Foss organization one of the most loyal anywhere . Thea did n't want to leave the active work of the business she loved . And she did n't want to deny her sons and daughter a normal family life . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family . They ate at the family table and slept in a dormitory wing built into the water-front home . Many . of the hands pitched in and helped with the housework in return , so that Thea could attend to the growing business . About this time Thea began to be known as Mother Foss , Andrew as Father Foss . Mother Foss was the banker . Mother Foss paid no staled wage . Her sons still treasure the original ledgers , with the neat ten and fifteen vent items charged against the various hands . At the end of every two or three years , or when a man wanted to quit , Mother Foss would pay him a generous lump sum . Several successful Northwestern businessmen got their first stake from the hands of Mother Foss . Mother Foss did the cooking for her crews . She kept a large henhouse , pigs and a cow . Annie , the brindle cow , was a. favorite . She had an abnormal love for hot . cakes . Annie would appear at the kitchen window in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hot cakes were immediately forthcoming , she would stick her head in the window and moo loudly until she gut them . There are as many tall tales about Brindle Annie as there are about Paul Bunyan 's blue ox , Babe . Once there was a Foss skipper who was particularly beloved by Annie . Whenever he whistled for a landing , Annie would amble to the head of the Foss wharf and moo in anticipation of the titbit he always brought her . It got so that , in a fog , the skipper would sound his whistle , listen for Annie 's answering moo as a guide to the wharf , and romp into the harbor at full speed , making a spectacular but accurate landing at the feet of his trusty foghorn . One very dirty night the skipper whistled and faithful Foghorn Annie 's ( Continued on Page 74 ) iCentinued from Page 72 ) answering moo floated out to him through the murk . Without slowing , he headed for the sound of gentle Annie 's voice . He tooted . Annie answered immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prow directly toward his animated signal . Annie lowed again , louder , closer . The skipper 's hand reached for the handle of the engine control . But it never got there . He was hurled forward as the tug piled itself high on the steep beach . The skipper leaped from the pilothouse , running to the bow . There , outlined in the fog , was Foghorn Annie , her bawling muzzle elevated as she struggled against her tether , caught fast between two boulders , a hundred yards down the beach from the dock . Foghorn Annie is no more , and her pasture is the site of factories . But the spirit of the Foghorn Annie days still obtains in the Foss organization . Some MO employees are hired on what amounts to a yearly wage . They sleep in dormitories when ashore , and buy their clothes and accessories at a discount from the company store . The Foss store resembles a general mercantile establishment of forty years ago in the multiplicity of articles handled . The stock ranges from massive parts for a 700-horsepower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a. well-fed man was a contented man . The Foss outfit is proud of its reputation for " feeding good . " The large outside tugs are equipped with electric refrigerators . Fresh fruit , vegetables and meat are prepared ashore and quick-frozen by modern methods in the company 's own freezer . The frozen stores are transferred to the tug 's refrigerator just before it casts off . This also makes for economy , because the tugs escape the higher prices charged for fresh produce in the northern ports . As they grew older , Mother and Father Foss gradually surrendered the cares of their big business to their sons . But Mother Foss could not endure inactivity . Throughout her last years she was busy at her hobby  --  finding work for deserving unfortunates . When , in 1927 , the green-and-white flags flew at half mast aboard the tugboats she loved , the funeral services for Mother Fuss set a Tacoma attendance record . Father Foss seasoned his sons to executive duties slowly , remaining at their shoulders with words of mellow advice . Ho remained extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he died in his eighty-second year , in 1937 , was that the three of them , without any assistance , should conduct his funeral services . In the Foss Tradition Now , in middle age , Arthur , 54 , Wed-ell , 52 , and Henry Foss , 48 , stand together as solidly as they did when , united , they were forced to fight the grammar-school classmates who yelled the hateful epithet " seoweegians " at them . Together , the sons of Tugboat Annie , though their joint achievements include a state senatorship , a national-bank directorship and the presidencies of various civic clubs , maintain the standards of simplicity and family solidarity sot by Mother and Father Foss . The eldest , Arthur , who , with Wed-ell , manages the Seattle office , inherits many of the qualities of his mother . One is the ability to handle people . Foss hands come to him with their grievances and personal problems . Ho heads the tugboat family of today , in the same way his mother managed it years ago . If an employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . If he thinks the man extravagant , he works out a budget for him . If misfortune is to blame , the hand gets an advance . If a loan shark is at the bottom of the business , Arthur , who has the iron of his mother in him , sends the shyster fleeing to his hole . It is characteristic that when there is a tug accident  --  perhaps one costing thousands of dollars  --  Arthur 's first question always is : " Anybody hurt ? " Wedell was admitted to the bar years ago and is an expert on marine insurance , but he practices only for the Foss company . It is through Wedell that Thea Foss became the prototype of Tugboat Annie . And it is a good bet that , when Tugboat Annie outsmarts Bullwiukle or some other scalawag by some marine-law shenanigan , Wedell Foss has stuck his head into the nefarious business . In fact , Norman Reilly Raine credits Wedell with prodding him into carrying Tugboat Annie through the now famous series . How a Character Was Born It happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a malaria-stricken forecastle hand in 1924 , returned under somewhat different auspices in 1931 . He had made himself a first-rate short-story writer and was asked to lecture to the school of journalism of the University of Washington . There Edwin Wintermute , who had been a reporter in Providence , Rhode Island , suggested-that a woman tugboat skipper ought to make a good short-story character . He mentioned a woman in Providence who had inherited a tugboat business from her husband . Knocking about the water fronts , absorbing tugboat atmosphere , Raine talked to many maritime men , among them Wedell Foss . Wedell talked about his mother , the early days of the business , and the exciting exploits of the present .. In Tact , Wedell gave Heine a stirring episode around which to weave a plot . The first Tugboat Annie story resulted . Raine thought he had written just another short story . But a son of Tugboat Annie fixed that . Miss a chance to make the world not only tugboat-conscious but Puget-Sound-conscious at the same time ? Not Wedell Foss . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a. series . He proved a very good salesman . Today Wedell Foss is bitter because the work of writing successful motion pictures in Hollywood has taken so much of Raine 's time that he can turn out a Tugboat Annie story only rarely . Editor 's Note : We know people who are even more hitter than Wedell Foss about this matter . Henry Foss , the youngest of the sons of Tugboat Annie , inherits much of the vision , drive and canniness of his mother . He manages the Tacoma office , he takes the lead in selling the services of the great fleet of tugs , he directs public relations , and lie takes care of political contacts . Prematurely gray , suave , and something of a diplomat , he is well fitted for his big assignment . It is Henry Foss who makes the arrangements for some of the most spectacular jobs done by the great marine corporation his mother founded with a five-dollar rp  --  boat . For example , when United States Engineers decided they needed a special kind of tug performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77 ) ( ConUnsnarl from P aye 74 ) Midway Island airport , 1038 miles on the other side of Honolulu in the Pacific , Henry convinced them that they had to come to Tacoma to get it . The 500-horsepower tug Mathilda Foss was sent 4200 miles to do the job . At the moment the Foss brothers are completing a long and delicate series of operations presenting far more ditlieulties than the Midway Island contract offered . When the Tacoma Narrows Bridge is completed , linking Tacoma with the Olympic Peninsula , the Foss brothers will be able to boast that their outfit laid the groundwork for this new triumph of engineering skill . The builders of the bridge faced an extraordinary problem . To anchor the pier caissons in the nine-mile-an-hour tide , they intended to use fifty-three huge concrete blocks . The blocks , twelve feet square by fifty-one feet long , each weighed 600 tons . Could the Foss boys rig a barge which could carry such a load , and slide it into the water at a mapped location , accurately fixed by triangulation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine railway and two machine shops , with fifty men working on Foss equipment exclusively , could try . It was certain that the barge would take a terrific mauling when the 600-ton load was pitched into the water suddenly . A strong barge was selected . Watertight cells , braced with huge timbers and stay irons , were set into the hull bulkheads . Fresh oakum was driven into the seams and battened in place with galvanized sheathing . Ted Kuss , the engineer who designed the block-anchoring system , poured the huge monoliths in plywood forms , on sanded runners secured to the barge . It was planned to tip the barge by admitting sea water into the cells on one side . Because of the danger , eight-inch wooden plugs below the water line were used instead of sea valves operated by hand . The plugs were rigged to a rope bridle , and they were to he pulled out by a distant tug . Everybody concerned was tense with anxiety when the first barge , with its great concrete block , was towed into Tacoma Narrows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the method was untried . Maybe the barge would be shattered into kindling . If each of the fif ty-three concrete blocks destroyed a barge , a great deal of money would be lost . Labor of Hercules From the various triangulation stations , the engineers used short wave to direct the four tugs jockeying the barge into position . At their signal , the plugs were pulled . Water poured into the barge . It listed sharply , heeled deeper , began to sink sidewise . Everybody groaned . If the barge and block planed to the bottom together , they would drift yards out of position . Suddenly the canted block shifted , moved , gathered momentum , and crashed off the half-sunken barge . A shaft of spray shot into the sky for hundreds of feet . The engineers cheered ; their block was in place . But the Foss brothers held their breath . What would happen to the barge ? The sunken barge shot from the water like a projectile , leaped high , and then smacked back on the water with a clap like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barge was taken to the shipyards and placed on the marine railway for examination . Except for two large ? bracing stringers sheared off the bate tom , it was practically undamaged . Success ! Five similar barges dumped the other fifty-two concrete anchor blocks . One was lost overboard five miles from its destination when a rip tide jerked a barge out of control . Always there was the danger of a tide catching a tug between one of the 600-ton loads and a pier , which would have meant the end of the tug and probably all aboard . The Foss brothers have another contract with the bridge builders in which luck must be on their side . They have agreed to deliver 20,000 tons of mixed concrete from the shore mixing plant to the bridge piers . According to specifications , the concrete must be poured in the pier forms within thirty minutes after it is mixed . And once the placing of concrete is begun , the entire pouring operation , often extending over thirty hours , must be completed without a hitch . The Log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towing barges of mixed concrete fight their way through rip tides , delivering their perishable cargo on schedule , regardless of rain , wind or fog . The steering is such hard work and the responsibility so nerve-re ekiug that the tug skippers are obliged to work in very short shif ts . But a slice fat contract  --  good busi-ness ? " Yes , " Henry Foss admits . " But remember , every contract is an out-and-out gamble . The waves and the winds and the tides sit in this game at all times , and they are always ready to slap an ace on your king . In this business , the unexpected is the expected ; just about every day 's work proves that . Take this log of the Mathilda Foss , for example . " I took the log of the Mathilda Foss . She left Tacoma last spring for Kodiak Island , in the Gulf of Alaska . Her tow was 700 tons of fish-trap piling , earls piling 140 feet long . Time was all-important . The piles had to be delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish trap could be constructed in time for the salmon run . All went well until the Mathilda was within a few hundred miles of her destination . A furious storm suddenly lashed the gulf . The tug 's propeller hit an underwater derelict . One of three blades was sheared off . SOS . SOS . And while he waited , Capt . Roy Hall was forced by his tow to keep the pitching Mathilda under power , headed right into the teeth of the gale . The vibration caused by the unbalanced propeller seemed about to tear the little muscle boat to pieces . A Coast Guard cutter cause to tho rescue . The cutter took over the tow and the crippled Mathilda limped along astern into the small bay of Yakutat , on the Alaska mainland five hundred miles from Kodiak Island . Captain hall called Tacoma on his tug 's radio telephone . The firm shipyards immediately found the pattern of the Mathilda 's propeller and had a duplicate cast . But the contracted date of the delivery of the piling was near . No airplane pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only vessel touching at that port for thirty days was leaving that evening . The newly vast propeller was still hot when a master mechanic , with tools to install it , took it aboard . Yakutat lacked a dry dock . There were no facilities for careening the deep-draft Mathilda . It began to look as though a lot of deep red would he spread on the green-bordered Foss ledgers . Captain Hall and his men were on their own . They looked around and found a strip of shore where , their calculations showed , the tide would fall just eighteen inches below the propeller shaft of the beached Mathilda . They gambled with disaster and drove their craft hard up on the shingle at high tide . If the Gulf of Alaska had loosed one of its frequent storms , that would have been the end of the Mathilda . The gulf was kind . The outgoing tide bared the damaged prop . The new propeller was installed in two hours , a record under those conditions . The fish-trap piling was delivered on time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S from the Sophia Christianson . The Sophia was hard aground an uncharted sandbar in the Aleutian Islands , where she had piled up in a fog . At low tide it was possible to walk completely around the schooner dry-shod . Captain Hall swung his Mathildzs as close to the bar as he dared , put a double hawser aboard the Sophia . and waited For full tide . Then he ordered his engineer to wedge up the governor , allowing the injection valves to open wide . With her screw roiling the water far astern , the 500-horsepower Mathilda tugged , and tugged and tugged . But she could not break the tenacious sand 's grip on the Sophia Christianson . Then Captain Hall had an idea . Ile recalled that the Mathilda was equipped with a special self-contained , freshwater cooling device for the Diesel . Captain Hall did n't have to he afraid of blocking the waterjackets of his motor by pumping even very sandy salt water through them . Any Tow May be a Headache At high tide Captain Hall deliberately ran the stern of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranded schooner . He ordered his Diesel at full speed . The powerful churning of the Mathilda 's propeller began to dredge a channel in the soft , sand . After two days of marine plowing , the Mathilda was lying alongside the Sophia Christianson and washing shackling sand away from her hull . At the next high title Captain Hall snaked the schooner through his man-made channel into deep water . " Bit tsurely , " I asked Henry Foss , ' ' that 's not a typical job of work t " " Maybe not typical , " he said thoughtfully , " but it is n't a unique story . There are plenty of others about the same on our logs . There 's never a time when chance does n't complicate what . looks like a simple towing job . There 's never a job where the resourcefulness of the men on the tugs and the ability of the men backing them up ashore do n't mean the difference between a prolit and a heavy loss . " The Foss boys know what good men mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only as good as its tugboatmen and the men in the shipyards and offices ashore . Their main concern is to keep superior crews . Two men have been on the Foss pay roll for more than forty-five years . Nineteen have been employed twenty years . Fifty-seven have been on the job ten years . The outfit operates on a closed-shop basis , with a record of many years of co-operative harmony with the unions . The Hand at the Wheel The brothers are especially particular about the backers-up in the home office . Louis Berg , who is in charge of the stores and purchasing for the shipbuilding-and-repair plant , is a typical backer-up . At the age of thirteen he got his first job from Andrew Foss , who set him to tending the garden where the food for the growing tugboat family 's table then was grown . While weeding the strawberry patch , Berg found a roll of bills . He took the money to Andrew Foss . The old man gave Berg half the money and said : " You could have kept all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that honesty pays good dividends . " Berg moved into the office as assistant to Thea Foss . He rose steadily from one position of trust to another . " I always wonder if the old man planted the money as a test. , " Berg reflects today . " Somehow I like to think he did n't . " But the Foss brothers do not consider their alert tug and shore crews their greatest asset . Their mother and father hold that place . In their offices they have the logs of fifty years of the boat business . The boys can look back and see what Mother and Father Foss did in a given situation . And they do just that , to advantage . The memory of Thea Foss is kept especially fresh in the hearts of her sons . A picture of her hangs over the desk of each . They have named their beautiful yacht the Thee , Foss . But they did n't think it quite right to make the boat they named for her a pleasure craft altogether . So the Thea Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towing bit to girders built into her hull especially for that purpose . The sons of Tugboat Annie think she would have wanted it so .
