Little Eva <P> Sir : <P> <P> DEEPLY SHOCKED AT IDOLIZATION OF MADAME PERON ON YOUR COVER TIME , JULY 14 . <P> <P> PAUL H. GOLDENBERG <P> New York <P> Sir : <P> TIME has certainly reached a new low . The article on Eva Peron is the devil 's own broth of poison and vituperation . . . . <P> Eva Peron is a most prominent man 's wife . It is obvious that Mr. Peron knows what TIME could not possibly know about Eva 's heart and soul , and that is the reason why he chose her as his wife . . . . <P> <P> F. C. MONTUORI <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . There must be something more important going on in Latin America that you could devote this precious space to . . . . <P> <P> PHIL SHERF <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> . . . A classic . Plutarch or Dante could not have surpassed it . The resemblance to Aimee Semple McPherson is uncanny . . . . Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMES PRESTON SCROGGS <P> Los Angeles <P> Renter 's Slant <P> Sir : <P> TIME 'S comments on the rent situation are cogent and fair TIME , July 14 , and it is refreshing to find it not subscribing to the denunciation of an unidentifiable " real-estate " lobby . . . . <P> The nubbin of this situation is really easy to understand if we approach it from a different slant . <P> Q. : How much of total expenditures went for rent , prewar ? <P> A. : Nationwide , approximately 20% . <P> Q. : How much of total spending goes for rent in 1947 ? <P> A. : Less than 15% . <P> In other words , one class of the population is being mulcted for the benefit of another larger class . . . . <P> I 'm a renter , but I say the renters should be sufficiently grounded in equity to consent to give their landlords that 5% difference without bellyaching . <P> <P> FRANKLIN KNOX <P> Tujunga , Calif . <P> <P> Rhyme &; Reason <P> Sir : <P> I have often noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will accept my assurance that " Fildes " has never rhymed with " Shields , " but always with " Childs " TIME , June 23 . . . . As for his " goatee " . . . his was an ordinary beard ( see cut ) as worn by many " gents " of his day . He looked like the doctor in his picture of " The Doctor " . . . . <P> More important is your story of a preliminary small-scale picture followed by the large final version . The truth is that the large picture is the original . My father made a small copy of it years later . . . . <P> <P> PAUL FILDES <P> London <P> I TIME was misinformed ( rhymes with wrong ) . - ED . <P> <P> There 'll Always Be a Linden <P> Sir : <P> Elliot Paul might be interested to know that modern Lindeners are still running true to form : " Lindeners were basically easygoing , but could become aroused over really important issues " TIME , July 14 . <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Eastern Ave . to Salem St. Seems that the local two-engine fire station had been condemned , was to be torn down and a larger one built in the next district to service both communities . . . .
