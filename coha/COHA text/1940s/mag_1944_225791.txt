This week listeners at Europe 's 36,000,000 radio sets might have heard New York 's Archbishop Francis Joseph Spellman preaching civil disobedience . The Archbishop 's OWI broadcast ( his first ) , rebroadcast by BBC , eloquently urged Hungary 's nine million Roman Catholics* to disobey their Government 's new anti-Semitic decrees . <P> Said Monsignor Spellman : <P> " Almost on the feast of Pentecost ( May 28 ) , the day on which the Church of Christ emphasizes the supranational , supraracial character of her mission , we learned that the Government of Hungary had agreed to enforce against the Jewish people a code of discriminatory laws . We were told that this unhappy segment of Israel in Hungary is being herded into ghettos after its homes and its shops had been systematically looted and pillaged . <P> " This announcement has shocked all men and women who cherish a sense of justice and of human sympathy . It is in direct contradiction of the doctrines of the Catholic Faith professed by the vast majority of the Hungarian people . It is a negation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . <P> " It seems incredible , therefore , that a nation which has been so consistently true to the impulses of human kindness and the teachings of the Catholic Church should now yield to a false , pagan code of tyranny because of blood and race . How can men of good will fail to heed those solemn words of Pope Pius XI : ' Abraham is called our patriarch , our ancestor . Anti-Semitism is not compatible with the sublime reality of this text . It is a movement in which we Christians can not share . Spiritually we are Semites . ' <P> " To this day , the coinage and the postage stamps of the country bear the figure of Mary , the Mother of Mankind . It would be all the more tragic , therefore , if a people so devoted to Mary , the Jewish Maiden who was the Mother of the Messiah , freely countenance cruel laws calculated to despoil and annihilate the race from which Jesus and Mary sprang . <P> " It is incredible that a people with such profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest parliamentary tradition of the Continent , would join in a hymn of hatred and willingly submit to the blood lust and brigandage of tyranny . No man can love God and hate his brother . No one who hates his brother can be a faithful follower of the gentle Christ . " <P> <P> * The 1,000,000 Roman Catholics in Texas and Oklahoma last week were commanded to cooperate with Protestants and Jews , Purpose : to help rebuild " a broken civilization . " The unusual order was mainly the work of San Antonio 's Archbishop Robert Emmet Lucey , but the six bishops in the area also signed it . Wrote the prelates : " For Catholics this is a c ommand.
