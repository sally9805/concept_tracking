txt Oldest High School for Boys GEORGE C. HANSON , pg . 22 Letters to The Times Oldest High School for Boys To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a recent issue of THE NEW YORK TIMES I note that it was stated that De Witt Clinton was the first high school for boys established in New York . We at Boys High School have always felt that our school was the oldest public high school for boys in the metropolitan area . ? The history of Boys High School goes back to 1878 , when a group of public-spirited Brooklyn citizens , after decades of agitation , finally persuaded the authorities of the then city of Brooklyn to establish a public high school in which graduates of the elementary schools might continue their education . As a result , the Central Grammar School was established in a small building at the corner of Court and Livingston Streets . That was the significant beginning of public secondary education in Brooklyn . In 1886 the girls were transferred to a new building  --  Girls High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Marcy Avenue building . Thus toys High is the oldest public high school for boys in the metropolitan area . GEORGE C. HANSON , Administrative Assistant . Brooklyn , Oct. 24. 1947.
