No one , least of all the average Briton , questions that a British victory in World War II would mean a very " new order " in the British Empire and quite possibly in the world . Herbert George Wells &; Co. , Clarence ( " Union Now " ) Streit , Winston Churchill , Lord Halifax and the Anglican Church have all had their say about Britain 's war and peace aims . Last week in London , when Britain 's most apparent war aim was to keep from getting licked , another group spoke up . <P> In a press-released " commentary " a self-appointed brain trust of liberal intellectuals , calling themselves the 1941 Committee , handed out stinging criticism to the British Government , suggested a broad program of war and peace aims . Signed by Julian Huxley , H. G. Wells , Kingsley Martin , veteran editor of the liberal New Statesman , and J. B. Priestley , the " commentary " suggested that Britain must " win the peace " as well as the war , should start right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concentration of industry s an example of a now-familiar process . . . A scheme is improvised which drives out the small men , secures the position of the big monopolists and temporarily at least of the large trade unions , while providing no safeguards for the mass workers . ... No attempt has been made to link this scheme . . . with any national wage system or to fit it into a general economic plan for the community . <P> " When big industrial magnates are drawn from their private firms to take over departments of State , the interests of these firms are not necessarily subordinated to the interests of the nation . <P> " The press is largely in the hands of a few monopolists and tends to go with the Government and with the big advertisers . <P> " In the absence of an organized opposition , in the conditions of the party truce and with no real elections taking place , the danger is that Parliament ceases to be representative . . . and democratic life dies . It is perhaps worth remembering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France . <P> " Mr. Churchill 's leadership must now be backed up by adequate policies . Comprehensive , coherent , imaginative measures are needed . " <P> As a starter toward " winning the war and winning the peace " the Committee suggested a sweeping but somewhat vague program : 1 ) organizing all opposition to the Nazis and Fascists ; 2 ) open declaration of Britain 's war and peace aims ; 3 ) giving a concrete demonstration of what Britain is fighting for by starting to rebuild her social system at once . <P> No cluster of gentle and disregardable nuts is the 1941 committee . Chairman Priestley , before the war a writer of folksy reveries like The Good Companions , has turned into a national oracle . No less than 40% of Britain 's 14,000,000 radio listeners give him ear when he discusses each Sunday night the problems before the Empire .
