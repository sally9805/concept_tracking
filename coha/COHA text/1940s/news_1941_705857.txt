txt LONDON , Sept. ** leading questions of the day in Britain are , first , what exactly has been the effect of the Royal Air Force offensive against the Reich , and , second , when , where and in what strength will the Luftwaffe retaliate ? The first can be answered along broad lines based on knowledge of how many raids have been carried out and their relative hitting power , but there is still a wide divergence of opinion as to how much has been accomplished .. ' More than 5,000 R. A. F. raids have been made on Germany and German-occupied territory from the start of the war up to last Aug. 31 . Between Sept. 3 , 1939 , and the end of April , 1940 , there were only seventy-eight such raids , apart from leaflet and reconnaissance flights . The real British Blitz that started this Summer entailed nearly 600 bombing attacks within a period of three months . And it should never be forgotten that the more recent attacks have yielded far better results because of improved aircraft and vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of R. A. F. raids made during the intervening thirteen months follow : 1940 ? May 119 , June 319 , July 496 , August 580 , September 804 , October 697 , November 514 , December 57 ; 1941 ? January 38 , February 130 , March 194 , April 213 , May 181 . Targets selected for attack were oil plants 392 times , railroad and water communications 796 , aircraft factories 89 , munitions 181 , industrial plants 344 , airports 1,298 , docks and shipyards 1,360 , shipping at sea 327 , military concentrations 209 and miscellaneous objectives 257 . The Air Ministry 's map of Germany showing the concentrations of attacks has a cross-hatching in dicating where munitions , coal , lignite , chemicals and oil and also shipping and steel objectives were sought out . Two Rhineland-Ruhr areas have received the heaviest blows  --  that embracing Cologne , Essen , Dortmund , Duisburg , Muenster and Osnabrueck and that taking in Frankfort on the Main , Mannheim and Stuttgart . In addition , there are the regions surrounding Berlin , Hamburg , Kiel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This listing is obviously very sketchy because R. A. F. interests extend over several hundred German towns . It is significant that some of them have experienced bombings comparable to those suffered by the worst-raided British communities . Take , for example , the first ten days of last July , when Muenster received a three-star blasting on July 5  --  the stars being an unofficial Air Ministry way of telling how severe a raid was . Muenster was attacked again on July 6 , 7 and 8 , and on ' July 9 was down for four stars , which is " the works . " Berlin has been raided fifty times . Cologne is the only German city the R. A. F. has attacked more than 100 times , but there is a score of others that have heard the crash of British bombs at least as often as has the Reich capital . Every one here is sure those towns will see and hear much more of destruction before another year has passed . New Bomber Types The British are frankly experimenting with their bombers . Leading among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat bigger than the American-built Flying Fortress . Then there are the Manchester and Halifax , both newcomers since the Wellingtons , Whitleys and Blenheims blazed trails over the Reich . Defending the bombers on forays against near-by targets in occupied France , Belgium and the Netherlands are new , faster , more heavily armed British fighters : the Spitfires , Hurricanes , Bristol , Beaus , Havoc , Whirlwind and Defiant . Some of these are earmarked generally for night defensive patrols . Germany has mustered nothing to match this display of aircraft . That is , always , so far as is known here . Rather than dicker around with different types , Marshal Goering 's practice has been to improve existing types . It gives him a big advantage in the matter of production . The Germans rely on large numbers of Heinkel 111 's and Junkers 88 's , possibly supplemented with Dornier 17 's and 215 's . The ace aircraft up the Luftwaffe 's sleeve are the Focke-Wulf Condor longrange bombers and the fighters Courier and Zerstorer made by the same firm . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109F and the 110 , known as the Jaguar fighter-bomber , are laughed at by British fighter pilots . The Flying Fortress bombers are designed for service in the substratosphere , a point in which they differ from the British Stirlings . High-altitude bombing is said here to be only truly effective during daylight . So long as the Fortress planes keep their height they can attack German cities with relative immunity as the Nazi fighters can .. not go much above 35,000 feet and anyway by the time they get there the raiders are 100 miles off . It was shown recently that a Fortress plane caught as low as 20,000 feet can be riddled with machine-gun bullets and cannon shot . Major results , however , have been obtained through low-level attacks by British bombers , notably that on Rotterdam this week , when shipping was literally blown out of the water . Planes , no matter how large , sweeping over a countryside at fifty to 100 feet make almost impossible targets for ground defenses ; it is a case of here they come , there they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train his sights . Moreover , the bqmberaimer has a good prospect of scoring a bull 's eye when the objective is almost within arm 's reach . British Planes Preferred British airmen express a marked preference for their own planes . This is not a sample of ingratitude , nor is it entirely due to any lack in the American aircraft . A. lot of it has to do with the manner in which the British designers have solved their problems  --  turning out excellent machines for specific purposes . Manufacturers in the United States have not the advantage of the war laboratory at their doorstep . The publicity given the latest very powerful British bombs does not include many crumbs of information and those that are picked up around town can not be circulated farther . But the story goes , and the evidence supports it , that they flatten everything over a wide area and toss whole buildings in the air . In short , one of them well placed is worth half a dozen of the old big ones over a scattered target area . Speculation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German war effort can go on all night . The Air Force people issue communiqu  --  s full of flames and smoke and bolstered by accounts of what the bomber crews see during attack ; yet there is room for discounting part of this because of the uncertainty of observation when a raid is in progress . Deemed more accurate are the long-delayed reports issued by the Ministry of Economic Warfare , in which the results of raids are assessed on the ground in Germany . Finally there is the opinion of experts in high places here who say quietly , " We have reason to believe some very good results are being obtained . " Weighing the Losses The air war simmers down to a matter of ratios . The British aim to destroy at least 10 per cent of enemy raiders while keeping their own losses over the Reich below that same 10 per cent . It is calculated that a bombing expedition is not profitable when the losses exceed that figure . There is also the secret ratio of fighter escort planes assigned to bombers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archibald Sinclair , Minister of Aircraft Production , said this week the British Empire was turning out crews far faster than the rate of plane production . Still unanswered is the question of when , where ? and in what strength the Luftwaffe will retaliate on the enemy now reflecting such heavy damage to German cities . A year ago London was mentioned for the first time as a target of German bombers in this war . Between Oct. 8 and Nov. 1 there were twenty-six raids over Britain , all save four aimed at London . London suffered the heaviest raid any British city ever has had last May 10 . In days to come London will probably furnish the answer to the question of what the Luftwaffe has in store for Britain , just as Berlin serves as a sort of barometer for a measure of the , pressure Britain can bring to bear on her foe .
