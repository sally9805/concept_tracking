txt Appreciation Expressed I have had occasion within the last two weeks to appear with one of my boys here , a member of my church , before an appeal officer , and with another before a local draft board , both haying- registered as conscientious objectors . May I thus publicly express my appreciation of the character and tone of the hearings accorded ? With seriousness and unfailing courtesy both boys were given an object lesson in the ways of an intelligent democracy by men who were among its worthiest representatives . I was deeply impressed by the spirit manifested in both cases and found myself growing still prouder of the freedoms which we possess here in America and which it is our privilege both to cherish and to serve .
