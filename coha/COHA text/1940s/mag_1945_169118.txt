Good soldiers winced , like the folks at home , when they heard that U.S. service troops in France had been systematically stealing and selling cigarets , gasoline , food and arms needed by their fighting comrades at the front . Last week the Army ( and court martial witnesses ) told more about one of the sorriest scandals in recent military history . <P> One hundred and eighty-two soldiers and two officers had been charged with taking some $200,000 in black market cigarets alone . The trials had begun and some of the defendants had already spoken up . As they talked , the line of uniformed racketeers seemed to grow &; grow . <P> Said one 21-year-old private : " They seem to think us fellows of the 716th 716th Railway Operation Battalion were the only ones that did anything . That ai n't right . All along the line the railway leading from Cherbourg to Paris there were any amount of men doing the same thing , maybe on a higher scale . " <P> Further details from men in other units rounded out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to susceptible Yanks . At first the soldiers had committed petty thefts for petty cash . Then some had grown more ambitious . They had diverted or delayed whole trains and looted them . Truckloads of supplies had been sold for $5,000 and up ; when trucks were added , they sometimes brought another $5,000 . <P> In their heyday , the G.I. racketeers had waded in cigarets and candy , traded fistfuls of U.S. money at poker games . The 716th had boasted openly of its nickname : " The Millionaire Battalion . " <P> But when the men of the 716th threw themselves on the mercy of a cold court last week , all their brag was gone . The defense made its points as well as it could : 1 ) the accused had been left largely to shift for themselves soon after Dday , and so had become easy prey for the black-marketeers ; 2 ) officers knew of the situation and tolerated it ; 3 ) so many units were entangled that feelings of moral guilt reached the vanishing point . <P> The court martial was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face it was sentenced to prison and hard labor . The lightest sentence : 25 years . The heaviest : life .
