Last week Kenneth Farrand Simpson , 45 , had had his first 23 days as Congressman from Manhattan 's silk-stocking district . He had started briskly : he offered a substitute measure for the President 's Lend-Lease Bill , along the lines of Wendell Willkie 's suggestions , limiting the Presidential powers to two years , giving Congress greater control . The stocky , outspoken , ex-Republican boss of Manhattan seemed the most dynamic Republican freshman in a decade . He was counted on to bring to Republican counsels a liberal spirit , fruitful imagination and good-natured common sense . <P> Kenneth Simpson spent his weeks in Washington , his weekends in Manhattan . <P> There Republican affairs had gone against him ; last December he felt compelled to resign his last important party post , the county chairmanship . Thomas Dewey , once Simpson 's ally , later his bitter foe , emerged in complete control of the New York County Republican machine , with only the still potent Simpson voice to be heard from the outside . Last week the voice was silenced . Sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , managed to call to his wife for help before he died . Tributes poured in from many he had fought-from President Roosevelt , Tom Dewey , Mayor LaGuardia . The short story of Kenneth Simpson 's national career was over .
