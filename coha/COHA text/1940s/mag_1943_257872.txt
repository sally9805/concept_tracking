Tired and rather haggard , General Georges Catroux , Fighting French emissary to the North African government of General Henri Honor Giraud , arrived in London last week and registered as usual at Claridge 's . Within an hour he had bathed , changed and with a bulging briefcase left in a four-year-old Buick flying the French tricolor to see his leader , General Charles de Gaulle . Behind him lay two weeks of conferences in Algiers ; before him , perhaps , a solution at last of the differences which had long divided the French . <P> A Friend Lost ? General Catroux had a problem . His conferences in Algiers with General Giraud had been intended to lay a basis for uniting the two French factions . The stage had been set for De Gaulle 's coming to Algiers . Then , at the eleventh hour , a message signed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower had requested De Gaulle to postpone his visit . <P> This postponement reawakened all of De Gaulle 's old doubts , suspicions and mistrust of the U.S. policy which had pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allayed when General Eisenhower tartly announced that the Fighting French announcement of the request and the delay surprised him . <P> The explanation , when it came , confirmed General de Gaulle 's worst misgivings . This time it was not his U.S. detractors and opponents who had thrown the wrench . General de Gaulle 's old friends and supporters in the British Government had suggested that he stay away from North Africa ; someone at General Eisenhower 's headquarters had merely agreed and acted in his name . <P> To soothe touchy , egoistic General de Gaulle , to explain once more the harsh realities of North Africa , was General Catroux 's problem . As mediator between De Gaulle and Giraud , astute General Catroux at times had taken on greater stature than either of the two leaders . Certainly he understood some things that his chief did not . <P> Despite some spectacular manifestations of support , French North Africa was not ready to fall into De Gaulle 's arms . A visit now would divert the energies of generals absorbed in the climactic phase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pointed out these things to General de Gaulle . Higher and harsher authorities finally had to do so . <P> Resurrection Lost ? The U.S. State Department , the British in their alignment with U.S. policy , even General de Gaulle sometimes forget that there are two De Gaulles . One is the hypersensitive , often arrogant , always difficult De Gaulle in London . The other is the De Gaulle who commands the unquestioning faith and loyalty of millions in his occupied homeland . <P> Of that De Gaulle and of the alternatives to him , a Frenchwoman in Vichy-france wrote last December . When she penned her letter to a friend in the U.S. , turncoat Admiral Jean Franois Darlan was still alive and in U.S. favor . Since his death , many things had changed for the better . But when her smuggled letter turned up in the U.S. last week , its words still rang : <P> " I would like you now to try to convince our American friends that if they were obliged , for strategical reasons , to make a compact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may at first have appeared fruitful . The key which opened for them the doors of Algiers will not open metropolitan France .
