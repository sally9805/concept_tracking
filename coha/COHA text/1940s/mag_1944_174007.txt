Dr. Marcel Andre Henri Felix Petiot is a tall , elegant man whose brown curly beard stretches from ear to ear . Seven months ago a peculiar odor coming from his Paris house attracted unwanted attention . Inside , police found the remains of 50 to 60 persons , bits of their clothing and jewelry . At first they could not find Dr. Petiot , but last fortnight they did . He was waiting for a subway in the Saint-Mande station . Dr. Petiot wore the uniform of an F.F.I captain . <P> Since he fled from his sinister home , Dr. Petiot had joined the resistance movement , got himself commissioned as a captain at Valmy barracks under the name of Henry Valery . Police caught him by comparing a letter written by F.F.I. Captain Valery with samples of Dr. Petiot 's handwriting . Dr. Petiot said that his 50-odd victims were collaborators and Germans whom he had murdered for the sake of France . But the police said they were Frenchmen murdered for the Gestapo . <P> Interest in Dr. Petiot plummeted . Parisians yawned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of political murderers .
