Mutual Broadcasting System is seven years old this month , and a happy birthday it will be . Mutual will add two more NBC stations to its chain . The Federal Communications Commission 's antimonopoly hearings which begin in Washington this week will not mar the youngest network 's celebration , will probably be a sick headache for rivals CBS and NBC . Mutual 's position is dandy . As a cooperative , it has little to fear from FCC 's projected chain-busting . <P> Baltimore 's WFBR and Pittsburgh 's WCAE , MBS 's two new outlets , were among the many stations being jogged around by NBC preparatory to selling its Blue network out of fear of FCC 's frown . WFBR and WCAE had been Red network stations and chose to go Mutual rather than be put in the Blue package . Besides its acquisitions in Baltimore and Pittsburgh , Mutual will also take over next fortnight Buffalo 's WGR , a CBS outlet , which decided to shift allegiance when its sister station WKBW moved to CBS .

MBS needs only 72 employes ( against 4,600 for NBC , 1,900 for CBS ) to keep going . Its total operating expenses foot up to some $700,000 . Its headquarters , on the edge of Manhattan 's garment district , consist of a bleakly furnished floor in a dreary building which also houses its major Eastern outlet , WOR . <P> Under swart , smart General Manager Fred Weber , onetime assistant to NBC 's Niles Trammell in Chicago , Mutual has moved steadily ahead . From a two-station chain in 1934 , it has grown until today it includes 173 affiliates . In the first eight months of 1940 , its cumulative billings were $2,494,370 ; for the same period this year $4,024,680 ( as compared with NBC 's $30,960,519 , CBS 's $25,776,094 ) . <P> Unlike its competitors MBS started through necessity .

Big recommendation for Mutual with advertisers was the fact that it insisted only on the purchase of its three big units , WOR , WGN , WLW , with other units to be added at pleasure . Not until June 1936 did it reach a coast-to-coast status . That occurred when CBS offered to buy the Don Lee network , which turned to cooperative Mutual instead .
