txt Hoping that the " great consuming class " will rise up and demand adequate price control , congressional leaders today were confident that they could bring a semblance of national unity out of the critical cost of living fight on Capitol Hill . A compromise , which Senator Alben W. Barkley , Majority Leader , predicts will pass the Senate , would put the President in command of the troublesome farm labor problem , instead of allowing it immediately to negate the new tigher ceilings on prices , proposed by the President in his Labor Day speech . The compromise directs the President to take farm labor costs into consideration when he fixes price ceilings . After adoption by the Senate it would still have to go back to the House where a recalcitrant Farm Bloc this week succeeded in getting the farm labor allowance written into the price control bill , against the President 's wishes .

He has promised to act independently under his war powers to stop price rises if Congress does not pass a satisfactory bill before Oct. 1 .

Three main factors are clearly influencing the views of both governments and the public in a number of European nation which hitherto have been inclined to give the Axis at least an equal chance of winning the war , but which are now swinging around toward the opinion that the likelihood of a Hitler victory declines sharply with every week Stalingrad holds out . First and most important reason for this altered attitude is the prolonged Russian resistance , both at Stalingrad and in the Caucasus . Ability of the Russians to launch measurable counterattacks , in An effort to relieve pressure on the city , reveals reserve strength which many observers now believe may prove decisive . Whatever the fate of Stalingrad itself , the conviction is spreading throughout Europe that Hitler has failed to achieve the main strategic aims of his 1942 campaign and that he therefore faces the necessity of another costly winter campaign against Russian armies whose forces are strained but unbroken . Key Question The key question here is plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South will have adversely affected . Russia 's resources of food factories and oil to such an extent that it will be unable to maintain its present pressure . On the basis of their performance during the last few weeks , however , the Soviet armies seem to possess unsuspected reserve power . They have not only held up Field Marshal Fedor von Bock at Stalingrad for more than a month , they have at the same time kept some degree of initiative all the way along the front from Voronezh to Leningrad . The effect on the Axis satellites and European neutrals of this failure by Germany to achieve anything like its full ? objectives this year is becoming more and more marked . This has been heightened by a second factor , namely , increasingly heavy bombing of Germany by the British and American air forces . Taken together , these two developments appear to be widely interpreted on the Continent as clear evidence Hitler has lost his best chance of defeating the United Nations . Third Factor This growing impression is still further heightened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . The fact is that only lately have the information services of Britain and the United States been able to get in some genuinely effective work in neutral countries and even in occupied and satellite nations . This information has at last begun to counteract the high pressure of Nazi propaganda , which all along has belittled the significance of the United States ' entrance into the war . The result is the idea has begun to penetrate and spread that in the end , despite all their vast territorial conquests to date , the Axis is bound to lose . The consequences throughout Europe of this altered view on the eventual outcome of the conflict can hardly be overestimated  --  though it would be a mistake to expect any immediate sensational developments . The German grip on the satellite governments is too tight and Axis influence in neutral nations too considerable to justify the expectance of any sudden startling changes . But it is nevertheless clear that the leaven has begun to work . Tension in Balkans Among signs of this are the growing restlessness and tension in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ion Antonescu " above the law " and empowering him to set up general constitutional laws is indicative of this situation . There Is great dissatisfaction in Rumania at the heavy German demands on the Rumanian Army . It is estimated that nearly 15 Rumanian divisons have been sent to fight the Russians . Hitler is now reported to be demanding the immediate dispatch of five more Rumanian divisions . Antagonism between Rumania and Hungary , though latent , has not really lessened . Both countries keep a large number of troops along their common frontier . Rumanians are reported especially incensed that such a big proportion of their army has been sent to Russia while relatively few Hungarian troops have been drafted by the Germans for this unpopular campaign . It is this dissatisfaction which General Antonescu is believed to have talked over with Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop at their recent meeting . An unconfirmed report also says that General Antonescu recently was received by Hitler . In Yugoslavia , too , the Axis has its hands full with the continued resistance of Yugoslav patriots and Communist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their strategic significance appear to have been exaggerated recently , the fact remains the Yugoslav unrest continues to pin down many Axis troops now sorely needed in Russia . Concern Over Bulgaria The Bulgarian situation , too , Is causing the Axis much concern . Although , owing to strict censorship , reports from Bulgaria are inconclusive , it appears that popular sympathy with the Soviet continues to make It difficult for the Bulgarian Government to lend much active support to the Axis . Rumors of outright revolt In Bulgaria have not been confirmed , but might well be premature rather than completely unfounded . Among the neutrals , Turkey has been particularly affected by Hitler 's failure to achieve anything resembling complete success in the Russian campaign . A month or six weeks ago the Turks were gravely worried , both by Marshal von Bock 's threat through the Caucasus and by General Field Marshal Erwin Rommel 's menace to Suez . Neither of these peril has been removed , but neither of them any longer appears imminent . Ankara has also been particularly impressed by the news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit there . Effect in Portugal At the other end of the Mediterranean , slow but steady improvement in United Nations prospects has had an undoubted effect in both Madrid and Lisbon . In Portugal , the tendency to draw closer to the United Nations , which started with Brazil 's entry into the war , has now been accentuated . There is good reason to believe that diplomatic relations between London and Lisbon are now closer and more cordial than they have been for a long time . The same thing applies in a differing degree to relations with Spain . The political picture in Madrid , however , remains obscure . There are persistent reports of negotiations for restoration of the monarchy . All that can be said ' I with any assurance is that the Army and other elements favorable to the monarchy have been strengthened by the recent changes which saw the departure of Ramon Serrano Sutler. as Foreign Minister , and other strongly pro-Axis pollticians . Even In Vichy , there are some signs that faith in German victory is waning . So far the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre Laval , Chief of Government , and other confirmed collaborationists to procure for Hitler French labor and other help he needs . But underneath the surface , there are hints that some Vichy supporters are beginning to look around for the opportunity to switch over to the winning side . Thus there is widespread evidence that throughout Continental Europe , Axis failure to achieve a decisive victory over Russia this summer is having important repercussions . It is too soon to draw any far-reaching conclusions from this new tendency . Much depends on the course of the Russian campaign in the next few weeks . But should the Soviet be able to turn the tide and drive the Germans back from Stalingrad , then the indications are that the sentiments all over Europe would turn powerfully away from the Axis and toward the United Nations .
