Consul General Angus Ward hurried from a Communist people 's court in Mukden , Manchuria last week to telephone the news to the nearest American diplomat , 400 miles away in Peiping . Ward and four members of his consulate staff had been freed from a Communist jail and were to be deported from Red China . <P> The U.S. Consul in Peiping relayed the report to Washington . From Ward 's skimpy recapitulation and the splutterings of the Communist Chinese radio , the State Department pieced together the humiliating story . After holding the U.S. consulate members incommunicado for nearly a month ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) , the Communists had staged a hasty " trial , " and convicted Ward and his aides of " brutally assaulting " a Chinese servant . The Reds ' kangaroo court sentenced the five to jail for three to six months , imposed a stiff fine , then suspended the sentences and ordered them deported . <P> Despite the State Department 's flaccid indecisiveness in the whole affair , the Chinese Communists had apparently bowed to international indignation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the right to represent China in the U.N . Ward 's release came only a day after the U.S. appealed to 30 nations ( including Russia ) for help in freeing the consul general and his aides . <P> But the Communists did not yield without slapping the U.S. in the face once again . At week 's end , as Ward and his staff tried to arrange for transport out of China , Communist police descended on the consulate , made off with young ( 26 ) <P> Vice Consul William N. Stokes and forced him to watch the trial of ten Japanese , Chinese and Koreans accused of " spying " for the U.S. No Americans were on trial , but that did not bother the people 's court . Its verdict : the entire staff of the U.S. consulate would be deported along with Angus Ward .
