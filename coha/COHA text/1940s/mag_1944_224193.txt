They brought what was left of Mineichi Koga to Tokyo in a special train . He had done no great deeds , but he had died ( they said ) in action-and he was the Commander in Chief of Japan 's Fleet . They enshrined him as a minor Shinto god ; the Emperor granted him two decorations and a promotion to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet ; the radio implored Japanese to " live the Koga way . " <P> Thus did Koga , a small , taciturn man with an egg-shaped head , pass from the stage . But he left it in a whirl of mystery more impressive than his life . <P> Only eleven months earlier , Koga 's famed predecessor , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ( " I am looking forward to dictating peace in the White House . . . " ) was shot down in his airplane in the South Pacific . The announcement of Koga 's death was strangely like that of Yamamoto 's : " . . . died at his post in March while directing general operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Allied observers and Japan 's civilians could only speculate on the rest : was Koga killed in the U.S. air and naval raids on Truk and Palau on March 29 ? Was he intercepted by U.S. fighters en route to some Pacific base ? Or did he , as Chungking suggested , honorably disembowel himself presumably in protest against the last naval reshuffle ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) ? <P> Almost forgotten in the flurry of speculation was the appointment of the new Fleet Commander : puffy-faced , 59-year-old Soemu Toyoda , a skilled naval technician , who had thus far sat this war out in and near Tokyo , cannily managed to be known as a bitter-end jingo.
