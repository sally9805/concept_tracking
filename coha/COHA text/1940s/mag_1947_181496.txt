Endorsement <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on being condemned by Vishinsky . That 's the best endorsement a free newsmagazine could get . <P> FRANCIS BARNETTE <P> Baltimore <P> Checkmate <P> Sir : <P> TIME 'S Sept. 29 cover showed . . . the red pieces on the chess board hopelessly positioned with king in check , vital men doomed , checkmate a certainty . <P> DR . CONRAD MOSES <P> Wilmington <P> Sir : <P> A hurried analysis . . . indicates that the player pushing the red men ( Stalin ) has accepted white 's gambit pawn but lost a knight as a result . Furthermore , the red player has not taken time by the forelock , but has remained undeveloped , while white has taken full advantage of every possibility to develop his position . . . . <P> <P> W. G. McGAVOCK <P> Davidson , N.C. <P> Sir : <P> <P> . . . Ernest Baker is not only a splendid artist but an excellent chess player as well . <P> It is Russia 's move . If she changes her viewpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pursuit of Happiness as well as Religious Freedom . . . her opponent might delay the checkmate ( moving of white bishop one space forward , diagonally ) , or at least give Russia another chance ( new game ) . <P> If Russia continues to follow the same policies in the future as she has in the past , this might be the last game . <P> RALPH O. ROGERS <P> Indianapolis <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on your cover with the famous chess game ( Marshall v. Tschigorin , Monte Carlo , 1902 ) in background . <P> We thought it quite symbolic of present U.N . chess game . <P> Let 's hope the results are equally conclusive . <P> An interesting point : the tactics adopted by Tschigorin ( black pieces ) are now considered obsolete by modern theorists ! <P> WM . C. ADICKES JR . Asheville , N.C. <P> Blood &; Guts <P> Sir : <P> Your review in the Sept. 29 issue of Robert S. Allen 's book Lucky Forward is the first authentic evaluation of General Patton from the combat soldier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known to the line soldier as " Georgie . " It was just plain " Pat-ton . " You bet it was " our blood and his guts " as far as combat troops were concerned ! A general 's position is too remote to make him a hero to his men . . . . We did respect Patton but only as hired help respect any reportedly competent high executive . <P> WILFRED S. REYNOLDS JR . <P> Birmingham , Ala . <P> Sir : <P> It was a pleasure to learn that TIME 'S book reviewer was n't taken in by Robert S. Allen 's phony-baloney story of how Patton and his Third Army won the war . . . . <P> I believe the record goes more like this : <P> First on the Normandy Beaches-the First Army . <P> First to break a hole at St. L for the Third Army to pour through-the First Army . <P> First to reach Paris-the First Army . <P> First into Belgium and Luxembourg-the First Army . <P> First to crack the Siegfried Line-the First Army . <P> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> First to meet the Russians at the Elbe-the First Army . . . . <P> ALLAN E. BULMER <P> Ex-Ninth Air Force Man <P> Revere , Mass . <P> Sir :
