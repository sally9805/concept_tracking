 | The Case of the Moving Jaws or Why Millions Chew Gum PerHAPS the closest the world has come to one language is the question hurled at American troops all over Europe : " Any gum , chum ? " America became a gum-chewing nation mainly because of three men : Thomas Adams , who put the chicle in the stick ; John Colgan , who put the flavor in the chicle ; and William Wrigley , Jr. , who put the gum in our mouths . . Adams , a spare-time inventor , became interested in gum one day in 1869 when he happened to hear a little girl in a Jersey City drugstore ask for some paraffin gum to chew . Recalling that he had seen Santa Anna , the Mexican dictator then in exile on Staten Island , break off pieces of ' chicle to chew , Adams and his son started work that night on some chicle that he had previously tried to convert into a rubber substitute ; they softened the chicle in hot water , kneaded it , and rolled out 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday Sun Don Wharton them quickly at a penny each , and soon Adams imported 5000 pounds of chicle . He shipped the unwrapped pellets in boxes labeled " Adams New York Gum ? Snapping and Stretching . " Later he got a machine that would run the chicle out in long thin strips notched so a druggist could break off penny lengths . The gum was chewy but tasteless . John Colgan , a Louisville druggist , flavored chicle with tolu balsam and called it Taffy-Tole . His first 1500 pounds went so quickly in Louisville that he decided to tackle Chicago , Cincinnati and Cleveland . The merchants there laughed and said they had heard that down South people chewed gum but in their cities it was not considered nice . Colgan told them it was " only a matter of education " ? and proceeded to " educate " them . Soon he had imitators galore . At one time ten factories were making tole-flavored gum , all calling it Taffy-Tolu.  | By the 1880 's a Cleveland manufacturer had flavored gum with peppermint , today 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pepsin , began talking about " good for digestion . " Soon an Indiana man came through with the slogan " Far Better Than a Kiss . " Gum has since been produced in dozens of flavors and under thousands of brand-names . In 1892 William Wrigley , Jr. , the greatest huckster of his day , brought salesmanship to chewing gum . This uninhibited sales genius a complete extrovert who owned red cars so he could find them and boasted that he could sell pianos to the armless men of Borneo ? built a company which has since sold more than 113 billion sticks of gum and paid out in dividends more than St 85,000,000 . At 12 Wrigley had been expelled from school in Philadelphia , run away from home , spent a winter in New York selling papers . At 13 he persuaded his father to release him from his $1.50-a-week soap-factory job and let him go on the road selling soap . The boy outsold drummers four times his age , and in a few years was selling as much as his father 's factory could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing gum . He picked a manufacturer , and went around to close the deal . Wrigley himself boasted that he was never late for an appointment , and when this man kept him waiting ten minutes Wrigley stalked out , found another manufacturer and gave him the business which eventually swelled to more than $40,000,000 a year . Wrigley 's first gum was called Lotta , implying that the customer got a lot of value . Wrigley had used premiums effectively in selling soap ; for instance , throwing in an 85-cent umbrella after raising the price from $1.8o to $3.34 a case . Now he used the premium technique in selling gum to dealers . His premiums give a fair picture of life in the Gay Nineties : boudoir lamps , fur rugs , pink-lemonade sets , solid brass cuspidors , mandolins , hat racks , coffee mills and a baby carriage complete with a laceedged parasol . The premiums helped to introduce many new inventions  --  fountain pens , cameras , graphophones . He gave away safety razors four years before the Gillette company was incorporated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1907 , Wrigley decided to " invest $1,000,000 in advertising . " He did n't have the million , or even a quarter million , but he got the advertising on credit . Soon Wrigley cards were in every streetcar in the country . In a year his Spearmint sales zoomed from $170,000 to $1,345,000 . People complained that they could n't get away from either the Wrigley name or the spearmint smell . O. Henry put chew-  | ing gum in the mouths of his stenographers and shopgirls . By 1910 Wrigley 's total sales were up to $4,445,000 . Wrigley liked doing things on a big scale . Twice he sent free chewmg gum to every name listed in ev- ery telephone book in the United States . Along the Trenton-Atlantic City railway he had an outdoor sign three miles long . Over a two-year period he distributed 14,000,000 Mother Goose books rewritten to tie chewing gum into nursery jingles . For years Wrigley sent two sticks of gum to as many American children as possible on their second birthday . Some years these birthday presents reached 750,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who in orange-colored satin teams of four to eight moved from city to city . Each girl was trained to give away 5000 sticks of gum a day . Thus America learned to chew gum . Consumption , which was 39 sticks per capita in 1914 , rose to 100 in 1925 , and is over 130 today . Though other countries have picked up the practice of gum-chewing , the United States consumes seven times as much as the rest of the world combined . Through the years the Wrigley , Beech-Nut and American Chicle companies have chalked up chewinggum profits of a third of a billion dollars ? all from a penny item for which the manufacturers have averaged about half a cent . In the 187o 's few adults thought of chewing gum . But by 1890 Harper 's was calling gum-chewing " mainly a female accomplishment ; the few men who chew gum may be supposed to do so by reason of gallantry . " ' Today surveys indicate that gumchewing is about evenly divided between the sexes , and that children do n't chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Spear and Miss Mint gave a dollar for an answer from anyone coming up with an open package of Wrigley 's . This campaign ran for three years , and Wrigley found that invariably the leading reasons were those which his advertising stressed at the moment . You ca n't say " relieves nervous tension " millions upon millions of times without some people believing it . Chewing gum has rolled on against the intangible opposition of manners . At one time chewing gum was used by the theater as a stage prop for streetwalkers . Later it was identified with stenographers . Two decades ago the head of the commercial department at one state university welcomed every new class with the pronouncement : " The difference between a secretary and a stenographer is : a stenographer chews gum . " Emily Post ignored gum in edition after edition of her Etiquette . Shortly before the war came along , she wrote : " It is still impossible to imagine a lady walking on a city street either chewing gum or smoking . " Some people think the current bubble-gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They reason that after one has seen bubble gum blown into an ugly balloon , popped , sucked , stretched , chewed and blown again , and again  | then mere chewing gum may seem relatively good form . Chewing gum creates a disposal problem which after 78 years is still unlicked . Thousands of dollars have been spent cleaning it from railroad terminals , theaters and so on . Most wrappers carry a printed line : " Save inner wrapper to dispose of gum . " This is probably the world 's most widely printed direction , yet apparently few follow it . During the war American plants produced some 15 billion sticks for the armed forces . For a while the entire output of Wrigley 's Australian factory disappeared ; no one at Wrigley headquarters in Chicago knew where and no one in Australia would tell . Later the story came out : the gum was wrapped in special wrappers , one side showing the crossed flags of the United States and the Philippines , the other carrying the words : " I Shalt Return ? MacArthur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Philippines . The world thinks of the United States as a nation of gum-chewers , but actually some ten percent of the population buys about 75 percent of the output . In wartime our service men chewed more than 500 sticks each per year ; gum manufacturers would like to duplicate that among civilians in peacetime . The difficulty lies in digging up new claims for chewing gum . Most of the possibilities have been used up ? everything from " increases efficiency " and " helps industrial relations " to " relieves boredom " and " keeps lips young . " However , we may depend upon the ingenuity of the gummakers to find something .
