Like everything else , the cost of putting out magazines had skyrocketed in the first two postwar years-and so had magazine mortality . Several big " X " ( for experimental ) projects had been quietly stowed away on the back of the shelf , and a good many marginal titles had been quietly junked by their publishers . Last week , adless , pocket-sized Pageant , one of the likelier-looking war babies , was dying in its handsome crib . <P> Publisher Alex L. Hillman started it in November 1944 , to add a touch of prestige to his profitable , hurdy-gaudy string ( comic books , Real Romances , Crime Detective , etc . ) . Pageant went out for good bylines , good pictures and no reprints . But neither Eugene Lyons , its first editor , nor Vernon Pope , its last ( since May 1945 ) , had the paper to justify promoting Pageant into competition with The Reader 's Digest or Coronet . In the past 18 months , Pageant ( circ. 270,000 ) has lost $400,000 for Publisher Hillman , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his staff left last week . Hillman planned to use up their " bank " of articles in three bimonthly issues . Then , barring happy accident , Pageant would give up the ghost . <P> - <P> This week Liberty , another chronic money-loser , tried a new tack to get out of the red tide and into the black . Except for a couple of war years , it had gone profitless under Founders Joseph M. Patterson and Robert R. McCormick . And it had failed to pay its way for their successors , Bernarr Macfadden and Paul Hunter . A weekly until last February and a fortnightly since , Liberty ( circ. 1,600,000 ) will now be a 10 monthly .
