oon the newspapers will begin their season run of stories under such headings as : Changing Seats in Canoe , 2 Drown ? or Canoe Capsizes in Squall , Young Camper Lost . Whereupon numerous readers will shake their older and wiser heads and say : " Those canoes are treacherous boats . You could n't get me into one ! " Unfortunately , it is just that ignorance of canoes which accounts for most accidents . For the cold truth is that there probably is n't a boat safer than a canoe . Instead of damning it for the many accidents in which it is involved every summer , we should place the responsibility where it belongs : upon the canoeists . And in so doing we would get at the root of a lot of unnecessary trouble . For years W. vanB . Claussen , canoeing consultant of the American Red Cross , has been preaching what all old hands know : A canoe never sinks . Even when filled with water to the gunwales , a canoe will still have sufficient buoyancy to keep four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned after their canoe is swamped , because they desert the still floating craft and try to swim ashore fully clothed . Likewise , in fully three-quarters of the cases of capsizing , the canoe immediately rights itself and floats away ? while its erstwhile occupants flounder around in a panic , ignoring the boat entirely . And even in the remaining twenty-five percent of the cases ? where the canoe remains upside down ? it is still afloat , an infallible life preserver ready to be turned over again if you know how , or perfectly capable of supporting you as it is if you 'll merely hang on . In just about 100 percent of canoe fatalities the victims did n't know ? or forgot ? that the first rule in an emergency is : Stick to the canoe . For a canoe never sinks . An even better precaution , of course , is to avoid emergencies . The only requirement for that is a little common sense . The Boy Scouts teach the beginner to understand a canoe by having him sit on the canoe 's floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rocking it from side to side . Only in such fashion can you learn how difficult it is to tip a canoe over when you keep your weight low . Having learned that lesson , you will promptly take those fancy seats out of the vacation canoe you rent this summer and leave them ashore . You will sit or kneel on the floor when you paddle , using a cushion for the sake of your tender knees , and thus you will make it difficult for your canoe to tip . For the benefit of the weekend or occasional paddler , a few other elementary hints may not be out of order . First of all , never try to get into a canoe standing up ? that is the mark of a greenhorn . Always bend over , with one hand on each gunwale. steadying yourself as you move forward . Unless you 're an expert who has become part of his canoe , you should never stand erect when the craft is offshore . And unless you 've seen the correct method demonstrated and fully understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Changing seats is one of our most popular forms of summer suicide ? for which the hapless canoe always takes the blame . Another extremely common vacation blunder is overloading a canoe . Do n't ever put more than three people into a sixteen-foot canoe ? the popular size . Even though that size will safely hold four experienced paddlers , it is decidedly hazardous for novices to attempt it .  |
