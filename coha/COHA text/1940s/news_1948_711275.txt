txt WASHINGTON , May 22 ? The ominous announcement that three " improved " atomic bombs have been successfully fired at Eniwetok has spurred the activities of a little group of men in the Pentagon here . Headed by Russell J. Hopley , they are seeking to devise a country-wide plan for civil defense in the United States if it should ever be attacked . It is taken for granted that no power would go to war against the United States unless its leaders believed it could successfully attack our industrial centers with atomic weapons of some kind . It is also assumed that such an attack would be the opening blow in an enemy 's strategic campaign . Thus , any proposal for an organization for civil defense brings immediately to mind measures to minimize the results of an atomic attack . On the other hand , ' a rounded plan of the kind likely to be needed in a war of the future must concern itself with countless other grim contingencies as well . Stages of Program Mr. Hopley was " borrowed " a month ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company , of which he is president . He is serving without compensation as director of civil defense planning in 24r . Forrestal 's office . He has just set up a staff of twentyeight experts and consultants , some of whom also draw no salary , to help him . They began work this week . By the end of July they hope to turn out a detailed plan under which the civil , or passive , defense of the United States could be conducted . The next step will be the drafting of measures they consider necessary to put the plan into effect . The third stage Will be the establishment of a permanent peacetime civil defense organization which will constitute the skeleton on which a wartime force could be quickly constructed . Immunity of attack , says Mr. Hopley and his colleagues , will not ' favor the United States in another general war , if there should be one . They are not military experts , and they rely on the joint Chiefs of Staff to outline to them the probable pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . The ideal pattern for civil defense starts with the principle of selfhelp . Every individual must first try to help himself , then his family , then his neighbors . Only when he is overwhelmed must he summon help from the community . The community itself must call for help only when the situation is beyond its own control . Snags to Procedure The planners , however , are faced by the unhappy probability that enemy attack on the United States , using some form of atomic weapons , would cause many situations in which communities would be obliged to call for assistance . They want to have ready the machinery through which such aid could be promptly and efficiently brought to bear . City lines and state boundaries will mean nothing under enemy attack . Such areas as the region around New York , Newark and Jersey City will have to pool their resources and work as a unit . Another guiding principle Mr. Hopley 's band has in mind is that a civil defense organization must not be drawn into other activities , no matter how closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustle around at bond rallies , and the like . They must be available at all times for the specific duties to which they are assigned . Civil defense , as they see it , must be passive defense . None of it will be designed to prevent the enemy from attacking , or to punish him after he has attacked . That is the responsibility of the national military establishment . The civil defense organization will not provide men or women to operate anti-aircraft guns , balloon barrages , or other active defenses . The civil defense workers will devote their efforts to minimizing the effects of enemy attack and to repairing its ravages . Under conditions now predicted , that will be a full-time assignment . Probable Effects Barnet W. Beers , a former lieutenant colonel of the General Staff Corps and now a member of Mr. Hopley 's planning staff , has carefully studied the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and he has sought the opinions of several scientists on the probable effects of more powerful atomic bombs , such as appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . In a staff study on the subject , he has submitted a more than conventionally frightening estimate in a manner enabl ? ing any local civil defense agency to apply it to its own city map . He managed to end on a rela. tively cheerful note , however . He took the casualties at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and translated them into United States equivalents , allowing for the lesser density of population and the greater resistant qualities of building construction here . Casualty Prediction Assuming that an atomic bomb was dropped in one enemy operation on er , : h of the thirty-seven cities of the United States having populations greater than 250,000 in 1940 . Mr. Beers found that 555 , - 000 persons would be killed and a. like number wounded . An attack of such success is , of course , inconceivable , but he wanted to conjure the worst possible example to point his conclusion . Even after such a disaster , he found , there would remain in those thirty-seven cities about 30,000,000 uninjured survivors , or 9 &4; per cent of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
