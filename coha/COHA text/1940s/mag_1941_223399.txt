Scrap-conscious OPM conservationists last week saved for defense the rusting skeleton of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge ( " Galloping Gertie " ) from a watery grave in Puget Sound . Scrap dealers had not been interested until OPM stirred them up . Now they figure they can salvage it at a. profit even under the $20-a-ton scrap ceiling . Result : addition of 3,500 tons to the shrinking U.S. scrap-steel stockpile , enough to build 500 light tanks . <P> Other conservation items : <P> From the dim recesses of the Library of Congress , the Capitol , Senate and House Office Buildings , Capitol Architect David Lynn recovered 285 tons of scrap-old motors , brass book ends , aluminum and steel strips , copper scraps . <P> To boost pulp supplies WPA is mangling 25,000,000 folders of World War I draft records , baling the shreds . <P> But , complained the Conservation Division , the equivalent of 400 Army tanks in used razor blades is still being thrown away annually-not , unfortunately , into the Grand Canyon or any other one place .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
