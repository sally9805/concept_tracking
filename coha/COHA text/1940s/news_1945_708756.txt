txt TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is quite possible to share some of the doubts expressed in your editorial about the Hatch-Burton-Ball plan for revision of our Federal labor laws . Yet the sponsors ' advocacy of compulsory arbitration , objectionable as that would be under normal conditions , may hardly be condemned today without discussion , for at this time a good case for the procedure may be made on the grounds that it offers at least a yassable substitute , though not necessarily a good or permanent one , for the traditional balance of power between labor and management . During the first third of the present century the dominant feature of labor disputes  --  and the feature that kept the situation from being explosive , as it had been during the Eighties and Nineties  --  was the limitation of the powers possessed by either party . This made for peace . Neither side dared to take issue over trivialities . Balance of Power Weakened Today , however , because of our recently enacted labor laws , this balance of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of labor has already acquired a definite monopoly of power , and it is no longer possible for management to set limits beyond which it can not afford to go in accepting the workers ' demands . Employers can no longer counter with the threat of employing others to take the places of intransigent employes . The whole weight of the Federal Government is being thrown into the establishment of a vested right for each worker in his job regardless of what he does and regardless of the demands that he may impose upon his employer . The worker can , and does , go on strike or ? engage in slow-downs for the most trivial and impractical reasons , and he can confidently expect to avoid paying any penalty for his arbitrary acts . No one is permitted to take his place . In brief , in this segment all competition on the part of a workman to hold his job has been eliminated . We have , of course , Federal laws to prevent such concentrations of power as are set up by the elimination of competition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to labor . Politics a Factor The obvious step would be to wipe out those labor laws which even labor leaders have admitted are unreasonable . If we eliminated them , and their still more absurd interpretations , we would , of course , re-establish the balance of power between labor and management . However , since politics and political face-saving are what they are , and since anyone attempting to eliminate the objectionable laws would be accused , however unjustly , of trying to deprive workers of their unquestioned right to join unions if they so desire , such wholesale repeal seems to be out of the question for the immediate future . But everyone grants that something must be done to meet the wave of labor disputes that will surely sweep the nation when the psychological restraints of wartime are removed . So the alternative would seem to be , temporarily at least , to provide for handling our labor disputes exactly as we handle the disputes between our regulated industries and their customers . For a generation the various States have kept the natural monopolies like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts and disputes by setting up public service commissions . The States can do the same thing with disputes between management and labor . That , of course , would mean some form of compulsory arbitration , and it would seem that the HatchBurton-Ball legislation has merely granted recognition to this inescapable fact . FRANCIS KINGSLEY . New Rochelle , N. Y. , June 24 , 1945 . Ambiguous Park Rules Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : This morning , when I innocently enjoyed myself on the shady lawn of one of New York 's public parks , parking my baby carriage right next to me , a policeman handed me a summons requesting my appearance in court to answer a violation of the park rules . When I protested that this park bears a large sign reading , " This lawn is open for passive use , " and that I therefore assumed that this includes baby carriages , the officer said I should explain that to the presiding judge in court , since baby carriages are not allowed there . It seems to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violators ought to be protected in certain ways : 1 . The sign should be changed appropriately , as it is done when prohibiting certain , areas from use by dogs or bicyclists. 2 . First offenders ought to be let off with a warning where there is no such sign . 3 . Payment of fines ought to be made on the spot instead of making the innocent offender or representative waste half a day in court to answer a petty offense of the above sort . PATH , W. SAMUEL . New York , June 24 , 1945 . The blood that is donated today and tomorrow and the next day is the blood that will be there , waiting for the wounded , so that men can go into battle with the added confidence of the knowledge that the medics will be able to care for them if they fall . There is no vacation from enemy bullets . Why should there be any vacation from support of the Red Cross blood bank ? MARTHA ADDOMS . Brooklyn , June 26 , 1945 . Inflation Curbs Discussed More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read the letter to the people by my esteemed friend and colleague , Max Rolnik , which appeared in your paper June 14 , on the subject of Proposed Inflation Cures . The three things which he believes are vitally necessary to deal with the causes of inflation are : first , the reduction of Government deficit financing for purchasing power ; second , greater taxes so as to reduce excess purchasing power ; and third , greater forced savings so as to avoid excess purchasing power . We all recognize the devastating results of inflation and the importance in subduing the mounting tendencies . I agree with Mr. Rolnick as to his first proposal . As to his second proposal , I would hold with him on higher taxes only on speculations in capital assets , so as to avoid the violent price rises and the inevitable results . Higher cash marginal requirements alone would not curb the aggressive wealthy speculators . But I disagree with Mr. Rolnik on the general recommendation of higher taxes on all forms of productive business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no incentive to industry under present rates of taxation , if applied post-war , so as to give impetus to production and distribution . And without that impetus , increasing unemployment will result and become a momentous problem , which , in turn , contrary to Mr. Rolnik 's first proposal , would require deficit financing for pump-priming . Under such conditions the Government debt certainly will increase . In reply to the third proposal , I wish to say that as a practical matter nothing can be done about forcing permanent savings . Savings are voluntary and represent the excess over needs , and needs vary with individual standards of living , which are not voluntarily lowered . I dare say that the savings today are greater than at any other time in the history of this country , . This is so since war production restricts other production , thus resulting in scarcities in much-needed civilian requirements . That reason chiefly continues to make possible or forces the huge bond purchases and savings . However , as peacetime production increases and goods become available , the savings will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of goods will meet the demand . Of course , inflation must be curbed , but let 's be practical with proposed cures . IvAN R. LAsHiNs , New York , June 22 , 1945 . Remagen Bridge Memorial Proposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I suppose , now that the war in Europe has come to a triumphant close , numbers of our people will move to memorialize in some shape or other events and personages in it that have evoked their special interest or sympathy . And I have no ambition to add to the numbers of such people . But there is one event whose significance and interest are common to all Americans and which I think should be memorialized in such manner as to enshrine it forever in our national consciousness . I refer to the crossing of the Remagen Bridge . The importance of this affair lies not in any spectacular exhibition of daring or strategy  --  although as a matter of fact it may be considered the turning point of the campaign  --  but in the fact that in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard no doubtful guess in saying that this piece of adventurous individualism could have happened in no other army in the world than ours . It will not be possible to identify certainly the lieutenant or sergeant that first sighted the bridge still intact and said to his men , " Say , fellers , here 's a perfectly good bridge . Let 's cross over to the other side and see what happens ! " But the unit that first crossed can surely be identified and made the central feature of the memorial . JOHN H. CULLEY . El Monte , Calif. , June 20 , 1945 . Blood Donations Lagging To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was very much shocked the other day to see empty beds again at the Brooklyn Red Cross Blood Donor Center . Why do n't people realize that ; now is the time to donate blood , because now is the time to build up the stockpiles of plasma and blood for the next largescale outbreak of fighting in the Pacific ? If those stockpiles are n't there at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not live .
