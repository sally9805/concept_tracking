Candlelight in Algeria ( British Lion 20th Century-Fox ) illuminates a dark corner of the invasion of North Africa . Its heroine ( Carla Lehmann ) , a Kansas-born sculptress , hides a fugitive Englishman ( James Mason ) from the local Nazi chief ( Walter Rilla ) . Later she snitches a small camera from the lair of a collaborationist nightclub singer ( Enid Stamp-Taylor ) . A lot of people are interested in this camera , because it contains film which shows the location of the seaside house in which General Mark Clark and his colleagues are soon to rehearse signals for the invasion . Dapper Nazi Rilla and his henchmen energetically hound its bearers through the deluxe hotels and low dives of Algiers , take part in a brisk auto-chase which winds up at the very time &; place of General Clark 's rendezvous . <P> Fleet , flexible second-grade melodrama , handled with habitual British know-how , Candlelight is further enjoyable for its three leading performances . Canadian Carla Lehmann , with her prairie voice , is about twice as American as the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol new to U.S. cinemaddicts , suggests a welterweight Clark Gable . Walter Rilla , once popular on the German stage and screen , is perhaps the most satisfying portrayer of suave continental menace since the late Conrad Veidt . <P> Summer Storm ( United Artists ) drives that shapely moujik , Linda Darnell , into a Russian garden house for shelter , and into the steaming presence of a dissolute Raymond Lovell . <P> Russian count , Edward Everett Horton , and a no-less-dissolute Russian judge , George Sanders . Their breathing becomes heavy . They are lost men . <P> A ruthless , passionate young woman , out strictly for the highest bidder , she keeps them on her leash even after she marries doting , pathetic Peasant Hugo Haas . First she destroys Judge Sanders ' attempt to settle down with a wife ( sugary , upper-class Anna Lee ) . Then she parades before the count in his dead wife 's wedding dress . At length , on a shooting party ( the film is made from Chekhov 's story The Shooting Party ) , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Bolshevik revolution overtakes her guilty lover before justice does . <P> Stacked against , the run of U.S. films , Summer Storm is well above the ordinary . Stacked against the kind of European film it is trying to be , it is as distractingly uneven as a ride in a flat-wheeled streetcar . There are moments of remarkable sensitiveness to season , landscape , and the part they can play in creating erotic and moral atmospheres . There are even moments when handsome Linda Darnell embodies the natural force she is portraying . And Edward Everett Horton somehow manages to suggest that a Tsarist rake would look and act like Edward Everett Horton . But too much of Scripter-Director Douglas Sirk 's effort is polysyllabic , " cultered " and Little Theaterish.
