As an undergraduate at Cambridge , Norbert Stephen Erleigh was in a hurry to make a million pounds , then quit . Said Norby Erleigh : " I think it could be done swiftest in South Africa . " A wealthy Rand pioneer 's son , Erleigh had the financial backing ; he soon picked up the mining experience . In 1933 , he helped Abraham Sundel Hersov form the Anglo-Transvaal Investment Co. , Ltd. , and together they made a killing in Rand mines . But " Bob " Hersov was too cautious for bumptious , erratic Norby Erleigh . By 1935 Erleigh , then 32 , had broken away from Anglovaal , and he had made his first million . He had also lost all desire to quit . <P> Erleigh bought control of the New Union Goldfields Ltd. , fixed his attention on the undeveloped Orange Free State , where he bought hundreds of leases and options on mining lands , including the fabulous Rooder and Main Reef Mines . The big money rolled in when other gold houses awoke to the richness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , April 29 , 1946 ) . Erleigh built up a South African empire of 152 companies-gold mines , diamond fields , coal mines , rubber factories , hotels and cinemas-valued at some 100,000,000 . <P> Byeways . He lived as befitted a Randlord . He acquired a stable of 30 horses , raced them in England . " Byeways , " the Erleigh estate north of Johannesburg , grew along with New Union Goldfields . A swimming pool was built , then a small theater . <P> As Rooderand 's profits increased and its stock ( at 52 shillings ) led all other " Kaffirs " ( gold shares ) , British investors assumed that New Union , the holding company , promised similar windfall profits . They gobbled up some 750,000 worth of New Union stock , soon bid the 5 shilling shares up to 32 shillings . What the investors did not realize was that the bulk of the New Union income no longer came from its operating property , but from the sale of stocks and options . New Union was living on its capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slipways . While Erleigh was entertaining potential backers at champagne parties , his auditors refused to certify New Union 's books . New Union owed its associated companies more than 5,000,000 ; Erleigh and a partner owed New Union 470,000-and there was no cash to meet the debts . New Union stocks in London plummeted to 6 shillings and threatened to carry the entire gold share market along . <P> Last month , rather than risk complete collapse , Erleigh gave up . He invited his old partner , conservative Bob Hersov , to take over New Union with the option to buy part of its best properties . Hersov accepted . In order to get a moratorium from New Union 's creditors , he threw the company into " judicial management . " By taking over New Union , Hersov gave U.S. financiers a major beachhead in South Africa through a comparatively new company , American Anglo-Transvaal Corp .

The Americans had put up $5,000,000 , had agreed to ante up more as the need arose .
