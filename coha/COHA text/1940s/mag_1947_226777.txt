Why Germans living in the Russian occupation zone repeatedly protest that they " ca n't understand the Russians " is illustrated in the following report by John Scott , TIME 'S Berlin bureau chief : <P> Down Potsdam 's slushy Berlinerstrasse stumbled twelve haggard men . Halfheartedly they tried to avoid the largest puddles . Their faces had the pale , creased look of prisoners . Behind them trudged a stubby , broad-faced Russian soldier , Tommy gun crooked in his right arm , the wide Ukrainian steppe in his blue eyes . <P> Approaching the Stadtbahn station , the group met a stream of men &; women hurrying home from work . Some started with fright when they spotted the prisoners . Others scowled darkly at the pock-marked Russian Tommy-gunner . Several passers-by produced precious cigaret butts which they pressed into the hands of the prisoners . <P> " . . . Weiss Nicht . " An angular , middle-aged woman , who had been weaving through the crowd from sidewalk to curb in a futile effort to keep her ill-shod feet dry , suddenly sighted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-eyed at them for a full minute . Then she dropped her threadbare market bag , flew across the street in front of a lumbering , charcoal-burning truck and threw herself with a gasping cry upon the third prisoner . Prisoners and passers-by paused and gaped dumbly at the two Rodinesque figures fingering the backs of each other 's rough coats and mumbling hysterically : " Wohin ? " " . . . weiss nicht ; " " Warum ? " . . . weiss nicht " <P> Slowly the Russian walked around his charges and approached the couple . Slowly a grin covered his face . He tapped the woman on the back . She shuddered . Rigid apprehension spread over the faces of the onlookers , but the Russian rumbled soothingly : " Keine Angst . Keine Angst . " ( No fear . No fear . ) Then he waved the muzzle of his Tommy gun toward the prisoner , who instinctively recoiled a step , and asked : " Dein Mann ? " <P> " Ja , " replied the woman , tears streaming down her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . " Nimm mit , " and he gave the bewildered prisoner a gentle shove toward the sidewalk . <P> The spectators exhaled a mass sigh of relief as the couple stumbled off deliriously , hand in hand . Eleven prisoners , muttering to each other , pushed on down the street past the muttering crowd : " Unpredictable Russians . . . incredible ... I ca n't understand . ... I do n't understand the Russians . " <P> " Komm . " The Russian shuffled along stoically , gripping a long papirosa between yellow stained teeth as he fished in a pocket for matches . Suddenly his face clouded . He hitched the Tommy gun higher under his arm , took a dirty piece of paper from the wide , ragged sleeve of his shinel , and scowled at it . After a few steps he stuffed the paper back carefully , stared for a moment at the bent backs of the prisoners , then searched the strained faces of a new load of commuters just leaving the station .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
