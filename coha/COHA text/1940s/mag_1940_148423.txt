One day last fortnight Eleanor ( " Cissie " ) Patterson was reading an early edition of her Washington Times-Herald . She called her office . Said Cissie : " Martha Blair bores me - kill the column . " So pressmen ripped open the forms , jerked out These Charming People by Martha Blair , a column about Washington 's social stratosphere . <P> Martha Blair 's copy for next day was already written . Meanwhile , volatile Cissie Patterson had suffered a change of heart : the column stood . But Martha Blair ( who is also the wife of the New York Times 's Arthur Krock ) had had enough of Cissie 's whims . <P> Though she had counted on the $100 a week she got from the Times-Herald to help put her two sons ( by a previous marriage ) through college , Martha Blair handed in her resignation . Cissie Patterson accepted it . <P> Next day there came to Martha Blair a hot tip for anybody 's society column : two onetime members of Washington 's diplomatic set had become engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no friend of Cissie Patterson ) , who owns the Washington Post . Gleefully the Post printed on its own society page : " Mrs. Charlotte B. Nast , Ian Wilson-Young to wed - Mrs. Arthur Krock receives word of betrothal in London . . . . " <P> For a couple of days Martha Blair handed free stories to the Post . Then , having shown Cissie Patterson who could get the news , she subsided . To her friends she said : " Now that I 've got all the vixen out of me , I 'm through . " Mrs. Patterson 's friends said that Cissie was amused . <P> The charming Mrs. Krock and the intense Mrs. Patterson had met socially several times last week since they parted professionally . There were no eruptions . Some of her friends thought they heard Mrs. Krock say one evening : " Well , thank God , I 've still got Arthur Krock ! " <P> The New York Times pays Pundit Krock over $25,000 a year , so Martha Blair can get along without her job . The Times-Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington newsmen call it " Cissie Patterson 's henhouse . " Cissie has a weakness for firing her columnists in a fit of temper , then hiring them back at a bigger salary . By week 's end , knowing her own failing , Mrs. Patterson had fled to Nassau.
