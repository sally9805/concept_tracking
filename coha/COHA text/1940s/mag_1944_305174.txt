It was a Government shipment , and the Southern Railway Co. speeded it over the most direct route . Nevertheless , the U.S. Comptroller General refused to let the bill be paid . He claimed that the freight charges should have been based on a circuitous routing , which , though many miles longer , would have resulted in a lower freight rate . Last week the Supreme Court upheld the Government 's curious claim . <P> The longer routing would have diverted the freight to a section of the Southern Railway built years ago under a Government land grant . Under land grants made in 1850 and thereafter , the Government subsidized southern and western railroad-building by giving builders a total of 132 million acres of land-7,500 acres of adjacent land for every mile of track they laid . In return the railroads granted the Government , in perpetuity , a 50% reduction in rates for transportation of military supplies and troops . <P> The free land financed the building of 79 railroads .

" Adventurous easterners , meantime , found occasional diversion on the long trip west by shooting buffalo ( see cut ) . <P> Though less than 8% of the total U.S. mileage was subsidized by land grants , the railroads cleared an estimated $434 million from the sale of land . Four of them- Southern Pacific ; Northern Pacific ; Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe ; Union Pacific - still hold most of the remaining 16 million acres , worth $60 million . But the railroads have long since regretted their old bargain . The Government is now far &; away the nation 's biggest shipper . <P> The unhappy railroads figure that Government rebates are costing them $20 million a month , that they have forfeited more than $600 million since the first land grant act was passed .

Based on the premise that the roads have now repaid their subsidy in full , it would put an end to the system of Government rebates .
