The battles of the world , both those being fought and those apparently about to be fought , fell into a single scheme . They were all attacks on , or defenses of , three of the Allies ' strongholds : &gt; The Allies gave ground in the battle of the China Sea for Singapore ( see p. 13 ) . &gt; The British had their wind up last week about Gibraltar . They suspected Spain and were not sure of Portugal ( see p. 22 ) . But the actual disposition of Axis forces did not appear to substantiate British fear of an immediate assault on Gibraltar . &gt; Suez was threatened because the Middle East seemed to be threatened . Increasing German troop concentrations in Bulgaria and the concentration of German air power in Greece , Crete , southern Italy and Sicily suggested an imminent blow , perhaps at Turkey ( see p. 22 ) . Such a blow , if successful , would have four advantages for the Axis : <P> 1 ) It would largely nullify the British victory in Libya ( see p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suez Canal to British use and keep the U.S. from establishing its projected base for African operations in Eritrea . <P> 3 ) It might mean the acquisition of the oil of Iran and Iraq , the closing of the Persian Gulf , route of Allied aid to Russia . <P> 4 ) It would pave the way to what the Axis hopes will be the final battle of World War II , the struggle for India . <P> But the Axis might have to wait for these advantages , because Russia , to which the Middle East has become a kind of life line , is doing all it can , by indirection , to protect Suez . The Russian winter drive ( see p. 20 ) had perhaps assumed great enough proportions last week to make Adolf Hitler at least postpone a move to the south .
