After less than two hours of debate it approved $6,559,939,000 for the Army and the Air Force by a vote of 348 to 2 . Passage of the $3,686 , - 733,250 Navy measure was scheduled for tomorrow . This $10,246,672,250 is on top of $3,198,100,000 cleared previously by Congress for procurement of aircraft for the Air Force and the Navy , leaving recent appropriations and contract authorizations for defense at something like $13,444,772,250 . It was pointed out that this did not tell the whole story of defense cost since much money approved in previous years , yet unspent , remained available . On the basis of today 's a.ction by the House it was estimated that the Army and the Air Force , during the fiscal year starting July 1 , would have available for outlay a total of $12,438 , 731 , 820 . Other Funds Available Remaining available to them , debate disclosed , was $3,583,692 , - . 820 , from appropriations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 of cash and $1,687,000,000 in contract authorizations for the Air Force . This money included a contract authorization of $822 , - 000,000 for building that establishment up to a modernized 70-group outfit . There were no estimates of possible Navy Department carry-over which might build up its available funds beyond the surface figures of the bill at hand . Passage of the Army-Air Force money measure came with an apparent acceptance by the House that AS Appropriations Committee after weeks of study and questioning of top military officials , had cut as deeply as it zould under the circumstances of the international situation . The only negative votes were cast by the American Labor party representatives from New York , Vito Marcantonio and Leo Isacsoh . The Appropriations Committee , through Representative Albert J. Engel , Republican of Michigan , subcommittee chairman , reported that the totals it recommended were $647,903,000 under what the Army and Air Force had asked . This subcommittee contended that allowances for upkeep and operation of the military forces were excessive ; it found , too , that the employment of civilian personnel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sweeping manner , taking care , however , not to slash so as to reduce ' prospective Army personnel below the 790,000 . it deemed required , or Air Force manpower below 460,000 . The subcommittee suggested that if its slashes should prove to be too sharp the services could come back for more funds early next year . Expenditures , it was conceded , would depend much on the rapidity with which the Army built up in manpower , with or without the revival of the selective draft . Soviet " Menace " Stressed The military money measures were taken before the House with recommendations backed up by recent closed session testimony that at times was highly dramatic . Great stress had been put by toplevel military spokesmen on " the alarming menace " of the military might of Soviet Russia . Examples of the testimony , as released in transcript today , were as follows : Admiral Louis E. Denfeld , Chief of Naval Operations , testified ( two weeks ago ) that the Mediterranean Fleet . ( one carrier , threes cruis- ers and ten destroyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of twelve ships left Norfolk , Va. , yesterday for relief of vessels now in the Mediterranean . Gen. Omar N. Bradley , Army Chief of Staff , stressed the " menace " of vast numbers of men under arms in Russia . " The precipitation of armed hostilities , either by a deliberate or accidental incident , " General Bradley said , " is a plausible possibility so long as our forces face each other on opposing frontiers in this strained atmosphere of distrust and tension . " Soviet armed forces , with an approximate total of 4,000,000 men and 14,000 planes , provide a substantial iron fist for the aggressive policies of Moscow . These forces are capable of swiftly overrunning Europe , the Near and Middle East , Korea and even China . " These Soviet military capabilities , even when viewed quite apart from their intentions , present an alarming menace to the security of the United States . " In such an emergency as might be possible , General Bradley told the Appropriations Committee the fighting might provided in the American Army-Air Force bill approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we rallied sufficient and active reserves . " He renewed his urgent plea for enactment of Universal Military Training , designed to provide such ' reserves . At the same time it was conceded in Congress that this program would receive no consideration before the adjournment .
