Every ten years educators , parents , social workers , doctors gather in Washington for a check-up on the condition of U. S. children . President Theodore Roosevelt started it by calling the first White House Conference on children in 1909 . Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover followed suit in 1919 and 1930 . Last week Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins rapped a gavel , called to order the fourth decennial White House Conference on Children in a Democracy . <P> The 400 conferees examined the record of a depression decade , were surprised to find that in the face of Depression child welfare had made many gains : <P> &gt; The death rate of babies had been reduced 25% ( from 68 to 51 per 1,000 ) . <P> &gt; Tuberculosis deaths were 36% fewer , pneumonia and syphilis were under much better control. * <P> &gt; Child labor had been sharply reduced . <P> &gt; Children had many more parks , playgrounds , swimming pools . <P> But the conference 's researchers also had to report : <P> &gt; The birth rate had dropped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ( under 16 ) , 2,000,000 fewer than in 1930 . <P> &gt; Nearly two-thirds of the nation 's children did not have " a decent American standard of living . " <P> &gt; Nearly a fourth ( 8,000,000 ) were on public or private relief . <P> &gt; About 1,000,000 got no schooling . <P> To the White House conferees , all this called for more child help from the U. S. Government . They plumped for a glittering , 83-point program : Federal aid for schools , libraries , medical care , playgrounds , housing . They were only momentarily discouraged when President Franklin Roosevelt , addressing the conference , declared : " The permanent answer is not mere handouts from the Federal Treasury but has to be solved by improving the economics of the poorer sections . . . . " As the conference closed , Secretary Perkins prophesied : " The program . . . is one which I predict will be worked upon . . . for 30 years to come , when a new generation , pray God , is better born , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever walked the earth .
