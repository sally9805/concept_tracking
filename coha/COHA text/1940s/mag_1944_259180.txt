China 's hunger pangs were described with sharp medical clarity recently by a British surgeon . The average Chinese diet was always so low in protein ( nitrogen compounds in meat , fish , some vegetables ) that the slightest disruption in supply might produce famine . The disruption brought about by the war has " ' been enormous . In south Kwangtung last year , H. T. Laycock , a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons , doctored hundreds of Chinese who had been getting no protein at all . Wrote he to the British Medical Journal : <P> " More than 90% . . . had come from occupied into ' free ' China . The remainder were nearly all Chinese soldiers , many recently recruited from among the refugees . <P> " Some refugees were what the Japanese call ' repatriates ' . . . . Without warning , some hundreds of harmless pedestrians , hawkers and beggars are rounded up in the streets of an occupied city . . . then systematically starved in one of the worst sort of concentration camps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soda ( to economize on firewood ) which is served without salt , flavoring , or other addition . . . . <P> " From the camp , victims considered sufficiently weakened are transported in overcrowded junks to the coast of free China , where those that have not died on the way are left , totally destitute , to their own resources-to the intense annoyance of the local residents . The ones who are too weak to walk remain where they are landed until they starve . Many of them try to prolong their sufferings by consuming inedible or semi-edible substances-hard woody roots . . . a dark green powder , prepared by drying and pounding certain leaves . . . heaps of banana skins and mango stones scavenged in the streets . . . . " <P> Too Weak to Stand . " Why more of these unfortunate people do not give up and commit suicide , I do not know . . . . Instead , they struggle inland with a frantic desperation of which one is forcibly reminded by seeing the deep ulcers on the buttocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country in a sitting posture . <P> " Clinically the most conspicuous feature was the widespread edema which first appeared on the tops of the feet . These became more and more swollen until the skin was tightly stretched and assumed a peculiar bluish transparency . . . . Fissures appeared which were readily infected . . . . Farther up the leg , the edema distends the skin ; and over the lower leg especially , this has often a high glaze . The whole limb up to the groin was often swollen . The external genitalia were early affected by the edema . <P> " The face was often grossly edematous with the eyes completely closed . There was a strong tendency for the edema to shift with gravity . . . . Unnatural creases appeared and the expression became toneless and gloomy . . . quite repulsive . . .. . The loss of the normal silky luster of Chinese hair in someone who was seen before and after several months of slow starvation was quite striking . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
