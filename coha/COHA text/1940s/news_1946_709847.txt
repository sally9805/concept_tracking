txt Letters to The Times Plight of Displaced Persons Situation of Children in the German Camps Is Described To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just returned home after a year of service as UNRRA welfare director in one of the ? largest Jewish Displaced Persons ? Camps in Germany . From the questioning I have been subjected to since , it is obvious that there is a general need for information about the present state of *affairs in these camps . Mr. La Guardia has described the Jewish displaced persons he visited in Germany as " heartbreaking to see , " and I would add , from months of experience , that the heartbreak is often more than one can bear . Let it first be said , however , that the American Army Command , under General , is extending itself notably to meet and anticipate basic material needs . The heartbreak in the present situation is political and psychological in nature , and appears most acutely among the children . It may be recalled as a matter of record that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistic until qne equates it with the total number of GI 's in the one hundred combat divisions of the American Army at the peak of the war . Surviving in Europe today are approximately 150,000 Jewish children who through the years of the war managed to elude , the Nazis by burrowing underground like hunted animals . Homeless Children Most of these children are without parents ' and many are withcut kin of any kind . Homeless . and deprived of parental care and schooling , they have found their way by the thousands into the Displaced Persons Camps of Germany , Austria and Italy . Physically , many are markedly stunted in growth . Their long ordeal , on the other hand , has made them wise beyond their years . They are clear and articulate as to what they want in the present and future . After the destruction of life seen and the terror endured they loathe Germany in particular and Europe in general with traumatic intensity and want no more of either . They want and need to be resettl5d in an environment that will heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the opportunity for normal development Which have been the birthright of children since the dawn of the human race . Emphatically , the present rootless limbo existence amid the slow psychological rot of the Displaced Persons Camps , enclaved among the Germans , still feared , is the farthest possible remove from such an environment . Hopes for Emigration Like their elders , these children have been sustained not by the hope but by the confident expectation that the Western democracies , being humane and just , would free them to rebuild their shattered lives within the family fold of kin or brethren , in Palestine principally , but also in America , Canada , Australia , etc . After many months of patient waiting and preparation the Anglo-American Palestine Commission 's report last spring and the President 's original statement on immigration quotas seemed to bring the final day of their deliverance near at hand . Needless to say , the events of recent weeks have been a cruel and devastating blow to them . Closed doors , for all practical purposes , have remained all but closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by numbed shock and bewildered anxiety . At my farewell meal with the youth groups of my camp their leaders asked me to make known these questions : " What is to become of us ? Is this camp , which we thought was no more than a corridor , a way station on the road to a safe home and a normal life , to become a trap for us , a dead end ? Were we liberated from the Nazi hell only to be again abandoned in the end to the Germans ? What has become of the great heart of the democracies ? " These are questions directed at the consciences of England and America , which , try as we may , , we dare not evade . LEO SROLE . Chicago , Oct. 2 , 1946 . Fractional Curren/ Suggested To THE EDITOR OF THE.NEW YORK TIMES : The price situation today , especially on low-price items , makes the need for fractional currency of 21/2 , 121/2 cents or other denominations more urgent than at any previous time . Our present units of currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents on a standard price article , but many suppliers whose increased costs compel them to charge more for their goods would , I am sure , be content with an increase of 2% cents on a ten-cent article if the fractional coin were available . A. WINEBuRGH . New York , Oct. 2 , 1946 . Cigarettes in Hotel Fires To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Page One of your second section of Oct. 1 , you head the first column thus " Fire Laws broken by 80 per cent of hotels , cooking in rooms found main violation . " Cooking in rooms is not a cause of fire ? at least , not in my sixty years of experience . Ask any experienced hotel operator what caused the La Salle Hotel fire , or what caused a fire in his own hotel . The reply would invariably be cigarettes . When I was a youth working in a British hotel , smoking in bedrooms was prohibited . A smoking room was provided . It happens that the hotel you mention was under my authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Who built the hotel for cooking in their rooms , for this made the renting of rooms and suites that much more easy . Cooking in rooms ands fires are not related . The cause of hotel fires , almost 100 per cent , is the cigarette smoker . As a rule , he or she is a menace to hums , life . Let the Housing Department get to the real cause of hotel fires . J011 N . POWIE . Binghamton , N. Y. , Oct. 1 , 1946 . Stalin on War  - -   - -  -   - -  Recent Statement Is Questioned in I View of His Past Utterances To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To evaluate the seriousness of Stalin 's statement of Sept. 24 , we must ? weigh it against some of his unrepealed utterances which are still being distributed on his ' iehalf throughout the world . Stalin said in his statement : " I do not believe in a real danger of a new war , " and answering the question . whether he believes in the possibility of a friendly and lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I do , unconditionally . " In his book " Problems of Leninism " which can be considered as the Bible ? at least as its New Testament ? of the Communists the world over and which has by now reached a circulation of more than 30 million copies , Stalin answers these two questions with the following sentence : " It is inconceivable that the Soviet Republic should continue to exist for a long period side by side with imperialistic states  --  ultimately one or the other must conquer . " Stalin has always taken pride in calling himself the most faithful of Lenin 's pupils and he has never missed an occasion to emphasize this point . Everybody who has studied the history of the Russian Communist party knows there was going on for many years a discussion dealing with exactly the same problem  --  namely , with the question whether the existence of the Soviet Union must be considered as incompatible with the existence of bourgeois states . Stalin dictatorially ended this discussion once and for all by answering a " letter " from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classical answer to this question , especially in communist text-books . It appeared for the first time on Feb. 14 , 1938 , in Pravda , from which source I quote : " The final victory of socialism , the complete assurance that bourgeois relationship can not be restored , is only possible if that victory is carried out on an international scale . " To corroborate this statement Stalin quotes Lenin in his answer to Ivanov : " We live not only in a state but in a system of states , and the prolonged existence of the Soviet Republic side by side with the imperialistic states is unthinkable . Finally either the one or the other will be victorious . And until this happens a series of terrible conflicts between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states is unavoidable . " ( Lenin 's complete works , Vol. may , page 122 . ) The latest - confirmation sof this classical Bolshevist point of view was Stalin 's election speech of Feb. 9 ; 1946 . In it he again emphasized the Marxian theory according to which " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war " and in which he attributed the war guilt for the First and Second World Wars solely to capitalistic world economy . By implication we can conclude that in Stalin 's opinion a third world war could arise only as a result of a third crisis in the development of capitalistic world economy . This documentation of Stalin 's real opinion , as revealed time and again by him and his followers , is in irreconcilable contradiction with his statement of Sept. 24 . This statement is obviously written for the sole purpose of carrying out a diplomatic maneuver whose chief aim is the befogging of non-communist public opinion . JULIUS EPSTEIN . New York , Oct. 3 , 1946 . Rationing of Meat Advocated TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Apropos the disgraceful meat situation precipitated by the present Administration , possibly restoration of rationing for a period of six months to a year would be the most effective means of control . During the war rationing certainly worked , even while supplying our huge armies , and we have run into difficulties only since Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tax money be More profitably expended in maintaining an effective control board by which ? we can be assured an allotted amount of meat now and in the future than in maintaining an OPA police force to cope with black market operations and get just exactly not We still have " emergency " stamps in our ration books which could be easily used , and such a system might release the people of this country from the indignity of being used as puppets of political machinations .
