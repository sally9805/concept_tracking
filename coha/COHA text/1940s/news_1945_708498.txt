txt LA GUARDIA EASES CURFEW TO I A. M. ; BYRNES IS SILENT Mayor Sanctions Sale of Food and Liquor After Midnight on His Own Initiative MOVE STIRS OTHER CITIES Some Confusion Is Caused by Change but Streets Are Cleared More Quickly By ALEXANDER FEINBERG A day short of three weeks after War Mobilization Director James F. Byrnes had stunned restaurant , bar and grill , night club , movie and other amusement operators by placing in effect a " request with teeth " that they close their establishments at midnight , Mayor La Guardia yesterday extended " one hour of tolerance " to New York City places . The change , which the Mayor apparently made on his own initiative , went into effect at once , with the city observing its new curfew hour at 1 A. M. today . Its results were immediately apparent in clearing the streets around Times Square and in the East Side night-life area of the post-curfew stampede that had been a feature of recent weekends . Patrons started home at in-I tervals throughout the last hour , instead of remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus thinning traffic . Subway crowds were less dense , and the all-night restaurants , although reporting good business , said that the throngs that previously charged the doors just after midnight , arrived in smaller and more orderly groups . The police reported no disorders and few instances of any difficulty in inducing patrons to leave at the closing hour . Such confusion as existed was in the minds of tavern and restaurant owners for the most part . In the Bronx some police officials ruled that patrons could order drinks only to midnight but could remain until 1 A. M. , and some proprietors , rather than risk an infringement , closed accordingly at the old hour or slightly afterward . Mayor Clarifies Announcement Mayor La Guardia chose the end of his weekly radio talk over WNYC to make his announcement of the extended curfew , but it was not until reporters talked with him directly afterward in his office at City Hall that he clarified it to sanction the sale of liquor and food in bars and restaurants after midnight . The only condition the Mayor attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleared of patrons and closed by 1 A. M. At 2:48 P. M. , some fifty minutes after the Mayor had ended his broadcast , an " amendment " to the " War Manpower Commission midnight curfew order on places of entertainment " was sent out to all borough commands over the police teletype from headquarters . The amendment read : " One hour of tolerance after midnight will be allowed and it is expected that all places affected by the midnight curfew order will be completely closed by 1 A. M. daily . " Sent out from the office of Cbief Inspector John J. O'Connell , it was signed " by direction of the Police Commissioner . " The Mayor waved aside queries of reporters both as to whether he had the " authority " to effect a modification as well as whether a new ordinance would be required . The City Council , at his request , passed a local law changing the time for closing of places selling liquor from 4 A. M. to midnight . " We wo n't worry about that , " the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1 o'clock . " Although their places were not included by specific designation , night club owners expressed jubilation and in nearly all cases changed // the hours of their floor shows last night to bring them to a close either at 12:30 or 12:45 A. M. , an hour later than the schedules adopted under the midnight curfew . It was too late in most instances for movie theatre operators to take advantage of the extra hour granted them last night , but new and later schedules , they said , would be adopted tonight . The police order was read to every platoon in the five boroughs that went on duty at 4 P. M. and again at midnight . Each precinct captain who received the order was to .. turn it over to the desk lieutenant with instructions to read it to the patrolmen before they started their tours . To dispel any uncertainty as to the precise meaning of the order , uniformed patrolmen went from door to door to notify restaurant and bar owners in midtown that they were permitted to sell drinks after midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same question poured into headquarters and stations in the five boroughs , City Hall , and newspaper offices . Official Washington was silent on the Mayor 's action , but it brought caustic comment from other large cities and charges of " favoritism . " Mr. Byrnes , who promulgated the original curfew order , had not made any statement up to a late hour last night . His office would not speculate on whether the Mayor had consulted with Mr. Byrnes in advance . Paul V. . War Manpower Commissioner , whose agency was given the power of " enforcement " of what , in the first instance , was a " request " through allocations of employes and the setting of employment ceilings , said the WMC had no part in interpreting Mr. Byrnes ' order . Mrs. Anna M. Rosenberg , regional WMC head , was reported out of town for a week and there was no statement from her office . Mulrooney Is Confident Edward P. Mulrooney , chairman of the Curfew Control Board , said he was confident that " it will work out " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order or any police powers . It acted , he said , merely in an interpretive capacity . The board is scheduled to meet this afternoon . In Boston , where modification rests with the City Licensing Board , Miss Mary E. Driscoll , the chairman , said the board would meet today to discuss the situation . The owner of three leading night clubs said that " unless something similar is done here and in other large cities , the various Mayors will find the people demanding they be given the same treatment as New York is receiving . " Mayor Edward J. Kelly in Chicago said he would go along with the " order of the Government " and retain the midnight curfew . William H. Spencer , WMC regional director in Chicago , said he did not know why Mayor La Guardia should feel " that he has a different situation than anywhere else . " San Francisco , which has had a midnight curfew on liquor since early in 1942 , imposed by the Army , will conform to the original hour , Mayor Roger D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that " we 're much more serious about winning this war than the people in New York who apparently are concerned with having a good time after midI night . " Midnight in Jersey New Jersey will observe the midnight closing , at least for the present . Alfred E. Driscoll , State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner , said he would go to Washington today to demand from officials a clarification of " what is to be the national policy . " " It begins to look as if there was one law east of the George Washington Bridge , " he declared , " and another for the west side . " In making New York the first large city to ease the nation-wide midnight curfew , the Mayor gave as his reasons for modification the fact that the early closing has created a traffic snarl , that it has resulted in rapid drinking , that a tendency has developed toward the unlawful sale of liquor , and that the extra hour will enable police to " get after " speakeasies , clip joints and other dives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like New York , he declared , adding that unless adjustments are made the curfew would " defeat its very own purpose . " Landlords Are Warned He warned landlords who rent to speakeasies that after due notice they would be prosecuted for " conspiracy to violate the law . " He had caused his " own perI sonal survey " to be made , the Mayor said , adding that he had been watching the situation very closely . In granting his one hour of " tolerance " the Mayor ? expressed his belief that , if the places were actually closed by 1 A. M. , " that is a full and reasonable and bona fide compliance with the request . " It was noted that the Mayor , in stating " to the entire country " that licensed places in New York City had complied with both the letter and the spirit of the curfew , used the word " request " as did Mr. Byrnes rather than " order " as promulgated by the WMC . Hours after the Mayor had made his " clarifying " comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant and bar proprietors as to the meaning of his action . Some bar owners said they would not risk selling drinks after midnight until they have had " positive assurance " that they were not violating the law . Most of the larger hotels , according to Martin Sweeny. president of the Hotel Association of New York City and head of the Hotel Commodore , were taking the Mayor 's radio statement " at its face value " and kept their restaurants and bars open until 1 A. M. " It must be assumed , " Mr. Sweeny declared , " that Mr .. La Guardia as Mayor of New York has the authority to speak concerning a curfew which his Police Department has been called on to enforce . " " The tavern keepers of Manhattan and the Bronx are appreciative and are thankful to the Mayor for his action , " said Joseph Maguire , president of the United Restaurant Liquor Dealers , with a membership of 1,500 . Mr. Maguire , characterizing the curfew as a " farce , " said : " It serves no purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place the public could not be i blamed for not tolerating it . And I am giving the consensus of opinion of the customers of our members when I say they are thankful to the Mayor . Personally , it looks to me like the beginning of the end . " In his talk with reporters the Mayor warned that he would go back to the midnight curfew at once if the 1 A. M. hour was not faithfully observed . Warns Against Abuse " We will brook no abuse , " he said . " If this hour of tolerance is abused we 'll clamp the lid right back on at midnight again . But I do n't think there will be any abuse . Midnight was just the wrong hour for New York City . " When he was asked if the new ruling meant that a customer could go into a place at or after midnight and order food and drinks the Mayor replied : " They can go in any time they want , as long as they 're out at 1 o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra hour , the Mayor said : " Tell them to try it . I do n't believe there 'll , be any complaint if they stay open . " In response to questions he said the curfew modification would apply to night clubs , taverns and bowling alleys , as well as other " amusement " places . Spokesmen for night clubs said the extra hour " will enable us to serve the after-theatre public that might want a bite of food , a drink or a little dancing before going home . " Jobs Open Up Again The management of a. chain of restaurants that had dismissed thirty employes because of . the midnight curfew sent messengers yesterday to the homes of its former employes asking them to report for work at once . Bartenders in taverns along Eighth , Ninth and Tenth Avenues said they welcomed the Mayor 's extra hour . " The only pity , " said one , " is that it had to come one day after St. Patrick 's Day . " In his radio talk the Mayor introduced the curfew change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " He had come to the conclusion following the personal survey made for him , he said , that an " adjustment " was necessary to meet local conditions . He mentioned the " great jam " in transportation around midnight and that the curfew " has created too much rapid drinking . " " In other words , " he said , " people get to a place about 11:30 P. M. and want to do about two hours of drinking in thirty minutes . You can not absorb it so fast . " In addition , it has created , as we have seen , a tendency for the unlawful sale of liquor . " Thanks Amusement Places After extending his thanks to lhotels , restaurants , night clubs , theatres and other amusement places for their strict observance " without any griping or grousing or complaining or whining , " the Mayor said : " Now , there is no use prolonging the diagnosis , I think I have it diagnosed pretty well . So , in order to meet the situation and to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reasonable in New York City to extend one hour of tolerance . " " In other words , at 12 o'clock there is an hour 's time of adjust1 ment in which patrons may pay their bills without a wild scramble for the doors and exits . Therefore , I would say that with this one hour of tolerance , if the places are actually closed one hour after midnight , that that is a full and reasonable and bona fide compliance with the ( Federal ) request . " Another feature , the Mayor said , was that with the days longer now it was almost impossible for the theatres to open much earlier than they are opening . " Therefore , " he said , " they are out at 11 or 11:15 and it is not unreasonable for someone to want to have a little something to eat or something to drink before going home . The 12 o'clock , being a definite , rigid 12 o'clock , simply will not work in with that . More Police Hours " In addition to that , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which to get after the speakeasies , the clip joints , the dives , the dumps and the other gyp places , and we can use these several hundred police , hours to greater advantage . " The Mayor then warned landlords who rent to speakeasies , saying they were one of three parties to the crime of selling liquor unlawfully  --  the others being the seller and the patron . " Ah , you never thought of that , did you ? " he said addressing the landlords . " We are going to nail you just the same as we do for housing any other unlawful or immoral activity . " Concluding , the Mayor said : " So now we will allow one hour tolerance after midnight and expect the places to be closed at 1 A. M. You may put it on the teletype anytime you are ready now , Lew . " This last was a reference to Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine .
