When Shipbuilder Henry J. Kaiser stormed into Washington 16 months ago with plans to build 5,000 giant cargo planes in shipyards , most U.S. planemakers hooted down : 1 ) Mr. Kaiser , 2 ) the very idea . Some of them , Washington rumor said , put their best hatchet men to work to kill it . But stubborn Mr. Kaiser somehow salvaged a small Government contract from the battle . Turned down everywhere in the industry , he promptly went to work with lanky Howard Robard Hughes , movie maker , oilman , round-the-world flyer and aeronautical engineer . They planned to turn out three super-colossal planes of Hughes 's own design . <P> Last week , the hatchet work was revived ; Shipbuilder Kaiser and Flyer Hughes stormed into Washington . They had good reason : WPB was casting a cold and fishy eye on the three-plane contract , had a good mind to cancel it . <P> On the surface , WPB was merely scanning all plane contracts . <P> Suspicious Mr. Kaiser . But blunt Mr. Kaiser made no secret of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoffingly certain that the tremendous Kaiser-Hughes plane would be a flop . ( Where will he get the plant ? The men ? The engineers ? The materials ? Besides , the U.S. does n't need it . ) Now , said Mr. Kaiser , they were worried lest it be a success . They feared , with good reason , said he , that it would put Shipbuilder Kaiser years ahead in the race for a postwar plane . <P> WPB wanted to be convinced that the mammoth Hughes plane was worth the time ( twelve more months ) , the money ( $16,500,000 ) that was being lavished on it . Confident Mr. Hughes took time off from planemaking to convince WPB . Despite all rumors , he said , the work was going along well . Reported Hughes : 1 ) the engineering work for the entire plane was practically completed ; 2 ) the construction of the wings was well along and work was under way on the fuselage ; 3 ) the plane would be ready to fly late in ' 44 . <P> Satisfied WPB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staggering facts leaked one shocker : the Kaiser-Hughes plane , the largest ever built , will carry 700 soldiers fully equipped . Or it could evacuate 550 wounded men . <P> WPBsters were shaken by Howard Hughes 's ice-cold confidence . They closely scrutinized all the plans , were assured by Expert Grover Loening , WPB 's aviation adviser , that the ship was far in advance of anything he had seen . WPB 's eye warmed up . It decided not to cancel the Kaiser-Hughes contract - at least , not immediately . But WPB also made it plain that it intends to keep an eagle eye on the supership , may yet cancel the contract .
