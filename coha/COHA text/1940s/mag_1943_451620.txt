FoBEWORD . ? The story of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes is the story of his country . The narrative can not begin with the flat date of his birth  --  1841 . This was a man whose presence carried tradition ; over his shoulder one catches sight of his ancestors . His roots reached deep into American earth ; it was the strength of these roots that permitted so splendid a /lowering . To know Judge Holmes at eighty courtly , witty , scholarly , kind ? it is well to have acquaintance with his Calvinist grandfather , Abiel Hohnes , with his handsome , worldly great-grandfather , Judge Wendell , with his mot her from whom he inherited , he said , " a trace of melancholy . " Above all , it is well to know his father , the sturdy Yankee who wrote bad verse and good books ? professor of anatomy , talkative five-foot-three Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table , who lived on applause and said so with engaging frankness , and who looked down his nose at his son 's choice of a profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of Dane Hall on Harvard Square , up between the white columns , through the wide doors , and takes his seat in the lecture room of Judge Joel Parker . He is eager , but he is also more than a little confused . He is by no means sure of himself . He has only the stubborn , hazy conviction that the law is what he is going to do next and do with all his might . Within the boundaries of this conviction he is slated for hours , days , years , of doubt and bitter uncertainty . " Law student , " Holmes had written with a flourish three years ago in his army identification papers . On his return from the war in July of 1864 he would have liked to go over to Cambridge immediately and enroll in the Law School . But he hesitated . It was a serious step . Was the law really his objective in life ? not merely the " starting point " he had called it in his class autobiography ? There was one other possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard . Since his undergraduate days and his prize essay on Plato , Holmes 's passion for philosophy had grown steadily deeper . Metaphysics , dialectics , formal logic , theories of government and theories of sovereignty : these things fascinated him . And in 1864 these were the things that lay behind the law . The question was : Should such knowledge be pursued with only itself as goal , or was it better to have a focus , a boundary , some clinical application outside the classroom , such as a money-making law practice that brought a man up against the world and the living problems of the world ? Cousin Robert Morse , who had a very good law practice on Pemberton Square , said Wendell was born for the law . Wendell received this statement with skepticism . The only thing he felt born for was to use his powers to the full . Even more clearly than when he was in the army , Holmes recognized that his powers were intellectual , that he w4st an " internal " man to whom ideas were more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as external as it would be possible to live . He had slept on the ground , had killed men with his own hand , saved men 's lives by his own hand . Now he was free , and the life of pure scholarship beckoned . But if he embraced it , if he followed in the footsteps of such a man as Emerson , might he not , at forty , find himself dwelling in a cloudland of pure speculation , his own vital force dilute in this rarefied region ? At home he said nothing of his plans , aware that his father had long ago studied the law and hated it . Dr. Holmes liked philosophy no better , having the scientist 's mistrust for abstract speculation . It seemed to him that lawyers went about solving their problems ? and what dreary problems ! ? in a manner both unreal and devious . He had a quotation from Gulliver about lawyers , whirls he loved to air : " It is a maxim among these lawyers , that whatever bath been done before may legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it kept Wendell 's lips sealed . He had no wish to be preached at concerning the uselessness of lawyers and philosophers in a hard , practical world : " What are you going to do ? " Dr. Holmes asked continually . " What about science ? Science is the coming thing . What about teaching ? It 's true the professor 's ' hair has an insulating quality that cuts it ofl ' from contact with reality . But combined with writing or some more practical application , teaching is a very satisfactory way to make a living . " Ile had talked until his wife cautioned him to be still , let Wendell alone , give him a chance for a rest . and a few /eoliths ' vacation before making his decision . If the war was not over by spring the boy would probably re-enlist whether he was physically fit or not . Let him have a winter free of responsibility . Give him time to look round , get flesh on his bones , heal up his nervous system . On the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regiment in a ceremony on the Common with the other three-year men . He carried the title of Lieutenant Colonel , breveted for " gallant and meritorious service at the battle of Chancellorsville . " Afterward the Regiment marched around Faneuil Halt behind the brass band , ending up at the Apollo Gardens for beer and an excellent supper provided by the Citizens ' Committee . Wendell sat with Captain Magnitzky , an older man , a Pole from out near Lowell who had volunteered as a private and served right through the war . Wendell was immensely fond of him . " Do not look so troubled , " Magnitzky told lion now . " You have done your part . You were a good soldier , Captain Holmes . And you were not born for it . In six months , eight months , if we do not beat the Rebels you eon perhaps re-enlist . Now it is time for you to forget soldiering and be a scholar . It . is time for you to do for a little while the things you were born to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of his father 's study . " I am going to the Law School , " he said without preamble . Dr. Holmes looked up from his desk . " What 's the use of that , Wendell ? A lawyer ca n't be a great man . " The remark was instinctive . But if he had tried , Dr. Holmes could not have devised as statement more provocative to his son . A lawyer can't. be a great man . To Wendell the statement combined a paternal cocksureness tatneerning the universe and its arrangements with a bland assurance that any son of Dr , Oliver Wendell Holmes could be a great man if he started out right . The words struck home , pointed , steel-shafted . If there had been doubts , they were resolved now . Wendell would go over to Cambridge and sign his name on the , rolls at Dane 11211 . He would prove that the profession of the law was not a way to make money on Court , Street . The law was not merely a door opening into knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . SITTING in Judge Parker 's lecture room on a bright day of September , Holmes took out his notebook as the Judge began to speak . It was a large ( lass ; the war had not caused college enrollments to fall off . The last class graduated from the College had in fact been much larger than Wendell 's own class of ' 61 . Peter Olney sat just across the aisle , Robert Lincoln next to him . Strange to be a student once more to sit , notebook in hand , waiting for the professor 's voice . What an impressive-looking man Judge Parker was ! Senior professor and Dean of the Law School , he had been Chief Justice of New Hampshire . His black eyes shot lightning , his features were strong , he carried himself very straight . When he strode through the room and onto the platform he looked as if he were going to walk right on through the other side . He was sixty-nine ; he had lectured at the school for sixteen years . A good fight , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with : politics and for the past two years had bitterly condemned Lincoln 's use of wartime powers . Everyone knew what Judge Parker bad said to the president of Dartmouth . " Sir ! " roared Parker . ' ' This modern education is all a hmbug ! " President Lord had only sighed . " Judge Parker , " he replied , " it is . " There was no other way to converse with Judge Parker . His knowledge of the law was vast. - It was also exact , formal , and involved to the point of obscurity . Holmes had been warned not to try to understand Parker 's lectures . Just get what he said into a notebook and then learn it by heart . Wendell had been scornful of fins . He was no undergraduate trying to skim through college . He WAN a man of twenty-three who had been to war and desired knowledge . But after the first twenty minutes . of Joel Parker , Holmes was not so scornful of his adviser . He could not make sense of one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else had stopped writing too , Peter Olney 's eye was glassy . Only Robert . Lincoln leaned forward , intent , frowning . Was this the frown of understanding or the anxious pucker that goes with hopeless incomprehension ? Holmes lunged it . was the latter . Only last , night Harry James had told him that he had sat through an entire winter of lectures at the Law School without understanding it single word . Then he had joyfully abandoned the law . Father , Uncle John , Harry Jones- - 110t stupid 1/1011 . At home that , night . Wendell Holmes was unusually silent . Next day Professor Parsons lectured . And Professor Parsons , fortunately , Was a different , matter altogether . Parsons hated the more technical parts of the law , such as pleading and property , and did not hesitate to Say so . His father had been Chief Justice of Massachusetts , his own hook on Contracts was being readied for its fifth edition and was so much used in the courts that a student was heard to tusk if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed more litterateur thane lawyer . Holmes was drawn to hint immediately . Parsons always gave his first , lecture of the year on the ethics of the profession and it always opened with the same words . The students grinned with anticipation : " If a young lawyer pays for his sign Ike first year and his office rent the next , he can tell himself he is doing very The third professor , Emory Washburn , was a strikingly handsome man in his late sixties . In the early days of the war Holmes had been much impressed by seeing hint march up and down , gun on shoulder , guarding Cambridge Arsenal with his students . Like the other two professors , Washburn was descended from a long line of patriots . He himself had been State Senator , Judge . Whig Governor of the Commonwealth . This summer Holmes had twice seen him walking behind soldiers ' funerals in the uniform of the Home Guard . The bushy gray eyebrows and side whiskers of the former Governor looked strange under a private 's cap , and somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , " Washburn said . Ile was the best lecturer in the school , he could breathe life even into Coke on Littleton and the dreadful logic of Fearne on Contingent Remainders . When he laughed you could hear him across the Yard , and the students loved him . Holmes said it was Washburn who taught him the meaning of the phrase , " enthusiasm of the lecture room . " So far , so good . Under teachers of first-rate minds , strong characters , and contagious personalities , Holmes could start off with enthusiasm . He lived at his father 's house on Charles Street , going back and forth to Boston in the crowded horsecars over the West Bridge , carrying large brown books to study at home ? Spence and Fearne and Austin . Austin 's Jurisprudence was new . Austin was a Utilitarian . Lawyers said his book attempted to untangle law from ethics , to separate old theories of political sovereignty from the historical foundations of society . list the book made very unpleasant reading . Later , in London , Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with typical Pollockian candor declared the author to be " uncouth and excessive , " his literary manner so repulsive that even at his most accurate it was difficult to believe what he said . Not all the books Holmes studied were British . From the Law School itself came some of the best . ones : Story 's Commentaries , Greenleaf on Evidence , Stearns on Real Actions , Parsons on Contracts . For American jurispruLice Holmes had a book he liked : Walker 's Introduction to American Law . It was . t.a said afterward , one of the five books that gave him a glimpse of what he was seeking ? the law in its general , historical aspect . The other was the first volume of Spence 's Equitable Jurisdiction . Timothy Walker , a student at the Law School under Judge Story , had written his book as a very young man , apologizing in the preface because somebody older and wiser had not written it instead . In it he examined American law from the Bill of Rights to Civil Procedure , discussed the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent to support him . He advised the student to shun delights and live laborious days . " Genius without toil , " Holmes read on page nineteen , " may , to some extent , distinguish a man elsewhere ; but here he must labor , or he can not succeed . No quickness of invention can supply the place of patient investigation . A clear mind might determine at once what the Ws ' ought to be , but actual inspection alone can determine what the law is . " Wendell Holmes did not spurn this investigation . He reveled in it , pursued it mightily . In the students ' law club ? the Marshall Club , it was called ? he argued cases with Olney and Lincoln . At home he continued the argument until his father , rebelling , said if Wendell went on talking law he would get out his fiddle and play against him right there in the library . Wendell laughed . How much pleasanter his father was to get on with , now that the decision was made and he was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to living at home . After being a captain in the army , how could he submit even outwardly to his father 's authority ? Yet he had no choice . He had no money , he was twenty-three . It was his business to get through Law School as cheaply as possible . Mrs. Holmes 's pleasure ir ' iaving her eldest son once more under her roof was extreme . It touched Dr. Holmes , made him suddenly more tolerant . When Mrs. Holmes heard Wendell 's voice she came quickly into the room and sat down , watching him with an expression of such bright pleasure that Wendell turned instinctively , addressing the rest of his remarks to her . Once , while Wendell was speaking , his father got up and , putting an arm over his wife 's shoulder , patted her gently , then left the room . Mrs. Holmes was interested in every detail her son brought home from the Law School . She did not want to talk about the war , she said . She had had enough of war . Wendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him use it then , while the chance was given him . The Rebels were not beaten ; God knew what lay ahead . Mrs. Holmes was especially interested in the Marshall Club debates . Wendell had a talent for speaking , she said . Dr. Holmes did not agree , but for once he kept silence . The law was a howl of sawdust ; Wendell had undertaken to swallow it down . Let him swallow it then . His father wished him well . But what exactly was that phrase ? Sawdust without butter . Some English barrister had said it to a young aspirant . " If you can eat sawdust without butter , young man , you will be a success in the law . " He must look the phrase up , have it ready for Wendell next time the boy began to orate on the virtues of jurisprudence , over against medicine , as a mind trainer . 17 ONE evening in December , Cousin Robert Morse stopped in to see Wendell . He had a proposition to make . How would Wendell like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part time of course , and see a little practical application of all this theory he was reading in Cambridge ? Might do him good to handle a real writ , acquire a practical conviction of the difference between assuinpsit and trover . After all , lawyers were n't made in libraries . The old apprentice system had had its points . Wendell did not hesitate . Next Monday afternoon he sat on a high stool behind a desk in Barristers ' Hall and copied wills , deeds , trusts , for ' three hours . He could not pretend it was invigorating work . But as the weeks wore on he was continually surprised at the speed with which Morse moved when a question was brought to him . At Law School it had seemed that such questions would require weeks of argument , reference , and cross-reference before a decision could be reached . It left Wendell openmouthed , he told the fancily at , supper , to see the swift certainty with which a master of his business turned it off . Dr. Holmes , helping himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knife in hand . " Sawdust ! " he murmured . " Sawdust without butter . " He looked up . The old gleam was in his eye . " Wendell , have you heard what the English judge said to the young man who asked how a person could recognize a real vocation for the law ? " ) hider the table Neddy kicked his brother swiftly . Across the table his sister Amelia watched , her brown eyes quick as a bird 's . Mrs. Holmes poured Wendell 's tea , handing it to him serenely . Wendell looked at his mother ; their eyes met without expression . " No , Father , " Wendell said gravely . " I have n't heard . What did the judge say to the young man who wanted to be a lawyer ? " In the autumn of 1865 , beginning his second year at the Law School , - Wendell Holmes looked at his courses with a dispassionate eye ? and found them wanting . In the catalogue the course called " Instruction for the Bar " was listed briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Admiralty ; Commercial , International and Constitutional Law ; and the Jurisprudence of the United Mates . " Holmes still had no fault to find with his teachers . They were admirable men . But . when you had mastered the subjects they presented , where did it lead ? Holmes had thought to make all knowledge his province , walking from ignorance to light through a door labeled Tim LAW . Now he found himself wandering in a maze of technicalities , a nightmare of doors that opened only to close silently upon themselves , with no progress made , no path revealed . With one or two exceptions the books that were put into his hand gave no perspective beyond the intricate learning they presented , appeasing not at all Holmes 's curiosity , his passion for an ordered intellectual vision of the connection of events . Any man of ambition is willing to labor unceasingly to master the tools of his profession  - -  -  provided the tools arc adequate to the job that will follow . The trouble was that in 1865 the tools of legal education were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student with its sociological implications ; he was not taught history , economics , or given any sense of continuity in the law , of past , present , or future . Year after year the same ancient books were given the strident , the same rules to learn by rote . Wendell Holmes entered Law School only six years before Christopher Columbus Langdell brought the case system of study to Harvard . But when Holmes was in school , in 186,5 , the case system was es unknown to Cambridge as the telephone . Holmes had to learn the law the way his grandfather , Judge Jackson , had learned it , by fumbling through detached and unrelated books on legal specialties and by studying such meager reports as the United States courts had lately gathered . The temple of the law , Dr. Holmes had said , was very cold and cheerless about the threshold . With violence , his son repudiated this statement . But the farther he went in the law , the stronger grew his own doubts . And as always , doubt engendered challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the law was simply a system of fossilized injustice , with not enough intellectual interest to occupy an intelligent man for an hour . Holmes himself gave testimony to the hardships of his search : ? " One found oneself plunged in a thick fog of details ? in a blade and frozen night , in which were no flowers , no spring , no easy joys . Voices of authority warned that in the crush of that ice any craft might sink . One heard Burke saying that law sharpons the mind by narrowing it . One heard jet Thackeray of a lawyer bending all the powers of a great mind to a mean profession . One saw teat artists and poets shrank from it as from an alien world . . . . " And yet , observing Holmes at twenty-four as he pursues his way through the law , one has the impression that the blind seeking , the lack of compass , chart , and rudder , was for him a not unfavorable circumstance . Lack of tools may cause the weak to abandon their project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irksome challenge . Chancellor Kent said he owed his reputation to the fact that when studying law during the Revolution he had but one hook ? Blackstone ? and that one book he mastered , Paucity of material forced him to be not only thorough but , imaginative , to exercise his mind far beyond the program . As for tools , had not Holmes 's forefathers made their own ? Ilea John Holmes the Connecticut Go-Outer desired clapboards , he made a sawmill . Abiel Hohnes ? vearning to read the history of his country and finding none available , sat down and wrote his own Annabi of America , taking twenty-six years to do it . Wendell 's father , angered by the mysterious death of young mothers in childbed , sought through uncharted regions of a medical tradition that knew no Lister , no Pasteur , no germ theory , and no antisepsis , until he found the contagiousness of puerperal fever . What pioneer ever had chart and lighthouse to steer by ? Wendell Holmes could not know that in the field of historical jurisprudence he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that ordered precedent which is history . No wonder he could not find it . He was himself to be its spokesman . 18 The only fellow here I care anything about is Holmes , who is on the whole a first-rate article , and one which improves by wear . He is perhaps too exclusively intellectual , but sees things so easily and clearly and talks so admirably that it 's a treat to be with Jinn . YANKEE FROM OLYMPUS William James was boarding near the Medical School . Not only was the attraction mutual between hint and Wendell , but Dr. Holmes also was charmed with this student of medicine whose imagination went so far beyond the facts of anatomy . Dr. Holmes would have agreed with James that Wendell was too exclusively intellectual . But the doctor would not have used such flattering terms . He would have said that Wendell took himself too seriously ? that for a man of twenty-five he had far too little sense of the amenities . Half of Dr. Holmes 's success in life lay in the charm with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a talent for speaking , for expression , a talent for debate that mould be much to his advantage as a lawyer . Dr. Holmes ( lid not agree . His son was quick ; there was no denying it . Swift as lightning his mind penetrated to the meaning of a subject , swift as lightning reduced it to manageable terms . But the terms themselves were cold , ruthless , intellectual . Once he seized upon a subject , Wendell could not let it go . He worried it until the bare bones showed . If someone broke in with a pun , a quip , Wendell not only did not laugh but he ignored it and talked on without so ' much as a decent interval . Nobody could stop him . " Wendell puts a but at the end of every sentence , " John Gray said , " so that he can keep on without a pause . " There was fire in Wendell 's eye while he talked ; even his father saw it . Wendell shouted , waving his arms , striding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel as if his pipe were the common enemy and he must smash it . But the words he spoke were cold , logical . " Feeling counts , " James said one night . The doctor applauded . Wendell 's reply was quick , " To know is not less than to feel , " he said . But it was not to his father that Wendell Holmes expounded his views on the universe . Upstairs under the gas lamp that smelled and sputtered , he and James argued passionately about the existence of an external world ? a question that has occupied philosophers since the beginning . On evenings when Chauncey Wright and Charles Peirce joined them , Holmes was hard put to it to hold his own . Peirce had a kind of grim common sense that was wanting in most philosophers . At twenty-Six he was smart , fiercely combative . His angry black eyes , his square chin , gave him the look of a man of action . His lectures at Cambridge were making the town angry . He stood and hurled at his audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thirdness and then suddenly said something that woke up the hall like a fire gong . " The demonstrations of the metaphysicians are all moonshine ! " he had shouted the other night . " Classical German philosophy is of little weight except as suggestion . " This was heresy to a generation that had evolved its moral values from Kant . But it was Wright who taught Holmes never to say necessary about the universe . " How could you know , " he asked Holmes , his extraordinary pale-blue eyes alight with a cold passion , " ? how could you know what the universe considers necessary ? " It was , in truth , a time of extraordinary intellectual fer- mod- The Origin of Species had been published only seven years before . In America its repercussions . delayed by the tumult of the Civil War , were just being felt  --  and felt for the most part as a threat to Genesis 1 . The Harvard Divinity ' School was in a turmoil . One of its professors lectured on the topic : " Can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a Boston pulpit a preacher shouted , " If I could not believe that Joshua made the sun stand still in the heavens , I should lose faith in the Bible and in God ! ? ' But in these torments endured by the faithful , Wendell Holmes had no part . For him the core had been taken out of Christian theology a generation ago , when the Unitarians disavowed the doctrine of original sin . Man lost his fear of hell-fire ? and on that day gave back Christian doctrine to the preacher as irrelevant to life . After that , disbelief in Genesis I was a small thing . Wendell Holmes had achieved it without the least struggle . He was born to it , Dr. Holmes 's frantic efforts to free himself from Calvinism had failed . But they freed his son , The English-speaking world was going through a complete rebirth in science , theology , economics , sociology , and , last of all , law . New terminologies were forming everywhere ; it was no wonder Wendell Holmes sat up all night practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to have but one focus . Very soon the terminology of the law would exclude from his mind every other subject ? and his friends would be driven from him by this passionate single-mindedness . But just now he was trying his wings , was exercising tongue and brain upon every subject , every person available . William James , writing to Tom Ward in New Tork , and to his brother Wilkinson in the South , spoke often of Holmes and of their mutual friends . " I nude the acquaintance the other day , " he wrote in the spring of ISM " of Miss Fanny Dixwell of Cambridge ( the eldest ) , do you know her ? She is decidedly A I , and ( so far ) the best girl I have known . I should like if possible to confine my whole life to her , Ellen Hooper , Sara Sedgwick , Holmes , Harry , and the Medical School , for an indefinite period , letting no breath of extraneous air enter . " " Miss Dixwell , " James confided to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . That villain Wendell Holmes has been keeping her all to himself out at Cambridge for the last eight years ; but I hope I may enjoy her acquaintance now . She is A 1 , if anyone ever was . " That villain Wendell Holmes would have been astonished at this description of his relationship with Fanny Dixwell . He saw Fanny two or three times a week . She was perhaps his most intimate friend . He had known her since they were children . Seven years ago when he was a freshman at Harvard he had formed the habit of dropping in at the big frame house on Garden Street after classes , in the evening , or whenever he . happened to be near . Going to the Dixwells ' was almost like dropping in on one 's family . Often enough he and Uncle John met at the white wicket gate and walked up the Dixwells ' path together . ' 41 ) .1a3.i was twenty-five . She was the girl a fellow could take his troubles to , talk to by the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his partner for the sleighing party , the summer picnic , the country walk . She was always stimulating , never demanding . Holmes saw plenty of girls : Susie Shaw , handsome and clever , who was getting ready to enter the women 's college at Oxford . linnie Temple , who rumor had it was in love with John Gray . IVendell said it was James that Minnie had her eye On ; Gray said it was Holmes . The f ) ixwells ' house itself was full of girls . After Fanny came Esther , then Susan , then one brother , John . Then Arria , then Mary Catherine who at twelve was an imp , casting eyes at every man that entered . Dixwells were noisy and merry and unpredictable . In Cambridge you did not ask why a member of that family had done thus and so . It was understood that nobody was entitled to a why about a Dixwell . Mrs. Dixwell was a comfortable , lively , handsome woman . Uncle John Holmes adored her . On her wedding day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight one-dollar gold pieces . Mrs. Dixwell liked to tell about it . She was always trying to marry off John Holmes and getting nowhere . John lived just off Garden Street now , in a little alley he had named , grandiloquently , The Appian Way . His house wore an air of dilapidation ; it was filled with cats , books , birds in cages ; his mother 's old housekeeper took care of him . " You should move to better quarters , John , " Mrs. Dixwell told him severely . " Oh , I ca n't move to better quarters , " John Holmes replied gravely , " until I have a better half . " The remark went all over Boston . Tom Appleton heard it and took it to London , and the first thing Boston knew , it read the words in London Punch , mister a drawing of a Jim , whiskered young man who did not look like John I lohnes at all . The Scientific Club net every week at the Dixwells ' . If Wendell happened to call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Agassiz , Asa Gray , Jeffries Wyman . They were all VerY old friends . Mrs. Pixwell hush a wedding-day story about Gray , too . Ile ryas passionately fond of flowers and hated to pick them . Mrs. Dixwell said he must love her very much because on her wedding day lie had appeared with two sprays of white lilac broken from his own hush . Sometimes when there WAS an evening party in Cambridge , Wendell spent the night at the Dixwells ' . On these occasions Mr. Dixwell had a stock remark lie always made next morning , Walking briskly into the breakfast room , he would lake his place at the head of the long table , beam at the company through his spectacles , and remark heartily , " Well ! Did the evening 's enjoyment hear the morning 's reflect iinir Wendell loved if. , felt . as much at home as he did on Charles Street . This spring he talked much to Fanny Shout his approaching trip to England . He had been planning it for years ; he was to sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . Fanny herself had neverbeen abroad ; her travels were limited tA ) S11111/ner trips to Nahant , or Mail apoisett on the Cape . " I am to meet John Stuart Mill in London , " Holmes told her eagerly . And Hughes , the jurist , the fellow that wrote Tout Brown . I have letters from Motley and Sumner . Leslie Stephen will cross over with me to Switzerland . He has sonic really hard climbing mapped out . Do you remember my telling you about it in the spring of ' 63 when Stephen was in Boston ? " After the manner of women listening to masculine plans they may not share , Fanny 's expression and words were enthusiastic . It would be splendid , she said , the clear color high in her cheeks . Wendell needed to get away , see other countries , meet , other men and women . " Mind you stand up for this country , " she said , " with your fancy friends in the West , End of London . Stephen and Hughes and Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father tells me you will have entree to some very big houses . Do you think 3 ' 01I will be able to hold your own ? " At home that evening , Wendell repeated Fanny ? s words . " She says they will spoil me in London . Fanny says I will lose my Yankee ways and come home with an Oxford lisp . " Around the table a queer little silence fell . It was Neddy who broke it . Neddy was a junior at . Harvard now , and often went to the Dixwells ' to see Susie . Neddy was too bright for his bones , the family said . He had grown very fast ; he was thin as a rail and much bothered by asthma . He read omnivorously and brought home marks that his brother and father had never equaled in their undergraduate days . Wendell loved him . He had a precise way of speaking ; his voice was quiet , a little husky . " You are not very discerning about Fanny Dixwell , Brother , " Neddy said now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " It 's not necessary to ask me what I Wall . Yon just . are n't very discerning about . her , that 's all . " Wendell grinned . He did not want to know what Neddy meant . Neddy was at an age to see romance everywhere . Today as Wendell fame out of Dane Hall at his usual hour of one o'clock , Fanny Dixwell had happened to he walking just , across the street . She had hailed hini , invited him to supper tomorrow night . Susie Shaw was coining , she said . Wendell would enjoy talking to her about Oxford . Fanny was the best , friend a num ever had . Not smart about the girls  --  I ? " Wendell said to his brother . " Young fellow , when you learn to manage the ladies as well as I do , you can start giving advice 1.0 your ( ) Id ' nide Wendell . " Dr. and ratha . Holmes smiled , their eyes meeting down the length of the table . But as the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to the library , Mrs. Holmes told herself with a slightly Cnouirlvd air that Neddy had been right . Fanny Dix well was a marvelous girl . a girl among Ilimisands . She was devoted to Well - dell . her 111 ) W Many years had they been close friends ? People linked their names . Wendell did MIL Wein aWarl ? of it. ; he was totally unconcerned . Ile had inore girls than you could count , on ten fingers . Stepping into the library , stooping to turn up the flame in the lamp on the center table , NIrs . Holmes told herself again that Neddy was right . Wendell was not very discerning about . Fanny . Toward the middle of May , Holmes sailed for England . Before he left Boston , George Shattuck asked hint to come into his office next winter and read for his Bar examination . Holmes accepted gladly . The firm of Chandler , Shattuck , and Thayer was famous as a training ground . Holmes looked forward to Shattuck 's practical wisdom , his skill in handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston in September , 18t16 , Wendell Holmes expected somehow to find the whole face of nature changed . - What . had happened to him was important , ( - wiling . He had seen London , Scotland , had met great ices , had crossed the Channel and climbed great inount ants with Leslie Stephen . Excitement . filled him , and , like many a returning traveler , Ile never doubted the excitement would be reflected everywhere . But it was not reflected . Wendell returned , it is true , to a different house ; during the summer his family had moved a few blocks north on Charles Street ; the address was 1 ( 14 instead of 21 . It was pleasanter here near the river . But inside the house things were remarkably the same . Dr. Holmes went off to Grove Street every day to lecture , Ile had ceased ? mercifully ? to play the violin , but he was writing a new novel and burned to talk about it . Neddy , a senior at Harvard , came home over the week-ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the housekeeping , going to her Sewing Circle and to such festivities as the season afforded . The supper table listened for a night or two to the elder brother 's adventures abroad , then turned eagerly to its own affairs . They had been to Nahant in the summer , in n cottage near Longfellow and Agassiz . Dr. Holmes had suffered his usual Nahant asthma . The Indians had been a real nuisance , coming in swarms for the fishing , pitching their ditty tents right against the Lodges ' hedge on the Point . Ben Butler down in Washington wanted to impeach the President , Neddy interposed . But of course , Wendell never had been interested in politics . In England , had he MI Untied his absurd habit of not reading the newspapers ? Nobody waited for Wendell 's reply . Fourteen chapters of his new novel were finished , Dr. Holmes said eagerly . The Guardian Angel , he was going to call it . It was a kind of sequel to Elsie Venter , on the same theme of heredity . But lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of clergy . Dr. Bellamy Stoker , the villain of the story , had-three sermons on hell ? his sweating sermon , his fainting sermon , and his convulsion-fit sermon . He had n't made that up , the doctor added quickly . He had got it from an actual instance in a town in Maine back in his lecture-circuit days . The Atlantic Would probably publish the novel serially . You had better be careful , " Wendell told his father . " There was trouble enough about Elsie and the Autocrat . People will be calling you a freethinker all over again . " Dr. Holmes rubbed his small hands delightedly . " In New England they weld iron bands around the sapling elms to keep them within hounds . Your Uncle John and Wendell. were banded with iron in sir pout h . My books help me to get the iron of Calvinism out of my soul . ' " Uncle John . " Neddy said irrelevantly , " only goes abroad so that he can have the extreme pleasure of COMing back to Boston . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace spot and stand there , lie said it reminded him of the junction of Broadway and Cambridge Streets in Cambridgeport . Mr. Appleton told me . " Boston people were hopelessly provincial , Dr. Holmes said genially . Had Wendell noticed it , after being alma ' . ? As he had once written Motley , your Boston man carrie , , the Common in his head as a unit of space , the State House as the standard of arehitecture , and measures tilt men in Edward Everetts as with a yardstick . He himself had often been accused of provincialism . But he was not at all sure , for a literary man , that it was a weakness . " They are still trying to name the new hotel , " Amelia said , complacently pursuing her own line of conversation . " It is nearly finished and it is enormous . It will have a passenger elevator as big as a room . They can not decide between The Hub Hotel and Everett House . ' Father , if they name it . The Huh you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't it you who called Boston the huh of the universe ? " Looking around the table , Wendell was amused . This family could not hold its peace for two consecutive moments . Yet , listening now to their talk , Wendell recognized , with the fresh eye of the returned traveler , that his fatuity. while undoubtedly irritating , was very far from dull . This was not the wit of London dinner tables , but whatever it was , it had life . Provinciality ! There was something good about it , something vigorous and plain . " Mother ! " Wendell said suddenly . His strong voice came out easily above the rest . " Did you Item . what St. Peter said to the Boston man at the pearly gates ? " Surprisingly , the table was silent , waiting . " He said , You wo n't like it here . ' " On a Monday morning , Holmes went down to Court Street to the office of Chandler , Shattuck , and Thayer . Mr. Shattuck greeted him heartily . Peleg Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew all around under his chin ; his wing collar came up to his ears . He shook Wendell 's band . " How is your father ? " he said . " No candidate from this office ever failed a Bar examination , my boy . " He bowed slightly and disappeared . George Shattuck winked . It would take a hall-wit to fail the Bar examination , he said . If Holmes had sat three years in this office he would be admitted without examination . As it was , he had been to Law School instead , and the Commonwealth took no account of law schools . " Make sure you do n't know too much , " Shattuck said . " The examiners do n't like smart young men from the Law School . I 've known them to fail a 111f1/1 because he tried to show off . I 've also known them to drive a nice little bargain , promising not to ask the candidate any question he could n't answer if the candidate would do the same by them . " A client came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Bradley Thayer came out . He was ten years older than Holmes . He had got his LL.B. at Harvard in ' 56 . Rumor said he was aiming fir a professorship at the Law School . He wore his fine . lark hair rather long ; he had the dreamy , gentle eye of the scholar . Shattuck , it appeared , had turned over the student end of the office to Thayer . " Sit down , " Thayer said . " Now , what are you after , Holmes ? Admission to the Bar or perhaps a trifle more education with it ? No thinking will he required at the Court House . Judge Shaw used to make them think , but the rules are changed . Only memory is required . But they can lay it on pretty thick . If you get old Asaph Churchill , he is partial to Coke . Was n't Churchill in college with your father ? Do you know the rule in Shelley 's Case ? " Sitting in the outer room of Chandler , Shattuck , and Thayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Holmes was struck anew with the awful power of ideas to change a world . Montesquieu commanded the future more surely from his study than Napoleon from his throne . A valid idea was worth a regiment any day . The man of action has the present , yes ? but does not the thicker control the future ? Perhaps a man had to fight in a war to find that out . When you were twenty it was the Henry Abbotts , the Caspar CrowninshieIds ? external men all  --  who seemed to rule the world . But this picture Montesquicu drew of the government of England ? was it valid ? Montesquieu divided it into three distinct parts , the legislative , executive , judicial . Surely that was a fiction , even two centuries ago ! Holmes got up , knocked on Thayer 's door . " Find out for yourself , " Thayer said . " How well do you know Stephens on English criminal law ? Have you read Reeves ? " An enormous impatience began to possess Wendell Holmes . He could not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took home Argyll 's Reign of Lain , Gladstone 's Reform Speeches , McCosh 's Mill 's Philosophy . Holmes read Lecky , Phillimore 's Principles and Maxims of Jurisprudence , Forsyth 's History of Trial by Jury , Reeves 's History of the English Law , Palgrave 's English Commonwealth . It seemed no more than a drop in the bucket of knowledge . His age had begun to worry him . lie was nearly ' twenty-six . He had lost three years by the war . Men younger than he were well along now in law offices , done years ago with such puerilities as Bar examinations . " When will you come up for examination ? " Dr. Ifolmes asked just before Christmas . He had asked at least three times in the past month . " In the January term of Court , " Wendell replied . Actually , it was the twenty-seventh of February before George Shattuck wrote the conventional letter of recommendation , testifying to Isis good moral character . IloInses took it to the Court House . His petition was filed . Asaph Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wednesday morning , by appointment , Holmes walked up a flight of ( lark stairs 10 Mr. Churchill 's office . He felt more curious than apprehensive . " Good //Milling , Holmes , " Churchill said . " How is your father ? We were at college together . Afterward , I believe he was not so successful at law as at writing verse . " Behind Churchill , Charles Huntington grinned broadly . He was a much younger man , graduate of Harvard in ' 5th. but he had not been to Lass , School . Asaph Churchill motioned Holmes to be seated , across the big desk . Ile put on his glasses . His face was serious but Itohnes was conscious that Churchill was enjoying himself . " We might as well begin , " Churchill said . " Huntington , with your permission . Now , Holmes , who owns the land between high and low water mark ? " " In Massachusetts and nowhere else , " Holmes replied with equal gravity , " the land belongs to the owner of the adjoining land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Court Street . He felt exhilarated . They had let him ott too easily , he thought . After one or two routine questions , the three had simply sat and talked law . He could have got through with a third of his knowledge , a fifth of it . There were six hundred lawyers in Boston . Had they all slipped through so easily ? He turned in at 4 Court Street . George Shattuck whacked him on the shoulder . " Chandler will take you to Court Monday to be sworn in . Like to go myself , but I have a client coming . This will call for celebration . Come to my house Monday evening . Bring Ropes and Gray . I will ask Parkman and Warner and Green . I have a receipt for a new gin toddy . There is nothing better for drinking the healths of newborn counsellors at law . " Monday morning was dark and gusty , with a threat , of rain . Peleg Chandler , his ears entirely hidden inside his stiff white collar , walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the same side of the street . The pillared granite portico was dark and high . Holmes always entered the place with a quick sensation , not so much of excitement as recognition . This court house was a part of him , of his background and childhood . Here Judge Loring had sentenced the runaway slaves , Sims and Burns . Manacled to these very benches , they had waited for the verdict . Up these granite stairs Higginson had led the mob that tried to rescue Burns . Holmes had been eight years old . He had stood at his bedroom window on Montgomery Place , ten blocks away . There had been shouts , feet running on Tremont Street . Entering the wide doorway with Peleg Chandler , Holmes did not think of these things . Merely , he was conscious of them . They were part of lain , and what he was about to do would make these remembered things , this dark high hallway , even more a part of him . Holmes and Chandler were early . Court sat at nine-thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow in the gaslight . There were five lawyers in court ; they sat facing the Bench . Holmes recognized two of them ; they nodded to him . Peleg Chandler walked back and took his seat with the spectators . Judge Lord cause in , thrust back his coattails and sat . // down , looking toward Holmes , who sat alone on the petitioners ' bench . Lord was nearsighted ; he raised his bearded chin , his face straining slightly toward Holmes . .. and God save the Commonwealth and this Honorable Court , " the crier finished . There was a rustling of papers among the members of the Bar . The Clerk stood up . His voice was loudononotonous . " The Court will attend to the taking of the oath , " he said . Holmes came forward . It was like graduation , like walking up for your diploma , like the brevet.colonelship given him three years ago on the Common . It was absurd to feel so solemn . But Holmes did feel solemn . He liked ceremony . You did your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper , bowed to you . The five lawyers stood up ; so did the spectators . The room was silent . Holmes swore true faith and allegiance to the Commonwealth , swore to support the Constitution of Massachusetts and of the United States . Then with his hand on the Bible he took the Attorneys ' Oath : I , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. , solemnly swear that I will do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court ; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any false , groundless or unlauful suit , nor give aid or consent to the same ; I will delay no man for lucre or malice ; but I will conduct myself in the office of an attorney within the courts according to the best of my knowledge and discretion , and with all good fidelity as well to the courts as my clients . So help me Cod . Judge Lord smiled , inclined his head . " Come and sign the Bar Book , " Peleg Chandler said . It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the bottom of the page was room for one more name . There were thirteen names inscribed in this January term of court . All but three , Holmes noted , were from the Law School . Holmes signed his name carefully . There was no flourish to the way he did it . Peleg Chandler peered over his shoulder . " Horace Graves , " he read . " Promising fellow , Graves . I knew his father . Well , well , Holmes ! You can have a sign on your door now . Be sure you bring us in some clients . " For Peleg Chandler , this was unusually facetious . Holmes put down the pen , turned , and followed Shat-tuck 's senior partner to the door . On the portico , rain drove through the pillars , wind blew back the skirts of Chandler 's overcoat . Turning up his coat collar , Holmes descended the steps and followed Peleg Chandler down the gray slope of Court Street . A week later , the secretary of the class of ' 61 , Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIVER WENDELL HOLIES , JR . Counsellor at Law 4 Court Street , Boston . 20 tIVER WENDELL HOLMES , JR. , Counsellor at Law , was not overwhelmed with business . What had Washburnsaid at the Law School ? " If a young lawyer pays for his sign the first year and his rent the next , he can tell himself he is doing very well . " All summer he stayed in town , going every day to the office , with an occasional week-end with the Lodges at Nahant . All his friends were out of town it seemed ? and Wendell Holmes had need of company . If to Shattuck the practice of law was exciting , to Holmes it was quite horrifyingly dull . This was no sudden discovery : Holmes had long suspected it . But it was not something a young lawyer could go around confessing to his friends . He could have told it to William James . But James , unfortunately , was in Germany . lie had sailed quite suddenly in April . " To study physiology , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was ashamed of his share in the family " nerves . " Backache , insomnia , eye trouble , deep depression : the symptoms seemed unmanly . He confided in no one , not even his family . Holmes missed him greatly . James 's very sensitiveness , the overacute perceptions that made bins ill , drew Holmes to him . In September James wrote , confessing his complete prostration  --  inability to work , study , sometimes even to react . To Holmes , loving action above all else , this was a purgatory almost inconceivable . Ile knew James to be no moody neurotic , but a man like himself , ambitious , desiring work and the companionship of his fellows . ' You had better believe James wrote that I have thought of you with affection at intervals since I have been away , and prized your qualities of head , heart and person , and my priceless luck in possessing your confidence and friendship in a way I never did at home ; and cursed myself that I did n't make more of you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian , threw evening after evening away which I might have spent in your bosom , sitting in your whitelylit-up room , drinking in your profound wisdom , your golden gibes , your costly imagery , listening to your shuddering laughter , baptizing myself afresh , in short , in your friendship .. . But pray , my dear old Wendell , let me have one letter from you  --  tell me how your law business gets on , of your adventures , thoughts , discoveries ( even though but of mares ' nests , they will be interesting to your William ) ; books read , good stories heard , girls fallen in love with ? nothing can fail to please me , except your failing to write . . . . . . Give my very best regards to your father , mother and sister . And believe me ever your friend , Wis . JAMES . P. S. Why ca n't you write me the result of your study of the vis viva questions ? I have not thought of it since I left . I wish very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great .. . . Vis viva ? the vital forces ? Holmes sat down , wrote page after page . Then he lit a cigar , tilted back his chair , read over what he had written ? and tore it up . Easy enough to see that force is not destroyed ? but not easy to master the formula . Translating mathematics into English was no simple exercise . In November , as Junior Counsel to Shattuck , Holmes tried his first case in court . A passenger on the New York Central died intestate ; his widow claimed 85000 inns the railroad . Shattuck and Holmes were counsel for the plaintiff . Holmes sat . at a long table below the judge 's desk while Shattuck talked ; occasionally he jumped tip to hand Shattuck a needed paper . Shattuck , he observed , was nothing short of magnificent . Needing the excitement of advocacy to waken his interest , Shat-tuck 's mind , once roused , moved like lightning , like lightning struck and struck again . A stranger , coining into court , would have thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , some question of American rights , free speech , honor . They lost the case . But Judge Hoar , delivering his opinion , leaned his handsome , bearded face across the tench and said the argument of the plaintiff had been kith ingenious and impressive . Walking back front the office late that afternoon , Holmes reflected on all this . He had worked hard on the ease , preparing his statement of facts , looking up law . ' set even in court , he had been a trifle bored . If the excitement of advocacy awakened George Shattuck 's ' lowers , it by no means awakened the powers of Wendell Holmes . How small a goal lay at the end of these huge legal efforts ! Better , like the scholar , to have no goal at all , pursuing doggedly the unknown end . " So you lost the case ? " Fanny Dixwell said that night . Wendell had come over to Cambridge in the horsecars , stopping by prearrangement for Uncle John on the way . They had had tea with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yost lost the case ? " Fanny repeated . " Yes , " Wendell said . " Shattuck was magnificent . " Ile was silent . John Holmes looked thoughtfully at his nephew . A generation ago , John had sat in a law office himself , for two mortal years . Twenty-four months too many , he often said . Today , Wendell had acted as counsel in his first case in court . Wendell was very far from reserved . Yet all lie had to say now was that Shattuck had been magnificent . Wendell would never make a lawyer . Clients meant nothing to him . His father had better stop pushing him . Fanny inquired no further concerning the lost case . " Wendell , " she said , " I meant to ask you long ago , did you answer Bill James 's letter ? About ? what was that thing lie wanted to know about ? " " Via viva ? " Wendell said . " No . I tried three times . All I could wring out was diluted moonshine . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts . " Fanny made a gesture of impatience . " Bill James is your friend , " she said . " He is alone and he is ill . Ithink I have written him more letters than you have . II loves you . Write to him without . ri.s. viva . " Wendell shrugged . Fanny got up , went . to the tall for something . In a moment she turned to john Holmes her color high . " Mr. Holies , " she said . Her voice wit urgent . ' ' Has your nephew , all his life , professed to cart more for ideas than he cares for people ? ? Wendell Holmes to I l'lltiant James BOSTON , Dec. 15 , 1867 DEAR Bit.t ? - I shall begin with no apologies for my delay in writing except to tell you that since seeing you I have written three long letters to you at different intervals on vis viva , each of which I was compelled to destroy because on reflection iL appeared either unsound or incomplete . But . I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away anyhow  --  ? that . she thought it would please you to hear from me even without vis viva . SO here goes . Writing is so unnatural to me that I have never before dared to try it to you unless in connection with a subject . Alt ! dear Bill , do site justice . My expressions of esteem are not hollow nor hyperbolical ? nor put in to cover my neglect . In spite of my many friends I am almost alone in my thoughts and inner feelings . And whether I ever see you much or not , I think I can never fail to derive a secret comfort and companionship frosts the thought of you . I believe I shall always respect and love you whether we see much or little of each other . . . . For two or three months I debauched o ' nights in philosophy . But now it is law-law-law . My ' magnum opus was reading the Critique of Pure Reason . And Holmes is off to paragraphs of pure logic ? exercise that for him was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse George Shattuck . Yet even as he wrote , even as he quoted , Holmes was aware that it was only exercise . February , March , April . On Boston Common the gaunt outlines of the elm branches softened . Color crept slowly down the giant oaks ; the cracks along the sidewalks showed a brilliant , yellow green . Piles of blackened , muddy snow still lay in the gutters. high as a man 's waist . But Holmes , swinging down Beacon Hill from the office in the late afternoon , raised his head and felt his step quicken , the blood move faster in his veins . On Saturday he would take Fanny for a walk in Cambridge , up around Fresh Pond . Arbutus would be out under the leaves , and bloodroot . For how many Aprils had they gone together to search for it ? Holmes did not ask himself this question . lAterely , it was spring , high time Fanny sent him a message about the bloodroot being tip , in the woods around Cambridge .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
