NO MORE than two years ago it was a good guess that Hitler 's war would make hash of Soviet Russia . Instead , the war has not only enlarged Stalin 's empire and proved a real boon to it in many ways , but has also converted it into the last thing one would ever have expected it to become  --  a " transit country . " Persons who wish to go from Europe to America nowadays have to make a tiresome trip around three-quarters of the globe ; and they have to go through Russia . Unless they prefer to wait their turn for months at Petsamo or Lisbon , the last two ports of the Continent from which a few ships still ply across the ocean , they have no choice but to go to Moscow , by plane , train , or boat , spend nine days and nights on the Trans-Siberian Railroad , wait a week or so at Vladivostok for the boat to Japan , which only runs three times a month , and then take a transpacific liner at Kobe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip may very possibly be canceled at the last minute " by order of the government . " It is , although not a very comfortable journey , an interesting one if you have plenty of time ; if you have not , it is a damned nuisance . I had lived in Moscow for six months in 1932 when things generally were in rather bad shape ; so naturally I was curious to see how they would be now , eight years later . To tell the truth , I was disappointed . There is no denying that some progress has been made . the standard of living has undoubtedly risen ; scores of new and imposing buildings have been built in Moscow alone ; many services which at that earlier period were in a chaotic condition have been licked into shape . But , by and large , things looked pretty much as they did eight years ago . There were still the same depressing queues outside the food shops , the restaurants , the stores where anything of practical value could be bought , and on the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to be quite so long and the people did not look quite so hungry as in 1932 , but it was obvious that the output and distribution of foodstuffs and other essentials was still  --  or again ? ? far short of requirements . The capital seemed better off in many ways than Vladivostok , where we stayed a week , and the other towns of Siberia and the Far East , which we merely glimpsed from our train . We saw few beggars or ragged children in Moscow , but dozens of them lined the platform of practically every station beyond the Urals . They looked unspeakably tattered and grimy , and they fought like hungry wolves for the pieces of bread and the coins which the passengers threw to them . I had read articles  --  which I believed innocent of propaganda  --  saying that the chronic dearth of food and household goods had at last been overcome in Soviet Russia arid that the stores were filled with goods of all sorts , at reasonable prices . I can not say whether that was true at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , most of the stores , in Moscow as in Vladivostok , were as empty and desolate as they had been eight years ago . My eyes met the same familiar and depressing sights : the yawning emptiness of cases and shelves , with here and there a sprinkling of unsalable goods , the bored-looking shop-assistants , haughtily cutting short all inquiries for articles with the unvarying , final njet , " none " ? the most-used word of the Russian vocabulary  --  and the multitudes billowing to and fro , from opening hour to closing time , between the bare counters and empty cases , with eager , searching eyes , ready to jump at any object not entirely devoid of usefulness that could be bought for rubles . We found scarcely any more goods on sale now than in 1932 , but there was a spectacular change in window-dressing . Whereas in that year even the shop windows used to gape in utter desolation , they are at present alluring pitfalls for the artless passer-by . Here , behind the glass  --  mostly broken in Vladivostok , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution  --  are exhibited all the things that the crowd in the street is longing to buy : beautiful loaves of bread and appetizing strings of sausages , ham and cheese , lusty lobsters and huge codfish , a lovely portrait of a young lady inhaling a perfume which the cosmetic trust promises to sell you if you will step inside . The promise is vain : the bread , the ham , the lobster are painted images ; none of them are really on sale . But everywhere one can buy portraits and busts of Stalin , Molotov , Voroshilov , and other prominent Soviet leaders . Rows upon rows of them stand in the shops  --  in black , in white , in colors ; carved in wood , moulded in metal , or hewn in stone ; tiny figures to be carried in your pocket or to be worn as amulets ; medium-sized ones for office desks and sideboards ; oversized specimens for the decoration of assembly halls and railroad stations . From one end of our trans-Siberian journey to the other there was n't a station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busts of Lenin , Stalin , and sometimes Karl Marx . Many other things were indicative of the noisome leader-worship that contributes to the resemblance between the Soviet Union and the Nazi or Fascist dicta- . torship . Propaganda , however , seemed to have abated somewhat . We saw nothing like the orgy of posters and banners , with hammered catchwords and flaming slogans , that until a few years ago were a part of daily life in the Soviet Union . Are there no bright spots in the picture , then ? Certainly there are . In the first place , I noticed that the majority of the people were much better dressed , and in particular better shod , than when I was last there . My wife , of course , thought their clothes were awful , but she had never been in Russia before and her mind was still filled with images of Sweden 's opulence and luxuries . She found it hard to believe that a nation existed without silk stockings or pretty hats , but when she looked around for a well-dressed woman she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor quality and poorer style . Well , they did n't look fashionable to me either , but they were truly well clad compared with 1932 , especially the men . People in rags no longer dominate the Moscow streets as they used to . The typical Russian garments have given place to Western suits and overcoats , and real leather shoes are worn now instead of the galoshes , sandals , or mere foot-straps of former times . Also , much better food is served in the restaurants I had no time or opportunity on this trip through Russia to find out whether the ordinary Russian family eats better at present than eight years ago ; to take the ill-provisioned food stores as evidence that it does not would be misleading because of the peculiarities of the Soviet system of distribution . But travelers and other people who can afford to eat at the Metropol or the Savoy are certainly presented with a better bill of fare . We had some delicious dishes , prepared with good butter  --  a thing not to be dreamed of in 1932 ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid ! A four-course dinner with wine for two persons , at the Metropol , cost me 96 rubles ( the official exchange rate is 5.60 rubles to the dollar ) , a box of sweets cost 16 rubles , a one hour 's taxi ride around town 30 rubles , and so forth . Fortunately , I had a small savings deposit in rubles left over from my previous stay in the country ; it came in very handy , for otherwise we should have spent our last dollar before we got on the boat at Vladivostok . In general , prices appeared to be quite as high as eight years ago and for some commodities even higher . Ever since the liquidation a few years ago of the special stores , like " Insnab , " where foreign specialists and workers could buy goods upon presentation of a special booklet , and " Torgsin , " where anyone could buy at reasonable prices if he had foreign currency , foreign residents and visitors in Russia have been at a distinct disadvantage owing to the unfavorable exchange rate . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem in a simple manner . They sold a few of their belongings at a commissioner 's shop , or better still on the " black " market , where they fetched exorbitant prices . An old suit , for example , could be sold for 300 rubles , a new one for from 800 to 1,000 , a watch for 600 rubles , a pair of shoes for 300 , stockings for from 40 to 100 rubles a pair . Such trading is of course illicit and subject to heavy penalties , but it goes on everywhere . If it were rigorously stopped , most of the people that 0 . December 21 , - 1940 now travel through Russia  --  the bulk of them are refugees from Germany and Poland  --  could no longer afford the journey . There are other noteworthy improvements . Urban traffic , for example , has made considerable progress . The streets of Moscow today are enlivened by a variety of excellent automobiles , of domestic as well as of German or American make , including many new taxicabs . Tram and bus services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to cope with the huge traffic of the city , thanks chiefly to the new Moscow Underground , which is , technically as well as decoratively , a marvel of modern architecture . On the whole , however , traveling in Soviet Russia is still as haphazard and comfortless a business as it used to be . A journey on the Trans-Siberian Railroad , in particular , is a source of more annoyance than pleasure . Trains are few and therefore permanently overcrowded ; through trains from Moscow to Vladivostok run but twice a week . Usually it matters little whether you have booked first- , second- , or third-class tickets or hotel accommodations . As likely as not you will learn , on arrival , that the Intourist Agency in the country from which you came has issued tickets and coupons to you which the head office in Moscow or the Vladivostok branch is unable to honor . I knew an elderly and rather squeamish gentleman who , after booking , in Stockholm , a first-class passage on the boat from Vladivostok to Tsuruga , Japan , was assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; nor did he get any money back , except rubles , which were obviously worthless to him since he was about to leave Russia and no one is permitted to take rubles out of the country . I also knew a woman who had bought coupons for first-class hotel accommodations in the Soviet Union , but found when she got to Vladivostok that the only hotel in the city was so full that it had not even a bench or a bathtub left to offer her as a sleeping place ; she was simply told to go and sleep in an unprepared and even unlighted railroad car . I believe that much of the disorganization and incompetence which make such a shocking impression on the foreign visitor in the Soviet Union is attributable to ingrained defects of the Russian character rather than to inevitable shortcomings of the Soviet system . But I am at a loss to understand why the Soviet authorities are so negligent in a matter which vitally affects their prestige . Sufely , with a little good-will , a real effort at organization , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary European or American traveler , it should be possible to overcome at least some of the grossest deficiencies . There is a peculiar sort of grandeur in the way the Russians ignore foreign opinion , determined , it seems , to muddle on as they please in their age-old ways . 633
