recoiled a step , her eyes full of fear . Timid ; eh ? ' He laughed contemptuously . Since when was the daughter of a Greek innkeeper so frugal with her smiles ? ' But I implore you , Tribune ! ' Dion 's voice was trembling . The House of Eupolis has ever been respectable . You must not offend my daughter ! ' Must not  --  indeed ! ' crowed Quintus . And who are you  --  to be advising the envoy of the Emperor what he must not do ? Be gone , fellow ! ' He thrust out an arm toward Phoebe and Ino . You , too ! ' he barked . Leave us ! ' Deathly white , Phoebe rose unsteadily and took a few steps , Ino supporting her . Dion held his ground for a moment , panting with impotent anger , but began edging out of range as their enemy fumbled for his dagger . What are you doing here , slave ? ' shouted Quintus , turning savagelyto Demetrius . My master ordered me to remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had better go with your father to the house . ' Purple with rage , Quintus whipped out his dagger and lunged forward . Demetrius sprang to meet the descending arm which he caught at the wrist with a tiger-claw grip of his right hand while his left crashed into the Tribune 's face . It was a staggering blow that took Quintus by complete surprise . Before he could regain his balance , Demetrius had sent another full-weight drive of his left fist into the Tribune 's mouth . The relentless finger-nails cut deep into his wrist and the dagger fell from his hand . The battle was proceeding too rapidly for Quintus . Dazed and disarmed , he struck wildly , blindly , while Demetrius , pressing forward step by step , continued to shoot stunning blows into the mutilated face . Quintus was quite at his mercy now , and Demetrius knew it would be simple enough to administer the one decisive upper-cut to the jaw that would excuse the Emperor 's envoy from any further participation in the fight ; but a strong desire had laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted on the Tribune 's face before he finally put him away . It was becoming a quite sanguinary engagement . Both of Demetrius ' fists were red with blood as they shot into the battered eyes and crashed against the broken nose . Quintus was making no defense now . Bewildered and blinded with blood , he yielded ground with staggering steps until he had been driven backward to a huge pine where he put out a hand for support . He breathed with agonized , whistling sobs . You 'll die for this ! ' he squeaked , through swollen lips . Very well ! ' panted Demetrius . If I 'm to die for punishing you --  ! '  |p201Grabbing  Quintus by the throat-strap of his helmet , he completed the ruin of his shockingly mangled face . Then , satisfied with his work , he deliberately drew back his arm and put his full strength behind an ultimate drive at the point of the Tribune 's jaw . The knees buckled and Quintus sank limply to the ground . The Eupolis family had withdrawn some distance while the punishmentwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . Have you killed him ? ' he asked , hoarsely . Demetrius , breathing heavily , was examining his bruised and bleeding hands . He shook his head . We will all be thrown into prison , ' moaned Dion . Do n't think of trying to escape , ' advised Demetrius . Stay where you are  --  all of you . You had nothing to do with it . That can be proved . ' He started to walk away toward his master 's suite . Shall I do anything for this fellow ? ' called Dion . ' Yes  --  bring a basin of water and towels . He will be coming around presently . And if he shows fight , send for me  --  and tell him that if I have to do this again , I shall kill him ! ' Very much spent , Demetrius walked slowly to their quarters and proceeded through to the peristyle where Marcellus sat at the table writing , his face brightly animated . He did not look up from his letter . Demetrius ! The Emperor commands me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known  --  at first hand  --  about the Galilean ! ' Marcellus ' voice was vibrant . Could anything have been more to my liking ? Tiberius wants to know how much truth there is in the rumor that Jesus was believed to be the Messiah . As for me  --  I care naught about that ! I want to know what manner of man he was ! What a chance for us , Demetrius ! We will pursue our Aramaic diligently with old Benjamin . Come early spring , we will journey into Galilee ! ' He signed his name to the letter , put down his stylus , pushed back his chair , looked up into Demetrius ' pale face . ' Why  --  what on earth have you been doing ? ' he demanded . The Tribune , ' said Demetrius , wearily . Marcellus sprang to his feet . What ? You have n't been fighting  --  with Quintus ! ' Not exactly fighting , ' said Demetrius . He insulted the family  --  Theodosia in particular  --  and I rebuked him . ' ' Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had done a good job . But  --  Demetrius !  --  this is very serious ! Greek slaves ca n't do that  --  not to Roman Tribunes  --  no matter how much it is needed ! '  |p202Yes   --  I know , sir . I must run away . If I remain here , you will try to defend me  --  and get into trouble . Please  --  shall I not go  --  at once ? ' By all means ! ' insisted Marcellus . ' But  --  where will you go ? , Where can you go ? ' I do n't know , sir . I shall try to get out into the country , into the mountains , before the news spreads . ' How badly is Quintus hurt ? ' asked Marcellus , anxiously . He will recover , ' said Demetrius . I used no weapons . His eyes are swollen shut  --  and his mouth is swollen open  --  and the last few times I hit him on the nose , it felt spongy . ' Has he gone ? ' No  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers through his hair . ' Go  --  wash your hands  --  and pack a few things for your journey . ' Walking past Demetrius , he went to his bedroom and unlockinghis strong-box filled a silk bag with gold and silver talents and other coins of smaller value . Returning , he sat down at the table , took up his stylus , wrote a page , stamped it with his heavy seal ring , rolled it , and thrust it into a scroll . Here you are , ' he said , when Demetrius reappeared . This money will befriend you for the present  --  and this scroll contains your manumission . I shall remain here until spring ; the ides of March , approximately . Then I shall go to Jerusalem . I can not tell how long I may be touring about in the Palestinian provinces ; all summer , certainly ; perhaps longer . Then I am to return to Capri and report to the Emperor . For that I have no relish ; but we will not borrow trouble . ' Would I were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall miss you , Demetrius ; but your first duty now is to put yourself quickly out of danger . Try to let me know , as soon as safety permits , where you are in hiding . Remember that I shall be burning with desire to learn that you have not been apprehended ! Notify me of your needs . If you are captured , I shall leave no stone unturned to effect your deliverance . ' I know that , sir . ' Demetrius ' voice was unsteady . You are very kind . I shall take the money . As for my freedom  --  not now . ' He laid the scroll on the table . If I were caught with this on me , they might think you had rewarded me for punishing Quintus . ' Drawinghimself stiffly to attention , he saluted with his spear . Farewell , sir . I am sorry to go . We may never meet again . ' Marcellus reached out his hand . Good-bye , Demetrius , ' he said , huskily . I shall miss you sorely . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my thoughts . '  |p203Please  tell Theodosia why I did not tarry to bid her farewell , ' said Demetrius . Anything between you two ? ' inquired Marcellus , with sudden interest . That much  --  at least , ' admitted Demetrius . They silently gripped each other 's hands  --  and Demetrius sped away through the rose garden . Marcellus moved slowly back into the house , relocked his strongbox , and went out by the front door . Dion was approaching , pale and agitated . You have heard , sir ? ' he asked , anxiously . How is he ? ' inquired Marcellus . Sitting up  --  but he is an unpleasant sight . He says he is going to have us all punished . ' Dion was shaken with fear . Tell me  --  what really happened ? ' The Tribune showed much disrespect for Theodosia . Your slave remonstrated , and the Tribune lunged at him with his dagger . After that  --  well  --  your Demetrius disarmed him and began striking him in the face with his fists . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gentle-spoken slave could be so violent . The Tribune is unrecognizable ! Has your slave hidden himself ? ' He is gone , ' said Marcellus , much to Dion 's relief . Proceeding through the grove , they came upon the wretched Quintus , sitting slumped under the tall pine , dabbing at his mutilatedface with a bloody towel . He looked up truculently and squinted through the slim red slit in a purpling eye . When I inform the Tetrarch , ' he declaimed , thickly , there will be prison for you  --  and beheadings for the others . ' What had you thought of telling the Tetrarch , Quintus ? ' inquiredMarcellus , with a derisive grin . And what do you think they will say , at the Insula , when you report that after you had insulted a respectable young woman , and had tried to stab a slave who intervened , you let the fellow disarm you and beat you with his bare hands until you could n't stand up ? Go , Quintus , to the Insula ! ' went on Marcellus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after having had a duel with a Greek slave ! The Tetrarch will probably tell you it was disgraceful enough for a Roman Tribune to be engaged in a fight with a slave , even if he had come out of it victorious ! Come , then ; let us go to the Insula , Quintus . I shall accompany you . I would n't miss it for the world ! ' Quintus patted his face gingerly . I shall not require your assistance , ' he muttered . Let me put you up , sir ; wheedled Dion , until you feel better . '  | That is a good suggestion , ' advised Marcellus . Dion certainly owes you nothing for playing the scoundrel on his premises , but if he is willing to give you shelter until you are fit to be seen , you would be wise to accept his offer . I understand you are sailing on The Vestris , the day after tomorrow . Better stay under cover here , and go directly to the ship when she is ready to put off . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing story to tell about you , next time he visits Rome . ' I shall have that slave of yours whipped to ribbons ! ' growled Quintus . Perhaps you might like to do it yourself ! ' retorted Marcellus . Shall I summon him ? ' The gray days were short , cold , and tiresome . Marcellus had discovered how heavily he had leaned on his Corinthian slave , not only for personal service but friendship and entertainment . Demetriushad become his alter ego . Marcellus was lost and restless without him . Nothing interesting happened . The days were all alike . In the morning he went early to old Benjamin 's shop for his regular ration of Aramaic , offered mostly in the form of conversation . At noon he would return to the inn and spend the rest of the daylight in his studio , hacking away without much enthusiasm or inspiration on a marble head that resembled Diana Gallus less and less , every day . It was still apparent that she was a girl , a Roman girl , a quite pretty girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana . And perhaps this was to be accounted for , surmised Marcellus , by the increasing vagueness of Diana on the retina of his imagination . She was very far away  --  and retreating . He had had two letters from her . The first , from Capri , had been written in haste . She knew all about the Emperor 's orders that he was to continue his studies in Athens and then proceed to Jerusalem and the northernprovinces of Palestine for authentic information about that mysterious young Jew . As for herself , Diana said , the Emperor had insisted on her remainingat Capri for a few weeks ; and , in view of his valued favors , she had decided to do so . He had been very kind ; he was lonesome ; she must stay . Her second letter had been written from home . It , too , sounded as if the carriage were waiting and someone were reading the words over her shoulder . The letter was friendly enough , solicitous of his welfare , but wanting in the little overtones of tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adjourned to await fur/ther development in some undated future . Marcellus re-read this letter many times , weighing and balancing its phrases , trying to decidewhether Diana had been taking extra precautions in case the scroll were read by a third party , or whether she was losing interest in their affection . It might be one or the other : it might indeed be both . Her words were not softly whispered . They were gentle  --  but clearly audible . And they made him very lonesome . It was an important occasion , therefore , when the long letter arrivedfrom Demetrius . A light snow had fallen in the night and the sky was heavily overcast . Marcellus had stood for a long time at the studio window debating whether to go to Benjamin 's shop today . But the light was too poor for sculpturing . And the old man would be expecting him . With a mood to fit the sullen sky , he made his way to the shop where Benjamin greeted him with bright-eyed excitement . Here is a letter for you ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my care . Addressed to me  --  but intended for you . It was brought by a slave attached to a caravan , and delivered here last night by Zenos , the noisy boy who runs errands for my friend Popygos . Demetrius , as you will see , is in Jerusalem . I read that much of it . Your slave is prudent . Fearing a letter addressed to you might be examined and reveal his whereabouts , he has sent it to me . ' Benjamin laughed as he handed over the scroll . Now you will have an opportunity to put your Aramaic to practical use . It 's very good Aramaic , too ! ' he added proudly . Marcellus drew up a stool beside the worktable , unrolled the end of the long sheet of papyrus , and began reading aloud , with occasional hesitations and appeals to Benjamin who delightedly came to his rescue . Esteemed Master ( read Marcellus ) , I am writing this on the Jewish Sabbath in the upper chamber of an old house overlooking the Kidron , no great distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Stephanos , a Greek of my own age , whom the Jews call Stephen . He is intelligent , well-informed , and friendly . At present he is absent , on some mysterious errand ; possibly the same business that kept him out , last night , until shortly before dawn . I arrived in Jerusalem but three days ago . You will be curious to learn the manner of my departure from Athens . Confident of Fulvius ' friendship , I ran to Piraeus , boarded The Vestris , and confided my dilemma . Fulvius hid me in the hold . When the ship stood well out to sea , on the second day , I was brought on deck where I enjoyed full liberty . We had an important passenger who was recovering from an accident that had disfigured his face . He kept to his cabin until we had cleared from Alexandria . Recognizingme , he ordered Fulvius to put me in irons , which Fulvius refused to do , saying that I had paid my passage . This was untrue , though I had offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he could have me apprehended at the next port . We anchored at nightfall in the Bay of Gaza , and Fulvius secretly put me ashore in the small boat . Providing myself with a few necessities , I journeyed on foot over the same route taken by the Legion from Minoa to Jerusalem . In a desolate wady , some twelve parasangsnortheast of Ascalon , I was captured and robbed by Bedouins , who did not otherwise harm me , and permitted my escape . The weather was extremely cold and I was lightly clad . That country is sparsely settled , as you may recall . The few inhabitants are poor , and hostile to strangers . I learned to relish warm goat-milk and frosted corn ; and I was stoned while pillaging withered leeks from an ill-kept garden . I discovered that eggs , sucked from the shell , are delicious , and that a sleepy cow does not resent sharing her warmth with a wayfarer seeking shelter in her stall . The cattle of Judea are hospitable . On the last night of my journey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable of a tavern in the village of Bethlehem . In the morning the innkeeper sent his servant with a dish of hot broth and a small loaf of wheaten bread . The servant said it was a custom of the inn to befriend impoverishedtravelers . I observed that on the corner of the napkin , in which the bread was brought , there was embroidered the figure of a fish . It stirred my curiosity a little because a similar design had been burned with an iron into the timber of the stable-door . After leaving Bethlehem I noticed , at two road-crossings , the crude outline of a fish , drawn in the sand , and surmised that the device might indicate the direction taken by someone who wished to leave this cryptic advice for another person following . Not knowing what it meant  --  or caring very much  --  I dismissed the matter from my mind . Arriving in Jerusalem , hungry and footsore , I decided to seek the house of a weaver , hoping I might be given some small tasks to provide me with food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop of Benyosef I was kindly received by Stephanos , who works there . Learning that I am a Greek , and having been informedthat I had done some carding and spinning for Benjamin in Athens , whose name Stephanos recognized , he commended me to Benyosef , and I was given employment . The wage is small , but consistent with the service I render , and is ample to sustain me for the present . Stephanos bade me lodge with him . Of course , his interest in me is due , primarily , to the fact that I am a Greek . His people were long ago of Philippi , his great-grandparentshaving fled for refuge in Jerusalem when Macedonia wasp207subjugated . It seems that there are hundreds of Greeks here , whose ancestors migrated to Jerusalem for the same reason . Not many of them are literate ; and Stephanos , who is a student of the classics , longs for congenial company . He seemed pleased when , in response to his queries , I told him I was at least somewhat conversant with Greek literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper and were talking of many things relating to the unhappy Greeks , Stephanos idly drew the outline of a fish on the back of a papyrus tablet ; and , pushing it across the table , raised his brows inquiringly . I told him it signified nothing to me , though I had seen the symbol before . He then asked me if I had not heard of Jesus , the Galilean . I admitted that I had  --  but not very much  --  and would be interested in hearing more . He said that the people who believed in the teachings of Jesus were being so savagely persecuted that they met only in secret . This fish-emblem had been adopted as their method of identifying themselves to others of similar belief . He did not tell me how they came to use this device . Jesus was not a fisherman , but a carpenter . Stephanos went on to say that Jesus advocated freedom for all men . Surely a slave should ally himself with such a cause , ' he said . I told hijn I was deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus when there was an opportunity . The house of Benyosef , I am discovering , is not only a weaver 's shop , but a secret meeting-place for the men who were intimate friends of Jesus . My position here is so lowly and menial that my presence is unnoticed by the sober men who come neither to buy nor sell , but to slip in quietly and sit beside the old man , whispering while he whacks his ancient loom . ( Benjamin would laugh at that loom . ) Yesterday a heavily bearded man of great strength and stature spent an hour in low-voiced conversation with Benyosef and two young fellows , in a far corner of the shop . Stephanos said they were Galileans . The huge man , he said , was called The Big Fisherman , ' and the younger men , who were brothers , he referred to as The Sons of Thunder : The Big Fisherman ' seems a very forceful man . Perhaps he is the leader of the party , though why there should be a party at all , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cause is lost , I do not pretend to understand . They all act as if they were suppressing some excitement . It does not resemble the excitement of fear ; rather that of expectancy . They behave as if they had found something valuable and had hidden it . This afternoon , a tall , well-favored man from the country came into the shop and was greeted with much warmth . I gathered that they had not seen him for some time . When the day 's work was done , and Stephanos and I were on the way to our lodging , I remarkedof this man that he seemed an amiable person whom every- one liked , and he unexpectedly confided that the man was Barsabas Justus , of Sepphoris in Galilee . He then went on to say that Jesus had appointed twelve friends , to serve as his accredited disciples . One of them , Judas of Kerioth , had betrayed Jesus ' whereabouts to the priests . After his master 's arrest , he was filled with remorse and hanged himself . The eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though why they felt the necessity to do that , after Jesus was dead , Stephanos did not explain . They voted on two men who had followed Jesus about through the provinces , hearing him speak to the people and witnessing many strange deeds of which Stephanos may tell me when he is in a mood to speak more freely . I think he wants first to make sure that I will respect his confidence . One of these two men , Matthias by name , was elected to succeed the traitor Judas . The other man is this Barsabas Justus . I venture to suggest , sir , that when you come to Jerusalem to make inquiries about Jesus ' career , you could not do better than to contrive the acquaintance of a man like Barsabas Justus . This will not be easy to do . These friends of Jesus are watched closely for any indication that they are attempting to extend or preserve his influence . The Temple authorities evidently feel that the teachings of the Galilean contain the seeds of revolution against the establishedreligion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets about Jesus , the more likely it may be that this next Passover season can be celebrated without a politicaluprising . During these past three days I have given much thought to a plan which might assist you in getting up into Galilee without excitingsuspicion . You could appear in Jerusalem as a connoisseur of homespun fabrics , particularly interested in the products of Galilean household looms . Let it be known that such textiles are now highly esteemed in Rome . Inquire in the bazaars for such fabrics and pay generously for a few articles . They are not considered as of much value here , but might quickly become so if you permit yourself to be well cheated in two or three shops . Rumor spreads rapidly in this city . In the course of your search for Galilean homespun you would naturally call at the house of Benyosef where you might let it be known that you contemplate a trip into the region around Capernaumto look for textiles . You could inquire whether it would be possible to employ , as a guide , some man well acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop , Barsabas Justus would be the most likely , I think , to accept such employment . The man they call The Big Fisherman ' is too passionately absorbed in whatever he is doing in the city and The Sons of Thunder ' appear to be weighted with duties , but Barsabas Justus seems to have **25;8282;TOOLONG . Unquestionably he is your man  --  if you can get him . My belief is that they will , scatter when Passover Week approaches , for the Insula will be on the alert , and these Galileans will want to avoid useless trouble . I suggest that you plan to arrive here about a month before the Passover . Spring will be approaching , and the country will be beautiful . It will be more prudent if you do not recognize me , even if we meet face to face ; for , unless I am mistaken , Stephanos will  --  by that time  --  have taken me into his full confidence , and it would be most unfortunate if he suspected collusion between us . Stephanos does not know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can contrive a secret meeting when you come , I shall be overjoyed to talk with you , but I think you should ignore me completely . If a private conference is practical , I shall arrange for it and let you know  --  somehow . Marcellus glanced up at Benjamin  --  and grinned . That boy should have been a Jew ! ' declared the old man . He has a keen mind  --  and is cunning . ' Yes , ' agreed Marcellus , dryly . I can see that a study of Aramaic has done wonders for him . He is crafty . However  --  this advice sounds sensible enough ; do n't you think ? ' I doubt it , my friend . This is a game that will have to be played with the utmost care , ' warned Benjamin . The Jews have no reasons for trusting the Romans . Their confidence will not be easily won . ' Do you think I might be able to pass myself off for a merchant ? ' inquired Marcellus , doubtfully . A good way to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to go over here to David Sholem 's bazaar and buy something ; and then go across the street and try to sell it to old Aaron Barjona . ' They both laughed . ' But  --  seriously , ' said Marcellus . Do you think I might be able to get into Galilee by any such scheme as the one Demetrius sug-gests ? ' Not a chance ! ' scoffed Benjamin . Not if I offer the fellow a handsome wage ? ' Benjamin shook his head decisively . No  --  not for a handsome wage . This Barsabas Justus may have much to give that you would like to know ; but he will have nothing to sell . ' You advise me not to attempt it ? ' The old man laboriously threaded a needle , with many grotesque squints and grimaces . Having accomplished it , he grinned , triumphantly , and deftly rolled a tight knot into the end of the thread.  |p210It  might be worth trying , ' he grunted . These Galileans may be bigger fools than we think . ' WITH almost no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , a little distance from the highway , and were now lounging in the shade . Justus had stretched out his long frame on the grass , and with his fingers laced behind his shaggy head was staring up through the broad leaves into a bland April sky , his studious frown denoting perplexity . Marcellus , reclining against the tree-trunk , moodily wished himselfelsewhere . He was restless and bored . Old Benjamin 's pessimisticforecast that this proposed expedition into Samaria and Galilee would be a disappointment had turned out to be correct . Arriving in Jerusalem two weeks ago , Marcellus had acted fully upon Demetrius ' written advice . Having engaged lodgings at the best inn , a commodious old house with a garden , halfway up the hill toward the suburb of Bethany , registering in the name of M. Lucan , ' he had proceeded deliberately to bewilder the downtown bazaars with inquiries for homespun fabrics and garments  --  particularlyarticles of Galilean origin . He went from one shop to another , naively admiring the few things they showed him ; recklessly purchasing robes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely pleased to have them at any cost . And when the merchants confessed , with unfeigned lamentations , that their stock of Galilean textiles had run low , he upbraided them for their lack of enterprise . Then he had laid up , for a few days , lounging in the garden of the inn , re-reading The Book of Yeshayah  --  old Benjamin 's farewellgift  --  and waiting for the rumor of his business transactions to be whispered about among the clothing dealers . It was very trying to be so close to Demetrius and unable to communicate with him . One day he almost persuaded himself that this elaborate scheme for getting into Galilee was unnecessarily fantastic , and he half-resolved to go down to Benyosef 's shop and explain , in the most forthright manner , that he had a desire to talk with men whop211had known Jesus in his own community . But , upon reflection , he saw that such a course might embarrass Demetrius ; so he abandonedthis impulsive procedure and impatiently bided his time . At mid-afternoon on the fifth day of that second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauntering in casually to give the impression that he really wanted to do business ; for he had observed that , in Jerusalem , the serious customer with his mind set on something he intended to buy invariably tried to disguise his interest . The most ridiculous subterfuges were practiced . The customer would stroll in pretending he had come to meet a friend , or that he had lost his bearings and wanted to know how to find Straight Street . On the way out he would pause to finger some article of merchandise . Apparentlythese childish tricks deceived nobody . The more indifferentthe customer was , the more attentively the merchant hovered about him . It was evident that all business in the Holy City was so full of mendacity that a man who gave evidence of an honest purpose was immediately suspected of rank imposture . Pausing indecisively in the open doorway of Benyosef 's shop , Marcellus glanced about in search of Demetrius . It was not going to be easy , after this long separation , to confront his loyal friend with the cool stare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal the presence of Demetrius , but Marcellus was not sure whether he was disappointed or relieved ; for he had dreaded this moment . The clatter of the two antiquated looms slowed and ceased as he made his way toward the venerable weaver who , he felt , must be old Benyosef himself . If the aged Jew was alarmed at the presence of an urbane young Roman in his house , he gave no sign of it . He maintained his seat on the bench of his loom , methodically polite but not obsequious . Marcellus briefly stated his errand . Benyosef shook his long white beard . His weaving , he said , was all custom work . He had nothing made up to sell . If his client wished to order a coat , they would gladly make it for him , and it would be a good one . But as for homespun , it might be found in the bazaars ; or , better , in the country . And with that laconic announcement , he deftly scooted a wooden shuttle through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made the old loom shudder . It was apparent that so far as Benyosef was concerned the interview had terminated . Four other men had been mildly interested  --  and a dark , handsomeboy of twelve , who had stopped romping with a dog to listen . One of the men was a young Greek with a refined face , seated at a ramshackle loom adjacent to Benyosef 's . Marcellus surmised that this might be Demetrius ' friend Stephanos.  | Near the wall , behind the looms , sat two men who bore a marked resemblance , one in his early thirties , the other considerably younger . They were deeply tanned , and simply dressed in country garb , their rustic , well-worn sandals indicating that they were accustomed to long journeys on foot . This pair , obviously brothers , might easily qualify as The Sons of Thunder , ' though the appellationdid seem rather incongruous , for they appeared benign enough , especially the younger whose expressive eyes had a marked spiritual quality . He would have passed more reasonably as a mystic than an agitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an inverted tub , was probably sixty . He , too , was an outlander , to judge by his homely dress and the shagginess of his gray-streaked hair and beard . Bronzed and bushy , he seemed out of place under a roof . During the brief colloquy , he had sat gently stroking his beard with the back of his hand , his brown eyes drifting lazily from old Benyosef to the eccentric Roman who , for some obscure reason , wanted to purchase articles of homespun . At first sight of him , Marcellus thought this might be the man Demetrius had referred to as The Big Fisherman . ' He was big enough . But another glance at the reposeful posture and the amiable smile assured Marcellus that if The Big Fisherman ' was a man of energy and something of a party leader , the hairy one who lounged on the tub must be someone else , conceivably Barsabas Justus . Now that the looms had gone into action again , Marcellus had begun to doubt whether this was the time or place to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Benyosef had remarked that one might hope to buy homespun in the country ; so the query would be natural enough . As if this were a fresh inspiration , Marcellus inquired , in his best Aramaic , and addressing them all impartially , whether they knew of a man  --  well acquaintedin the northern provinces  --  who might be employed to accompany him on a leisurely tour . Benyosef , ceasing his racket , scowled thoughtfully , but made no comment . The older brother shook his head . The younger calmly stared through and beyond the inquirer as if he had not heard . The Greek , who might be Stephanos , slowly turned about and faced the big man in the corner . You could go , Justus , ' he said . You were intending to go home , anyhow ; were n't you ? ' How long do you want to stay ? ' rumbled Justus , after some deliberation.  |p213Two  weeks , perhaps , or three  --  or a month . ' Marcellus tried not to sound too urgent . Once I am up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , you could leave me  --  if you had other things to do . ' When do you want to start ? ' inquired Justus , with a little more interest . Soon as possible . How about the day after tomorrow ? ' The day after tomorrow , ' put in Benyosef , reproachfully , is the Sabbath of the Lord our God ! ' Sorry , ' mumbled Marcellus . I had forgotten . ' Do n't you Romans ever observe a day of rest , young man ? ' demandedBenyosef , enjoying his right to be querulous . The Romans rest oftener than we do , ' drawled Justus , encouraged to this audacity by the broad grin with which Marcellus had met the old man 's impertinence . But not oftener than you do ! ' growled Benyosef , darting his bright little eyes at Justus . This was good for a chuckle . Even the younger brother turned about and smiled a little . As if to prove himself a man of action , Justus rose and led the way to a wooden bench in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others , followed . So did the boy , who sat beside them , hugging his knees . With more resourcefulness than Marcellus had expected , Justus led the conversation about necessary arrangements for the journey . They would need a small string of pack-asses , he said , to carry camp equipment ; for some of the smaller villages offered very poor accommodations . Four asses would be sufficient , he thought , to pack everything including whatever might be purchased . Will you buy the asses for me , and the camping tackle ? ' asked Marcellus . Doubtless you could make better terms . How much money will it take ? ' He unstrapped his wallet . You are trusting me to buy these things ? ' inquired Justus . Why not ? You look honest . ' Noting that this comment had brought a little frown , he added , You would not be an acceptable visitor at old Benyosef 's shop if you were unscrupulous . ' Justus gave him a long sidewise look without turning his head . What do you know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruffly . Marcellus shrugged . The place is of good repute , ' he answered , negligently . Benyosefhas been in business for a long time . ' That means nothing , ' retorted Justus . Plenty of rascals stay in business for a long time . ' And when Marcellus had agreed to that with a nod , and an indifferent Doubtless , ' Justus said : There will be no need to buy pack-asses . You can hire them  --  and a boy to drive them . Hire the tent , too , and everything else . ' Will you see to it , then ? Let us be on our way early on the first day of the week . ' Marcellus rose . How much will you expect for your services ? ' I am willing to leave that to you , sir , ' said Justus . As you heard Stephen say , I had intended going home in a few days to Sepphoris in Galilee . This journey will not inconvenience me . I have nothing to do at present . My time is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter . And I could use a new pair of sandals . ' Well  --  I mean to do better than that by you , ' declared Marcellus . A new robe , then , ' suggested Justus , holding up a frayed sleeve . With pleasure . ' Marcellus lowered his tone and said , Pardon the question , but  --  but '  --  he hesitated  --  ' you are a Jew ; are you not ? ' Justus chuckled and nodded , stroking his whiskers . When they parted , a moment later , with a definite understandingto meet at the Damascus Gate soon after sunrise on the next morning after the Sabbath , Marcellus felt confident that the journey would be rewarding . Justus was a friendly old fellow who would tell him everything he wanted to know . He was just the type to enjoy reminiscence . With his errand satisfactorily performed and nothing in particularto do , Marcellus strolled back toward the busy , ill-flavored market-placewhere he idled past the booths and stalls , pausing to listen , with amusement and disgust , to the violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pickled fish or a calf 's foot . Vituperations rent the air . Unpleasant comments were made by customers reflecting on the merchants ' ancestry . Insults were screamed , and ignored , and forgotten , which  --  had they been exchangedin a Roman barracks  --  would have demanded an immediateblood atonement . At one booth , where he stopped to witness an almost incredible scene involving the disputed price of a lamb kidney , Marcellus was a bit surprised to find , close beside him , the boy he had seen at Benyosef 's shop . Having had more than enough of the market-place , he decided to return to his inn . It was a long tramp . Turning about , at the top of the steps leading to the entrance , Marcellus looked down toward the city . The boy from Benyosef 's was sauntering down the street . It was more amusing than annoying to have been followed . On second thought  --  these people were quite within their rights to investigatehim as far as they could . Perhaps they wanted to knowp215at what manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Insula , they would have had nothing further to do with him . That evening , as he sat in the walled garden of the inn , after supper , studying the ancient scroll that Benjamin had given him , Marcellus glanced up to find Stephanos standing before him . May I speak with you privately ? ' asked Stephanos , in Greek . They walked to the far end of the garden , and Marcellus signed to him to sit down . You were surprised not to find Demetrius , ' began Stephanos . About a fortnight after he wrote to you , he had the misfortune to be recognized on the street by the Tribune with whom he had had trouble in Athens . No effort was made to apprehend him , but he believed that the Tribune might seek revenge . In that case his friends at Benyosef 's shop might be involved  --  and we are in no position to defend ourselves . ' Where did he go , Stephanos ? ' asked Marcellus , deeply concerned . I do not know , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up and talked nearly all through the night . Several of our men were in a secret meeting at Benyosef 's shop . We joined them an hour before dawn . Demetrius , having bade us farewell , slipped away before the sun rose . He will return when it is safe ; when the Tribune has left . You may leave a letter for him with me , if you like , or send it later in my care  --  should you find a messenger who can be trusted . He confided to me that you were coming and asked me to explain his absence . None of the others were told . ' Stephanos lowered his voice , and continued , Demetrius also confided your reasons for wanting to visit Galilee . ' Just how much did he tell you ? ' Marcellus studied the Greek 's face . Everything , ' replied Stephanos , soberly . You see , sir , he wanted to make sure that Justus would go along with you . He felt that I might be of some service in arranging this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in Jesus  --  with much hesitation , and many mysterious gaps in the story  --  I urged him to make a clean breast of the whole business ; and he did . You can trust me to keep your secret . ' Marcellus had no rejoinder ready to meet this startling announcement . For a time he sat quietly deliberating . Are they suspicious of me , at Benyosef 's shop ? ' he asked , at length . I was followed , this afternoon . ' Young Philip is my nephew , sir , ' explained Stephanos . I needed to know where you were lodging . You need have no anxiety about Philip . He will not talk . No one at the shop will learn of our meeting . I feared , for a moment , this morning , that John might recognize you , but apparently he did not . He is a dreamy fellow . ' How could he have recognized me ? ' asked Marcellus . John was at the crucifixion , sir . Perhaps you may recall the young man who tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ? How dreadful ! ' Marcellus bowed his head and dug his finger-tips into his temples . It was , indeed , sir , ' muttered Stephanos . I was there . I recognized you instantly when you came into the shop , though of course I was expecting you . I think you may feel sure that John did not remember . ' You have been very kind , Stephanos . Is there any way in which I can serve you ? ' Yes , sir . ' The Greek lowered his voice to a whisper . Have you the Robe ? ' Marcellus nodded . May I see it ? ' asked Stephanos . Yes , ' said Marcellus . Come with me . ' They had been on the road for three days now , and the name of Jesus had not been mentioned . For all his apparent ingenuousness , Justus was surprisingly profound . His ready smile promised a childish capitulation to your wishes . His deference to your rating as a well-to-do young Roman was graciously tendered . But your negligent prediction that Justus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be incorrect . You were learning that there were a few things which not even a wealthy , well-dressed Roman could acquire either by cajolery , command , or purchase ; and one of these things was the story of Jesus . It had never occurred to Marcellus that an occasion could arise when his Roman citizenship might be an inconvenience . If you were a Roman and had plenty of money , you could have what you wanted , anywhere in the world . Doors and gates were swung open , bars and bridges were let down , tables were set up , aliens climbed out of public vehicles to give you their seats , merchants made everybody else stand aside while they attended to your caprices . If you arrived late at the wharf , the boat waited . If there was only one commodious cabin , the rich Jew surrendered it without debate . When you said Come , people came ; when you said Go , they went . But if you had journeyed on foot into the impoverished little provinces north of Jerusalem , ostensibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain penniless carpenterp217who had moved about in that region , your Roman citizenship was a nuisance and your money was of no aid . The project  --  as Marcellus had originally conceived it  --  had presented no problems . Barsabas Justus , full of zeal for his new cause , would be bubbling with information about his hero . Perhaps he might even have designs on you as a possible convert . He would be eager to introduce you to the country people who had often met this strange Galilean face to face . You would be shown into their homes to see the outgivings of their household looms and , before you had a chance to sit down , they would be reciting stories of enchanted words and baffling deeds . Well  --  it had n't come out that way . True , the country people had welcomed you at their little wayside inns , had greeted you respectfullyon the highway , had shown you their fabrics , had politely answered your random questions about their handicrafts ; but they had had nothing to say about this Jesus . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had often been a stranger in strange places , had never felt quite so lonesome before . They all shared a secret ; but not with you . Justus would present you to a household and tell them why you had come and they would make haste to bring out the best specimens of their weaving . And presently , the father of the family and Justus would exchange a covert glance of mutual understanding and quietly drift out of the room . After a while , your hostess would excuse herself , leaving you with auntie and the children ; and you knew that she had slipped away to join her husband and Justus . The very air of this country was full of mystery . For instance , there was this fish-emblem ; figure of a fish , freshly cut into the bark of a sycamore , scrawled with a stick into the sand by the roadside , chalked on a stone fence , scratched into a bare table at a village inn . Demetrius had said it was the accepted token of the new movement to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marcellus , hoping to make Justus talk , had asked casually : What 's all this  --  about fish ? ' And Justus had replied : That 's what we live on  --  up here  --  fish . ' Marcellus had been miffed a little by this evasion . He resolved to ask no more questions . Marcellus , lounging against the fig tree , studied the tanned face of old Justus , and wondered what he was thinking about ; won- dered , too , how long he was likely to lie there gazing wide-eyed at the sky . Justus gave no sign that he was aware of his client 's restlessness . After a while , Marcellus came slowly to his feet and sauntered over toward the pack-asses which the cloddish young driver  --  sound asleep under a tree  --  had staked out to graze . Noticing with indignation that the lead donkey 's bridle was buckled so short that the unhappy creature 's mouth had been torn by the bit and was bleeding , he tugged the torturing harness off over the long ears ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps by punching new holes with the point of his dagger . It was not an easy task , for the leather was old and stiff ; and before he had put the bridle together again , the donkey-boy had roused and was watching him with dull curiosity . Come here , stupid one ! ' barked Marcellus . I shall not tolerate any cruelty to these beasts . ' He reached into his wallet and drew out a copper coin . Go you to that house  --  or the next  --  or the next  --  and get some ointment  --  and do n't come back here without it ! ' After the dolt had set off , shambling down the road , Marcellus rose , carelessly patted the old donkey on the nose , and returned to find Justus sitting up , smilingly interested . You like animals , ' he observed , cordially . Yes , ' said Marcellus  --  ' some animals . I ca n't say that I am particularlyfond of donkeys ; but it irritates me when I see them mistreated . We will have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marcellus sat down beside him , aware that his guide was studying him with the air of having made a new acquaintance . Do you like flowers ? ' asked Justus , irrelevantly , after a lengthy , candid , and somewhat embarrassing inspection . Of course , ' drawled Marcellus . Why not ? ' This country is full of wild flowers . It 's the season for them . Later , it is very dry , and they wither . They are especially abundant this year . ' Justus made a slow , sweeping gesture that covered the sloping hillside . Look , sir , what a wide variety . ' Marcellus followed the tanned finger as the gentle voice identified the blossoms with what seemed like confident knowledge ; pink mustard , yellow mustard , blue borage , white sage , rayed umbel , plantain , bugle-weed , marigold , and three species of poppies . You must be an ardent lover of nature , Justus , ' commented Marcellus . Only in the last couple of years , sir . I used to pass the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I recognized the useful plants ; flax and wheat , oats and barley and clover ; but I never thought much about flowers until I made the close acquaintance of a man who knew all about them . ' Justus had again stretched out on the grass , and his tone had become so dreamily reminiscent that Marcellus , listening with suspendedbreath , wondered if  --  at last  --  the soft-voiced Galilean might be about to speak of his lost friend . He knew all about flowers , ' reiterated Justus , with a little shake of his head , as if the recollection were inexpressibly precious . Marcellusthought of asking whether his friend had died or left the country , seeing that Justus ' reference to him sounded as if it belonged to the past ; but decided not to be too intrusive with his questions . You would have thought , ' Justus was saying , half to himself , that the flowers were friends of his , the way he talked about them . One day he bade some of us , who were walking with him , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See how richly they are clad ! " he said . " They do no work . They do not spin . Yet even King Solomon did not have such raiment . " ' A lover of beauty , ' commented Marcellus . But probably not a very practical fellow . Did he not believe in labor ? ' Oh , yes  --  he believed that people should be industrious , ' Justus had been quick to declare , but he held that most of them spent too much time and thought on their bodies ; on clothing  --  and food  --  and hoarding  --  and bigger barns  --  and the accumulation of things . ' Sounds as if he was n't very thrifty . ' Marcellus grinned as he said it , so it would n't seem a contemptuous criticism ; but Justus , staring at the sky , did not see the smile , and the comment brought a frown . He was not indolent , ' said Justus , firmly . He could have had things , if he 'd wanted them . He was a carpenter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure to see him handle keenedgedtools . When he mortised timbers they looked as if they had grown that way . There was always a fair-sized crowd about the shop , watching him work ; children all over the place . He had a way with children  --  and animals  --  and birds . ' Justus laughed softly , and exhaled a nostalgic sigh . Yes  --  he had a way with him . When he would leave the shop to go home , there was always a lot of children along  --  and dogs . Everything belonged to him ; but he never owned anything . He often said that he pitied people who toiled and schemed and worried and cheated to possess a lot of things ; and then had to stand guard over them to see that they were n't stolen or destroyed by moths and rust . ' 1 Must have been an eccentric person , ' mused Marcellus , not to want anything for his own . ' But he never thought he was poor ! ' Justus raised up on one elbow , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people can afford that , you know . ' What an odd thing to say ! ' Marcellus had stared into Justus ' eyes , until the older man grinned a little . Not so odd , when you stop to think about it . A talent for truth is real property . If a man loves truth better than things , people like to be around where he is . Almost everybody wishes he could be honest , but you ca n't have the spirit of truth when your heart is set on dickering for things . That 's why people hung about this carpenterand listened to everything he said : he had the spirit of truth . Nobody had to be on guard with him ; did n't have to pretend ; did n't have to lie . It made them happy and free as little children . ' Did everybody respond to him  --  that way ? ' asked Marcellus , seriously . Almost everybody , ' nodded Justus . Oh  --  sometimes people who did n't know him tried to deceive him about themselves , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but , you see , sir , he was so perfected in the truth that you could n't lie to him , or pretend to be what you were n't . It simply could n't be done , sir ; either by word , tone , or manner ! And as soon as people found that out , they dropped their weapons and defenses , and began to speak the truth , themselves ! It was a new experience for some of them , and it gave them a sensation of freedom . That 's why they liked him , sir . They could n't lie to him , and so they told the truth  --  and  --  the truth set them free ! ' That 's a new thought ! ' declared Marcellus . Your friend musthave been a philosopher , Justus . Was he a student of the classics ? ' Justus was briefly puzzled , and presently shook his head . I do not think so , ' he replied . He just  --  knew ! ' I do n't suppose he had very many admirers among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of property . ' You would have been surprised , sir ! ' declared Justus . Plenty of rich men listened . I recall , one time a wealthy young nobleman followed him about for a whole afternoon ; and before he left he came up closer and said , " How can I get that  --  what you have ? " ' Justus paused so long and the look in his eyes grew so remote that Marcellus wondered whether he had drifted off to thinking about something else . And then  --  what did your carpenter say ? ?  |p221Told  him he was too heavily weighted with things , ' replied Justus . " Give your things away , " he said , " and come along with me . " ' Did he ? ' ' No  --  but he said he wished he could . He went away quite depressed , and we were all sorry , for he was indeed a fine young fellow . ' Justus shook his head , and smiled pensively . I suppose that was the first time he had ever really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenter must have been a very unusual man , ' remarked Marcellus . He appears to have had the mind of a dreamer , a poet , an artist . Did he draw , perhaps  --  or carve ? ' Jews do not draw  --  or carve . ' Indeed ? How then do they express themselves ? ' They sing , ' replied Justus  --  ' and tell stories . ' What manner of stories ? ' ' Oh  --  the legends of our people , mostly ; the deeds of our great ones . Even the little children can recite the traditions and the prophecies . ' Justus smiled benevolently , and seemed about to confidean incident . I have a grandson , sir . His name is Jonathan . We called him Jonathan because he was born with a crooked foot , like Jonathan of old  --  the son of King Saul . Our Jonathan is seven . You should hear him tell the story of the Creation , and the Great Flood , and the Exodus . ' The Exodus ? ' Marcellus searched his memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerant but surprised . I know what the word means , ' said Marcellus , defensively . ' Exodusis a going-away , or a road out ; but I do not recall a story about it . ' I thought everyone knew the history of our people 's escape from bondage in Egypt , ' said Justus . Oh  --  that ! ' recalled Marcellus . I did n't know that was an escape . Our history teachers insist that the Jews were expelled from Egypt . ' . That , ' declared Justus , indignantly , is a vicious untruth ! The Pharaoh tried to keep our fathers there  --  in slavery  --  to till their soil and build their monuments . ' ' Well  --  no matter , ' drawled Marcellus . There 's nothing we can do about it now . I 'll accept your version of the story , if you want to tell me . ' Little Jonathan will recite it for you when we visit Sepphoris . He is a bright boy . ' Justus ' sudden anger had cooled . It is easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes  --  little Jonathan is all we have . My wife entered into her rest many years ago . My daughter Rebecca is a widow . Jonathan is a great comfort to us . Perhaps you know how it is , sir , in a home where a child is sick or crippled . He gets a little more care ; a Little more love , maybe , to make up for it . Jonathan still gets it , . though he is all well now . ' Well ? ' queried Marcellus . His foot  --  you mean ? ' Justus nodded slowly , turning his face away . ' Is that not unusual ? ' persisted Marcellus . The crow's-feet on Justus ' temple deepened and his face was sober as he nodded again without looking up . It was plain now that he did not wish to be questioned further . Presently he tugged himself loose from his meditative mood , returned with a smile , stretched his long , bronzed arms , and rose to his feet . ' It is time we moved on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach Sychar by sunset . The town does not have a good inn . We will make camp this side , near Jacob 's well . Ever hear of Jacob , sir ? ' He grinned , good-humoredly . ' I believe not , Justus , ' confessed Marcellus . ' Is it such a good well ? ' ' No better than plenty of other wells , but a landmark ; fifteen centuries old . ' They were on the highway again . The lout with the browsing donkeys had dragged his stubborn caravan out of the weeds . Justus turned about ; and , shielding his eyes with his cupped hands , gazed intently down the road over which they had come . Marcellus ' curiosity was rekindled . It was not the first time that Justus had stopped to look backward . And whenever they had come to a crossing , he had paused to look carefully in all directions . He did not seem to be apprehensive of danger . It was rather as if he had made an appointment to meet someone up here . Marcellus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but discreetly decided it was none of his business . For more than three hours they plodded along the dusty highway , not meeting many travelers , not making much conversation . It was late afternoon . A half-mile ahead , a cluster of sycamores was sighted and a few scattered dwellings . ' There are the outskirts of Sychar , ' said Justus , lengthening his stride . In a little while they reached the little suburb , a sleepy , shabby community of whitewashed , flat-roofed houses . In its center , by the roadside , was the historic well . Two women were walking away with water-jars on their shoulders . A third was arriving . Justus ' steps lagged to give her time to draw up the huge bucket and fill her jar . She glanced apathetically in their direction , put dowup223her jar , stared ; and then proceeded vigorously with her task . Hurriedlyfilling the jar , and spilling much water about her feet , she shouldered her burden and made off toward one of the small houses . Have we alarmed her ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked so fierce . ' She is not frightened , ' said Justus soberly . It was a large well . The ancient stonework around it was of the height of a sheep , and broad enough to be sat upon comfortably . Justus , who had suddenly become preoccupied , sank wearily onto the ledge with his back toward the small group of dwellings . After standing about for some moments , wondering how long they were to linger here , Marcellus sat down on the opposite side to wait until Justus was ready to move on . His eyes idly followed the rapidly retreating figure of the woman until she entered one of the houses . Almost immediately she reappeared without her water-jar and ran across the highway to a neighbor ; entered , and came out in a moment accompanied by another younger and more attractive woman . They stood for a while looking toward the well ; then advanced slowly , stopping frequently to parley , their faces full of perplexity . That woman is coming back , Justus , and bringing another along , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused with a little jerk and turned his head . Then he rose and walked toward the woman who came quickly to meet him . They held a brief , low-voiced conversation , Justus solemnly shaking his head . The younger woman , her eyes  --  very pretty eyes , too  --  wide with curiosity , continued to press her queries , and Justus shook his head , as if saying , No  --  no  --  no . Finally he tipped his head slightly in Marcellus ' direction , and the woman 's eyes instantaneouslyfollowed the gesture . Justus was cautioning them not to pursue the matter , whatever it was . Then the older woman left them and began slowly retracing her steps toward her house ; and Justus , frowning heavily and nodding what seemed to be a reluctant consent , turned back toward the well . Yes  --  he would try to talk with her again , his manner plainly said . He would talk with her again , as soon as he could do so without arousing the curiosity of this Roman . After Justus had unpacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of rangy sycamores , he had mumbled something about having to go back to the village for bread , though Marcellus knew they had enough for their supper and suspected that his more urgent errand was to talk with that woman again ; for his manner had made it plain that he wished to go alone.  | Wearied by the long day 's tramp and annoyed by his guide 's secretiveness , he flung himself down on the rug that Justus had spread in front of the tent and moodily watched the sun going down over the tree-tops and house-roofs of the village . Why did Justus want to have a private interview with this woman ? What did they have to talk about ? Something quite serious , apparently . Perhaps they would discuss this mystery . But why should there be a mystery ? The Galilean was dead . Who was going to persecute these people for what the carpenter had said or done ; or for their tender remembrance of him ? Marcellus was offended . Surely Justus had no reason to think that he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no occasion for this fellow to treat him as if he were an ordinary eavesdropper ! Well  --  if Justus did not trust him , it was conceivable that he might secretly go through his belongings , looking for some evidence . If he did so  --  he would get a stunning surprise ! There was one article of Galilean homespun , at the bottom of his gunny-bag , that Justus must not see ! IT WAS well on toward sunset when they sighted Cana , after a fatiguing tramp from the village of Nain where Justus ' insistence on observing the Sabbath had kept them off the road for a day  --  one of the most tedious and profitless days that Marcellus had ever experienced . Justus had gone to the little synagogue in the morning . Had he been invited , Marcellus would have accompanied him , so hard up was he for diversion in an unkempt town where there was nothing of interest to see or do . But Justus had set off alone , after assuring Marcellus that there were ample provisions for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an interminable afternoon , Marcellus , lounging on the ground in front of the tent , observedJustus returning in the company of an elderly woman and a tall , sober-faced young man . They walked slowly , preoccupied with serious conversation . When within a stadium of the camp , they came to a stop and continued their earnest talk for a long time.  |p225Then  the woman and the young man who , Marcellus surmised , might have been her son , reluctantly turned back toward the village , arm in arm , while Justus came on wearing a studious frown . Marcellus knew it was childish to feel any resentment over the quite obvious disinclination of Justus to acquaint him with his local friends . When there was trading in prospect , Justus was promptly polite with his introductions , but he was making it plain that their relationship was strictly on a business basis . It was n't that Marcellus had any considerable interest in meeting this gray-haired woman , or the thoughtful young man on whose arm she leaned affectionately ; but he could n't help feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all fairness to Justus , he reflected , the fellow had contracted only to take him into householdswhere homespun might be purchased . He had not promised to introduce the young Roman merchant as his friend . Nor could Justus be expected to know  --  nor might he be permitted to suspect  --  that his patron had no interest whatsoever in this merchandising , but wanted only to meet and talk with persons who had known Jesus . Returning to the tent , with an absent nod toward his idle client , Justus had sat silently staring at the distant hills . Occasionally Marcellusstole a glance in his direction , but he was completely oblivious . It could not be divined whether this retreat into silence was of a piece with Sabbath observance or whether some new reason accounted for his taciturnity . Early the next morning , Justus had been suddenly animated with a desire to be on the highway . Breakfast was dispatched at top speed . The pack-asses and their socially inferior custodian were advised that there would be no nonsense on this day 's journey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little caravan with long , swinging strides . Marcellus was mightily relieved when , at high noon , Justus turned off the road and pointed to a near-by clump of olives . Shall we rest now , and eat ? ' he inquired . By all means ! ' panted Marcellus , mopping his brow . Is this Cana such an interesting city , then , that we must walk our legs off to get there today ? ' I am sorry to have pressed you , ' said Justus . I did not explain because I wanted to give you a pleasant surprise at the end of the day . There is a young woman in Cana who sings every evening in the park . ' Indeed ! ' muttered Marcellus , wearily . Well  --  she 'd better be good ! '  | She is good . ' Justus began unpacking their lunch . The people of Cana have their supper early ; and afterward a great many of them  --  both young and old  --  assemble about the fountain where this crippled girl sings the songs that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on her cot , and the people sit down and listen until dark . ' Extraordinary ! ' commented Marcellus , rubbing his lame muscles . You say she 's a cripple ? I shall want to meet her . At the rate we 're traveling , by the end of the day she and I may have a common cause . ' Justus acknowledged the raillery with a grin , broke a wheaten loaf , gave half of it to Marcellus , and seated himself on the grass . Miriam is a beautiful young woman , ' he went on , munching his bread hungrily . She is about twenty-two now . Some seven years ago she was suddenly stricken with paralysis . That would have been a great misfortune in any case , but for Miriam it was a calamity . She had been very active in games , and a leader in the children 's sports . Now she was unable to walk . Moreover , she added to her unhappiness by resenting her affliction , spending her days in such pitiful lamentations that her parents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I take it that you knew them well , ' contributed Marcellus , mildly interested . Not at that time , ' admitted Justus , but the day came when that part of Miriam 's story was quite widely discussed . For all of three years she lay on her bed , inconsolable , peevish , so embittered by her trouble that she rejected all the kindly efforts made to divert her mind . As time passed , she refused to admit her friends into her room ; and sat alone , sullen and smouldering with rebellion . ' And now she sings ? What happened ? ' Now she sings , ' nodded Justus ; adding , after a meditative moment : I do not know the particulars , sir . I am not sure that anyonedoes . Miriam refuses to discuss it . Her parents profess not to know . When people have inquired of them , they have replied , " Ask Miriam . " ' Perhaps they are telling the truth when they say they do not know . ' Marcellus was becoming concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement in their daughter 's disposition . ' Justus had nodded a few times , without comment . Maybe Miriam herself does n't know , ' speculated Marcellus , hopefulthat the story had not come to an end . Maybe Miriam found that she had finally exhausted her resentment  --  and might as wellp227make the best of it . ' He paused to give Justus a chance to contradictthis inexpert opinion ; and , meeting no rejoinder , ventured another guess . Maybe she woke up one morning and said to herself , " I 've been making everybody miserable . I 'm going to pretend that I 'm happy . I 'll be cheerful  --  and sing ! " Maybe she just reached that decision , after proving that the other course was futile . ' Maybe , ' murmured Justus , remotely . But you do n't think so , ' declared Marcellus , after a long interval of silence . I do n't know . ' Justus shook his head decisively . One of her girl friends , whom she had n't seen for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded with Miriam to attend the wedding , but she would not go ; and all that day she wept bitterly . But  --  that evening  --  when her parents returned from the wedding-feast  --  shemet them with gladness ; and sang ! ' Amazing ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . And has she a voice  --  really ? ' You may decide that for yourself , sir , when you hear her , ' said Justus . And you may meet her in her home tomorrow . Naomi , her mother , does beautiful weaving . I shall take you there . She may have some things that might interest you . If you are rested now , sir , shall we be on our way ? ' They pitched their tent at the edge of little Cana , ate their supper quickly , and walked to the center of the village , overtaking many people headed in the same direction . Already fifty or more were seated on the ground in semicircular rows facing a natural fountain that gently welled up into the huge brick basin . I suppose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they moved toward an unoccupied spot on the lawn . It is warm water , ' said Justus . Hot springs abound in this region . ' They seated themselves cross-legged on the ground . Is it thought to be a healing water ? ' asked Marcellus . ' Yes  --  but not by the people of Galilee . Travelers come from afar to bathe in the water from these springs . ' Oh ? Then Cana sees many strangers . ' Not so many in Cana . They go mostly to Tiberias , on the Lake Gennesaret . It is a more important city , and possesses much wealth . It is only the rich who come to bathe in medicinal waters . ' And why is that ? ' inquired Marcellus . Do not the poor believe in the virtue of these hot springs ? ' Justus laughed . It was a deep , spontaneous laugh that he seemed to enjoy ; an infectious laugh that evoked companionable chuckles in their vicinity , where many men and women had recognized the big , gentle-voiced neighbor from Sepphoris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was naturallyfull of fun . You would n't have suspected it . He had been so serious ; so weighted . The poor do not have the diseases , sir , that these springs are supposedto cure , ' explained Justus . Only men accustomed to rich foods and an abundance of fine wines seek these healing waters . The Galileans do not suffer of ills arising from such causes . ' It was delicious irony , because so free of any bitterness . Marcellus admired the tone of the appreciative laughter that came from their candidly eavesdropping neighbors . His heart warmed toward them . He was going to feel at home with them . That 's a new thought , Justus , ' he replied , and a sound one . I never considered it before , but it is a fact that hot springs are intended for gluttons and winebibbers . Now that you speak of it , I recall having heard something about this city of Tiberias on Lake Gennesaret . ' Often called the Sea of Galilee , ' nodded Justus , but not by the Galileans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tilting its head at a favorable angle , frankly interested . Big lake ? ' wondered Marcellus . Big enough to be stormy . They have some rough gales : Any fishing ? ' Justus nodded indifferently , and a middle-aged man sitting in front of them turned his head , plainly wanting to say something . Marcellus caught his dancing eye , and raised his brows encouragingly . That 's one of the diseases that poor people can afford , sir , ' remarkedthe man , fishing ! ' Everybody laughed merrily at that . Do they catch them ? ' inquired Marcellus . Yes , ' drawled Justus , they have caught them  --  all of them  --  a long time ago . ' This sally was good , too ; and the friendly hilarity increased the circle of listeners . Marcellus felt that they were showingquite an amiable attitude toward him ; perhaps because he was sponsored by Justus who , it seemed , everyone knew ; and , besides , Marcellus was doing fairly well with his Aramaic . But they still fish ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , from up the row a little way . Once they caught a great lot of them ! ' shouted the lad . Sh-sh ! '  --  came a soft , concerted caution from his kin . All eyes were now turning toward the fountain where a cot wasp229being borne in from the street . The girl was sitting up , propped about with pillows . In her bare , shapely arms she hugged a small harp . The sculptor in Marcellus instantly responded . It was a finely modeled , oval face , white with a pallor denoting much pain endured ; but the wide-set , long-lashed eyes had not been hurt . Her abundant hair , parted in the middle , framed an intelligent brow . Her full lips were almost gay , as they surveyed the crowd . Two men followed , carrying wooden trestles , and the cot was lifted up until everyone could see . A deep hush fell upon the people . Marcellus was much impressed by the unusual scene , and found himself wishing that the girl would n't try to sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Miriam gently swept the strings of her harp with slim , white fingers . Then her face seemed to be transfigured . Its momentary gaiety had faded , and there had come an expression of deep yearning . It was clear that she had left them now , and was putting out on an enchanted excursion . The luminous eyes looked upward , wide with far vision . Again she lightly touched the harp-strings . The voice was a surprisingly deep , resonant contralto . That first tone , barely audible at its beginning , swelled steadily until it began to take on the pulsing vibration of a bell . Marcellus felt a quick tightening of his throat , a sudden suffusion of emotion that burned and dimmed his eyes . Now the song took wings ! I waited patiently for the Lord  --  and He inclined unto me  --  and heard my cry . ' All around Marcellus heads were bent to meet upraised hands ; and stifled sobs , with childish little catches of breath in them , were straining to be quiet . As for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shook them out of his eyes  --  and stared ! And He hath put a new song in my mouth ! ' exulted Miriam . Justus slowly turned his head toward Marcellus . His seamed face was contorted and his eyes were swimming . Marcellus touched his sleeve and nodded soberly . Their gaze returned to the enraptured girl . Then I said , To  --  I come . " In the volume of the Book it is written of me , " I delight to do Thy will , 0 God  --  and Thy law is in my heart ! " ' The song was ended and the close-packed crowd drew a deep sigh . Neighbors slowly turned their faces toward their best beloved , smiled wistfully with half-closed eyes , and shook their heads , . lacking words to tell how deeply they had been moved . After an interval Miriam found her wings again . Marcellus reached for occasional phrases of her triumphant song , while rushing about in his heart to reacquaint himself with instinctive longings of his own . It was coming to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the sky . To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , ' sang Miriam , and to guide our feet in the way of peace . ' Twilight was falling . The men bore Miriam away . The crowd silently scattered and took to the highway . It pleased Marcellus that Justus , trudging by his side in the darkness , did not ask him if he had liked Miriam 's voice , or whether he had not been impressed by the unusual occasion . The home of Reuben and Naomi , at the northern extremity of the village , was more commodious and occupied a larger parcel of ground than most of the residences in Cana . The white-walled house , well back from the road , was shaded by tall sycamores . In the spacious front yard were many fruit trees , now gay and fragrant with blossoms ; and on either side of this area there was an apparentlyprosperous vineyard . It was with some difficulty that Marcellus had curbed his impatience to visit this home where he hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden voice . Justus had seemed willfullytedious at the two places where they had called on their way ; and had it not been imprudent , Marcellus would have dispatched these small transactions by purchasing whatever was offered . Let us first speak to Miriam , ' said Justus , unlatching the gate . I see her sitting in the arbor . ' They crossed the neatly clipped grass-plot and sauntered toward the shaded arbor where Miriam sat alone . She wore a white himationtrimmed with coral at the throat and flowing sleeves , but no jewelry except a slim silver chain about her neck with a tiny pendant  --  a fish  --  carved from a seashell . On the table beside her cot was the harp and a small case of scrolls . Her curly head was bent attentively over the lace medallion she was knitting . As they approached , she glanced up , recognizing Justus , and smiled a welcome . Oh  --  you need n't explain , Barsabas Justus , ' she said when , after presenting Marcellus , he had added that the young man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' She smiled into Marcellus ' eyes . We are all excited , sir , over your visit ; for it is n't often that anyone comes here to trade . '  |p231There  was a peculiar tone-quality in her low voice that Marcellus could not define , except that its warmth was entirely unselfconsciousand sincere . Frequently he had observed , upon being introduced to young women , that they had a tendency to soar off into an impetuous animation , pitching their blithe remarks in a shrill key as if from a considerable distance . Miriam 's voice was as unaffectedand undefended as her smile . Naomi is at home ? ' asked Justus . In the house . Will you find her ? I think she and Father are expectingyou . ' Justus turned away , and Marcellus was uncertain whether to follow . Miriam helped him to a gratifying decision by pointing to a chair . I heard you sing , ' he said . It was the most  --  ' He paused to grope for an appropriate word . How do you happen to speak Aramaic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , ' said Marcellus . ' However '  --  he went on more confidently  --  ' even your own countrymen might find it difficult to describe your singing . I was deeply moved by it . ' I am glad you wanted to tell me that . ' Miriam pushed aside the pillow on which the lace medallion had been pinned , and faced him with candid eyes . I wondered a little what you might think . I saw you there with Justus . I had never sung for a Roman . It would not have surprised me if you had been amused ; but would have hurt me . ' I 'm afraid we have a bad reputation in these provinces , ' sighed Marcellus . Of course , ' said Miriam . The only Romans we see in Cana are legionaries , marching down the street , so haughtily , so defiantly '  --  She straightened and swaggered her pretty shoulders , accenting her militant pantomime with little jerks of her head  --  ' as if they were saying  --  ' She paused and added , apologetically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know what we always seem to say when we strut , ' assistedMarcellus . He protruded his lips with an exaggerated show of arrogance , and carried on with Miriam 's march  --  ' " Here  --  we come  --  your  --  lords  --  and  --  mas  --  tersl " ' They both laughed a little , and Miriam resumed her needlework . Bending over it attentively , she inquired : Are there many Romans like you , Marcellus Gallio ? , ' Multitudes ! I make no claim to any sort of uniqueness . ' I never talked with a Roman before , ' said Miriam . But I supposedthey were all alike . They look alike :  | In their uniforms , yes ; but under their spiked helmets and shields , they are ordinary creatures with no relish for tramping the streets of foreign cities . They would much prefer to be at home with their families , hoeing in their gardens and tending their goats . ' I am glad to know that , ' said Miriam . It is so unpleasant to dislikepeople  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I shall say that great numbers of them wish they were at home with their gardens and goats ; and I shall hope , ' she went on , with a slow smile , that their desire may be fulfilled . Do you have a garden , sir ? ' ' Yes  --  we have a garden : But no goats , I think . ' There is no room for them . We live in the city : Do you have horses ? ' Yes : In Galilee , ' drawled Miriam , horses require more room than goats . Would you like to tell me about your home ? ' Gladly . Our family consists of our parents and my sister Lucia and myself . ' Does your father take care of the garden while you are abroad ? ' ' Well  --  not personally  --  no , ' replied Marcellus , after a little hesitation ; and when she glanced up from under her long lashes with an elder-sisterly grin , he asked , Are you having a good time ? ' She nodded companionably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , and a maidservant too , no doubt . ' Yes , ' assented Marcellus , casually . Are they  --  slaves ? ' asked Miriam , in a tone that hoped not to give offense . Yes , ' admitted Marcellus , uncomfortably , but I can assure you they are not mistreated . ' I believe that , ' she said , softly . You could n't be cruel to anyone . How many slaves have you ? ' I never counted them . A dozen , perhaps . No  --  there must be more than that . Twenty  --  maybe . ' It must seem odd to own other human beings , ' reflected Miriam . Do you keep them locked up , when they 're not working ? ' By no means ! ' Marcellus dismissed the query with a toss of his hand . They are free to go anywhere they please . ' Indeed ! ! ! ' exclaimed Miriam . Do n't they ever run away ? ' Not often . There 's no place for them to go . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be better off in chains ; would n't they ? Then maybe they could break loose . As it is , the whole world is their prison . '  |p233I  never thought about it before , ' pondered Marcellus . But I suppose the whole world is a prison for everyone . Is anybody entirelyfree ? What constitutes freedom ? ' The truth ! ' answered Miriam , quickly . The truth sets anyone free ! If it were n't so , I might feel quite fettered myself , Marcellus Gallio . My country is owned by a foreign master . And , because of my lameness , I may seem to have very little liberty ; but my spirit is free ! ' You are fortunate , ' said Marcellus . I should give a great deal to experience a liberty independent of all physical conditions . Did you work out that philosophy for yourself ? Was it a product of your illness , perhaps ? ' No , no ! ' She shook her head decisively . My illness made a wretched slave of me . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Marcellus kept silent , when she paused . Perhaps she would explain . Suddenly her face lighted , and she turned toward him with an altered mood . Please forgive me for being inquisitive about you , ' she said . I sit here all day with nothing new happening . It is refreshing to talk with someone from the outside world . Tell me about your sister Lucia . Is she younger than you ? ' Much : Younger than I ? ' Six years younger , ' ventured Marcellus , smiling into her suddenlywidened eyes . Who told you my age ? ' Justus : How did he happen to do that ? ' He was telling me , before we arrived in Cana , about your singing . He said that you never knew you could sing until  --  one day  --  you found that you had a voice  --  and sang . Justus said it came all unexpectedly . How do you account for it  --  if it is n't a secret ? ' It is a secret , ' she said , softly . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi , first , with her arms full of robes and shawls , followed by Justus and Reuben . Marcellus came to his feet and was introduced . Reuben rather diffidently took the hand that Marcellus offered him . Naomi , apparently pleased by their guest 's attitude , smiled cordially . It was easy to see the close resemblance of mother and daughter . Naomi had the same dimples in her cheeks . We have always gone to Jerusalem to attend the Passover at this season , ' she said , spreading out her wares across the back of a chair . This year we shall not go . That is why I happen to have so many things on hand. 4 Marcellus assumed his best business manner . Taking up a brown robe , he examined it with professional interest . This , ' he said , expertly , is typically Galilean . A seamless robe . And excellent workmanship . Evidently you have had much practice in weaving this garment . ' Naomi 's gratified expression encouraged him to speak freely . He felt he was making a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could risk an elaboration of his knowledge , particularly for Justus ' information . A weaver of my acquaintance in Athens , ' he went on , told me something about this robe . He was formerly of Samaria , I believe , and was quite familiar with Galilean products . ' He glanced toward Justus , and met an inquisitive stare , as if he were searching his memory for some related fact . Now his eyes lighted a little . There was a young Greek working for Benyosef , a short time ago , ' remarked Justus . I heard him say he had been with a weaver in Athens named Benjamin , from whom he had learned to speak Aramaic . Might this have been the same weaver ? ' Why  --  yes ! ' Marcellus tried to enjoy the coincidence . Benjamin is well respected in Athens . He is a good scholar , too . ' He chuckled a little . Benjamin quite insists on speaking Aramaic with anyone whom he suspects of knowing the language . ' He must have found you pleasant company , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use many terms which are colloquial with the Samaritans . ' Indeed ! ' said Marcellus , taking up a shawl , and returning his attention to Naomi . This is excellent wool , ' he assured her . Is it grown here in Galilee ? ' In our own madbra , ' replied Reuben , proudly . Madbra ? ' repeated Marcellus . In the desert ? ' Justus laughed . See , Reuben ? ' he exclaimed . When the Samaritans say " madbra , " they mean barren land . ' He turned to Marcellus . When we say " madbra , " we mean pasture . " Kara " is our word for desert . ' Thanks , Justus , ' said Marcellus . I 'm learning something . ' He dismissed this small episode by concentrating on the shawl . It is beautifully dyed , ' he said . With our own mulberries , ' boasted Naomi . Had I known you were acquainted with Benjamin , ' persisted Justus , I should have told you about this young Greek , Demetrius ; a most thoughtful fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in some trouble  --  and was a fugitive . ' Marcellus politely raised his brows , but made it clear enough , by his manner , that they had other things to talk about.  |p235I  shall want the shawl , ' he said , and this robe . Now  --  let us see what else . ' He began fumbling with the garments , hoping he had not seemed abrupt in disregarding the comments about Demetrius . Presently Justus sauntered away toward the vineyard , and Reuben followed him . Why do n't you show Marcellus Gallio those pretty bandeaus , Mother ? ' suggested Miriam . ' Oh  --  they 're nothing , ' said Naomi . He would n't bother with them . ' May I see them ? ' asked Marcellus . Naomi obligingly moved away , and Marcellus continued to inspect the textiles with exaggerated concern . Marcellus : Miriam 's tone was confidential . He glanced up and met her level eyes inquiringly . Why did you lie to Justus ? ' she insisted , just above a whisper . Lie to him ? ' parried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to talk about him . Perhaps you know him . Tell me , Marcellus . What are you ? You 're not a merchant . I know that . You have no real interest in my mother 's weaving . ' Miriam waited for a reply , but Marcellus had not recovered his self-possession . Tell me , ' she coaxed , softly . What are you doing up here  --  in Galilee  --  if it is n't a secret ? ' He met her challenging smile with an attempted casualness . It is a secret , ' he said . Jusrus was coolly polite today , but remote . He was beginning to be skeptical about Marcellus . Yesterday at Reuben 's house a few facts , unimportant when considered singly , had taken on size once they were strung together . Marcellus , whose Aramaic was distinctly of the Samaritan variety , had recklessly volunteered that he knew old Benjamin , the weaver in Athens , who had derived from Samaria . Demetrius , the handsome young Greek who had recently been in Benyosef 's employ , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aramaic he spoke was loaded with Samaritan provincialisms . Clearly there was some sort of tieup between Marcellus and this fugitive slave , though the Roman had pretended not to have known him , and had shown no interest in the story of his hasty flight from Benyosef 's shop . Doubtless Marcellus knew about it , and had reasons for wanting to evade any discussion of it . It all went to prove that you could n't trust a Roman . At sunset yesterday , Justus had strolled down the street by himself , making it clear that his Roman patron 's company was not desired . For a little while Marcellus had debated the propriety of going alone to the fountain . His anxiety to hear Miriam sing again decided the matter . The whole town was there and seated when he quietly joined the crowd at its shaded outskirts . No notice was taken of him , for Miriam had at that moment arrived and all eyes were occupied . Marcellus sat on the ground , a little way apart , and experienced the same surge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that he had talked with her , Miriam 's songs meant even more . He had been strangely drawn to this girl . And he knew that she had been sincerely interested in him . It was not , in either case , a mere transient infatuation . There had been nothingcoyly provocative in Miriam 's attitude . She wanted only to be his friend , and had paid him the high compliment of assuming that he was bright enough to understand the nature of her unreserved cordiality . As he sat there in the darkness , alternately stilled and stirred by her deep , vibrant , confident tones , he found himself consenting to the reality of her honest faith . His inherent , built-in skepticism yielded to a curious wistfulness as she sang , In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge . . . . My heart is fixed .... Awake , my glory ! Awake , my harp ! ' Miriam could n't walk  --  but she could fly . Justus had briefly announced that they would be leaving early in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to some errands . Will we be coming back through Cana ? ' Marcellus had asked . If it is your wish , yes , ' Justus had replied , but we have seen everyone here who has weaving for sale . ' There was n't much to be said after that . Marcellus could think of no reasonable excuse for a return to Cana . He could n't say , I must have another private talk with Miriam . ' No  --  he would have to go , leaving her to wonder what manner of role he had been playing . Given one more day , one more confidential chat with Miriam , he might have told her why he was here in Galilee . When the last song was ended , he waited in the shadows for thep237crowd to disperse . Justus , he observed , had moved forward to join Reuben 's party as it made its way to the street . It would be quite possible to overtake this slow-moving group and say farewell to Miriam . Perhaps she might be glad if he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove embarrassing to both of them . Perhaps Reuben and Naomi shared the obvious suspicionsof Justus that there was something irregular about this Roman 's tour of Galilee . After lingering indecisively until the little park was cleared , Marcellus , deeply depressed and lonely , slowly retraced his way to the little camp reproaching himself for having unnecessarily given them cause to distrust him . He saw now that it would have been much more sensible if he had told Justus , at the outset , why he wanted to visit Galilee . Of course , Justus , in that event , might have refused to conduct him ; but the present situation was becoming intolerable . Marcellus was very unhappy . He would have given much for a talk with Demetrius tonight . Demetrius was resourceful . Had he been along , by this time he would have found means for penetrating the reticence of these Galileans . It was nearing midday now . They had not exchanged a word for more than an hour . Justus , who had been tramping on ahead , paused to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house on a near-by shady knoll . We will stop there , ' he said , though it is likely that Amasiah and Deborah have gone to Jerusalem . They weave excellent saddlebagsand sell them to the bazaars when they attend the Passover . ' A stout , middle-aged woman came sauntering through the yard to meet them as they turned in at the gate , her face suddenly beamingas she recognized Justus . No  --  Amasiah was not at home . Yes  --  he had gone to Jerusalem . And why not you , Deborah ? ' asked Justus . Surely you know , ' she sighed . I have no wish ever to see the Holy City again . Nor would Amasiah have gone but to sell the saddle-bags . ' She turned inquiring eyes toward Marccllus , and Justus introduced him with cool formality , explaining his mission . Deborah smiled briefly and murmured her regret that they had nothing to sell . No  --  everything had gone with Amasiah . All but a little saddle-blanket I made for Jasper , ' she added . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and Deborah brought out the saddle-blanket , a thick , well-woven trifle of gay colors . Jasper can get along without it , if you want it . ' She nodded toward a diminutive , silver-gray donkey , browsing in the shade.  | I suppose jasper is a little pet , ' surmised Marcellus , lightly . Jasper is a little pest , ' grumbled Deborah . I am too heavy to ride him any more , and Amasiah says he is n't worth his keep in a pack-train . ' Would you like to sell him ? ' inquired Marcellus . You would n't have any use for him , ' said Deborah , honestly . How much would you want ? ' persisted Marcellus . What 's he worth , Justus ? ' asked Deborah , languidly . Justus sauntered over to the donkey , pulled his shaggy head up out of the grass , and looked into his mouth . ' Well  --  if he 's worth anything at all , which is doubtful , except maybe for a child to play with  --  he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad habits ? ' inquired Marcellus . Eating , ' said Deborah , dryly . But he wo n't run away . ' Qh , no ; he wo n't run away . That would be too much of an effort . ' They all laughed but Jasper , who sighed deeply . I 'll give you fifteen shekels for the donkey and the blanket , ' bargainedMarcellus . Deborah said that was fair enough , and added that there was quite a good saddle too , and a bridle that had been made especially for Jasper . She brought them . It was a well-made saddle , and the bridle was gaily ornamented with a red leather top-piece into which a little bell was set . How about twenty-five shekels for everything ? ' suggested Marcellus . Deborah tossed the saddle across the donkey 's back and began fastening the girths . Marcellus opened his wallet . Justus , watching the pantomime , chuckled . It relieved Marcellus to see him amused about something . Jasper was reluctant to leave the grass-plot , but showed no distress when it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the gate . Marcellus took the reins and proceeded to the highway , Justus lingering for a private word with Deborah . Late in the afternoon they reached the frowsy fringe of little Sepphoris , a typical Galilean village . Everybody waved a hand or called a greeting to Justus as the big fellow trudged on with lengthening strides . Soon they were nearing the inevitable public plaza . A small boy broke loose from a group of children playing about the brick-walled well and came running toward Justus with exultant shouts . He was a handsome lad with a sensitive face , a tousle of curly black hair , and an agile body . Justus quickened hisp239steps and caught the little fellow up in his arms , hugging him hungrily . He stopped and turned about , his eyes brightly proud . This is my Jonathan ! ' he announced , unnecessarily . The boy gave his grandfather another strangling embrace and wiggled out of his arms . He had sighted Jasper . Is this your donkey ? ' he cried . Perhaps you would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marcellus adjusted the stirrup-straps , a score of children gathering about with high-keyed exclamations . Justus stood by , stroking his beard , alternately smiling and frowning . What 's his name ? ' asked Jonathan , as Marcellus put the reins in. his hands . His small voice was shrill with excitement . His name is Jasper , ' said Marcellus . You may have him , Jonathan . He is your donkey now . ' Mine ! ' squeaked Jonathan . He gazed incredulously at his grandfather . This gentleman , ' said Justus , is my friend , Marcellus Gallio . If he says the donkey is yours , it must be so . ' He turned to Marcellus , and said , above the children 's shouts of amazement at Jonathan 's good fortune , That is most generous of you , sir ! ' Is he one of us , Grandfather ? ' Jonathan pointed a finger at his benefactor . The two men exchanged quick glances ; one frankly mystified , the other somewhat embarrassed . You are one of us , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! ' Again Marcellus invaded Justus ' eyes , but received no answer . Are you rich ? ' demanded Jonathan , immensely forthright . No one has ever said " yes " to that question , Jonathan , ' laughed Marcellus , as Justus mumbled an unintelligible apology for his grandson 's impertinence . But  --  you must be rich , ' insisted Jonathan , to be giving your things away . Did Jesus tell you to do that ? ' He thrust his small face forward and studied Marcellus ' eyes with childish candor . You knew Jesus ; did n't you ? Did my grandfather tell you that Jesus straightened my foot  --  so I can walk and run ? ' The children were quiet now . Marcellus found himself confronted with the necessity of making a public address , and was appropriatelytongue-tied . After a difficult interval , he stammered : ' Y-yes  --  your grandfather told me  --  about your foot , Jonathan . I am very glad it got well . That is fine ! ' Let us go now , ' muttered Justus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to meet my daughter . Lip240Marcellus needed no urging . They proceeded up the street , their numbers increasing as they went . The news had traveled fast . People came out of their houses , wide-eyed with curiosity ; children of all sizes ran to join the procession . One small boy on crutches , dangling a useless leg , waited for the parade , his pinched face alight with wonder . Justus stepped to the side of the road and gave him a friendly pat on the head as he passed . Now they had arrived at the modest little home . The dooryard was scrupulously tidy . The narrow walk was bordered with tulips . Rebecca , a gentle-voiced , plain-featured matron of thirty-five , met them , considerably puzzled by all the excitement . Justus , on the doorstep , briefly explained ; and , with a new cordiality , presented Marcellus . ' Oh  --  you should n't have done that , sir , ' murmured Rebecca , though her shining eyes were full of appreciation . That is quite an expensive gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaid , ' smiled Marcellus . It is evident that the donkey is a success . ' Look , Mother ! ' shouted Jonathan , waving his arm . It 's mine ! ' Rebecca nodded and smiled , and the noisy pack moved on in the wake of the town 's young hero . This is a great day for Jonathan , ' said Rebecca , as she led the way into their small , frugally furnished parlor . Yes , yes , ' sighed Justus , sinking into a chair . He was frowning thoughtfully . It 's a great day for the lad  --  but Jonathan 's pretty young for a responsibility like that . ' Oh  --  he 's old enough , ' remarked Marcellus . That lazy little donkey really should belong to a child . Jonathan will get along with him splendidly . ' As for that  --  yes , ' agreed Justus , soberly . He stroked his beard moodily , nodded his head several times and muttered to himself , Yes , yes ; that 's a good deal to expect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Rebecca , we will pitch Marcellus Gallio 's tent there beside the house . And he will have his meals with us . ' Of course , Father , ' responded Rebecca , promptly , giving their guest a hospitable smile . Is there anything you are enjoined not to eat , sir ? ' And when Marcellus looked puzzled , she hesitatingly explained , I am not acquainted with the Roman customs . I thought perhaps your religion  --  like ours  --  forbids your eating certain things . ' Oh , no , ' declared Marcellus , amiably . My religion has never inconvenienced anyone  --  not even me . ' He quickly repented of thisp241flippancy when he observed that his remark had drawn down the corners of his host 's mouth . Do you mean that your people have no religion at all ? ' queriedJustus , soberly . No religion ! ' protested Marcellus . Why  --  we have gods on every corner ! ' ' Idols  --  you mean , ' corrected Justus , dourly . Statues , ' amended Marcellus . Some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them . The Greeks have a talent for it . ' And your people worship these  --  statues ? ' wondered Justus . They seem to , sir . I suppose some of them are really sincere about it . ' Marcellus was tiring of this inquisition . But you , personally , do not worship these things , ' persisted Justus . ' Oh  --  by no means ! ' Marcellus laughed . Then you do not believe in any Supreme Power ? ' Justus was shocked and troubled . I admit , Justus , that all the theories I have heard on this subject are unconvincing . I am open to conviction . I should be glad indeed to learn of a reliable religion . ' Rebecca , scenting a difficult discussion , moved restlessly to the edge of her chair , smiling nervously . I shall go and prepare your supper , ' she said , rising . You men must be starving . ' I did n't mean to be offensive , Justus , ' regretted Marcellus , when Rebecca had left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtless of me to speak negligently of these matters . ' No harm done , ' said Justus , gently . You wish you could believe . That is something . Is it not true , in our life , that they find who seek ? You are a man of good intent . You are kind . You deserve to have a religion . ' Marcellus could n't think of an appropriate ; rejoinder to that , so he sat silent , waiting for further directions . After a moment , Justus impulsively slapped his big brown hands down on his knees in a gesture of adjournment ; and , rising , moved toward the door . Let us put up your tent , Marcellus , ' he suggested kindly . It was the first time he had spoken Marcellus ' name without the formal addition of Gallio . ' Shortly after the family supper , which he had been too busy to attend , Jonathan appeared at the open front of the brown tent . He stood with his feet wide apart , his arms akimbo , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that the day 's experiences had aged him considerably . Marcellus , writing at the small collapsible table , put down his stylus , regarded his caller with interest , and grinned . He mistakinglythought he knew what had been going on in Jonathan 's mind . At the outset , his amazing windfall had dizzied him into a state of emotional instability that had made his voice squeaky and his postures jerky ; but now that the crowd had gone home , and Jasper had been shown into the unoccupied stall beside the cow , and had been hand-fed with laboriously harvested clover , Jonathan 's excitement had cooled . He was becoming aware of his new status as a man of affairs , a man of property , sole owner and proprietor of a donkey , the only man of his age in all Sepphoris who owned a donkey . Even his grandfather did n't own a donkey . Marcellus felt that Jonathan 's behavior was approximately normal for a sevenyear-oldboy , in these circumstances . Well  --  did you put him up for the night ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and nodded gravely . Will you come in and sit down ? ' Jonathan came in and sat down , crossing his legs with mature deliberation . Did Jasper behave pretty well ? ' Jonathan nodded several times , facing the ground . Marcellus felt in need of some cooperation , but pursued his inquirieshopefully . Did n't bite anybody ? Or kick anybody ? Or lie down in his harness and go to sleep on the road ? ' Jonathan shook his head slowly , without looking up , his tongue bulging his cheek . Not having conversed with a small boy for many years , Marcellusbegan to realize that it was n't as simple a matter as he had supposed . Well ! ' he exclaimed brightly . That 's fine ! Is there anything else you 'd like to tell me about it ? ' Jonathan glumly raised his head and faced Marcellus with troubled eyes . He swallowed noisily . Thomas asked me to let him ride , ' he muttered , thickly . Something tells me that you refused , ' ventured Marcellus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' went on Marcellus , comfortingly . You can let Thomas ride tomorrow . Perhaps he should n't havep243expected you to lend him your donkey on the very first day you had him . Is this Thomas a good friend of yours ? ' Did you see the boy with the crutches ; the one with the limber ' e ' The little boy your grandfather stopped to speak to ? ' Jonathan nodded . ' Well  --  you can make it all up to Thomas , ' cooed Marcellus , maternally . He 'll have plenty of chances to ride . See here  --  if you feel so upset about this , why do n't you run over to Thomas ' house now and tell him he may ride Jasper , first thing in the morning . ' They 're going away tomorrow , ' croaked Jonathan , dismally . Thomas and his mother . They do n't live here . They live in Capernaum . They came here because his grandmother was sick . And she died . And now they 're going back to Capernaum . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't your fault . If you 're troubled about it , perhaps you 'd better talk it over with your grandfather . Did you ever sleep in a tent , Jonathan ? ' Jonathan shook his head , the gloom lifting a little . There 's another cot we can set up , ' said Marcellus . You go and talk to your grandfather about Thomas , and ask your mother if you may sleep in the tent . ' Jonathan grinned appreciatively and disappeared . It was impossible not to overhear the conversation , for Justus was seated near the open window within an arm 's reach of the tent . After a while , Marcellus became conscious of the deep , gentle voice of Justus and the rather plaintive treble of his troubled grandson . Immensely curious to learn how all this was coming out , he put down his stylus and listened . When Jesus told people to give their things away , he said that just to rich people ; did n't he , Grandfather ? ' ' Yes  --  just to people who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich ? ' Yes  --  and he is very kind . ' Did Jesus tell him to give his things away ? ' There was a long pause here that made Marcellus hold his breath . I do not know , Jonathan . It is possible . ' There was another long silence , broken at length by the little boy . Grandfather  --  why did n't Jesus heal Thomas ' leg ? ' I do n't know , son . Perhaps Jesus was n't told about it . ' That was too bad , ' lamented Jonathan . I wish he had . ' Yes , ' sighed Justus . That would make things much easier foryou ; would n't it ? '  | I 'm glad he straightened my foot , ' murmured Jonathan . ' Yes  --  that was wonderful ! ' rumbled Justus . Jesus was very good to you ! I know that if you could do anything for Jesus , you would be glad to ; would n't you ? ' I could n't do anything for Jesus , Grandfather , ' protested Jonathan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find that there was something Jesus had n't done , because they had n't told him about it ; something he would have wanted to do , if he had known ; something he would want to do now , if he were still here  --  ' You mean  --  something for Thomas ? ' Jonathan 's voice was thin . Had you thought there was something you might do for Thomas ? ' Little Jonathan was crying now ; and from the sounds of shifting positions within the room , Marcellus surmised that Justus had taken his unhappy grandson in his arms . There was no more talk . After a half-hour or more , Jonathan appeared , red-eyed and fagged , at the door of the tent . I 'm going to sleep with Grandfather , ' he gulped . He wants me to . ' That 's right , Jonathan , ' approved Marcellus . Your grandfather has n't seen you for a long time . You may play in the tent tomorrow , if you like . ' Jonathan lingered , scowling thoughtfully and batting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave Jasper away ? ' he asked , with an effort . To Thomas , maybe ? ' wondered Marcellus . Jonathan nodded , without looking up . Are you sure you want to ? ' No  --  I do n't want to . ' ' Well  --  you 're a pretty brave little boy , Jonathan ! I 'll say that for you ! ' declared Marcellus . This fervent praise , being altogether too much for Jonathan , led to his sudden disappearance . Marcellus untied his sandal-straps and lounged on his cot as the twilight deepened . This Jesus must have been a man of gigantic moral power . He had been dead and in his grave for a year now , but he had stamped himself so indelibly onto the house of Justus that even this child had been marked ! The simile intrigued him for a moment . It was as if this Jesus had taken a die and a hammer  --  and had pounded the image of his spirit into this Galilean gold , convertingit into the coins of his kingdom ! The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to impress more people ! A spirit like that  --  if it contrived to get itself going  --  could makep245the world over into a fit habitation for men of good will ! But Jesus was dead ! A little handful of untutored country people in Galilee would remember for a few years  --  and the great light would be extinguished . It would be a pity ! Little Jonathan would give up his donkey to a crippled boy , but only Sepphoris would ever know about it . Miriam would sing her inspired songs  --  but only for sequestered little Cana . Jesus ' kingdom belonged to the world ! But its coinage was good only in the shabby villages of Galilee . He would write that , tomorrow , to Demetrius . Marcellus ate his breakfast alone , Rebecca attentive but uncommunicative . He had ventured upon several commonplace remarks to which she had replied , amiably enough , in listless monosyllables . Yes  --  Jonathan and his grandfather had had their breakfast early . No  --  she did n't think they would be gone long . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter he had begun to Demetrius ; writing it in Greek ; with no plans for its delivery . Everybody who was likely to be journeying to Jerusalem at this season had already gone . Presently Justus appeared at the tent-door . Marcellus signed to him to come in , and he eased himself onto a camp-chair . Well , ' began Marcellus , breaking a lengthy silence , I suppose little Jonathan has done a generous deed  --  and broken his heart . I am sorry to have caused him so much distress . ' Do not reproach yourself , Marcellus . It may turn out well . True  --  the child is a bit young to be put to such a severe test . We can only wait and see how he behaves . This is a great day for Jonathan  --  if he can see it through . ' Justus was proud  --  but troubled . See it through ! ' echoed Marcellus . But he has seen it through ! Has n't he given his donkey to the crippled lad ? You do n't think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the donkey back ; do you ? ' No , no  --  not that ! But they 're all down there on the corner telling Jonathan what a fine little fellow he is . You should have heard them  --  when Thomas and his mother set off  --  Thomas ridingthe donkey and his mother walking alongside , so happy she was crying . And all the women caressing Jonathan , and saying , " How sweet ! How kind ! How brave ! " ' Justus sighed deeply . It was too bad ! But  --  of course  --  I could n't rebuke them . I came away . ' But  --  Justus ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . Surely it is only natural that the neighbors should praise Jonathan for what he did ! It was no small sacrifice for a little boy ! Is n't it right that the child should be commended ? '  | Commended  --  yes , ' agreed Justus , but not praised overmuch . As you have said , this thing has cost Jonathan a high price . He has a right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great pity if all he gets out of it is smugness ! There is no vanity so damagingto a man 's character as pride over his good deeds ! Let him be proud of his muscles , his fleetness , his strength , his face , his marksmanship , his craftsmanship , his endurance  --  these are the common frailties that beset us all . But when a man becomes vain of his goodness , it is a great tragedy ! My boy is very young and inexperienced . He could be so easily ruined by self-righteousness , almost without realizing what ailed him . ' I see what you mean ! ' declared Marcellus . ' I agree with you ! This thing will either make Jonathan strong  --  beyond his years or it will make a little prig of him ! Justus  --  let 's get out of here before the neighbors have had a chance to ruin him . We 'll take him along with us ! What do you say ? ' Justus ' eyes lighted . He nodded an enthusiastic approval . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pack up and leave  --  at once ! ' That 's sensible , ' said Marcellus . I was afraid you might insist on Jonathan 's remaining here  --  just to see how much of this punishmenthe could take . ' No ! ' said Justus . It would n't be fair to overload the little fellow . He has done very well indeed . It is time now that we gave him a helping hand . We too have some obligations in this case , my friend ! ' You 're right ! ' Marcellus began rolling up the letter he had just finished . I got Jonathan into this mess , and I 'll do my best to help him through it without being damaged . ' Justus had no more than had time to enter the house until Jonathanput in an appearance at the door of the tent , wearing the wan , tremulous smile of a patient burden-bearer . Hi !  --  Jonathan , ' greeted Marcellus , noisily . I hear you got young Thomas started on his way . That 's good . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two of the best legs in town . ' Busily preoccupied with the blankets he was folding up and stuffing into a pack-saddle , he absently chattered on , half to himself , A boy who was once a cripple  --  and then was cured  --  should be so glad he could walk that he would never want to ride ! ' But Jasper was such a nice donkey , ' replied Jonathan , biting his lip . Everybody said they did n't know how I could give him up . ' ' Well  --  never mind what everybody said ! ' barked Marcellus . Do n't let them spoil it for you now ! You 're a stout little fellow  --   |p247and  that 's the end of it ! Here !  --  blow your nose  --  and give me a hand on this strap ! ' Justus showed up in time to hear the last of it . He winced  --  and grinned . Jonathan , ' he said , we are taking you with us on a few days ' journey . Your mother is packing some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' squealed Jonathan . Oh ! ' he raced around the corner of the tent , shouting gleefully . Justus and Marcellus exchanged sober glances . That was a brutal thing I did just now ! ' muttered Marcellus . " Faithful are the wounds of a friend , " ' said Justus . Jonathan will recover . He already has something new to think about  --  now that he is going with us . ' By the way , Justus , where are we going ? ' I had thought of Capernaum next . ' That can wait . We might overtake Thomas and Jasper . We do n't want to see any more of them today . Let 's go back to Cana . It will do little Jonathan good to have a look at Miriam . ' Justus tried to conceal a broad grin by tugging at his beard . Perhaps it would do you good too , Marcellus , ' he ventured . But will you not be wasting your time ? We have seen everything there is for sale  --  in Cana . ' Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicker box , straightened and looked Justus squarely in the eyes . I think I have bought all the homespun I want , ' he announced , bluntly . What I have been learning about this Jesus has made me curious to hear more . I wonder if you will help me meet a few people who knew him  --  people who might be willing to talk about him . ' That would be difficult , ' said Justus , frankly . Our people have no reasons for feeling that they can talk freely with Romans . They would find it hard to understand why a man of your nation should be making inquiries about Jesus . Perhaps you are not aware that the Romans put him to death . Maybe you do not know that the legionaries  --  especially in Jerusalem  --  are on the alert for any signs that the friends of Jesus are organized . ' Do you suspect me of being a spy , Justus ? ' asked Marcellus , bluntly . No  --  I do not think you are a spy . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have no evil intent . I shall be willing to tell you some things about Jesus . ' Thank you , Justus . ' Marcellus drew from his tunic the letter he had written . Tell me : how may I send this to Jerusalem ? '  | Justus frowned , eyeing the scroll suspiciously . There is a Roman fort at Capernaum , ' he muttered . Doubtless they have messengers going back and forth , every few days . ' Marcellus handed him the scroll and pointed to the address . I do not want this letter handled through the Capernaum fort , ' he said , or the Insula at Jerusalem . It must be delivered by a trusted messenger into the care of the Greek , Stephanos , at Benyosef'sshop . ' So you do know that slave Demetrius , ' commented Justus . I thought as much . ' ' Yes  --  he is my slave . ' I had wondered about that , too . ' Indeed ! Well  --  what else had you wondered about ? Let 's clean it all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what your purpose was in making this trip into Galilee , ' said Justus , brightening a little . ' Well  --  now you know ; do n't you ? ' I am not sure that I do . ' Justus laid a hand on Marcellus ' arm . Tell me this : did you ever see Jesus ; ever hear him talk ? ' Yes , ' admitted Marcellus , but I could not understand what he said . At that time I did not know the language . ' Did you study Aramaic so you could learn something about him ? ' Yes  --  I had no other interest in it . ' Let me ask one more question . ' Justus lowered his voice . Are you one of us ? ' That 's what I came up here to find out , ' said Marcellus . Will you help me ? ' As much as I can , ' agreed Justus , as much as you are able to comprehend . ' Marcelius looked puzzled . Do you mean that there are some mysteries here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , soberly . Bright enough  --  yes , ' rejoined Justus . But an understanding of Jesus is not a mere matter of intelligence . Some of this story has to be accepted by faith . ' Faith comes hard with me , ' frowned Marcellus . I am not superstitious . ' So much the better , ' declared Justus . The higher the price you have to pay , the more you will cherish what you get . ' Impulsively throwing aside his coat , he began pulling up tentstakes . We will talk more about this later , ' he said . It is time we were on our way if we hope to reach Cana by sunset . ' Suddenly he straightened with a new idea . I have it ! ' he exclaimed . We will go to Nazareth ! Itp249is much nearer than Cana . Nazareth was Jesus ' home town . His mother lives there still . She will not hesitate to talk freely with you . When she learns that you  --  a Roman  --  saw her son , and were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will tell you everything ! ' ' No  --  no ! ' exclaimed Marcellus , wincing . I have no wish to see her . ' Noting the sudden perplexity on Justus ' face , he added , I feel sure she would not want to talk about her son  --  to a Roman . ' For the first three miles , Jonathan frolicked about the little caravanwith all the aimless extravagance of a frisky pup , dashing on ahead , inexpertly throwing stones at the crows , and making many brief excursions into the fields . But as the sun rose higher , his wild enthusiasm came under better control . Now he was content to walk sedately beside his grandfather , taking long strides and feeling very manly . After a while he took his grandfather 's hand and shortened his steps at the request of his aching legs . Preoccupied with their conversation , which was weighty , Justus had been only vaguely aware of the little boy 's weariness ; but when he stumbled and nearly fell , they all drew up in the shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest donkey might be free for a rider . Jonathan made no protestwhen they lifted him up . I wish I had kept that nice saddle , ' he repined . No , you do n't , ' drawled Marcellus . When you give anything away , make a good job of it . Do n't skimp ! ' Our friend speaks truly , my boy , ' said Justus . The donkey will carry you safely without a saddle . Let us move on , and when the sun is directly overhead , we will have something to eat . ' I 'm hungry now ! ' murmured Jonathan . The bread will taste better at noon , ' advised Justus . I 'm hungry too , ' intervened Marcellus , mercifully . As he unstrappedthe hamper , he added , out of the corner of his mouth , He 's only a baby , Justus . Do n't be too hard on him . ' Justus grumbled a little over the delay and the breakdown of discipline , but it was easy to see that he had been mellowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token lunch was passed about , and presently they were on the highway again . You would have been delighted with the mind of Jesus , ' said Justus , companionably . You have a generous heart , Marcellus . How often he talked about generosity ! In his opinion there was nothing meaner than a mean gift . About the worst thing a manp250could do to himself or a fellow creature was to bestow a grudged gift . It was very hard on a man 's character to give away something that should have been thrown away ! That much of Jesus ' teachings you could accept , my friend , without any difficulty . ' That is a friendly comment , Justus , but you do me too much credit , ' protested Marcellus . The fact is  --  I have never in my life given anything away that impoverished me in the least . I have never given anything away that I needed or wanted to keep . I supposeJesus parted with everything he had . ' Everything ! ' said Justus . He had nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two coats , he should give one away . During his last year with us he wore a good robe . Perhaps he would have given that away , too , if it had n't been given to him in peculiar circumstances . ' Would you like to tell me about it ? ' asked Marcellus . There was an ill-favored woman in Nazareth who was suspected of practicing witchcraft . She was a dwarfish person with an ugly countenance , and walked alone , friendless and bitter . The children cried after her on the road . And so a legend spread that Tamar had an evil eye . One Sabbath day the neighbors heard her loom banging , and warned her against this breaking of the law ; for many of our people have more respect for the Sabbath than they have for one another . Tamar did not heed the warning and she was reported to the authorities who came in upon her , on a Sabbath morning , and destroyed her loom which was her living . Perhaps you can guess the rest of the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus was a good carpenter , ' remarkedMarcellus . But what did the authorities think of his coming to Tamar 's aid ? Did they accuse him of being sympathetic with Sabbath-breakers ? ' That they did ! ' declared Justus . It was at a time when the priests were on the alert to find him at fault . The people often urged him to speak in the village synagogues , and this displeased the rabbis . They were always haranguing the people about their tithes and sacrificial offerings . Jesus talked about friendship and hospitality to strangers and relief for the poor . ' ' But  --  did n't the rabbis believe in friendship and charity ? ' wonderedMarcellus . Oh , yes  --  of course . They took it for granted that everybody was agreed on that . ' In theory , at least , ' surmised Marcellus . Exactly ! In theory . But securing funds to support the synagogue  --  thatwas practical ! They had to talk constantly aboutTHE ROBE 251p251money . It left them no time to talk about the things of the spirit . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose Jesus reconstructed her loom  --  and she wove him the Robe . ' Right ! And he wore it until he died . ' Were you there  --  when he died ? ' asked Marcellus , uneasily . No  --  I was in prison . ' Justus seemed disinclined to enlarge upon this matter ; but , when questioned , told the story briefly . A few days before his trial for treason and disturbing the peace , Jesus had impulsively driven hucksters and bankers out of the Temple . Several of his friends had been arrested and thrown into prison on the charge of having gathered up some of the scattered coins from the pavement . The accusation was untrue , Justus insisted , but they were kept in prison for a fortnight . It was all over , ' he said , sadly , when we were released . As for the Robe  --  the Roman soldiers gambled for it  --  and carried it away with them . We often wonderedwhat became of it . It could have no value  --  for them . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little grove where there was a spring and a green grass-plot for grazing . The donkeys were unburdened and tethered . The food was unpacked ; a wineskin , a basket of bread , a parcel of smoked fish , an earthenware jar of cooked barley , a box of sun-cured figs . They spread a blanket on the ground for little Jonathan , who , stuffed to repletion and wearied by the journey , promptly tumbled down to sleep . Justus and Marcellus , lounging on the grass , pursued a low-voiced conversation . Sometimes thoughtless people misunderstood his atttitude toward business , ' Justus was saying . His critics noised it about that he had contempt for barter and trade ; that he had no respect for thrift and honest husbandry . ' I had wondered about that , ' said Marcellus . There has been much talk about his urging people to give things away . It had occurred to me that this could be overdone . If men recklessly distributed their goods to all corners , how could they provide for their own dependents ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This subject came up , one day , and Jesus dealt with it in a story . He was forever contriving simple little fables . He said , a man with a vineyard wanted his grapes picked , for they were now ripe . Going down to the public market , he asked a group of idlers if they wanted a job . They said they would work all day for one denarius . ' Rather high , ' observed Marcellus . Rather ! But the grapes had to be picked immediately , and the man was n't in a position to argue ; so he took them on . By noon ,  | it was apparent that he would need more help . Again in the market-placehe asked the unemployed what they would take to work that afternoon . And they said , " We will leave that up to you , sir . " Well  --  when evening came , the men who had dickered with him for one denarius were paid off according to agreement . Then came the men who had worked shorter hours , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So  --  what did he do ? ' wondered Marcellus , sincerely interested . Gave every man a denarius ! All the way up and down the line  --  one denarius ! He even gave a denarius to a few who had n't worked more than an hour ! ' That might have started a row , ' surmised Marcellus . And indeed it did ! The men who had worked all day complainedbitterly . But the owner said , " I paid you the price you had demanded . That was according to contract . These other men made no demands , but relied on my good will . " ' Excellent ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . If a man drives a hard bargain with you and you are forced to concede to it , you have no obligation to be generous . But if he lets you say how much he should have , that 's likely to cost you something ! ' There you are ! ' nodded Justus . You have a right to weigh it out by the pennyworth , if the other fellow haggles . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give must be pressed down , shaken together , and running over ! ' Justus , ' declared Marcellus , if it became a custom for people to deal with one another that way , the market-place would n't be quite so noisy ; would it ? ' And all men would be better off , ' said Justus . People would n't have to be taxed to employ patrols to keep the peace . And  --  as the idea spread , ' he added , dreamily , all of the armies could be demobilized . That would lift a great weight off the shoulders of the people . And once they had experienced this more abundant life that Jesus proposed , it is not likely they would want to return w the old way . ' For some time they sat in silence , each busy with his own thoughts . Of course  --  it 's utterly impractical , ' declared Marcellus . Only a little handful would make the experiment , and at ruinous cost . The great majority would sneer and take advantage of them , consideringthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon be stripped of everything ! ' That 's true , ' admitted Justus . Stripped of everything but the great idea ! But , Marcellus , that idea is like a seed . It doesn'tp253amount to much if you expect immediate returns . But if you 're willing to plant it , and nourish it  --  ' ' I suppose , ' remarked Marcellus , it is as if some benefactor appeared in the world with a handful of new grain which , if men should feed on it , would give them peace and prosperity . ' Very good , ' approved Justus , but that handful of grain would not go very far unless it were sowed and reaped and sowed again and again . Jesus talked about that . Much of this seed , he said , would never come up . Some of it would lodge in the weeds and brambles . Some of it would fall upon stony ground . But a little of it would grow . ' ' Justus  --  do you honestly believe there 's any future for a theory like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest . Yes  --  I do ! ' declared Justus . I believe it because he believed it ! He said it would work like yeast in meal ; slowly , silently ; but  --  once it began  --  nothing could ever stop it . Nobody would ever be able to shut it off  --  or dig it up  --  or tear it out ! ' ' But  --  why did it begin  --  up here  --  in poor little Galilee  --  so remote from the main centers of world development ? ' wondered Marcellus . ' Well '  --  reflected Justus  --  ' it had to begin somewhere ! ' After a moment of meditation , he faced Marcellus with a sly grin . Do you think this seed might have had a better chance to take root and grow , if it had fallen on the streets in Rome ? ' I think the question answers itself , ' conceded Marcellus . Justus reached over and patted the little boy 's tanned cheek . ' On  --  now  --  to Cana , ' he said , scrambling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway , Justus leading with long , swinging strides , indulging in a reminiscent monologue . How often we came over this road together ! ' he was recalling . Jesus loved Cana better than any other town in Galilee . ' Better than Nazareth ? ' queried Marcellus . They never quite appreciated his spirit in Nazareth , ' explained Justus . You know how it is . A prophet has no standing in his own community . The Nazarenes used to say , " How can this man have any wisdom ? Do n't we know him ? " ' Apparently they did n't rate very high in their own esteem , ' laughed Marcellus . ' It was natural , ' said Justus , sobering . He had grown up with them . He never held it against them that they did not respond to his teachings as they did in Cana and Capernaum . It was in Cana that he first exercised the peculiar powers you will be hearing about . I do n't suppose anyone has told you what happened there , one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 255p254No , ' replied Marcellus , attentively . What happened ? ' It was a story of some length , and Justus was so particular about the small details that Marcellus immediately surmised its unportance . Anna , the daughter of Hariph and Rachel , was to be married . Hariph was a potter , an industrius fellow , but by no means prosperous , and the expense of the wedding dinner for Anna was not easy for them . However , Hariph was going to sec his child properly honored . Anna was very popular , and Hariph and Rachel had a host of relatives . Everybody was invited and everybody came . Were you there , Justus ? ' No  --  that was before I knew Jesus . The story of what occurred , that day , quickly spread far and wide . I do n't mind telling you that when I heard it , I doubted it . ' Get on with it , please ! ' insisted Marcellus . Jesus arrived late . The wedding rites had been performed , and the guests had been at table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy . He had not provided enough wine for so large a crowd . His predicament was whispered into Jesus ' ear . ' Justus tramped on for half a stadium in moody silence . Maybe it is not the time yet to tell you this , ' he muttered . You will not believe it . I did not believe it when they told me ! Jesus slipped away from the table , and went to the small serving-room . He saw some of Hariph 's earthenware jars in the little court outside , and told the servants to fill them with water . Then , having instructed them to serve it to the guests , he went back and resumed his place at the table . When the water was served , it was wine ! ' ' No  --  Justus  --  no ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . This spoils the story of Jesus ! ' I was afraid you were n't ready for it , my friend , ' regretted Justus . ' Oh  --  but there must have been some better explanation of that wine , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; everyone loving him . And even the water they drank in his presence tasted like wine ! And so  --  this other utterly preposteroustale got bruited about . ' Have it your own way , Marcellus , ' consented Justus , kindly . It does not offend me that you doubt the story . You can believe in the wisdom and goodness of Jesus without that . ' They proceeded , without further conversation , up the long hill where , at the crest , Justus stopped , cupped his eyes with his big , brown hands , and gazed intently down the narrow road as far as he could see ; a familiar , though unexplained , occurrence . The best Marcellus could make of these frequent long-range observationsp255was his belief that Justus was expecting to meet someone by appointment . Today he thought of asking about it , but decided to wait until Justus wanted to tell him . While they tarried , at the top of the hill , for the pack-train to overtake them , Marcellus broke the silence with a query . Did you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while her family was absent from home , attending a wedding-feast to which she had been invited  --  and had refused to go ? ' Yes , ' assented Justus . It was Anna 's wedding . ' Jesus arrived late at the wedding , ' remembered Marcellus . Yes : Justus nodded and they exchanged a look of mutual understanding . I wonder what made him late , ' reflected Marcellus. too , have often wondered about that , ' said Justus , quietly . Do you suppose he might have asked Miriam not to tell ? ' It is possible . ' So far as you know , Justus , ' persisted Marcellus , did he ever confer a great gift upon someone  --  and request the beneficiary to keep it a secret ? ' Yes , ' said Justus . There were many evidences of such events : How do you explain that ? ' Marcellus wanted to know . Jesus found any public display of charity very offensive , ' said Justus . Had it been possible , I think he would have preferred to do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to a great throng that had gathered on a hillside to hear him talk , " When you make gifts , do not let them be seen . Do not sound a trumpet that you may receive praise . When you do your almsgiving , let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing . No one but your Father will see . Only your Father will reward you . " ' What did he mean , Justus  --  about your Father rewarding you  --  if no one else knows ? Take little Jonathan 's case , for example : if nobody had learned about his giving his donkey to the crippled lad , would he have been secretly rewarded ? ' Of course ! ' declared Justus . If no one had known about the gift , Jonathan 's heart would have overflowed with happiness . You would n't have heard him wishing that he had kept the saddle ! ' But the child had no way of keeping the matter quiet ! ' expostulatedMarcellus . True , ' nodded Justus . That was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that peculiar radiance of Miriam 's can be accounted4 for by her having kept her secret ? In her case , she was not the donor . She was the recipient ! ' I know , ' agreed Justus . If the recipient does n't tell , then the donor is rewarded in his heart . It is thus that the recipient helps him to obtain his reward . ' But now that Jesus is dead , ' argued Marcellus , with a puzzled look , Miriam is free to tell her secret ; is she not ? ' Justus stroked his beard , thoughtfully . Probably not , ' he murmured . If she were  --  she would tell . ' THEY had reached Cana too late to hear Miriam sing , but Marcellusthought it was just as well , for Jonathan was so tired and sleepy that he could hardly hold his head up . By the time they had pitched camp , washed off their dust , eaten a light supper , and put the little boy to bed , many voices could be heard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain . Justus sauntered out to the street . Marcellus , wearily stretched at full length on his cot , heard him talking to a friend . After a while he returned to say he had been informed by Hariph the potter that Jesse , the son of Beoni , was leaving early in the morning for Jerusalem . Doubtless he would carry the letter to Demetrius . Very good ! ' Marcellus handed him the scroll and unstrapped his coin purse . How much will he expect ? ' Ten shekels should be enough . ' There was an expression of satisfaction in Justus ' face and tone , perhaps because the letter had been given up so casually . His look said that there could be nothingconspiratorial in this communication . Jesse will probably he over here presently , ' he added . Hariph will tell him . He lives hard by the home of Beoni . ' You can talk with him , ' said Marcellus . I am going to sleep . ' And he did ; but after a while the murmur of low-pitched voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through the open tentdootthe white moonlight showed Justus and a stocky , shaggy-haired man of thirty , seated cross-legged on the ground . Jesse , the son of Beoni , was rumbling gutturally about the business that was takingp257him to Jerusalem . He was going to attend the annual camel auction . They always had it at the end of Passover . Many caravans from afar , having disposed of their merchandise , offered their packanimalsfor sale rather than trek them home without a pay-load . You could get a sound , three-year-old she-camel for as little as eighty shekels , Jesse said . He hoped to buy six , this time . He could easily sell them in Tiberias for a hundred or better . Yes  --  he made this trip every year . Yes  --  he would gladly carry Justus ' letter to the Greek who worked for Benyosef . And when Justus asked him how much , Jesse said , Nothing at all . It 's no bother . ' But it is n't my letter , ' explained Justus . It is sent by this Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's there in the tent , asleep . ' ' Oh  --  that one ! My mother told me about him . It is strange that he should want our simple weaving . No one ever thought it was valuable . Well  --  if it is his letter , and not yours , he should pay me eight shekels . ' He will give you ten . ' The coins were poured clinking into Jesse 's hand . Eight is enough , ' said Jesse . You keep the other two . ' But I have done nothing to earn them , ' protested Justus . Theyare yours . I think the Roman would prefer to give you ten . ' Jesse chuckled  --  not very pleasantly . Since when have the Romans turned soft-hearted ? ' he growled . I hope there is nothing queer about this scroll . They tell me the jail in Jerusalem is alive with vermin . How about it , Justus ? You ought to know . ' Jesse laughed at his own grim jest . You lodged there for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justus ' rejoinder . Perhaps he had merely grinned or scowled at Jesse 's bucolic raillery . You can trust Marcellus , ' said Justus , confidently . He is a man of good will . Not all Romans are crooked , Jesse . You know that . ' Yes , yes , ' consented Jesse . As the saying goes , " Every Jew has his Roman . " Mine happens to be Hortensius . ' You mean the Centurion , over in Capernaum , whose orderly Jesus cured of a palsy ? Did you have dealings with him , Jesse ? ' I sold him four camels  --  shortly before that affair of his servant . Three for a hundred each . I told him he could have the other one for sixty because she was spavined . And he said , " She does n't limp . What did you pay for her ? " And I said , " Eighty  --  but I did n't know the spavin was bad until we were on the road two days . " And he said , " She seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " She 's rested . But she 'll go lame on a long journey with anything of a load . " And he said , " You need n't have told me . " Then he said , " Do you know Jesus ? " And I said , " Yes . " And he said , " I thought so . " And then he said , " Let 's split the cost of the spavin . I 'll give you seventy . " And I said , " That 's fair enough . " And then I said , " Do you know Jesus , sir ? " And he said , " No  --  but I heard him talk , one day . " And then I asked him , just as if we were equals , " Are you one of us ? " And he was busy counting out the money , and did n't answer that ; but when he handed it to me he said  --  that was four years ago , and I looked younger than now  --  he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never be rich  --  but you 'll never be poor ! " ' I 'm glad you told me that , Jesse , ' said Justus . You see what happened there ? Hortensius heard Jesus talk about how people ought to treat one another . And maybe he wondered whether anybodywas trying to practice it . And then you told him the truth about the spavined camel . And he began to believe that Jesus had great power . ' Jesse laughed . ' So you think the camel deal had something to do with his believingthat Jesus could cure his sick orderly . ' ' Why not ? ' It was Justus ' turn to chuckle . ' I suppose the Centuriondecided that any man who could influence a Jewish cameldroverto tell the truth about a spavin should be able to heal the sick . But '  --  Justus ' tone was serious now  --  ' however Hortensius came by his faith , he had plenty of it . I was there that day , Jesse . The Centurion came forward  --  a fine figure , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his servant was sick unto death . Would Jesus heal him ? " You need not trouble to come to my house , sir , " he said . " If you will say that my servant is healed , that will be sufficient . " Jesus was much pleased . Nothing like that had happened before . None of us had ever been that sure . He said to Hortensius , " You have great faith . Your wish is granted . " ' ' And then '  --  recollected Jesse  --  ' they say that almost everyone in the crowd set off at top speed for Hortensius ' house . ' ' Yes , ' said Justus , ' and they never did agree on a story . One report had it that the restored orderly met Hortensius at the gate . Some said the fellow was recovered and sitting up in bed . Others told that when the Centurion returned , the orderly was saddling a horse to ride to Capernaum . You know how these rumors get about . I suppose the fact is that none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' But the man did recover , that day , from his sickness ; did n't he ? ' Jesse insisted.  |p259He  did , indeed ! ' declared Justus . I heard him say so . By the way  --  think you that Hortensius will be made Commander of the fort at Capernaum , now that old Julian has been promoted to succeedPilate ? ' No such luck for Galilee ! ' grumbled Jesse . Everyone likes Hortensius . He is a just man , and he would be friendly to our cause . That old fox Herod will see to it that someone tougher than Hortensiusgets the job . The thing that surprises me is the appointment of lazy old Julian to the Insula at Jerusalem . ' Perhaps it 's because Julian is lazy that the Temple crowd wanted him as their Procurator , ' suggested Justus . The more indolent and indifferent he is , the more power will be exercised by the High Priest . He will let Caiaphas do anything he pleases . There are times , Jesse , ' went on Justus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of good intent  --  is more to be feared than a crafty and cruel man . He shuts his eyes  --  and lets the injustices and persecutions proceed . In truth , our cause would have been better served if Pilate had remained . ' Does anyone know what has become of Pilate ? ' asked Jesse . Sent back to Crete , I understand . Better climate . The rumor is that Pontius Pilate is a sick man . He has n't made a public appearancefor all of a year . ' ' Why  --  that goes back to the crucifixion ! ' said Jesse . Do you mean that Pilate has n't been seen in public since that day ? ' That 's what they say . Benyosef thinks Pilate 's sickness is mental . ' ' Well  --  if that 's the case , a change of climate will do him no good , ' remarked Jesse . Hariph says he heard that there 's talk of transferring the Commander of the fort at Minoa to Caper-naum . ' Impossible ! ' muttered Justus . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Jesus to death ! ' Yes  --  I know that , ' said Jesse . I think , too , that it 's just idle talk . Hariph did n't say where he 'd picked it up . Someone told him that this Paulus from Minoa would probably be our next Commander . If so  --  we will have to be more careful than ever . ' Justus sighed deeply and rose to his feet . I must not keep you longer , Jesse . You have a long day ahead of you . Salute Benyosef for me , and any of the others who may have returned , now that the Passover is at an end . And '  --  he laid a hand on Jesse 's shoulder  --  keep watchful eyes on the roads , for no one knows the day  --  or the hour  --  ' His deep voice throttled down to a whisper . They shook hands and Jesse drifted away . With his face turned toward the tent-wall , Marcellus feigned sleep when Justus entered quietly . For a long time he lay wide awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been so easy for Pilate . Pilate had washed his hands in the silver basin , but apparently the Galilean 's blood was still there . So  --  Julian was in command at Jerusalem : Caiaphas could have his own way now . Julian would n't know ; would n't care if he did know what persecutionswere practiced on the little handful that wanted to keep the memory of Jesus alive . It would n't be long until old Benyosef and his secretive callers would have to give it all up . And perhaps Paulus was to be sent up here to keep Galilee in order . Well  --  maybe Paulus would n't be as hard on them as they feared . Paulus was n't a bad fellow . Paulus had been forced to take part in the crucifixion of Jesus . That did n't mean he had approved of it . It was conceivablethat Paulus might even take an interest in the Galilean friends of Jesus . But they would never accept his friendship . The very sight of him would be abhorrent . Justus ' comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with nailing their adored Jesus to the cross could never hope to win their good will , no matter how generously he treated them . Marcellus realized now that he had been quite too sanguine in believing that his sincere interest in the story of Jesus might make it safe for him to confide in Miriam . He had been telling himself that Miriam  --  uncannily gifted with sympathetic understanding  --  would balance his present concern about Jesus against the stark facts of his part in the tragedy . Miriam , he felt , would be forgiving . That was her nature ; and , besides , she liked him , and would give him the benefit of whatever doubts intruded . Perhaps he would not need to go the whole way with his confession . It might be enough to say that he had attended the trial of Jesus , and had seen him die . Whether he could bring himself to be more specific about his own participation in this shameful business would depend upon her reaction as he proceeded . But he knew now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , was a fair-minded person to whom one might safely confide almost anything ; but Justus had revolted against the shocking suggestion that an officer from Minoa might be sent to preserve the peace of Galilee . They would n't dare ! ' Justus had muttered through locked teeth . No  --  he could n't tell Miriam . Perhaps it would be more prudent if he made no effort to see her alone . Hariph the potter , upon whom Cana relied for most of its infor/mation on current events , had risen at daybreak with the remembrancethat Reuben had mentioned his need of a few wine-jars . Although it lacked some three months of the wine-pressing season , this was as good a time as any to learn Reuben 's wishes . Too , he thought Reuben might be glad to learn that Barsabas Justus had arrived in Cana , last evening , with his small grandson  --  the one who , crippled from birth , had been made sound as any boy ever was  --  and the handsome young Roman who , for some obscure reason , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this might be added the knowledge that Jesse , the son of Beoni , had been engaged by this Marcellus to carry an important letter to Jerusalem . After these items had been dealt out to Reuben , piecemeal , he could be told that Justus would be taking his grandson to see Miriam . And so it happened that when the three callers sauntered across Reuben 's well-kept lawn , at mid-forenoon , instead of taking the family by surprise they discovered that their visit was awaited . Feeling that little Jonathan might enjoy a playmate , Miriam had sent for her nine-year-old cousin Andrew , who lived a mile farther out in the country . And Andrew 's widowed mother , Aunt Martha , had been invited too , which had made her happy , for she had not seen Justus in recent months . There were many questions she wanted to ask him . They were all in the arbor , grouped about Miriam who was busy with the inevitable embroidery . She was very lovely , this morning , with a translucent happiness that made her even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attended to  --  the artless sincerity of Miriam 's welcome speeding Marcellus ' pulse  --  they all found seats . Miriam held out a slim hand to Jonathan and gave him a brooding smile that brought him shyly to her side . You must be a very strong boy , Jonathan , ' she told him , ' keepingup with these big men on a journey , all the way from Sepphoris : I rode a donkey  --  most of the time , ' he mumbled , self-consciously ; then , with more confidence , I had a nicer donkey  --  of my own . His name was Jasper . ' He pointed a finger vaguely in Marcellus ' direction without looking at him . He gave Jasper to me . And I gave him to Thomas , because Thomas is lame . ' ' Why  --  what a lovely thing to do ! ' exclaimed Miriam . Her shining eyes drifted past Jonathan and gave Marcellus a heart-warmingglance , and then darted to Justus , whose lips were drawn down to a warning frown . I suppose Thomas really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justus ' hint . It must have made you very happy to do that for him . ' Jonathan smiled wanly , put one brown bare foot on top of the other , and seemed to be meditating a dolorous reply . Divining his mood , Miriam intercepted with a promising diversion . Andrew , ' she called , why do n't you take Jonathan to see the conies . There are some little ones , Jonathan , that have n't opened their eyes yet . ' This suggestion was acted upon with alacrity . When the children had scampered away , Naomi turned to Marcellus . What 's all this about the donkey ? ' she inquired , smiling . Marcellus recrossed his long legs and wished that he had been included in the expedition to inspect the conies . I think Jonathan has told it all , ' he replied , negligently . I found a lazy little donkey that nobody wanted and gave him to Jonathan . There was a lame lad in the neighborhood and Jonathan generouslypresented him with the donkey . We thought that was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want his good-heartedness to go to his head , ' put inJustus , firmly . He 's already much impressed . ' But Jonathan is only a child , Barsabas Justus , ' protested Miriam . Of course ! ' murmured Martha . I know , ' mumbled Justus , stroking his beard . But we ca n't have him spoiled , Miriam . If you have an opportunity , speak to him about it . . . . Well , Reuben , what 's the prospect for the vineyard ? ' Better than usual , Justus . ' Reuben slowly rose from his chair . Want to walk out and have a look at the vines ? ' They ambled away . Presently Naomi remembered something she had to do in the kitchen . Aunt Martha , with a little nod and a smile , thought she might help . Miriam bent over her work attentivelyas they disappeared around the corner of the house . You have been much in my thoughts , Marcellus , ' she said softly , after a silence which they both had been reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to come back . ' Marcellus drew his chair closer . And now that you 're here '  --  Miriam smiled into his eyes cornpanionably  --  what shall we talk about first ? ' I am much interested in the story of that carpenter who did so many things for your people . ' Miriam 's eyes widened happily . I knew it ! ' she cried . How could you have known it ? ' wondered Marcellus.  |p263'Oh  '  --  archly  --  ' by lots of little things  --  strung together . You knew nothing about textiles , nor does good old Justus , for that matter . You have had no experience in bargaining . It was clear that you were in Galilee on some other errand . ' ' True  --  but what made you think I was interested in Jesus ? ' Your choosing Justus to conduct you . He saw as much of Jesus as anyone except Simon and the Zebedee boys who were with him constantly . But you had me quite mystified . ' She shook her head and laughed softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had consented to come up here with you . Then it came out that you knew the Greek who works for Benyosef . He must have planned your meeting with Justus , for surely that was no accident ! The men who frequent Benyosef 's shop are friends of Jesus . So  --  I added it all up  --  and  --  ' And concluded that I had employed Justus to inform me about Jesus , ' interposed Marcellus . ' Well  --  your deduction is correct , though I must say that Justus seems to know a great deal that he is n't confiding in me . ' Have you told him why you are interested in Jesus ? ' Miriam studied his eyes as she waited for his reply . Not fully , ' admitted Marcellus , after some hesitation . But he is not suspicious of my motive . ' Perhaps if you would tell Justus exactly how you happened to become interested in Jesus , he might be more free to talk , ' suggested Miriam ; and when Marcellus failed to respond promptly , she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That 's a long story , Miriam , ' muttered Marcellus , soberly . I have plenty of time , ' she said . Tell me , Marcellus . ' A year ago , I was in Jerusalem  --  on business  --  ' he began , ratheruncertainly . But not buying homespun , ' she interjected , when he paused . It was government business , ' Marcellus went on . I was there only a few days . During that time , there was a considerable stir over the arrest of this Galilean on a charge of treason . I was present at the trial where he was sentenced to death . It seemed clear that the man was innocent . The Procurator himself said so . I had much difficulty putting the matter out of my mind . Everything indicated that Jesus was a remarkable character . So  --  when I had occasion to come to Jerusalem again , this spring , I decided to spend a few days in Galilee , and learn something more about him . ' What was it  --  about Jesus  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full confidence . His apparently effortless courage , I think , ' said Marcellus . They were all arrayed against him  --  the Government , the Temple , the merchants , the bankers , the influential voices , the money . Not a man spoke in his behalf . His friends deserted him . And yet  --  in the face of cruel abuse  --  with a lost cause  --  and certain death confrontinghim  --  he was utterly fearless . ' There was a thoughtful pause . It was impossible not to have a deep respect for a person of that fiber . I have had an immense curiosity to know what manner of man he was . ' Marcellus made a little gesture to signify that he had ended his explanation . That was n't such a very long story , after all , Marcellus , ' remarked Miriam , intent upon her work . I wonder that you were so reluctant to tell it . Did you , perhaps , omit to tell Justus some of the things you have just told me ? ' No , ' said Marcellus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you said you had not told him fully ! ' ' Well  --  what I have told you and Justus is sufficient , I think , to assure you that my interest is sincere , ' declared Marcellus . At least , Justus appears to be satisfied . There are some stories about Jesus which he hints at  --  but refuses to tell  --  because , he says , I am not ready to be told . Yesterday he was lamenting that he had talked about that wedding-feast where the guests thought the water tasted like wine . ' You did n't believe it . ' Miriam smiled briefly . I do not wonder . Perhaps Justus is right . You were n't prepared for such a story . ' A slow flush crept up her cheeks , as she added , And how did he happen to be talking of Anna 's wedding ? ' We had been hoping to reach Cana in time to hear you sing , ' said Marcellus , brightly , glad to have the conversation diverted . Naturally that led to comments about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me previously that it had occurred on the day of a wedding-feast . I pressed the subject , and he admitted that your strange experience had happened on the same day . ' The changing of water into wine  --  that was too much for you , ' laughed Miriam , sympathetically . I 'm not surprised . However '  --  she went on , seriously  --  ' you seem to have had no trouble believing in my discovery that I could sing . It has completely transformed my life  --  my singing . It instantly made me over into another kind of person , Marcellus . I was morbid , helpless , heart-sick , self-piteous , fretful , unreasonable . And now  --  as you see  --  I am happy and contented . ' She stirred him with a radiant smile , and asked , softly , Is that so much easier to understand than the transformation of water into wine ? '  |p265Shall  I infer , then , that there was a miracle performed in your case , Miriam ? ' asked Marcellus . As you like , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer not to discuss it , ' he said , and I shall not pursue you with queries . But  --  assuming that Jesus spoke a word that made you sing  --  why did he not add a word that would give you power to walk ? He straightened little Jonathan 's foot , they say . ' Miriam pushed her embroidery aside , folded her arms , and faced Marcellus with a thoughtful frown . I can not tell you how I came by my gift , ' she said , but I do not regret my lameness . Perhaps the people of Cana are more helped by the songs I sing  --  from my cot  --  than they might be if I were physically well . They all have their worries , agonies , defeats . If I had been made whole , perhaps they would say , " Oh  --  it 's easy enough for Miriam to sing and rejoice . Miriam has no trouble . Why indeed should n't she sing ? " ' You 're a brave girl ! ' declared Marcellus . She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , Marcellus . There was a time when my lameness was a great affliction  --  because I made it an affliction . It afflicted not only me but my parents and all my friends . Now that it is not an affliction , it has become a means of blessing . People are very tender in their attitude toward me . They come to visit me . They bring me little gifts . And , as Jesus said so frequently , it is more blessed to give than to receive . I am fortunate , my friend . I live in an atmosphere of love . The people of Cana frequently quarrel  --  but not with me . They are all at their best  --  with me . ' She flashed him a sudden smile . Am I not rich ? ' Marcellus made no response , but impulsively laid an open hand on the edge of the cot , and she gave him hers with the undeliberatedtrust of a little child . Shall I tell you another strange story , Marcellus ? ' she asked , quietly . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some amazing things in our Galilean villages , the news spread throughout the country , and great crowds followed him wherever he went ; hundreds , thousands ; followed along for miles and miles and days and days ! Men in the fields would drop their hoes and run to the road as the icing procession passed ; and then they too would join the throng , maybe to be gone from home for a week or more , sleeping in the open , cold and hungry , completely carried away ! Nothing mattered  --  but to be close to Jesus ! Well  --  one day  --  he was entering Jericho . You have n't been to Jericho , have you ? No  --  you came up through Samaria . Jericho is one of the larger towns of Judea . As usual , a big crowd followed him and the whole city rushed to the main thoroughfare as the word spread that he had come . At that time , the Chief Revenue Officer of Jericho was a man named Zacchaeus  --  ' A Greek ? ' broke in Marcellus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Zaccai , really ; but beingin the employ of the Roman Government  --  ' Miriam hesitated , colored a little , and Marcellus eased her embarrassment with an understanding grin . You need n't explain . These provincial officers usually alter their names as soon as they begin to curry favor with their foreign masters . It 's fashionable now to have a Greek name ; much smarter and safer than to have a Roman name . I think I know something about this Zaccai  --  alias Zacchaeus  --  without meeting him . He is a commontype of rascally tax-collector ; disloyal to everybody  --  to the Government  --  and his own countrymen . We have them in all of our provinces throughout the Empire . You ca n't have an empire , Miriam , without scoundrels in the provincial seats of government . Think you that Tiberius could govern faraway Hispania and Aquitaniaunless certain of their men betrayed their own people ? By no means ! When the provincial officers go straight , the Empire goes to pieces ! . . . But  --  pardon the interruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zacchaeus . ' He was very wealthy . The people of Jericho feared and hated him . He had spies at every keyhole listening for some rebellious whisper . Anyone suspected of grumbling about the Government was assessed higher taxes , and if he protested , he was charged with treason . Zacchaeus had built a beautiful home on a knoll at the southern boundary of Jericho and lived like a prince . There were landscaped gardens and lagoons  --  and scores of servants . ' But no friends , ' surmised Marcellus . Neither among the rich nor poor ; but Zacchaeus did not care . He had contempt for their hatred . Well  --  on this day  --  having heard that Jesus was proceeding toward Jericho , Zacchaeus came down into the city for a glimpse of him . The waiting crowd was so dense that he abandoned his carriage and struggled through the multitude to reach a spot where he might see . A legionary , recognizinghim , assisted him to climb up into the fork of a tree , though this was forbidden to anyone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stopped by the tree . He called to Zacchaeus , addressing him by name , though they had never met , saying , " May I dine with you today ? " ' And what did the people of Jericho think of that ? ' wondered Marcellus.  |p267They  were indignant , of course , ' said Miriam . And Jesus ' closest friends were very unhappy . Zacchaeus had been so mean  --  and now Jesus had singled him out for special attention . Many said , " This Galilean is no better than the priests , who are ever truckling to the rich . ' I suppose Zacchaeus made the most of their discomfiture , ' commentedMarcellus . He was much flattered ; hurried down from the tree and swaggeredproudly at Jesus ' side as the procession moved on . And when they arrived at his beautiful estate , he gave orders that the multitude might enter the grounds and wait  --  ' While he and his guest had dinner , ' assisted Marcellus . They must not have liked that . ' No  --  they were deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great marble house of Zacchaeus . After they had sat waiting for almost an hour , Zacchaeus came out and beckoned to the people . They scrambled to their feet and ran to hear what he might say . He was much disturbed . They could see that something had happened to him . The haughtiness and arrogance was gone from his face . Jesus stood a little way apart from him , sober and silent . The great multitude stood waiting , every man holding his breath and staring at this unfamiliar face of Zacchaeus . And then he spoke , humbly , brokenly . He had decided , he said , to give half of all he owned to feed the poor . To those whom he had defrauded , he would make abundant restitution . ' But  --  what had happened ? ' demanded Marcellus . What had Jesus said to him ? ' Miriam shook her head . Nobody knows , ' she murmured ; then , with averted , reminiscent eyes , she added , half to herself : Maybe he did n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes until the man saw  --  reflected there  --  the image of the person he was meant to be . ' That is a strange thing to say , ' remarked Marcellus . I 'm afraid I do n't understand . ' Many people had that experience , ' said Miriam , softly . When Jesus looked directly into your eyes  --  ' She broke off suddenly , and leaned far forward to face him at close range . Marcellus , ' she went on , in an impressive tone lowered almost to a whisper , if you had ever met Jesus  --  face to face  --  and he had looked into your eyes until  --  until you could n't get away  --  you would have no trouble believing that he could do anything  --  anything he pleased ! If he said , " Put down your crutches ! " you would put them down . If he said , " Pay back the money you have stolen ! " you would pay it back . '  | She closed her eyes and relaxed against the cushions . Her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he said , " Now you may sing for joy ! " ventured Marcellus , you would sing ? ' Miriam did not open her eyes , but a wisp of a smile curved her lips . After a moment , she sat up with suddenly altered mood , reclaimedher hand , patted her curls , and indicated that she was ready to talk of something far afield . Tell me more about this Greek who worked for Benyosef , ' she suggested . Evidently he too is interested in Jesus , or he would n't have had the confidence of the men who meet one another there . ' It will be easy to talk about Demetrius , ' replied Marcellus , for he is my closest friend . In appearance he is tall , athletic , handsome . In mind , he is widely informed , with a sound knowledge of the classics . At heart , he is loyal and courageous . As to his conduct , I have never known him to do an unworthy thing . ' Marcellus paused for a moment , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented Demetrius to me  --  a birthday gift . ' But  --  you said he is your closest friend ! ' exclaimed Miriam . How can that be ? Does he not resent being enslaved ? ' No man can be expected to like slavery , Miriam ; but , once you have been a slave , there is not very much you could do with your freedom if you achieved it . I have offered Demetrius his liberty . He is free to come and go as he likes . ' You must have been a good master , Marcellus , ' said Miriam , gently . Not always . At times  --  especially during the past year  --  I have made Demetrius very unhappy . I was moody , restless , wretched , sick . ' And why was that ? ' she asked . Would you like to tell me ? ' Not on this fair day , ' rejoined Marcellus , soberly . Besides  --  I am well now . I need not burden you with it . ' As you please , ' she consented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Benyosef 's shop ? ' That is a long story , Miriam . ' ' You  --  and your long stories , ' she put in , dryly . Marcellus feigned a wince  --  and smiled . Briefly , then  --  we were in Athens . Through no fault of his , and in defense of some helpless people , Demetrius engaged in combat with a man who held a position of authority , but had not been advised that a blow delivered by this Greek slave would stun an ox . It was a well-justified battle , albeit one-sided and of short duration . But we thought it prudent for Demetrius to lose no time increasingp269the distance between himself and the Athenian jail . So  --  he drifted to Jerusalem , and because he had some knowledge of carding and spinning  --  ' And how had he picked that up ? ' asked Miriam , busy again with her precise stitches . At a weaver 's shop in Athens . He was studying Aramaic under the weaver 's instruction  --  and made himself useful . ' Was that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you learn carding and spinning , too ? ' No , ' laughed Marcellus . Just Aramaic  --  such as it is . ' That was in preparation for this tour of Galilee , I think , ' venturedMiriam . And when you have learned all you wish to know about Jesus  --  what then ? ' My plans are uncertain . ' Marcellus frowned his perplexity . I must go back to Rome , though my return is not urgent . Naturally I want to rejoin my family and friends , but  --  ' Miriam took several little stitches before she looked up to ask , almost inaudibly  --  But what ? ' Something tells me I am going to feel quite out of place in Rome , ' he confessed . I have been much impressed by what I have heard of your brave Galilean 's teachings about human relations . They seem so reasonable , so sensible . If they became popular , we could have a new world . And , Miriam , we must have a new world ! Things ca n't go on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her work and gave him her full attention . She had not seen him in such a serious mood before . During these past few days , ' he went on , I have had a chance to look at the world from a different angle . It was n't that I had never stopped to think about its injustice , its waste , its tragic unhappiness . But  --  out here in this quiet country  --  I lie at night , looking up at the stars , and suddenly I recall Rome !  --  its greed and gluttony at the top ; its poverty and degradation growing more and more desperateall the way down to the bottom of damp dungeons and galleys and quarries . And Rome rules the world ! The Emperor is a lunatic . The Prince Regent is a scoundrel . They rule the world ! Their armies control the wretched lives of millions of people ! ' He paused , patted a damp brow , and muttered , Forgive me , my friend , for haranguing you . ' Would it not be wonderful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Impossible ! ' expostulated Marcellus . Maybe not , ' said Miriam , quietly. $ He studied her eyes , wondering if she were really serious , and was amazed at her sober sincerity . You ca n't be in earnest ! ' he said . Besides  --  Jesus is dead . ' Are you sure of that ? ' she asked , without looking up . I agree that his teachings are not dead , and something should be done to carry them to as many people as can be reached ! ' Do you intend to tell your friends about him  --  when you go home ? ' Marcellus sighed . They would think me crazy . ' Would your father think you were crazy ? ' He would , indeed ! My father is a just man of generous heart , but he has contempt for people who interest themselves in religion . He would be embarrassed  --  and annoyed , too  --  if I were to discussthese things with our friends . ' Might he not think it brave of you ? ' Brave ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad taste ! ' Justus and Reuben were sauntering in from the vineyard , much occupied with their low-voiced conversation . How long will you be here , Marcellus ? ' asked Miriam , with undisguised concern . Will I see you again ; tomorrow , maybe ? ' Not tomorrow . We go to Capernaum tomorrow , Justus says . He wants me to meet an old man named Nathaniel . Ever hear of him ? ' Of course ! You will like him . But you are coming back to Cana , are n't you , before you return to Jerusalem ? ' I 'd like to . ' Please . Now you let me have a word with Justus , alone ; will you ? ' Justus , ' said Marcellus , as the men approached , I shall go back to the village , and meet you there at your convenience . ' He offered his hand to Reuben , who clasped it cordially . EvidentlyJustus had given Reuben a friendly account of him . Good-bye , Miriam , ' he said , taking her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marcellus , ' she said . I shall be looking for you . ' The bearded Galilean stood by and watched them exchange a lingering look . Reuben frowned a little , as if the situation perplexed him . The frown said that Reuben did n't want his girl hurt . This Roman would go away and forget all about her , but Miriam would remember . You 're coming back this way , then , ' said Reuben to Justus , as Marcellus moved away.  |p271It  seems so . ' Justus grinned . Let me tell Naomi that you will tarry and break bread with us , ' said Reuben . When they were alone , Miriam motioned to Justus to sit down beside her . Why do n't you tell Marcellus everything ? ' she asked . He is deeply concerned . It seems he knows so little . He was in Jerusalem and attended the trial at the Insula , heard Jesus sentenced to death , and knows that he was crucified . And that is all . So far as he is aware , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him ? ' I intend to , Miriam , when he is prepared to hear it . He would not believe it if I were to tell him now . ' Justus moved closer and lowered his voice . I thought perhaps you would tell him . ' I almost did . Then I wondered if you might not have some reason  --  unknown to me  --  for keeping it a secret . I think Marcellushas a right to know everything now . He thinks it such a pity that no plans have been made to interest people in Jesus ' teachings . Ca n't you tell him about the work they are doing in Jerusalem  --  and Joppa  --  and Caesarea ? He has n't the faintest idea of what is going on ! ' Very well , ' nodded Justus . I shall tell him  --  everything . ' Today ! ' urged Miriam . Tell me truly , daughter , ' said Justus , soberly . Are you losing your heart to this foreigner ? ' Miriam took several small , even stitches before she looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit foreign to me , ' she said , softly . Aimlessly sauntering back to the tent Marcellus began sorting over the homespun he had accumulated , wondering what he should do with it . Now that there was no longer any reason for pretending an interest in such merchandise , the articles already purchased were of no value to him . The thought occurred  --  and gave him pleasure  --  that he might take them to Miriam . She would be glad to see that they were distributed among the poor . He took up a black robe and held it against the light . It was of good wool and well woven . He had paid twenty shekels for it . Fifteen would have been enough , but the woman was poor . Besides , he had been trying to make a favorable impression on Justus by dealing generously with his fellow countrymen . With nothing better to entertain him , Marcellus sat down on the edge of his cot , with the robe in his hands , and indulged in some leisurely theorizing on the indeterminate value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor invested by the woman who wove it , on a basis of an adequate wage per hour for such experiencedworkmanship , the robe was easily worth thirty shekels . But not in Sepphoris , where she lived ; for the local market was not active . In Sepphoris it was worth twelve shekels . A stranger would have been asked fifteen . Marcellus had made it worth twenty . Now it was n't worth anything ! He would give it to Miriam , who had no use for it , and it still would n't be worth anything until she had donated it to someone who needed it . At that juncture , the robe would begin to take on some value again , though just how much would be difficult to estimate . If the man who received this excellent robe should be inspired by it to wash his hands and face and mend his torn sandals  --  thereby increasing public confidence in his character , and enablinghim to find employment at a better wage  --  the robe might eventually turn out to be worth more than its original cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalawag , he might sell it for whateverit would fetch , which would n't be much ; for no person of any substance would want  --  at any price  --  a garment that had been in the possession of this probably verminous tramp . You could amuse yourself all day with speculations concerning the shifting values of material things . Marcellus had been doing an unusual amount of new thinking , these past few days , on the subject of property . According to Justus , Jesus had had much to say about a man 's responsibility as a possessorof material things . Hoarded things might easily become a menace ; a mere fire-and-theft risk ; a breeding-ground for destructiveinsects ; a source of worry . Men would have plenty of anxieties , but there was no sense in accumulating worries over things ! That kind of worry destroyed your character . Even an unused coat , hanging in your closet ; it was n't merely a useless thing that did nobody any good ; it was an active agent of destruction to your life . And your life must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  Jesus had demanded  --  if he were to gain the whole world  --  and lose his own life ? A bit bewildered by this statement , Marcellus had inquired : What did he mean , Justus , about the importance of saving your own life ? He did n't seem to be much worried about losing his ! He could have saved it if he had promised Pilate and the priests that he would go home and say nothing more to the people about his beliefs.  |p273Well  , sir '  --  Justus had tried to explain  --  ' Jesus did n't mean quite the same thing that you have in mind when he talked about a man 's life . You see  --  Jesus was n't losing his life when they crucifiedhim , but he would have lost it if he had recanted and gone home . Do you understand what I mean , Marcellus ? ' No  --  I ca n't say that I do . To speak that way about life is simply trifling with the accepted definition of the word . I believe that when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps lost it in a good cause ; perhaps still living  --  for a little while  --  in the memory of those who believed in him and cherished his friendship . But if our human speech is of any use at all , a man who is dead has lost his life . ' Not necessarily , ' protested Justus . Not if his soul is still alive . Jesus said we need have no fear of the things that kill the body . We should fear only the things that kill the soul . ' And when Marcellushad shrugged impatiently , Justus had continued , The body is n't very important ; just a vehicle ; just a kit of tools  --  to serve the soul . ' He had chuckled over Marcellus ' expression of disgust . You think that sounds crazy ; do n't you ? ' he added , gently . Of course ! ' Marcellus had shrugged . And so do you ! ' I admit it 's not easy to believe , ' conceded Justus . And then Marcellus had stopped in the road  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had delivered what for him was a long speech . Justus , ' he began , I must tell you candidly that while I am much interested in the sensible philosophy of your dead friend Jesus , I hope you will not want to report any more statements of that nature . I have a sincere respect for this man 's mind , and I do n't wish to lose it . ' He had half-expected Justus to be glum over this rebuke , but the big fellow had only grinned and nodded indulgently . I did n't mean to be offensive , ' said Marcellus . I am not troubled , ' said Justus , cordially . It was my fault . I was going too fast for you ; offering you meat when you should have milk . ' He tossed the black robe aside and examined a white shawl with a fringe . He could n't imagine his mother wearing it , but the woman who had made it had been proud of her handiwork . He remembered how reluctant she was to see it go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She should have been permitted to keep the shawl . It meant more to her than it could possibly mean to anyone else . Such things should never be sold ; or bought , either . Marcellus recalled the feeling of self-reproach he had often experienced at lavish banquets in Rome where the wines were cooled with ice that had been brought from the northern mountains by relays of runners who sometimes died of exhaustion . No honest man could afford such wine . It had cost too much . Well  --  he would give all of these garments to Miriam . She would put them to good use . But  --  would n't it be rather ungracious to let Miriam know that these things , fabricated with great care by her own fellow countrymen , were n't worth carrying away ? But they are gifts , ' he would say to Miriam . The people who receive them will be advantaged . ' And then Miriam would have a right to say , though she probably would n't , How can they be gifts , Marcellus , when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered with ? ' And then , assuming that Miriam had said that , he could reply : But so far as the people are concerned who get these things , they would be gifts ; would n't you say ? ' No , ' he thought she might reply , they would never be gifts . You see , Marcellus  --  ' And then she would go on to explain again how Jesus had felt about gifts . He pitched the heavy white shawl back onto the pile of homespunand glanced up to see a tall , lean , rugged-faced fellow standingat the door of the tent . The visitor grinned amiably and Marcellusinvited him to come in . He eased himself down on a campstool , crossed his long legs , and said his name was Hariph . Doubtless you came to see Justus , ' said Marcellus , cordially . He is at Reuben 's house . If you call this afternoon , I think he will be here . ' Hariph nodded , but made no move to go ; sat slowly swinging his pendent foot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture of the tent , the heap of homespun , and the urbane stranger from Rome . I think I have heard Justus speak of you , ' said Marcellus , feeling that if Hariph meant to stay awhile some conversation might be appropriate . You are a potter , I believe . You make water-jarsandwine-jars  --  and things like that . ' Hariph nodded and the grin widened a little . Tell me , ' went on Marcellus , hopefully , is it customary to use the same sort of jar either for wine or water ? ' Oh , yes , sir , ' replied Hariph , with deliberate professional dignity . Many do that . Water or wine  --  it 's all the same . Oil , too . Same pot.  |p275But  I suppose that after you 've had oil in a pot , you would n't want to put wine in it , ' observed Marcellus , sensibly enough , he thought . ' No  --  that would n't be so good , ' agreed Hariph . The wine would taste of oil . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in a jar that had held wine , ' pursued Marcellus . The water might taste like wine . ' Hariph stopped swinging his foot and gazed squintingly toward the street , the fine lines on his temple deepening . Marcellus surmisedthat the town gossip was trying to decide whether it would be prudent to discuss the matter . After some delay , he turned to his young host and gratified him by saying : Did Justus tell you ? ' Yes : Did you believe it ? ' asked Hariph . No , ' replied Marcellus , firmly . I should be much interested in hearing what you think about it . ' Well , sir , ' rejoined Hariph , we ran out of wine at the wedding of my daughter Anna , and when Jesus came he made wine  --  out of water . I do n't know how . I just know that he did it . ' Did you taste it ? ' Yes , sir . I never tasted wine like that  --  before or since ? What was it  --  a heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwed up his face indecisively . It was of a delicate flavor . ' ' Red ? ' queried Marcellus . White , ' remembered Hariph . White as water ? ' Yes , sir . ' Hariph 's eyes collided briefly with Marcellus ' dry smile , and drifted away . Nothing further was said for a long moment . I am told that everyone was very fond of Jesus , ' remarked Marcellus . Indeed they were , sir ! ' responded Hariph . He came late , that day . You should have seen them when he appeared ; the shouts of greeting ; many leaving their places to crowd about him . It was so , wherever he went , sir . Nobody had eyes for anyone else . ' Had you ever kept wine in those jars , Hariph ? ' asked Marcellus . Yes , sir , ' admitted Hariph . Marcellus nodded his head slowly and grinned . ' Well  --  thank you for telling me , ' he said . I was almost sure there must be an explanation . ' He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall I tell Justus you will be back later ? '  | Hariph had not risen . His face was perplexed . If it was only that one thing , sir , ' he said , quite unaffected by his dismissal  --  ' if it had been only that one time  --  ' Marcellus sat down again and gave respectful attention . But  --  from that day on , sir , ' continued Hariph , deliberately , there were many strange happenings . ' So I have heard , ' admitted Marcellus . Let me ask you : did you see any of these mysterious things done , or did you just learn about them from others ? Strange stories always grow in the telling , you know . ' Has anyone told you , ' asked Hariph , how Jesus fed a crowd of five thousand people when he had nothing but a little basketful of bread and a couple of smoked fish ? ' No , ' said Marcellus , eagerly . Tell me , please . ' Perhaps Justus will tell you , if you ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when it happened . ' Were you there , Hariph ? ' ' Yes  --  but I was rather far back in the crowd . ' Well , tell me what you saw . I shall be much interested in your view of it . Where did all this happen ? ' It was n't so very long after our wedding . Jesus had begun goingabout through the villages , talking with the people , and large crowds were following him . ' Because of what he said ? ' interposed Marcellus . Partly  --  but mostly because of the reports that he was healing all manner of diseases , and giving blind men their sight , and  --  ' Do you believe that  --  about the blind men ? ' Yes , sir ! ' declared Hariph . I saw one man who could see as well as you can , sir . ' Had you known him before ? ' No , sir , ' confessed Hariph . But his neighbors said he had been blind for years . ' ' Did you know them  --  his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Sychar . ' That kind of testimony , ' observed Marcellus , judicially , would n't get very far in a court of law ; but you must have some good reason for believing it .... Well  --  go on , please , about the strange feast . ' Always there were big crowds following him , ' continued Hariph , undismayed by the Roman 's incredulity . And sometimes they were n't easy to handle . Everybody wanted to be close enough to sec these wonderful things happen ; and you never could tell when it would be . It 's no small matter , sir '  --  Hariph interrupted himself to comment  --  ' when one of your own neighbors , as you might say ,  |p277who  had grown up with the other youngsters of his village , and had worked at a carpenter 's bench , takes to talking as nobody else had ever talked ; and stopping in the middle of a speech to point his finger at some old man who might be standing in the front row , with his mouth open and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly the old man yells " Ahhh ! "  --  and begins dancing up and down , shouting , " I can hear ! I can hear ! I can hear ! " And Jesus would n't have stopped talking : he would just point at the man  --  and he could hear ! ' Did you ever see Jesus do that , Hariph ? ' demanded Marcellus . No , sir  --  but there were plenty who did ; people whose word you could trust , too ! ' Very well , ' consented Marcellus , indulgently . Now tell me about the feeding of the five thousand people . You say you saw that ? ' It was this way , sir . It all began over in Capernaum . A lot of strange things had happened , and the news had spread abroad until a great crowd had collected , a disorderly crowd it was ; for nobody was trying to keep them from pushing and jostling and tramping on one another . ' It 's a wonder they did n't call out the legionaries , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes  --  and many of the soldiers were there ; but I do n't think the priests and elders of the city wanted the crowd to be kept in order . They probably hoped something would happen , a bad accident , maybe , so that Jesus could be arrested for disturbing the peace . ' But did n't he have a few close friends who might have demanded the people to cease this confusion ? ' Yes , sir  --  Jesus had many close friends . He named twelve of them to be known as his disciples . But they had no authority to give orders to that big crowd . They were really beside themselves to know what to do . Reuben and I had gone over to Capernaum  --  like everybody else  --  to see what was going on . When we arrived , the people were milling about in the central plaza . I never was in such a press , sir ! Men and women with sick children in their arms , being pushed roughly in the swaying pack . Blind men . Half-dead people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lepers in the crowd . ' Hariph chuckled grimly . Nobody jostled them ! ' It 's a wonder they were n't arrested , ' put in Marcellus . Well , sir , ' drawled Hariph , when a leper is out on his own , not even a legionary is anxious to lay hands on him . And you could n't blame the poor lepers , sir . They hoped to be healed , too . ' ' Is Jesus supposed to have healed lepers , Hariph ? ' Marcellus ' tone was loaded with doubt . V Yes , sir .... Well , when the crowd became unmanageable , Jesus began retreating down toward the shore . Several of his disciples had run on ahead and engaged a boat . And before the people realized what was happening , Jesus and his twelve closest friends were pulling away from the beach . ' Was n't that a rather heartless thing to do ? ' queried Marcellus . He had tried to talk to them , sir , but there was too much confusion . You see  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him talk , but to witness some strange thing . They would n't even give way to the cripples or the blind or the very sick ones borne on cots . And then , too , Jesus had just received bad news . One of his best friends , whom old Herod Antipas had thrown into prison , had just been beheaded . Word of it came to Jesus while he was trying to deal with that unruly mob . You ca n't blame him , sir , for wanting to get away . ' Quite to the contrary , Hariph ! ' declared Marcellus . It 's gratifyingto hear that he could be puzzled about something . It was lucky that there was a boat available . Was the crowd enraged ? ' ' Oh  --  they behaved each according to his own temper , ' rememberedHariph . Some shook their fists and shouted imprecations . Some shook their heads and turned away . Some wept . Some stood still and said nothing , as they watched the boat growing smaller : And what did you and Reuben do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . And then somebody noticed that the boat was veering toward the north . A great shout went up , and the people began racing toward the beach . It seemed likely that the party in the boat was making for some place up in the neighborhood of Bethsaida . ' How far was that ? ' inquired Marcellus . For the boat  --  about six miles . For the crowd  --  nearly nine . It was a hot day and rough going . That country up there is mostly desert . But everybody went , or so it seemed . It was a singular sight , sir , that long procession stumbling over the stones and through the dried weeds . It was far past midday when we found them . ' Did Jesus seem annoyed when the crowd arrived ? ' ' No  --  just sorry , ' murmured Hariph . ' His face was sad . The people were so very tired . They were n't pushing one another  --  not after that trip ! ' He laughed a little at the recollection . Did he chide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir . He did n't say anything for a long time . The people flung themselves down to rest . Justus told me afterward that Simon urged Jesus to talk to them , but he wanted to wait until all of themp279had arrived ; for some were carrying their sick , and were far behind . He did n't speak a word until they were all there . And then he stood up and began to talk . He did not reprove us for trailing him to this place , nor did he have aught to say of the people 's rudeness . He talked about all of us being neighbors . We were all one family . Everyone was very quiet . There was n't a sound  --  but the voice of Jesus . And remember , sir ; there were five thousand people in that crowd ! ' Hariph 's chin twitched involuntarily . He cleared his throat . Marcellus studied his face soberly . I am not one to weep easily , sir , ' he went on , huskily . But there was something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nothing but a great crowd of little children  --  tired and worn out  --  and here was a man  --  the only man there  --  and all the rest of us nothing but quarrelsome , stingy , greedy , little children . His voice was very calm , but  --  if you can believe me , sir  --  his words were as ointment on our wounds . While he talked , I was saying to myself , " I have never lived ! I have never known how to live ! This man has the words of life ! " It was as if God Himself were speaking , sir ! Everybody was much moved . Men 's faces were strained and their tears were flowing . ' Hariph wiped his eyes with the backs of his hands . After a while , ' he continued , brokenly , Jesus stopped talking and motioned to some who had carried a sick man all that long way , and they brought their burden and put it down at Jesus ' feet . He said something to the sick man . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man got up ! And so did everybody else  --  as if Jesus had suddenly pulled us all to our feet . And everyone drew a gasp of wonder ! ' Hariph grinned pensively and faced Marcellus directly with childishly entreating eyes . Do you believe what I am telling you , sir ? ' It is difficult , Hariph , ' said Marcellus , gently . But I think you believe what you are saying . Perhaps there is some explanation . ' That may be , sir , ' said Hariph , politely . And then there were many , many others who went to Jesus to be healed of their diseases ; not jostling to be first , but waiting their turn . ' He hesitated for a moment , embarrassed . But I shall not weary you with that , ' he went on , seeing you do not believe . ' You were going to tell me how he fed them , ' prompted Marcellus . Yes , sir . It was growing late in the afternoon . I had been so moved by the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being hungry . Reuben and I , knowing there would be nothing out there to eat , had stopped at a market-booth in Capernaum and had bought some bread and cured fish . In any other kind of crowd , we would have eaten our luncheon . But now that we had begun to feel hungry , I was ashamed to eat what I had before the faces of the men about me ; for , as I have said , Jesus had been talking about us all being of one family , and how we ought to share what we had with one another . I should have been willing to divide with the man next to me ; but I did n't have much more than enough for myself . So  --  I did n't eat ; nor did Reuben . ' I daresay there were plenty of men in the crowd who faced the same dilemma , ' surmised Marcellus . ' Well  --  the disciples were around Jesus telling him he had better dismiss the people , so they could go to the little villages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head and told them that the people would be fed . They were much bewilderedand worried . There was a small boy , sitting very close and overhearing this talk . He had a little basket , his own lunch , not very much ; just enough to feed a boy . He went to Jesus with his basket and said he was willing to share what he had . ' Marcellus ' eyes lighted , and he leaned forward attentively . Go on ! ' he demanded . This is wonderful . ' Yes  --  it really was wonderful , sir . Jesus took the basket and held it up for the people to see . And then he told how the boy wanted to share his food with all of the people . And he looked up and thanked God for the little boy 's gift . It was very , very quiet , sir . Then he began breaking the small loaves into bits , and the fish he tore into little shreds ; and he gave these fragments to his disciplesand told them to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Marcellus . Well  --  no , sir . We did n't laugh , though almost everyone smiled over such a big crowd being fed on almost nothing , as you might say . As I told you , I had been ashamed to bring out the food I had , and now I was ashamed not to ; so I unwrapped my bread and fish , and broke off a piece , and offered it to the man next to me . ' Wonderful ! ' shouted Marcellus . Was he glad to get it ? ' He had some of his own , ' said Hariph , adding , quickly , But there were plenty of people who did not have any food along with them , sir . And everyone was fed , that day ! After it was over , they gathered up a dozen basketfuls of fragments , left over . ' It sounds as if some other people , besides you and Reuben , had had the forethought to bring some provisions along , ' speculate ! Marcellus . They probably would n't have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a marvelous story , Hariph ! ' You believe it , sir ? ' Hariph was happily surprised.  |p281Indeed  I do ! And I believe it was a miracle ! Jesus had inspired those stingy , selfish people to be decent to one another ! It takes a truly great man to make one harmonious family out of a crowd like that ! I ca n't understand the healing , Hariph ; but I believe in the feeding ! And I 'm glad you wanted to tell me ! ' THEY were on the way from Cana to Capernaum . All day their narrow road had been gaining altitude , not without occasional dips into shallow valleys , but tending upward toward a lofty plateau where the olive-green terrain met an azure sky set with masses of motionless white clouds . It had been a fatiguing journey , with many pauses for rest , and as the shadows slanted farther to the east , the two men trudged the steepening grade in silence , leaving the little pack-train far behind . They were nearing the top now . Justus had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great rock they had sighted two hours ago . There was a cool spring , he said , and plenty of forage . He hoped they would find the spot untenanted . Yes  --  he knew the place well . He had camped there many times . There was a splendid view . Jesus had loved it . Throughout this tour of Galilee , Marcellus had paid very little attention to the physical characteristics of the province . Until now , the landscape had been unremarkable , and he had been fully preoccupiedby the strange business that had brought him here . Marcellushad but one interest in this otherwise undistinguished land of rock-strewn fields , tiny vineyards , and apathetic villages drowsing in the dust around an ancient well . He was concerned only about a mysterious man who had walked these winding roads , a little while ago , with crowds of thousands surging about him . It was not easy today , on this sleepy old highway , to picture either the number or the temper of that multitude . The people must have come from long distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickly populated . Nor was it easy to imagine the confusion , the jostling , the shouting . Such Galileans as Marcellus had seen were not emotional , not responsive ; a bit stolid , indeed . That weary , weather-beaten woman , leaning on her hoe , in the frowsy little garden they had just passed  --  had she , too , bounded out of her kitchen , leaving their noonday pottage on the fire , to join in that curious throng ? This bearded man in the meadow  --  her husband , obviously ; now sluggishly mowing wisps of grass with his great-grandfather 's scythe  --  had he run panting to the edge of the crowd , trying to scramble through the sweating pack for a glimpse of the face of Jesus ? It was almost incredible that this silent , solemn , stodgy province could ever have been haled out of its age-long lethargy and stirred to such a pitch of excitement . Even Justus , looking back upon it all , could only shake his shaggy head and mutter that the whole affair was quite beyond comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflected Justus , soberly : many of the people were hysterical and had reported all manner of strange occurrences , some of which had never been satisfactorily confirmed . The air had been full of wild rumors , Justus said . A few Nazarenes had been quoted as remembering that when Jesus was a lad , at play with them , he had fashioned birds of clay , and the birds had come to life and had flown away . You could hear such tales by the score , and they had confused the public 's estimate of Jesus , making him seem a mountebank in the opinion of many intelligent people . But these passionate throngs of thousands who followed , day after day , indifferent to their hunger and discomfort  --  all Galilee knew that this was true because all Galilee had participated . You might have good reasons for doubting the validity of some of these miracle stories , but you could n't doubt this one ! Obscure little Galilee , so slow and stupid that its bucolic habits and uncouth dialect were stock jokes in Judea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned . Everybody talking at once ! Everybody shouting questionswhich nobody tried to answer ! Camels were left standing in their harness , hitched to water-wheels . Shuttles were left , midway of the open warp . Tools lay scattered on the floor of the carpenter shop . Plows stopped in the furrow . Fires burned out in the brickkiln . Everybody took to the road , on foot , on donkeys , on carts , on crutches . Helpless invalids who could n't be left were bundled up on stretchers and carried along . Nothing mattered but to follow the young man who looked into your eyes and made you well  --  or ashamed  --  or tightened your throat with longing for his calm strength and floral purity . Now the bright light had gone out . The great crowds had scattered . The inspired young man was dead . Galilee had gone back to sleep . It was a lonesome land . Perhaps the Galileans themselves were now conscious of its loneliness , after having briefly experienced this unprecedented activity.  |p283Marcellus  wished he knew how much of Jesus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a few of them  --  those who had known him best and owed him much  --  to rememberand remember until they died ; people like Miriam . Or were there any more like Miriam ? Justus had said that some of these Galileans had been completely transformed , almost as if they had been born again . Certain men of low estate had learned new occupations . Certain beggars had become productive . A few publicans had become respected citizens . - Women who had been known as common scolds were going about doing deeds of kindness . But perhaps the majority had been unable to hold on to their resolutions . He must press Justus for some more information about that . Now they had arrived at the top of the terrain , every step adding depth to the view . Far to the north lay a range of snow-capped mountains . A few steps farther on , and the distant turrets and domes of a modern city glistened in the declining sun . There was no need to inquire its name : it had to be Tiberias . Marcellus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly toward the northern rim , turning his head from side to side , and peering intently in all directions , as if he had expected to meet a friend up here . Suddenly the whole breath-taking panorama was spread before them and Marcellus had his first sight of the deep-blue lake that had figured so much in his guide 's conversation . It had been around this little sea that Jesus had spent most of his days . Justus dropped wearily to the ground , folded his arms , and sat in silent contemplation of the scene . Marcellus , a little way apart , reclined on his elbows . Far in the distance was a slanting sail . All along the shoreline , flat-roofed villages straggled down to the water 's edge . After a long interval , Marcellus stirred . So  --  this is the Sea of Galilee ! ' he said , half to himself . Justus nodded slowly . Presently he pointed to the farthest settlementthat could be seen . Capernaum , ' he said . Eight miles . ' I daresay this lake has some tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' he went on , with a slow gesture that swept the landscape , has the general behavior of those people been greatly altered by the career of Jesus ? ' It is hard to say , ' replied Justus . They do not talk much about it . They are afraid . The Roman fort is close by . One could easily get into trouble by asking questions . One only knows what has happened in the lives of one 's friends . I expect to visit some of them while we are here . '  | ' Will I see them ? ' inquired Marcellus , doubtfully . ' Not many , ' said Justus , frankly . ' You will see old Bartholomew , as I told you . He has a story I want you to hear . Bartholomew will not be afraid to talk to you , after I assure him it will be safe . ' He turned about and faced Marcellus with a reminiscent smile . ' You might be interested in knowing how Jesus and Bartholomew first met . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when Jesus and Philip passed the house . And Jesus cheerilywaved a hand and said , " Peace be upon you , Nathanael ! " ' ' I thought his name was Bartholomew , ' put in Marcellus . ' That 's the amusing part of it , ' chuckled Justus . ' It is not customarywith us to call venerable men by their given names . I do n't suppose old Bartholomew had heard himself called Nathanael for at least twoscore years . And here was this young stranger taking an immense liberty with him . ' ' Was he offended ? ' asked Marcellus , with a grin . ' Well  --  perhaps not seriously offended , but certainly astonished . He called Jesus to come to him , perhaps intending to take him to task for what looked like a bit of impudence . Philip told me the story . He said that old Bartholomew was looking stern as he waited for Jesus to approach . Then his eyes widened and softened ; and he smiled and said , " You knew my name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means ' Godgiven ' it is fitting , for you are an Israelite of high integrity . " ' ' That should have pleased the old man , ' observed Marcellus . ' It did , ' said Justus , soberly . ' It made him a disciple . ' ' You mean  --  he came along  --  and followed after Jesus ? ' ' Yes . There was something strange about that . The old man had long since taken to his chair in the garden , thinking his active days were ended . But he got up and went along with Jesus  --  and he rarely left his side for nearly three years . ' ' His vigor was restored ? ' Marcellus ' face showed disbelief . ' No  --  he was still an old man . It was hard work for him to keep up with the others . He got very weary indeed , and he wheezed and panted like any other hard-pressed old man  --  ' ' But he came along , ' assisted Marcellus . Yes  --  Bartholomew came along . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , invariably . And Bartholomewliked it . ' ' Perhaps Jesus did that to keep the old man going , ' suggested Marcellus . ' Maybe it made him feel younger . ' ' Well  --  it was n't only Bartholomew who felt young and immaturein the company of Jesus . ' Justus frowned and stroked hisp285beard , his habit when groping for an elusive memory . With the exception of John , all of the close friends and disciples of Jesus were older than he  --  but he was our senior  --  by years and years . Sometimes , after we had slipped away for an hour 's rest , he would say , " Come , children : we must be on our way . " But no one smiled  --  or thought it peculiar . ' ' He seemed remote ? ' asked Marcellus . Justus deliberately pondered a reply , then shook his head . ' No  --  not remote . He was companionable . You wanted to get closer to him  --  as if for protection . J think that 's why the people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move . ' ' That must have put him under a great strain , ' said Marcellus . ' Did n't he ever seem weary ? ' ' Very , very weary ! ' remarked Justus . ' But he never protested . Sometimes men would brace a shoulder against the crowd and push their way in , knocking others off their footing , but I ca n't recall that he ever rebuked anyone for it . . . . Marcellus , did you ever see a flock of little chickens climbing over one another to get under the hen 's wings ? Well  --  the hen does n't seem to notice ; just holds out her feathers , and lets them scramble in . That was his attitude . And that was our relation to him . ' ' Very strange ! ' murmured Marcellus , abstractedly . ' But I think  --  I understand  --  what you mean , ' he added , as from a distance . ' You could n't ! ' declared Justus . ' You think you understand  --  but  --  you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of us were old enough to Simon was always the leader among the disciples . I hope you meet him when you go back to Jerusalem . Simon is a very forceful , capable man . Whenever Jesus happened to be absent from us , for an hour , Simon was far and away the big man of the company , everyone deferring to him . But  --  when Jesus would rejoin us '  --  Justus grinned , pursed his lips , and slowly shook his head  --  ' Simon was just a little boy ; just a humble , helpless little boy ! A little chicken ! ' And Bartholomew  --  he was a little chicken , too ? ' ' Well , ' deliberated Justus , ' not quite in the same way , perhaps . Bartholomew never expressed his opinions so freely as Simon when Jesus was away from us . He did n't have quite so far to drop  --  as Simon . It was amazing how much fatigue the old fellow could endure . He attended the last supper they had together on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that the Master had been arrested , it was too much for Bartholomew . He was very sick . They put him to bed . By the time he recovered  --  it was all over . ' Justus closed his eyes , sighed deeply , and an expression of pain swept his face . ' It was all over , ' his lips repeated , soundlessly . ' He must be quite infirm , by this time , ' said Marcellus , anxious to lift the gloom . About the same , ' said Justus . Not much older . Not much weaker . ' He grinned a little . Bartholomew has a queer idea now . He thinks he may never die . He sits all day in the fig orchard , when the weather is fair . ' Looking up the road , perhaps , ' speculated Marcellus  --  and wishinghe might see Jesus again , coming to visit him . ' Justus had been gazing down at the lake . Now he turned his eyes quickly toward Marcellus and stared into his face . After a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned his gaze to the lake . That is exactly what old Bartholomew does , ' he murmured . All day long . He sits  --  watching the road . ' Old men get strange fancies , ' commented Marcellus . You do n't have to be old , ' said Justus , ' to get strange fancies . ' The little caravan , which had lagged on the last steep climb , now shuffled over the shoulder of the hill . Jonathan came running across . and snuggled down beside Justus . When do we have supper , Grandfather ? ' he wheedled . Quite soon , son , ' answered Justus , gently . ' Go and help the boy unload . We will join you presently . ' Little Jonathan scampered away . The lad seems in quite good spirits today , ' observed Marcellus . That 's Miriam 's work , ' declared Justus . She had a long talk with Jonathan yesterday . I think we need not worry about him now . ' ' That conversation must have been worth hearing , ' said Marcellus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ' said Justus , ' but he was deeply impressed . You noticed how quiet he was , last night . ' ' I doubt whether there is another young woman  --  of Miriam 's sort  --  in the whole world ! ' announced Marcellus , soberly . ' There is a widow in Capernaum , ' said Justus . ' Perhaps you may have an opportunity to meet her . She spends all of her time with the very poor who have sickness in their houses . Her name is Lydia . You might be interested in her story . ' ' Tell me , please . ' Marcellus sat up and gave attention . ' Lydia lost her husband , Ahira , while still quite a young woman . I do not know how it is in your country , but with us the predica/ment of a young widow is serious . She goes into retirement . Lydia was one of the most beautiful girls in Capernaum so everyone said . Ahira had been a man of considerable wealth , and their home was in keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievously afflicted with an ailment peculiar to women , and graduallydeclined until her beauty faded . Her family was most sympathetic . At great expense , they summoned the best physicians . They carried her to many healing springs . But nothing availed to check her wasting disease . The time came when it was with great difficultythat she could move about in her room . And now the whole country began to be stirred by reports of strange things that Jesus had done for many sick people . ' Justus hesitated , seemingly in doubt as to his procedure with the story . Marcellus waited with mounting curiosity . I think I had better tell you , ' continued Justus , that it was n't always easy for substantial people to have an interview with Jesus . As for the poor , they had no caste to lose . Most of them were in the habit of begging favors , and were not reticent about crowding in wherever they thought it might be to their advantage . But men and women in better circumstances  --  no matter how much they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down their natural pride and push into that clamorous multitude . Jesus regretted this matter . Often and often , he consented to talk alone with important men , late in the night , when he sorely needed his rest . ' Men who wanted to be privately cured of something ? ' asked Marcellus . Doubtless  --  but I know of some cases in which very influential men , who had no malady at all , invited Jesus into their homes for a long conference . Once we waited at the gate of Nicodemus ben Gorion , the most widely known lawyer of this region , until the cocks crew in the early morning . And there was nothing the matter with Nicodemus ; at least , nothing physical . ' Do you suppose he was warning Jesus to cease his work ? ' wonderedMarcellus . No . Nicodemus came out with him , that night , as far as the gate . Jesus was talking earnestly to him . When they parted , each man laid a hand on the other 's shoulder . We only do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say  --  it would have taken a lot of courage for a gently bred woman of means to have invaded the crowd that thronged about Jesus . ' That 's quite understandable , ' agreed Marcellus . One day , when Jesus was speaking in the public plaza in Capernaum , a well-to-do man named Jairus pushed his way through the crowd . The people made way for him when someone spoke his name . It was plain to see that he was greatly excited . He went directly to Jesus and said that his little daughter was sick unto death . Would Jesus come at once ? Without asking any questions , Jesus consented , and they started down the principal street , the crowd growing larger as they went . When they passed Lydia 's house , she watched them from the window , and saw Jairus , whom she knew , walking at Jesus ' side . ' Where were you , Justus ? ' asked Marcellus . You seem quite familiar with these details . ' As it happened , it was in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come with a message for Simon , who had serious illness at home . His wife 's mother was sick , and had become suddenly worse . I was as close to Jesus as I am to you when this thing happened . I do n't suppose Lydia would have attempted it if she had n't seen Jairus in the throng . That must have given her confidence . Summoning all her poor strength , she ran down the steps and into that crowd , desperately forced her way through , and struggled on until she was almost at Jesus ' side . Then , her courage must have failed her ; for , instead of trying to speak to him , she reached out and touched his Robe . I think she was frightened at her own audacity . She turned quickly and began forcing her way out . ' Why did n't some of you call Jesus ' attention to her ? ' asked Marcellus . ' Weir  --  defended Justus  --  ' there was a great deal of confusion  --  and it all happened so quickly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus stopped and turned about . " Who touched me ? " he demanded : You mean  --  he felt that contact  --  through his Robe ? ' exclaimed Marcellus . Justus nodded  --  and went : on . Simon and Philip reminded him that there were so many crowdingabout . Almost any of them might have brushed against him . But he was n't satisfied with that . And while he stood there , questioningthem , we heard this woman 's shrill cry . They opened the way for her to come to him . It must have been a very trying momentfor Lydia . She had lived such a sheltered life . The crowd grew suddenly quiet . ' Justus ' voice was husky as he recovered the scene . I saw many pathetic sights , through those days , ' he continued , but none more moving . Lydia came slowly , with her head bowed and her hands over her eyes . She knelt on the ground before Jesusp289and confessed that she was the one who had touched him . Then she lifted her eyes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Master ! I have been healed of my affliction ! " ' Overcome by his emotions , Justus stopped to wipe his eyes on his sleeve . Steadying his voice with an effort , he went on : Everyone was deeply touched . The people were all in tears . Jairus was weeping like a child . Even Jesus , who was always well controlled , was so moved that his eyes were swimming as he looked down into Lydia 's face . Marcellus  --  that woman gazed up at him as if she were staring into a blinding sunshine . Her body was shaking with sobs , but her face was enraptured ! It was beautiful ! ' Please go on , ' insisted Marcellus , when Justus fell silent . It was a very tender moment , ' he said , thickly . Jesus gave her both of his hands and drew her gently to her feet ; and then , as if he were speaking to a tearful little child , he said , " Be comforted , my daughter , and go in peace . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful story I ever heard , Justus , ' said Marcellus , soberly . I hardly know why I told you , ' muttered Justus . I 've no reason to think you could believe that Lydia was cured of her malady merely by touching Jesus ' Robe . ' He sat waiting , with an almost wistful interest , for a further comment from Marcellus . It was one thing to say of a narrative that it was a beautiful story ; it was quite another thing to concede its veracity . Marcellus had been adept in contriving common-sense explanations of these Galilean mysteries . The story of Lydia 's healinghad obviously moved him , but doubtless he would come forwardpresently with an attempt to solve the problem on natural grounds . His anticipated argument was so long in coming that Justus searched his face intently , astonished at its gravity . He was still more astounded when Marcellus replied , in a tone of deep sincerity : Justus  --  I believe every word of it ! ' Notwithstanding his weariness , Marcellus had much difficulty in going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had revived the memory of his own strange experiences with the Robe . It had been a long time since he had examined his mind in respect to these occurrences . He had invented reasons for the amazing effects the Robe had wrought in his own case . His explanation was by no means conclusiveor satisfying , but he had adopted it as less troublesome than a forthright admission that the Robe was haunted.  | The case , viewed rationally , began with the fact that he had had a very serious emotional shock . The sight of a crucifixion was enough to leave scars on any decent man 's soul . To have actually conducted a crucifixion was immeasurably worse . And to have crucified an innocent man made the whole affair a shameful crime . The memory of it would be an interminable torture , painful as a physical wound . Not much wonder that he had been so depressed that all his mental processes had been thrown into disarray . There was that night at the Insula when he had drunkenly consented to put on the blood-stained Robe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a stage where it could not endure this one more perfidy . A wave of sickening revulsion had swept through him , as if some punitive power  --  resident in the Robe  --  had avenged the outrage . For a long time Marcellus had suffered of that obsession . The Robe was possessed ! He shuddered when he thought of it . The Robe had become the symbol of his crime and shame . Then had come his remarkable recovery , that afternoon in Athens . His mental affliction had reached a moment of crisis . He could bear it no longer . The only way out was by suicide . And at that critical juncture , the Robe had stayed his hand . For a few hours thereafter , Marcellus had been completely mystified . When he tried to analyze the uncanny thing that had happened to him , his mind refused to work on it . Indeed , he had been so ecstatic over his release from the bondage of his melancholia that he was in no mood to examine the nature of his redemption . Such brief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an attempt to evaluate some fantastic , half-forgotten dream . The time came when he could explain his recovery even as he had explained his collapse . The Robe had been a focal point of interest on both occasions . But  --  did the Robe actually have anything to do with it ? Was n't it all subjective ? The explanation seemed sound and practical . His mind had been deeply wounded , but now it had healed . Evidently the hour had arrived , that afternoon in the cottage at the inn , when his harassed mind determined to overthrow the torturing obsession . It was a reasonable deduction , he felt . Nature was always in revolt against things that thwarted her blind but orderly processes . For many years a tree might wage a slow and silent warfare against an encumberingwall , without making any visible progress . One day the wall would topple ; not because the tree had suddenly laid hold upon some supernormal energy , but because its patient work of self-defense and self-release had reached fulfillment . The long-imprisonedtree had , freed itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this explanation . He had liked the analogy of the tree and the wall ; had liked it so well that he had set it to work on other phases of his problem . You had had a peculiar experience that had forced you to a belief in the supernatural . But your mind  --  given a chance to resume its orderly functions  --  would begin to resist that untenable thought . It was n't natural for a healthy mind to be stultified by alleged supernatural forces . No matter how convincing the evidences of supernatural power , one 's mind would proceed  --  automatically , involuntarily  --  to push this intrusive concept away , as a tree-root pushes against an offending wall . Until long after midnight , Marcellus lay on his cot , wide awake , re-examining his own rationalizings about the Robe in the light of Lydia 's experience , and getting nowhere with it . He had impulsivelytold Justus that he believed the story . There was no reason to doubt the good man 's integrity ; but , surely , somewhere along the line there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course , that day , needing only this moment of high emotional stress to effect her release . He silently repeated this over and over , trying to make it sound reasonable ; trying to make it stick . Then he agreed with himself that his theory was nonsense , and drifted off to sleep . Rousing with a start , Marcellus cautiously raised up on one elbow and peered out through the open tent-door . In the gray-blue , predawntwilight he dimly saw the figure of a tall , powerfully built , bearded man . It was quite too dark to discern the intruder 's features . His attitude did not denote furtiveness . He stood erect , apparently attempting to identify the occupants of the tent , and probably findingit impossible . Presently he moved away . As soon as he had disappeared , Marcellus arose , quietly strapped his sandals , buckled his belt , and slipped out . There had been nothingsinister in this unexpected visitation . Obviously the man was neither a thief nor an ordinary prowler . He had not acted as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable that he had arranged to meet Justus up here and had been delayed . Finding the campers still asleep , he had probably decided to wait awhile before making himself known . This seemed a reasonable surmise , for upon their arrival at the hilltop yesterday afternoon Justus had scrutinized the terrain as if expecting to be joined here by some acquaintance ; though that was a habit of his ; always scanning the landscape whenever an elevationpresented a farther view ; always peering down cross-roads ; al- ways turning about with a start whenever a door opened behind him . It was still too dark to explore the terrain in quest of the mysteriousvisitor . Marcellus walked slowly toward the northern rim of the narrow plateau where he and Justus had sat . Low in the east , beyond the impenetrable darkness that mapped the lake , the blue was beginning to fade out of the gray . Now the gray was dissolvingon the horizon and a long , slim ribbon of gleaming white appeared . Outspread lambent fingers reached up high , higher , higher into the dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow was touched with streaks of gold . Marcellus sat down to watch the dawn arrive . At not more than a stadium 's distance , also facing the sunrise , sat the unidentified wayfarer , not yet aware that he was observed . Apparently absorbed by the pageant in the east , he sat motionless with his long arms hugging his knees . As the light increased , Marcellusnoted that the man was shabbily dressed and had no pack ; undoubtedly a local resident ; a fisherman , perhaps , for the uncouth knitted cap , drawn far down over his ears , was an identifying headgearaffected by sailors . With no wish to spy on the fellow , Marcellus noisily cleared his throat . The stranger slowly turned his head ; then arose nimbly and approached . Halting , he waited for the Roman to speak first . Who are you ? ' asked Marcellus . And what do you want ? ' The newcomer ran his fingers through his beard , and smiled broadly . Then he tugged off the wretched cap from a swirl of tousled hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I had thought . ' Demetrius ! ' Marcellus leaped to his feet and they grasped each other 's hands . Demetrius !  --  how did you find me ? Have you been in trouble ? Are you being pursued ? Where did you come by such shabby clothes ? Are you hungry ? ' I learned yesterday afternoon in Cana that you were on the way to Capernaum . I have not been in much trouble , and am not now pursued . The clothes '  --  Demetrius held up his patched sleeves , and grinned  --  are they not befitting to a vagrant ? I had plenty to eat , last night . Your donkey-boy helped me to my supper and lent me a rug . ' Why did n't you make yourself known ? ' asked Marcellus , reproachfully . I wanted to see you alone , sir , before encountering Justus . ' Proceed , then , ' urged Marcellus , and tell me as much as you can . He will be waking presently . ' Stephanos told you of my flight from Jerusalem  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , sir ; but I contrived to send Stephanos a message , and he wrote me fully about your meeting . ' Demetrius surveyed his master from head to foot . You are looking fit , sir , though you 've lost a pound or two . ' Walking , ' explained Marcellus . Good for the torso ; bad for the feet . Keep on with your story now . We have n't much time . ' Demetrius tried to make it brief . He had fled to Joppa , hoping to see his master when his ship came in . He had been hungry and shelterless for a few days , vainly seeking work on the docks . One morning I saw an old man dragging a huge parcel of green hides along the wharf , ' he went on . I was so desperate for employmentthat I shouldered the reeking pelts and carried them to , the street . The old Jew trotted alongside protesting . When I put the loathsome burden down , he offered me two farthings . I refused , saying he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to carry the hides to his tannery , a half-mile up the street that fronted the beach . I said I would do it for my dinner . ' No details , Demetrius ! ' insisted Marcellus , impatiently . Get on with it ! ' These details are important , sir . The old man wanted to know what part of Samaria I had come from . Perhaps you have discoveredthat our Aramaic is loaded with Samaritan dialect . His people had lived in Samaria . His name was Simon . He talked freely and cordially , asking many questions . I told him I had worked for old Benjamin in Athens , which pleased him , for he knew about Benjamin . Then I confided that I had worked for Benyosef in Jerusalem . He was delighted . At his house , hard by the tannery , he bade me bathe and provided me with clean clothing . ' Demetrius grinned at his patches . This is it , ' he said . You shall have something better , ' said Marcellus . I am a clothingmerchant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So  --  what about this old Simon ? ' He became interested in me because I had worked for Benyosef , and asked me if I were one of them , and I said I was . ' Demetrius studied Marcellus ' face . Do you understand what I mean , sir ? ' he asked , wistfully . Marcellus nodded , rather uncertainly . Are you , really  --  one of them ? ' he inquired . I am trying to be , sir , ' responded Demetrius . It is n't easy . One is not allowed to fight , you know . You just have to take it  --  the way he did . ' You 're permitted to defend yourself ; are n't you ? ' protested Marcellus.  | ' He did n't , ' replied Demetrius , quietly . Marcellus winced and shook his head . They fell silent for a moment . ' That part of it , ' went on Demetrius , ' is always going to be difficult ; too difficult , I fear . I promised Stephanos , that morning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey the injunctions  --  and in less than an hour I had broken my word . Simon Peter  --  he is the chief of the disciples  --  the one they call " The Big Fisherman "  --  hebaptized me , just before dawn , in the presence of all the others in Benyosef 's shop , and , sir  --  ' ' Baptized you ? ' Marcellus ' perplexity was so amusing that Demetriuswas forced to smile , in spite of his seriousness . ' Water , ' he explained . They pour it on you , or put you in it , whichever is more convenient  --  and announce that you are now clean , in Jesus ' name . That means you 're one of them , and you 're expected to follow Jesus ' teachings . ' Demetrius ' eyes clouded and he shook his head self-reproachfully as he added , ' I was in a fight before my hair was dry . ' Marcellus tried to match his slave 's remorseful mood , but his grin was already out of control . ' What happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed his misdemeanor . The legionaries had a habit of stopping unarmed citizens along the road , compelling them to shoulder their packs . A great hulk of a soldier had demandedthis service of Demetrius and he had refused to obey . Then there was the savage thrust of a lance . Demetrius had stepped out of the way , and the legionary had drawn up for another onslaught . ' In taking the lance from him , ' continued Demetrius , ' I broke it . ' ' Over his head , I suspect , ' accused Marcellus . ' It was n't a very good lance , sir , ' commented Demetrius . ' I am surprised that the army does n't furnish these men with better equipment . ' Marcellus laughed aloud . ' And then what ? ' he urged . ' That was all . I did not tarry . Now that I have broken my promise '  --  Demetrius ' tone was repentant  --  ' do you think I can still consider myself a Christian ? Do you suppose I 'll have to be baptized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled Marcellus , busy with his own thoughts . ' What do you mean  --  " a Christian " ? ' ' That 's the new name for people who believe in Jesus . They 're calling Jesus " The Christos "  --  meaning " The Anointed . " ' ' But that 's Greek ! All of these people are Jews ; are n't they ? '  |p295By  no means , sir ! This movement is traveling fast  --  and far . Simon the tanner says there are at least three hundred banded togetherdown in Antioch . ' Amazing ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . Do you suppose Justus knows ? ' Of course . ' This is astounding news , Demetrius ! I had considered the whole thing a lost cause ! How could it stay alive  --  after Jesus was dead ? ' Demetrius stared into his master 's bewildered eyes . Do n't you  --  have n't you heard about that , sir ? ' he inquired , soberly . Has n't Justus told you ? ' Both men turned at the sound of a shrill shout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan came running toward them . Marcellus explained briefly . The little boy 's pace slowed as he neared them , inquisitively eyeing the stranger . Grandfather says you are to come and eat now , ' he said moving close to Marcellus , but giving full attention to the unexplained man in the shabby tunic . Do you catch fish ? ' he asked . Have you a boat ? Can I ride in it ? ' This man 's name is Demetrius , ' said Marcellus . He is not a fisherman , and he does not own a boat . He borrowed the cap . ' Demetrius smiled and fell in behind them as Marcellus , with the little boy 's hand in his , walked toward the tent . Jonathan turned around , occasionally , to study the newcomer who followed with measured steps . Justus , busily occupied at the fire , a few yards from the tent , glanced up with a warm smile of recognition and a word of greeting , apparently not much surprised at the arrival of their guest . May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all ready ; thank you , ' said Justus . You sit down with Marcellus , and I shall serve you . ' Demetrius bowed and stepped aside . Presently Justus came to the low table he had improvised by drawing a couple of packing-cases together , and served Marcellus and Jonathan with the broiled fish and honey cakes . Jonathan motioned with his head toward Demetriusand looked up anxiously into Marcellus ' face . Why does n't he come and eat with us ? ' he inquired . Marcellus was at a loss for a prompt and satisfactory reply . You need n't worry about Demetrius , son , ' he remarked , casually . He likes to stand up when he eats . ' Instantly he divined that he had taken the wrong turn . Justus , who was sitting down opposite them , with his own dish , frowned darkly . He had some deep convictions on the subject of slavery . It was bad enough , his glum expression said , that Demetrius should be Marcellus ' slave . It was intolerable that this relationship should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his half-eaten cake in the direction of Demetrius who was standing before the fire , dish in hand , apparently enjoying his breakfast . That man stands up when he eats , Grandfather ! ' he remarked in a high treble . Is n't that funny ? ' No , ' muttered Justus , it is not funny . ' With that , he left the table , and went over to stand beside the slave . Marcellus decided not to make an issue of it and proceeded to some lively banter with Jonathan , hoping to distract the child 's attention . Demetrius surveyed Justus ' grim face and smiled . You must n't let this slave business distress you , sir , ' he said , quietly . My master is most kind and considerate . He would gladly give his life for me , as I would for him . But  --  slaves do not sit at table with their masters . It is a rule . ' A bad rule ! ' grumbled Justus , deep in his throat . A rule that deserves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a small matter , ' said Demetrius , calmly . If you wish to make my slavery easier , please think no more of it , sir . ' At that , Justus ' face cleared a little . There was no use making a scene over a situation that was none of his business . If Demetrius was contented , there was n't much more to be said . After they had eaten , Justus carried a dish of food out to the donkey-boy , Jonathan trotting along , still perplexed about the little episode . Grandfather , ' he shrilled , Marcellus Gallio treats Demetrius no better than we treat our donkey-boy . ' Justus frowned , but made no attempt to explain . His grandson had given him something new to think about . In the meantime , Demetrius had joined Marcellus , his bearded lips puckered as he tried to discipline a grin . Perhaps it will clear the air for everybody , sir , ' he said , if I go on by myself to Capernaum . Let me meet you , late this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask Justus where he proposes to stop . But  --  are you sure it is prudent for you to go down to Capernaum ? We have a fort there , you know . ' I shall be watchful , sir , ' promised Demetrius . Take this ! ' Marcellus poured a handful of coins into his palm . And keep your distance from that fort ! '  |p297Demetrius  , unencumbered , made good progress down the serpentineroad to the valley floor . The air was hot . He carried his shabby coat and the disreputable cap under his arm . The lake-shore on this side was barren and unpopulated . Tossing off his clothing , he waded out and swam joyously , tumbled about like a dolphin , floated on his back , churned the water with long overhand strokes , luxuriating in his aquatics , and the thorough cleansing . He came out shaking his mop of hair through his fingers , the blazing sun drying him before he reached the little pile of patched and faded garments . Tiberias gleamed white in the mid-forenoon sun . The marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately set apart from the less noble but surprisingly lavish residences , glistened dazzlingly . Demetrius imagined he could see a sinuous shimmer of heat enveloping the proud structure , and was glad he did not have to live there . He was not envious of Herod 's privilege to spend the summer here . However , he reflected , the family had probably sought a more congenial altitude for the hot season , leaving a small army of servants to sweat and steal and quarrel until the weather eased with the coming of autumn . He had reached the little city now , and proceeded on through it , keeping close to the beach , where many fishing-boats had been drawn up on the sand , and the adjacent market-booths reeked of their merchandise . Occasionally he was viewed with a momentary curiosity by small groups of apathetic loungers , sitting cross-legged in the shade of dirty foodshops . The air was heavy with decaying fruit and the stench of rancid oil sizzling in tarnished pans . It had been a long time since breakfast , and Demetrius had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unpleasant foodstalls . The swarthy cook scowled , and waved his wooden spoon at the shabby traveler with the uncouth cap and no pack . Be on your way , fellow ! ' he commanded . We have nothing to give you . ' Demetrius jingled his money , and made a wry face . Nor have you anything to sell that a dog would eat , ' he retorted . The greasy fellow instantly beamed with a wheedling smile , liftinghis shoulders and elbows into a posture of servitude . It was this type of Jew that Demetrius had always despised , the Jew who was arrogant , noisy , and abusive until he heard a couple of coins clink . Immediately you were his friend , his brother , his master . You could pour out a torrent of invective on him now , if you liked.  | He would be weather-proofed and his smile undiminished . He had heard the pennies . Oh  --  not so bad as that , sir ! ' exclaimed the cook . The evil smell '  --  he wagged a confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who defiles the air with his stale perch and wretched oil . ' Tipping a grimy kettle forward , he stirred its steaming contents , appreciatively sucking his lips . Delicious ! ' he murmured . A tousled , red-eyed legionary sauntered up from the waterfront , rested an elbow on the end of the high table , and sourly sniffed the heavy scent of burning fat . His uniform was dirty . Apparently he had slept where he fell . Doubtless he was ready for food now . He gave Demetrius a surly stare . Have a bowl of this fine pottage , Centurion , ' coaxed the cook . Choice lamb  --  with many costly spices . A great helping for only two farthings . ' Demetrius repressed a grin . ' Centurion '  --  eh ? ' Why had n't the Jew gone the whole way and addressed the debauched legionary as Legate ' ? But perhaps he knew where to stop when dishing up flattery . The unkempt Roman snarled a curse , and rubbed his clammy forehead with his dirty brown bandeau . The cook took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who scowled and shook his head . None for me , ' he muttered , turning away . I 'll have some ! ' declared the legionary , truculently , slapping an empty wallet . The cook 's eager face collapsed , but he was not in a position to refuse the penniless soldier . With a self-piteous shrug , he half-filled the bowl and put it down on the filthy table . Business is so bad , ' he whined . So is your pottage , ' mumbled the legionary , nursing a hot mouthful . Even that slave would have none of it . ' Slave , sir ? ' The cook leaned over the high table to have another look at the tall Greek , who was moving leisurely up the street . He has a wallet full of money . Good money , too  --  from the sound of it ! A thief , no doubt ! ' The legionary put down his spoon . His lip curled in a crafty grin . If an overdue soldier could reappear at the fort with a prisoner in tow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night . Hi  --  you ! ' he shouted . Come back here ! ' Demetrius hesitated , turned , held a brief parley with himself , and retraced his steps . It would do no good to attempt an escape in the neighborhood of a fort . Did you call me , sir ? ' he asked quietly.  |p299How  do you happen to be in Tiberias alone , fellow ? ' The legionary wiped his stubbled chin . Where is your master ? Do n't pretend you 're not a slave  --  with that ear . ' ' My master is on the way to Capernaum , sir . He sent me on to seek out a desirable camping-place . ' This sounded reasonable . The legionary untidily helped himself to another large spoonful of the pottage . Who is your master , fellow ? And what is he doing in Caper-naum ? ' ' A Roman citizen , sir ; a merchant . ' ' A likely tale ! ' snorted the legionary . What manner of merchandisedoes a Roman find in Capernaum ? ' Homespun , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The legionary chuckled scornfully and scraped the bottom of his bowl with a shaky spoon . Greek slaves are usually better liars than that , ' he growled . You must think me a fool . A slave in rags and patches , seeking a campsitefor a Roman who comes all the way to little Capernaum to buy clothing ! ' And with much money on him ! ' shrilled the cook . ' A robber he is ! ' ' Shut up , pig ! ' bellowed the legionary . ' I should take you along , were you not so filthy . ' Setting his soiled bandeau at a jaunty angle , he rose , tightened his belt , belched noisily , and motioned to Demetrius to fall in behind him . ' But why am I apprehended , sir ? ' demanded Demetrius . Never mind about that ! ' snarled the legionary . ' You can tell your story at the fort . ' With an exaggerated swagger , he marched stiffly up the street without turning to see whether his captive was following . Demetrius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be foolhardy to attempt an escape in a vicinity so well patrolled . He would go along to the fort and try to send a message to Marcellus . Beyond the limits of Tiberias the grim old sand-colored barracks loomed up on the arid hillside . Above the center of the quadrangle reared the parapets of the inevitable praetorium . The legionary strutted on toward the massive wooden gate . A sentry sluggishly unbarred the heavy barricade . They passed into the treeless , sunblistereddrill-ground and on between orderly rows of brown tents , unoccupied now , for it was noon and the legion would be in the mess-hall . Presently they brought up before the relatively impressive entrance to the praetorium . A gray-haired guard made way for them. p 300 Take this slave below and lock him up , ' barked the legionary . What 's your name , fellow ? ' demanded the guard . Demetrius told him . And your master 's name ? ' ' Lucan  --  a Roman citizen . ' Where does he live ? ' In Rome . ' The guard gave the disheveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitancy on the part of the older man . What 's the charge ? ' asked the guard . Suspicion of theft , ' said the legionary . Lock him up , and let him explain later how he happens to be wandering about , away from his master , dressed like a fisherman  --  and with a wallet full of money . ' Write his name on the slate , then , ' said the guard . The Centurionis at mess . ' The legionary fumbled with the chalk , and handed it to Demetrius . Can you write your name , slave ? ' he inquired gruffly . In spite of his predicament , Demetrius was amused . It was obvious that neither of these Romans could write . If they could n't write , they could n't read . He took the chalk and wrote : Demetrius , Greek slave of Lucan , a Roman encamped in Caper-naum . ' Long name  --  for a slave , ' remarked the legionary . If you have written anything else  --  ' My master 's name , sir . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning to go . The old , guard tapped on the floor with his lance and a younger guard appeared . He signed with a jerk of his head that Demetrius should follow , and strode off down the corridor to a narrow stairway . They descended to the prison . Bearded faces appeared at the small square apertures in the cell-doors ; Jewish faces , mostly , and a few toughlookingBedouins . Demetrius was pushed into an open cell at the far end of the narrowcorridor . A perpendicular slit , high in the outer wall , admitted a frugal light . The only furniture was a wide wooden bench . Anchored to the masonry lay a heavy chain with a rusty manacle . The guard ignored the chain , retreated into the corridor , banged the heavy door shut and pushed the bolt . Slumping down on the bench , Demetrius surveyed his cramped quarters , and wondered how long he would have to wait for somcp301official action in his case . It suddenly occurred to him that if the dissipated legionary suspected the entry on the slate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that event , the new prisoner stood a good chance of being forgotten . Perhaps he should have made a dash for it when he had an opportunity . Assuming a speedy trial , how much should he tell ? It would be difficult to explain Marcellus ' business in Galilee . Without doubt , old Julian the Legate was under orders to make short work of this Christian movement . There was no telling what attitude he might take if he learned that Marcellushad been consorting with these disciples of Jesus . As his eyes became accustomed to the gloom , Demetrius noticed a shelf in the corner bearing an earthenware food-basin and a small water-fowl . He had been hungry an hour ago . Now he was thirsty . Moving to the door he crouched  --  for the barred port was not placed for a tenant of his height  --  and looked across the narrow corridor into a pair of inquisitive Roman eyes framed in the oppositecell-door . The eyes were about the same age as his own , and seemed amused . When do we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin . Twice , ' replied the Roman , amiably . ' At mid-morning  --  you should have arrived earlier  --  and again at sunset . Praise the gods  - -  I sha n't be here for the next feeding . I 'm getting out this afternoon . My week is up . ' ' I ca n't wait until sunset for water , ' muttered Demetrius . ' I 'll wager you ten sesterces you 'll wait until they bring it to you , ' drawled the Roman . He straightened to relieve his cramped position , revealing a metal identification tablet on the chain around his neck . ' What is your legion ? ' inquired Demetrius , seeing his neighbor was disposed to be talkative . ' Seventeenth : this one . ' ' Why are n't you in the legion 's guardhouse , ' ventured Demetrius , instead of down in this hole with the civilians ? ' ' The guardhouse is full , ' chuckled the legionary . ' Was there a mutiny ? ' inquired Demetrius . Not a mutiny , the legionary explained . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jerusalem . The new Legate had brought a detachment of fifty along with him from his old command , to guard him on the journey . During the festivities , much good wine had flowed ; much good blood , too , for the detachmentfrom Minoa was made up of quarrelsome legionaries  --  ' From Minoa ! ' exclaimed Demetrius . ' Is Tribune Paulus your new Legate ? '  | Indeed he is ! ' retorted the legionary . And plenty hard ! Old Julian was easy-going . This fellow has no mercy . As for the fighting , it was nothing ; a few dagger cuts , a couple of bloody noses . One man from Minoa lost a slice off his ear . ' He grinned reminiscently . I sliced it off , ' he added , modestly . It did n't hurt him much . And he knew it was accidental . ' After a little pause , I see somebodynicked you on the ear . ' That was n't accidental , ' grinned Demetrius , willing to humor the legionary , who laughed appreciatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been enslaved . Did you run away ? ' asked the Roman . No  --  I was to have joined my master in Capernaum . ' He 'll get you out . You need n't worry . He 's a Roman , of course : Yes , ' said Demetrius , but he does n't know I 'm here . ' He lowered his voice . I wonder if you could get a message to him . I'dgladly give you something for your trouble . ' The legionary laughed derisively . Big talk  --  for a slave , ' he scoffed . How much ? Two denarii , maybe ? ' I 'll give you ten shekels . ' That you wo n't ! ' muttered the legionary . I do n't want any of that kind of money , fellow ! ' I did n't steal it , ' declared Demetrius . My master gave it to me . ' ' Well  --  you can keep it ! ' The legionary scowled and moved back from the door . Demetrius sat down dejectedly on the bench . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that you had full confidence in Nathanael Bartholomew 's integrity but disbelieved his eye-witness account of the storm . Nor could you clarify this confusion by assuming that the old man had been a victim of hallucination . Bartholomew was n't that type of person . He was neither a liar nor a fool . According to his story , told at great length as they sat together in his little fig orchard , Jesus had rebuked a tempest on the Sea of Galilee ; had commanded the gale to cease , and it had obeyed hisp303voice  --  instantly ! Jesus had spoken and the storm had stopped ! Bartholomew had snapped his dry old fingers . Like that ! And the story was n't hearsay . Bartholomew had n't heard it from a neighbor who had got it from his cousin . No , sir ! The old man had been in the boat that night . He had heard and seen it all ! If you could n't believe it , Bartholomew would not be offended ; but it was truth ! The tale was finished now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing his long , white beard aside and looseningthe collar of his robe . Marcellus , with no further comments to offer and no more questions to ask , frowned studiously at his own interlaced fingers , conscious of Justus ' inquisitive eyes . He knew they expected him to express an opinion ; and , after a silence that was becoming somewhat constrained , he obliged them by muttering to himself , Very strange ! Very strange indeed ! ' The dramatic story had been told with fervor , told with an old man 's verbosity , but without excitement . Bartholomew was n't trying to persuade you ; nor was he trying to convert you . He had nothing to sell . Justus had asked him to tell about that storm , and he had done so . Perhaps it was his first opportunity for so completea recital of all its incidents . Certainly it was the first time he had ever told the story to someone who had n't heard it . Shortly after Demetrius had set off alone , that morning , the little caravan had proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirted the sparsely populated lake-shore to Tiberias where the ostentatious Roman palaces on the hills accented the squalor of the waterfront ; had followed the beach street through the city ; had passed the frowning old fort , and entered the sprawling suburbs of Capernaum . Jonathan had been promised a brief visit with Thomas  --  and the donkey ; so they had turned off into a side street where , after many inquiries , they had found the little house and an enthusiastic welcome . Upon the urgent persuasion of Thomas and his mother , Jonathan was left with them , to be picked up on the morrow . Everybodyagreed that the donkey recognized Jonathan , though the elders privately suspected that the sugar which had been melting in the little boy 's warm hand for the past two hours might have accounted for Jasper 's flattering feat of memory . Regaining the principal thoroughfare , they had moved on toward the business center of the town which had figured so prominently in Justus ' recollections of Jesus . They had halted for a moment in front of Lydia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Marcellus dissuaded him as it was nearing midday and a visit might be inopportune.  | The central plaza had seemed familiar . The synagogue  --  ironicallymore Roman than Jewish in its architecture , which was understandablebecause Centurion Hortensius had furnished the money  --  spread its marble steps fanwise into the northern boundary of the spacious square , exactly as Marcellus had pictured it ; for it was from these steps that Jesus had addressed massed multitudes of thousands . It was almost deserted now , except for the beggars , tapping on the pavement with their empty bowls ; for everybody who had a home to go to was at his noonday meal . Marcellus felt he had been here many times before . Indeed he was so preoccupied with identifying the cherished landmarks that he almost forgot they were to have met Demetrius here . Justus had reminded him , and Marcellus had looked about apprehensively . It would be a very awkward situation if Demetrius had been arrested . He had no relish for an interview with old Julian ; not while on his present mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demetrius where they would make camp , on the grounds of the old Shalum Inn ; but what could be detaining Demetriusin the meantime ? Perhaps he misunderstood me , ' suggested Justus . It 's possible , ' agreed Marcellus , but unlikely . Demetrius has a good ear for instructions . ' They had sauntered down to the beach , strewn with fishingboatsdrawn up on the shingle , leaving the donkey-boy to keep an eye out for Demetrius . Justus had suggested that they eat their lunch on the shore . After waiting a half-hour for the Greek to show up , they had packed their lunch kit and proceeded northward , Marcellus anxious but still hopeful of meeting his loyal slave at the inn . It was a quiet spot  --  the Inn of Ben-Shalum  --  with spacious grounds for travelers carrying their own camping equipment . No one had seen anything of a tall Greek slave . Hastily unpacking , they put up the tent in the shade of two tall sycamores , and made off toward the home of Bartholomew , a little way up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story they had come to hear . In its preliminary phases , episodes had been introduced which bore no closer relation to the eventful storm than that they had occurred on the same day . Jesus had been very weary that night ; so weary that he had slept at the height of the gale and had had to be awakened when it became clear that the little ship was foundering . Such deep fatigue had to be accounted for ; so Bartholomewhad elaborated the day 's activities . Sometimes , for a considerable period , the husky old voice wouldp305settle deep in the sparse white beard and rumble on in an almost inaudible monotone , and you knew that Bartholomew had deserted you and Justus for the great crowd that sat transfixed on a barren coast  --  a weary , wistful , hungry multitude of self-contained people who , in the melting warmth of Jesus ' presence , had congealed into one sympathetic family , for the sharing of their food . A clean , bright lad , ' Bartholomew was mumbling to himself ; a nephew of Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent most of his time at her house . She had packed his little basket . ' And then , suddenly remembering his guests , Bartholomew had roused from his reverie to tell Marcellus all about Lydia 's strange healing ; and Justus had not intervened with a hint that their young Roman friend had already heard of her experience . Having finished with Lydia  --  and Jairus , too , whose little daughter had been marvelouslyrestored that day  --  the old man had drifted back to his memories of the remarkable feast in the desert . The boy must have been sitting at the Master 's feet , ' he soliloquized , with averted eyes . He must have been sitting there all the time ; for when Jesus said we would now eat our supper , there he was  --  as if he had popped up from nowhere  --  holding out his little basket . ' It had taken Bartholomew a long time to tell of that strange supper ; the sharing of bread , the new acquaintances , the breaking down of reserve among strangers , the tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And then the tempo of the tale speeded . Wisps of chill wind lashed the parched reeds . Dark clouds rolled up from the northeast . Tilts old man swept them on with a beckoning arm ; black clouds that had suddenly darkened the sky . There was a low muttering of thunder . The crowd grew apprehensive . The people were scrambling to their feet , gathering up their families , breaking into a run . The long procession was on its way home . Darkness came on fast , the lowering black clouds lanced by slim , jagged , red-hot spears that spilled torrents splashing onto the sunparchedsand . Philip was for rushing to shelter in the little village of Bethsaida , two miles east . Peter was for beaching the big boat and using the mainsail for cover . And when they were all through making suggestions , Jesus said they would embark at once and return to Capernaum . He said we had nothing to fear , ' went on Bartholomew , but we were afraid , nevertheless . Some of them tried to reason with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are timid , ' he paused to interpolate , directly to Marcellus . When there are dangers to be faced , old men should keep still , for there 's little they can do , in any case . '  | I should have thought , ' commented Marcellus , graciously , that an elderly man 's experience would make him a wise counselor  --  on any occasion . ' Not in a storm , young man ! ' declared Bartholomew . An old man may give you good advice , under the shade of a fig tree , on a sunny afternoon ; but  --  not in a storm ! ' The boat had been anchored in the lee of a bit of a cove , but it was with great difficulty that they had struggled through the waves and over the side . Unutterably weary , Jesus had dropped down on the bare bench near the tiller and they had covered him up with a length of drenched sail-cloth . Manning the oars , they had maneuvered into open water , had put out a little jib and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one of them , Bartholomew said , had ever been out in such a storm . Now the boat was tossed high on the crest , now it was swallowed up , gigantic waves broke over their heads , the flood pounded them off their seats and twisted the oars out of their hands . The tortured little ship was filling rapidly . All but four oars had been abandoned now . The rest of the crew were bailing frantically . But the water was gaining on them . And Jesus slept ! Justus broke into the narrative here as Bartholomew  --  whose vivid memory of that night 's hard work with a bailing-bucket brought big beads of perspiration out on his deep-lined forehead  --  had paused to wield his palm-leaf fan . You thought Jesus should get up and help ; did n't you ? ' Justus was grinning broadly . The old man 's lips twitched with a self-reproachful smile . Well , ' he admitted , perhaps we did think that after getting us into this trouble he might take a hand at one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' we were n't quite ourselves . We were badly shaken . It was getting to be a matter of life or death . And we were completely exhausted  --  the kind of exhaustionthat makes every breath whistle and burn . ' And so  --  you shouted to him , ' prodded Justus . Yes ! We shouted to him ! ' Bartholomew turned to address Marcellus . I shouted to him ! " Master ! " I called . " We are going to drown ! The boat is sinking ! Do n't you care ? " ' The old man dropped his head and winced at the memory . Yes '  --  he muttered , contritely . I said that  --  to my Master . ' After a moment 's silence , Bartholomew drew a deep sigh , and continued . Jesus had stirred , had sat up , had stretched out his long , strong arms , had rubbed his fingers through his drenched hair.  |p307Not  alarmed ? ' inquired Marcellus . Jesus was never alarmed ! ' retorted Bartholomew , indignantly . He rose to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands reaching up to steady him as he made for the housing of the mainmast . Climbing up on the heavy planking , he stood for a moment with one arm around the mast , looking out upon the towering waves . Then he raised both arms high . We gasped , expectinghim to be pitched overboard . He held both hands outstretched  --  andspoke ! It was not a shrill shout . It was rather as one might soothe a frightened animal . " Peace ! " he said . " Peace ! Be still ! " ' The climax of the story had been built up to such intensity that Marcellus found his heart speeding . He leaned forward and stared wide-eyed into the old man 's face . Then what ? ' he demanded . The storm was over , ' declared Bartholomew . Not immediately ! ' protested Marcellus . Bartholomew deliberately raised his arm and snapped his brittle old fingers . Like that ! ' he exclaimed . And the stars came out , ' added Justus . ' I do n't remember , ' murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted Justus , quietly . That may be , ' nodded Bartholomew . I do n't remember . ' Some have said that the boat was immediately dry , ' murmured Justus , with a little twinkle in his eyes as if anticipating the old man 's contradiction . That was a mistake , ' sniffed Bartholomew . Some of us hailed out water all the way back to Capernaum . Whoever reported that should have helped . ' How did you all feel about this strange thing ? ' asked Marcellus . We had n't much to say , ' remembered Bartholomew . I think we were stunned . There had been so much confusion  --  and now everything was quiet . The water , still coated with foam , was calm as a pond . As for me , I experienced a peculiar sensation of peace . Perhaps the words that Jesus spoke to the storm had stilled us too  --  in our hearts . ' And what did he do ? ' asked Marcellus . He went back to the bench by the tiller and sat down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he was wet and chilled . After a while he turned to us , smiled reproachfully , and said , as if speaking to little children , " Why were you so frightened ? " Nobody ventured to answer that . Perhaps he did n't expectp308us to say anything . Presently he reclined , with his arm for a pillow , and went to sleep again . ' Are you sure he was asleep ? ' asked Justus . ' No  --  but he was very quiet and his eyes were closed . Perhaps he was thinking . Everyone thought he was asleep . There was very little talk . We moved to the center of the boat and looked into each other 's faces . I remember Philip 's whispering , " What manner of man is this  --  that even the winds and waves obey him ? " ' The story was finished . Marcellus , for whose benefit the tale had been told , knew they were waiting for him to say whether he believed it . He sat bowed far forward in his chair , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Bartholomew was n't willfully lying . Bartholomew was perfectly sane . But  --  by all the gods !  --  you could n't believe a story like that ! A man  --  speaking to a storm ! Speaking to a storm as he might to a stampededhorse ! And the storm obeying his command ! No !  --  you could n't have any of that ! He felt Justus ' friendly eyes inquiring . Presently he straightened a little , and shook his head . Very strange ! ' he muttered , without looking up . Very strange indeed ! ' The afternoon was well advanced when the gray-haired captain of the guard came down to free the legionary who had sliced off the ear of a visiting fellow-in-arms from Minoa . Demetrius listened attentively at the little port in his door as his neighbor 's bolt was drawn , hoping to overhear some formal conversationrelative to the prisoner 's release ; but was disappointed . Neither man had spoken . The heavy door was swung back and the legionary had emerged . The captain of the guard had preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandals , scraping on the stone floor , died away . Shortly afterward there was a general stir throughout the prison ; guttural voices ; unbolting of doors and rattling of heavy earthenwarebowls and basins ; the welcome sound of splashing water . Feeding time had arrived and was being greeted with the equivalent of pawing hoofs , clanking chains , and nostril-fluttering whimpers in a stable . Demetrius ' mouth and throat were dry ; his tongue a clumsy wooden stick . His head throbbed . He could n't remember ever having been that thirsty ; not even in the loathsome prison-ship on the way from Corinth to Rome , long years ago . It seemed they would never reach his end of the corridor . He hoped the water would hold out until they came to his cell . Thatp309was all he wanted  --  water ! As for food , it did n't matter ; but he had to have water  --  now ! At length they shuffled up to his door , unbolted it , and swung it wide open . Two burly , brutish , ear-slit Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , with the spade beard , deep pockmarks , and greasy hands , plunged his gourd-dipper into an almostempty bucket of malodorous pottage and pointed angrily to the food-basin on the shelf . Demetrius , with nothing on his mind but his consuming thirst , had been waiting with his water-bowl in hand . He reached up for the food-basin , and the surly Syrian dumped the gourdful of reeking hot garbage into it . Then he rummagedin the bottom of a filthy bag and came up with a small loaf of black bread which he tossed onto the bare bench . It bounced and clattered like a stone . Retreating to make room for his companion , the stocky one edged out into the corridor and the tall one entered with a large water-jar on his shoulder . Half-crazed with thirst , Demetrius held his water-bowl high . The Syrian , with a crooked grin , as if it amused him to see a Greek in such a predicament , tipped the jar , and from its considerable height poured a stream that overflowed the bowl , drenching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoonful left . The Syrian was backing toward the door . Give me water ! ' demanded Demetrius , huskily . The fellow sneered , tipped the jar again , and poured the remainder of the water over Demetrius ' feet . Chuckling , but vigilant , he moved back into the doorway . Though the bowl was not large , it was heavy and sturdy pottery , and in the hand of a man as recklessly thirsty and angry as Demetriusit was capable of doing no small amount of damage . But for the thick mop of kinky hair that covered his forehead , the howl might have cracked the Syrian 's skull , for it was delivered with all the earnestness that Demetrius could put into it . Dropping the water-jar , which broke into jagged fragments , the dizzied Syrian , spluttering with rage , whipped out a long dagger from his dirty sash , and lunged forward . Hot pottage would not have been Demetrius ' choice of weapons , but it was all he had to fight with ; so he threw it into his assailant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received another more serious blow . Raising the heavy food-basin in both hands , Demetriusbrought it down savagely on the fellow 's forearm , knockingthe dagger from his hand . Unarmed , the Syrian reeled back into the corridor where the stocky one , unable to force his way into the cell , was waiting the outcome of the battle . Demetrius took advantage of this moment to pick up the dagger . With the way cleared , the stocky one  --  dagger in hand  --  was about to plunge in ; but when he saw that the prisoner had armed himself , he backed out and began swinging the door shut . Unwilling to be trapped and probably killed with a lance thrust through the port , Demetrius threw his weight against the closing door and forced his way out into the corridor . Excited by the confusion , the prisoners set up a clamor of encouraging shouts that brought the elderly Captain of the guard and three others scurrying down the stone stairway . They paused , a few feet from the engagement . One of the younger guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out an arm and barred the way . It was n't every day that you could see a determined fight waged with daggers . When angry men met at close range with daggers , it was rough sport . Cautious in their cramped quarters , the contestants were weaving about , taking each other 's measure . The Syrian , four inches shorter but considerably outweighing the Greek , crouched for a spring . One of the younger guards emptied his flat wallet into his hand . Two shekels and nine denarii on the Syrian pig , ' he wagered . The others shook their heads . The Greek was at a disadvantage . The dagger was the favorite weapon with the Syrians  --  a dagger with a long , curving blade . The Syrian considered it good strategy to slip up behind an enemy in the dark and let him have it between the ribs a little below and to the right of the left shoulder . On such occasions one needed a long knife . Demetrius was not unfamiliarwith daggers , but had never practiced with one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He was finding his borrowed weapon unwieldy in this narrow corridor . It was close-in fighting and decidedly dangerous business . The tall Syrian lurked far back in the darkness behind his companion . The stocky one , facing an appreciative audience of guards , seemed eager to bring the event to an early conclusion . They were sparring actively now , their clashing blades striking sparks in the gloom . Demetrius was gradually retreating , quite definitely on the defensive . The guards backed away to give them a chance . The pace of the fighting increased , the Syrian forcing the action . Ha ! ' he shouted ; and a dark , red streak showed up on the Greek 's right sleeve , above the elbow . An instant later , a long gash appeared across the back of the Syrian 's hand . He gave a quick fling of his arm to shake off the blood , but not quick enough . A cut had opened over his collar-bone , dangerously close to his throat.  |p311He  retreated a step . Demetrius pursued his advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On guard  --  Greek ! ' shouted the Captain . The tall Syrian in the rear had drawn back his arm to hurl a chunk of the broken waterjar . Demetrius dodged , at the warning , and the murderous missile grazed the side of his head . Enough ! ' yelled the Captain . Grasping Demetrius ' shoulder , he pushed him aside , the younger guards followed with lances poised to strike . Come out of there , vermin ! ' the Captain ordered . The Syrians sullenly obeyed , the stocky one yielding his bloody dagger as he squeezed by the guards . The procession started down the corridor and up the stairs . Arriving on the main floor , the Captain led the way along the spacious hall , and out into the courtyard . Water was brought , wounds were laved and crudely bandaged . Demetrius grabbed a water-jar , and drank greedily . The cut on his arm was deep and painful , and the wide abrasion on his temple burned , but now that he had had a drink , nothing else mattered much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-entered the praetorium , turned to the left at a broad marble staircase , and ascended to the second floor . A sentry informed the guard at an imposing door that Captain Namius wished to see the Legate . The guard disappeared , returning presently with a curt nod . They advancedthrough the open door and filed into the sumptuous courtroom , brightly lighted with great lamps suspended from beautifully wrought chains . Demetrius ' wounds were throbbing , but he was not too badly hurt to be amused . Paulus , rattling a leather dice-cup , was facing Sextus across the ornately carved table that dominated the dais at the far end of the room . So  --  Paulus , transferred to the command of the fort at Capernaum , had brought his old gambling companion along . The guards and their quarry , preceded by two sentries in gay uniforms , marched forward . Legate Paulus glanced disinterestedly in their direction and returned his attention to the more important business in hand . Shaking the cup , he poured out the dice on the polished table , and shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languidly , poured it out  --  and scowled . Paulus laughed , and sat down in the huge chair behind the table . Centurion Sextus came to attention . What is it , Namius ? ' yawned Paulus . The Syrians were fighting this Greek prisoner , sir . ' What about ? ' asked Paulus , impatiently . Captain Namius did n't know . The Syrian slaves were feeding the prisoners , and somehow got mixed up with this Greek . '  | Step nearer , Greek . ' Paulus ' eyes had narrowed . He was searchinghis memory . Demetrius stepped forward , scowling to keep from smiling . Sextus leaned over and mumbled something . Paulus ' eyes lighted . He nodded and grinned dryly . Take the Syrians away for the present , Captain , ' he said . I would talk with this Greek . ' He waited until the guards and the Syrians had left the room . Are you badly hurt , Demetrius ? ' asked Paulus , kindly . No , sir . ' Demetrius was becoming aware that the room was slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blurred . He heard Paulus bark an order and felt the edge of a chair pushed up behind him . He slumped down in it weakly . A sentry handed him a glass of wine . He gulped it . Presently the vertigo cleared . I am sorry , sir , ' he said . How do you happen to be here , Demetrius ? ' inquired Paulus . But no  --  that can wait . Where is your master ? ' Demetrius told him . Here ?  --  in Capernaum ! ' exclaimed Paulus . And whatever brings the excellent Tribune Marcellus to this sadly pious city ? ' My master has taken a fancy to Galilean homespun , sir . He has been touring about , looking for  --  such things . ' Paulus frowned darkly and stared into Demetrius ' face . Is he well  --  in his head , I mean ? ' Oh , yes , sir , ' said Demetrius , quite so , sir . ' There was a rumor  --  ' Paulus did not finish the sentence , but it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of his betters , came unsteadily to his feet . The Tribune was ill , sir , for several months . He was deeply depressed . He went to Athens  --  and recovered . ' What was he so depressed about , Demetrius ? ' asked Paulus ; and when the reply was not immediately forthcoming , he added , Do I know ? ' Yes , sir , ' said Demetrius . Something cracked  --  when he put on that Robe  --  at the Procurator'sbanquet . ' Yes , sir . It did something to him . ' I remember . It affected him strangely . ' Paulus shook himself loose from an unpleasant recollection . Now  --  for your case . Why are you here ? ' Demetrius explained in a few words , and when Paulus inquired about the fight , he replied that he had wanted water and the Syrian would n't give it to him.  |p313Bring  Captain Namius in ! ' commanded Paulus . A sentry went out and returned almost immediately with the guards and the Syrians . The examination proceeded swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We stopped it , ' he concluded , when this Syrian picked up a shard of the broken water-jar and threw it at the Greek . ' Take him out and give him thirty-nine lashes with a bull-whip ! ' shouted Paulus . Lock the other pig up  --  and do n't try to fatten him . That will be all , Captain . ' And the Greek , sir ? ' asked Namius . Put him to bed , and have the physician attend to his cuts . ' Namius gave an order . The guards made off with the Syrians . Shall I go now , sir ? ' asked Demetrius . Yes  --  with the Captain . No  --  wait . You may go , Namius . I shall summon you . ' Paulus watched the retreating figure of the old guard until he reached the door ; then , glancing about the room , he said quietly , You may all go . ' He looked up over his shoulder . You , too , Sextus . I want a word alone with Demetrius . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back to the inn . Justus , preoccupied and somehow elevated , as if the afternoon with Bartholomew had reinvigorated his spirit , strode along with confident steps . As for Marcellus , the old disciple 's story had impressed and disturbedhim . Had he never known of Jesus until today , and Bartholomewhad said , I heard this man speak to a storm  --  and the storm ceased , ' he could have dismissed that statement as utterly preposterous . But the testimony about Jesus ' peculiar powers had been cumulative . It had been coming at him from all directions . Marcellus ' footsteps lagged as his thoughts became more involved . Justus , appreciating his dilemma , gave him an understanding smile , lengthened his stride , and moved on alone , leaving his bewildered patron to follow at his leisure . The trouble was : once you began to concede that there might be an element of truth in some of these stories , it was unreasonable to draw an arbitrary line beyond which your credulity would not go . It was childish to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary thing , but I do n't believe he could have done that ! ' Some of the stories permitted a common-sense explanation . Take Hariph 's naive account of the wedding-feast , for example . That was n't hard to see through . The porous water-jars had previously held wine . Of course you had to concede the astounding effect of Jesus ' personality on the wedding-guests who loved , admired , and trusted him . Not everybody could have made that water taste like wine . You were willing to grant that . Mean and frugal fare could be made pleasantly palatable when shared with a well-loved friend . If the water-into-wine episode had been the only example of Jesus ' inexplicable power , it would present no problem at all . But there was Miriam 's sudden realization that she possessed an inspired voice ; had made this amazing discovery on the same day that the other thing had happened in the home of Hariph . If you consented to Miriam 's story  --  and its truth was self-evident --  you might as well accept Hariph 's . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could explain that without difficulty . Under Jesus ' persuasive words about human brotherhood , they had shared their food . You had to concede nothing here but the tremendous strength of Jesus ' personality , which you were glad enough to do because you believed in it yourself . Demosthenes had wrought wonders with his impassioned appeals to the Greeks . Such infusions of courage and honesty required no miracle . But there was little Jonathan . The whole town of Sepphoris knew that Jonathan had been born a cripple . Of course you could maintainthat Jesus could have manipulated that crooked little foot and reduced its dislocation ; and if that were the only story of Jesus ' surprisingdeeds , your explanation might suffice . To be sure , that leaves the entire population of Sepphoris believing something that was n't true ; but even that was possible . There was no limit to the credulity of unsophisticated people . Indeed , they rather liked to believe in the uncanny . There was Lydia , healed of a long-time disease by touching Jesus ' Robe . Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own experience . You had impulsively told Justus that you believed it , and Justus felt that you were ready to hear about the storm . If you believed that Jesus ' supernormal power could heal the physical and mental sickness of those who merely touched his Robe , by what reasoning do you disbelieve that he could still a storm ? Once you impute to him supernormal power , what kind of impertinence consents to your drawing up an itemized list of the peculiar things he can and can not do ? Yet this storm story was too , too much ! Here you have no human multitude yielding to the entreating voice . This is an inanimate , insensible tempest ! No human being  --  however persuasive  --  could still a storm ! Concede Jesus that power , and you admit that he was divine ! I have taken the liberty of asking Shalum to bake us a fish , ' announcedJustus , as Marcellus slowly sauntered toward the tent . Wep315will have supper at the inn . It will be a relief from my poor cook-ing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have n't seen anything of Demetrius ? ' ' No  --  and I inquired at the inn . ' I had almost forgotten about the poor fellow , ' confessed Marcellus . There has been much to think about , this afternoon . ' If Demetrius has been arrested , he will give an account of himself , ' said Justus , reassuringly . You will learn his whereabouts promptly , I think . They will surrender him  --  for a price  --  no matter what the indictment is . Valuable slaves do n't stay long in jail . Shall we go to supper now , sir ? ' The dining-hall had accommodations for only a score of guests , but it was tastefully appointed . Because the lighting facilities in small town hostelries were not good , travelers dined early . The three dignified Pharisees , whose commodious tent had been pitched in the sycamore grove during the afternoon , occupied a table in the center of the room . Two centurions from the fort were enjoying their wine at a table by a western window while they waited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  led the way to a corner table , bowing deeply when Justus introduced his friend . Is he a Christian ? ' asked Marcellus , as Shalum waddled away . Justus blinked with surprise , and Marcellus grinned . Yes , ' said Justus , in a barely audible tone that strongly counseled caution . You did n't think I knew that word ; did you ? ' murmured Marcellus . Justus did not reply ; sat with arms folded , staring out into the garden . Demetrius picked it up in Joppa , ' explained Marcellus , quietly . We must be careful , ' admonished Justus . Pharisees have small hearts , but big ears . ' Is that a saying ? ' Marcellus chuckled . ' Yes  --  but not a loud saying , ' warned Justus , breaking one of the small brown loaves . He raised his voice a little and said , casually , Shalum bakes good bread . Have some . ' You come here frequently ? ' This is the first time for a year and a half , ' confided Justus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full . Shalum gave a dinner for Jesus . All of the disciples and a few others were here ; and there must have been a hundred outside . Shalum fed them too . ' Nothing secret about it then . ' No  --  not then . The priests were already plotting how they might destroy his influence with the people , but they were not yet openly hostile . ' That 's strange , ' said Marcellus . When Jesus was alive and an active menace to the priests ' business , no effort was made to keep his doings a secret . Now that he is dead and gone  --  you must talk about him in whispers . ' Justus looked Marcellus squarely in the eyes  --  and smiled . He seemed about to make some rejoinder , but refrained . An old servitor came with their supper ; the baked fish on a large platter , lentils in cream , stewed figs , and a pitcher of wine . It was an attractive meal and they were hungry . Did you sit close to Jesus at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their food . No  --  I sat with Matthias , over yonder by the door . ' Where did Jesus sit ? ' inquired Marcellus . There , ' nodded Justus , where you 're sitting . ' Marcellus started . No one should ever sit here ! ' he declared . Justus ' eyes mellowed , and he approved Marcellus ' sentiment with a comradely smile . You talk like a Christian yourself , my friend , ' he murmured ; adding , after a moment , Did you enjoy Bartholomew 's story ? ' It was n't meant to be enjoyed ! ' retorted Marcellus . I confess I 'm thoroughly bewildered by it . Bartholomew is a fine old man .. I 'm convinced that he believes his story true : But you do n't believe it , ' said Justus . Bartholomew made one statement , Justus , that may throw a little light on the matter . Do you remember his saying that he felt at peace , that he felt calmed , when Jesus spoke to the storm ? Maybe that 's where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds ! Jesus spoke to their fears , and they were reassured . ' Does that explanation content you ? ' asked Justus , soberly . Of course not ! ' admitted Marcellus . But  --  see here , Justus ! You ca n't have Jesus stopping a storm ! ' Why not ? ' asked Justus , gently . Why not ! Do n't you realize that he has to be superhuman to do that ? Ca n't you see that such an act makes him a god ? ' ' Well  --  and if it does  --  ' Then you 're left with a lot more explaining to do . Suppose you say that Jesus is divine ; a god ! Would he permit himself to be placed under arrest , and dragged about in the night from one court to another , whipped and reviled ? Would he  --  this god !  --  consent to be put to death on a cross ? A god , indeed ! Crucified  --  dead  --  and buried ! '  |p317Justus  sat for a moment , saying nothing , staring steadily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grasped his sleeve , and drew him close . He whispered something into Marcellus ' ear . No , Justus ! ' declared Marcellus , gruffly . I 'm not a fool ' I do n't believe that  --  and neither do you ! ' ' But  --  I saw him ! ' persisted Justus , unruffled . Marcellus swallowed convulsively , and shook his head . Why do you want to say a thing like that to me ? ' he demanded , testily . I happen to know it is n't true ! You might make some people believe it  --  but not me ! I had n't intended to tell you this painful thing , Justus , but  --  I saw him die ! I saw a lance thrust deep into his heart ! I saw them take his limp body down  --  dead as ever a dead man was ! ' Everybody knows that , ' agreed Justus , calmly . He was put to death and laid away in a tomb . And on the morning of the third day , he came alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're mad , Justus ! Such things do n't happen ! ' Careful ! ' warned Justus . We must n't be overheard . ' Pushing his plate away , Marcellus folded his arms on the table . His hands were trembling . If you think Jesus is alive , ' he muttered , where is he ? ' Justus shook his head , made a hopeless little gesture with both hands , and drew a long sigh . I do n't know , ' he said , dreamily , but I do know he is alive . ' After a quiet moment , Justus brightened a little . I am always looking for him , ' he went on . Every time a door opens . At every turn of the road . At every street-corner . At every hillcrest : Marcellus ' eyes had widened , and he nodded understandingly . I knew you were always expecting to meet someone , ' he said . If you persist in that habit , you 'll lose your mind . ' Neither man spoke for some moments . Marcellus looked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he asked cautiously , that you would n't be surprised if Jesus came in here now  --  and asked Shalum to serve him his supper ? ' Justus repressed a smile at the sight of Marcellus ' almost boyish expression of complete bafflement . No , ' he replied , confidently . I should n't be surprised , at all . I confess I was badly shaken the first time I saw him . As you say , such things do n't happen . They 're quite impossible . Had I been alone , I should have doubted my senses  --  and my sanity , too . ' Where was this ? ' demanded Marcellus , as seriously as if he expected to believe the story.  | At Benyosef 's house ; quite a little company of us ; ten days after Jesus had been put to death . We had had a simple supper together . The sun had set , but the lamps had not yet been lighted . There had been much talk about Jesus ' reappearance . Several of the disciplesclaimed to have seen him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I kept still . There had been a lot of confusing reports . On the morning of the third day , some women had gone to the sepulcher and found it empty . One of them said she had seen Jesus , walking in the garden ; said he had spoken to her . ' Hysterical , I dare say , ' put in Marcellus . That 's what I made of it , ' admitted Justus . And then there was a story that two men had seen him on the highway and asked him to have supper with them at an inn . ' Reliable people ? ' I did n't know them . One was a man named Cleopas , a cousin of Alphaeus . I never heard the other man 's name . ' Sounds like poor testimony . ' It occurred that way to me , ' said Justus . Several of the disciples declared he had come into the room where they were sitting , that same night . But  --  they were terribly wrought up , and I thought they might have imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  ' Naturally ! ' agreed Marcellus . Once the stories started , the hallucinations multiplied . Well  --  go on . You were at Benyosef 's house  --  ' John had been telling how he looked and what he said  --  ' He 's that dreamy young fellow , eh ? ' Yes  --  that 's the one , ' Justus went on , undisturbed by the implicationsof Marcellus ' query . And when John had finished his story , Thomas stood up and spoke his mind  --  and my mind , too . " I do n't believe a word of it ! " he shouted . " And I do n't intend to believe it until I have seen him with my own eyes  --  and touched his wounds with my hands ! " ' ' He was a bold fellow , ' remarked Marcellus . Was John offended ? ' I do n't know , ' said Justus , absently . He did n't have much time to be offended . Jesus was standing there  --  at Thomas ' elbow . ' ' No  --  Justus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knew so well . ' A specter ? ' Not at all ! He was a little thinner . You could see the effects of the bad treatment he had suffered . There were long scratches on his forehead . He held his hands out to Thomas  --  '  |p319Did  you all gather about him ? ' asked Marcellus , with a dry throat . No  --  I think we were stunned . I 'm sure I was . I could n't have moved if I had tried . There was complete silence . Jesus stood there , holding out his hands and smiling into Thomas ' eyes . You could see the deep wounds in his palms . " Touch them , " he said , gently . This was too much for Thomas . He covered his face with his hands and cried like a child . ' The dining-room had cleared . Twilight was settling . Shalum came over to inquire if there was anything else he could do for them . Marcellus glanced up bewilderedly at this summons back to reality . I have been telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , yes , ' nodded Shalum . Once , when he honored my poor house , he was seated there , sir , where you are sitting . ' Did he rise and speak  --  at the dinner ? ' asked Marcellus . He did not rise to speak , ' remembered Justus . He told a story , ' said Shalum . It seems someone had asked him to explain what was meant by " my neighbor " as it is written in our law . And Jesus told a fable about a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho  --  a dangerous road  --  and beset by Bedouins who stripped , robbed , and wounded him , leaving him half-dead . A priest came along and saw him , but passed on . A Levite , too , paused  --  but went his way . Then a Samaritan came  --  we do not care much for Samaritans up here , sir  --  and tied up the man 's wounds  --  and took him to an inn . " Which of these men , " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves ? " ' That was easily answered , I think , ' observed Marcellus . Had I been here , I should have asked another question . I am told that Jesus did not believe in fighting  --  regardless of the circumstances . Now , if the brave Samaritan had arrived while the Bedouins were beating the life out of this unfortunate fellow , what was he supposedto do ; join in the defense , or wait until the robbers had completedtheir work  --  and fled ? ' Shalum and Justus exchanged looks of inquiry , each inviting the other to reply . Jesus was interested in binding up wounds , ' said Justus , solemnly ; not in inflicting them . ' Does that answer your question , sir ? ' inquired Shalum . No , ' said Marcellus . Perhaps we should go , Justus . It is growing dark . ' They rose . The fish was good , Shalum . Let us have another for breakfast . '  |p320Taking  up the little lantern that Shalum had provided , Justus led the way across the well-kept grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung it to the center pole . Marcellus unlaced his sandal-thongs , took off his belt , and lounged on his cot , his eyes following Justus as he made his bed . And then what happened , ' asked Marcellus , after Thomas looked at the wounds ? ' Benyosef filled a supper-plate , and offered it to Jesus , ' said Justus , sitting down on the edge of his cot . There was a piece of broiled fish , a small loaf , and some honey in the comb . And Jesus took it  --  and ate . ' Not just a spirit then , ' commented Marcellus . I do n't know , ' mumbled Justus , uncertainly . ' He ate it  --  or some of it . The day was fading fast . Philip suggested that the lamps be lighted . Andrew , who was near the door to an adjoining room , went out and returned with a taper . Old Benyosef held up a lamp and Andrew lighted it . Jesus was not there . ' Vanished ? ' Marcellus sat up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . He might have gone out through the door . But nobody heard it open or close . ' Had he come in through the door ? ' I do n't know . I did n't hear it . The first I knew , he was standing there beside Thomas . And then  --  when the lamp was lighted  --  he was n't there . ' What do you suppose became of him ? ' I do n't know . ' Justus shook his head . There was a long silence . Ever see him again ? ' asked Marcellus . Justus nodded . Once more , ' he said , about a month afterward . But in the meantime , he was seen up here in Galilee . A very unfortunate thing happenedon the night Jesus was tried . When they had him before old Annas , Simon was waiting in the courtyard where the legionaries had built a fire . A servant-girl said to Simon , " Are n't you a friend of this Galilean ? " And Simon said , " No  --  I do n't know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the disciples , ' remarked Marcellus . That 's what made it so bad , ' sighed Justus . Ordinarily , Simon is a bold fellow , with plenty of courage . But he certainly did himself no credit that night . He followed along , at a distance , when they took Jesus to the Insula , and waited , across the street , while the trial was held . I do n't know where he went after the procession started out toward the place of execution , or where he spent the night andp321the next day . I heard him confess it all . He was sick with remorse , and hurried back home . ' ' So  --  Simon was n't present on that first occasion when the disciplesthought they saw Jesus . ' ' No  --  but Jesus told them to be sure and tell Simon . ' Did Jesus know that Simon had denied his friendship ? ' Oh , yes  --  he knew . You see that 's why he was so anxious to have Simon know that everything was all right again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas decided to take old Bartholomew home . He had been sick . They put him on a donkey and set out for Galilee where they found Peter , restless and heartsore , and told him what had happened . He was for rushing back to Jerusalem , but they counseled him to wait ; for the news of Jesus ' return was being noised about , and the priests were asking questions . And Benyosef 's shop was being watched . So  --  that night , they all went fishing . In the early morning , at sunrise , they left off and sailed toward the east shore . Bartholomew said that when they were within about two hundred cubits of the beach  --  chilled and drowsy from their long night on the water  --  they were suddenly roused by a loud shout and a splash . Simon had jumped overboard and was swimming . They all leaped up to see what had come over Simon . And they saw Jesus standing at the water 's edge , waiting . It was a very tender meeting , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  Marcellus ' voice was impatient  --  ' did he vanish  --  as before ? ' Not at once . They broiled fish for breakfast on the beach . He sat and talked with them for above an hour , showing special attention to Simon . ' What did he talk about ? ' Their future duties , ' replied Justus , to remember and tell the things he had taught . He would come back , he said , though he could not tell them the day or the hour . They were to be on the alert for his coming . After they had eaten , someone suggested that they return to Capernaum . They had beached the boat , and all hands  --  except Jesus  --  fell to work , pushing off into the water . Bartholomew was up in the bow , rigging a sail . The others scrambled over the side and shipped the oars . When they looked about for Jesus , he was nowhere to be seen . ' But he appeared again  --  another time ? ' The last time he was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on a hill top in Judea , a few miles north of Jerusalem . Perhaps I should tell you that the disciples and other friends of Jesus were closely watched , through those days . Such meetings as we had were late in the night and held in obscure places . In Jerusalem , the Temple people had the legionaries of the Insula patrolling the streets in search of us . Up here in Galilee , Herod Antipas and Julian the Legate had threatened death to anyone who so much as spoke Jesus ' name . ' They too believed that he had returned to life ? ' inquired Marcellus . Perhaps not . I do n't know . But they knew they had failed to dispose of him . They thought the people would soon forget and settle down to their old ways ; but it soon appeared that Jesus had set some forces in motion  --  ' I do n't understand , ' broke in Marcellus . What forces ? ' ' Well  --  for one thing  --  the Temple revenues were falling off . Hundreds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synagogues whose priests had persecuted Jesus . There was no violence ; but in the market-places throughout all Judea , Samaria , and Galilee , merchants who had thought to win favor with the authorities by denouncing Jesus found that their business was failing . The Christians were patronizing one another . It was apparent that they were in collusion and had a secret understanding . An edict was published prohibiting any assembly of Jesus ' adherents . We agreed among ourselves to hold no more meetings until such time as it might be more prudent . ' How many Christians were there in Jerusalem , at that time ? ' asked Marcellus . A score , perhaps ? ' About five hundred that had declared themselves . One afternoon , about five weeks after the crucifixion , Alphaeus came to my house saying that Simon had called a meeting . A week hence , we were to assemble shortly after sunrise on a hill , quite off the highway , where we had often spent a day of rest when Jesus was with us . Knowing it was dangerous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our belief , we journeyed singly . It was a beautiful morning . As I came to the well-remembered footpath that led across the fields toward the hills , I saw  --  in the early dawn-light  --  several men preceding me ; though I could identify none but Simon , who is a tall man . As the grade grew steeper , I overtook old Bartholomewleaning on his staff , already tired and laboring for breath . ' He had walked all that way from Capernaum ? ' asked Marcellus . And had spent the whole week at it , ' said Justus . But it seemedthat the hill would be too much for him . I counseled him not totry ; that his heart might fail him ; but he would n't listen . So I gavep323him an arm and we trudged along slowly up the winding path that became more difficult with every turn . Occasionally we had glimpses of the others , widely separated , as they climbed the rugged grade . We were about halfway up when Bartholomew stopped , pointed with his staff , and hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I looked up  --  and there he was ! He was wearing a white robe . The sunshine made it appear dazzling . He was standing on the big white rock  --  at the summit  --  waiting . ' Were you amazed ? ' ' No  --  not amazed ; but eager to press on . Bartholomew urged me to leave him . He would make it alone , he said . But the good old man was half-dead with weariness , so I supported him the rest of the way . When we came out at length on the little plateau in a shady grove , we saw him . Jesus was standing , with both arms outstretchedin a gesture of blessing . The disciples were kneeling about his feet . Simon , with his great hands covering his face , had bowed over until his head nearly touched the ground . Poor old Bartholomew , much moved and thoroughly spent , could n't take another step . He fell to his knees . So did I , though we were at least a hundredcubits from the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a moment he was overcome with emotion . Marcelluswaited silently for him to regain his self-control . After a while , ' continued Justus , thickly , we heard the murmuringof voices . We raised our eyes . He was gone . ' Where , Justus ? Where do you think he went ? ' asked Marcellus , huskily . I do n't know , my friend . I only know that he is alive  --  and I am always expecting to see him . Sometimes I feel aware of him , as if he were close by . ' Justus smiled faintly , his eyes wet with tears . It keeps you honest , ' he went on . You have no temptation to cheat anyone , or lie to anyone , or hurt anyone  --  when , for all you know , Jesus is standing beside you . ' I 'm afraid I should feel very uncomfortable , ' remarked Marcellus , being perpetually watched by some invisible presence . ' Not if that presence helped you defend yourself against yourself , Marcellus . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you at your best . ' Justus suddenly came to his feet , and went to the door of the tent . A lantern was bobbing through the trees . Someone coming ? ' inquired Marcellus , sitting up . A legionary , ' muttered Justus . News of Demetrius , perhaps . ' Marcellus joined Justus at the tent door . A tall legionary stood before them.  | ' I bear a message , ' he announced , from Legate Paulus to Tribune Marcellus Lucan Gallio . ' Tribune ! ' murmured Justus  --  in an agitated voice . The Legate presents his compliments , ' continued the legionary , in formal tones , and desires his excellent friend , Tribune Marcellus , to be his guest tonight at the fort . If it is your wish , you may accompany me , sir , and I shall light your way . ' Very good , ' said Marcellus . I shall be ready in a moment . Tarry for me at the gate . ' The legionary brought up his spear in a salute and marched away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have betrayed my people ! ' moaned Justus , sinking down on his cot . I have delivered my friends into the hands of their enemies ! ' ' No  --  Justus  --  no ! ' Marcellus laid a hand on his shoulder . All this may seem disquieting to you , but I assure you I am not a spy ! It is possible I may befriend you and your people . Wait for me here . I shall return by midday tomorrow : Justus made no response ; sat dejectedly , with his face in his hands , until Marcellus ' footsteps faded away . It was a long night of agony and remorse . When the first pale blue light appeared , the heavyheartedGalilean gathered up his few belongings ; made his way to the silent street , and trudged along , past the old fort , to the plaza . For a long time , he sat on the marble steps of the synagogue , and when the sun had risen he proceeded to the little house where he had left Jonathan . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are early , ' she said . I was not expecting you so soon . Ihope all is well with you , ' she added , searching his troubled face . I wish to be on the road as soon as may be , ' he replied . But where is your young Roman  --  and your little pack-train ? ' They are remaining here , ' said Justus . Jonathan and I are goinghome . ' PAULUS had been in command of the fort at Capernaum only a week , but he already knew he was n't going to like it here . For a dozen years he had been hoping to get out of Minoa . Itp325was a disgrace to be stationed there , and the Empire meant you to realize that an appointment to this fort was a degradation . The buildings were ugly and shabby , the equipment bad , the climate abominable . No provision had ever been made for an adequatewater-supply . On the sun-blistered grounds there was n't a tree , a flower , or a blade of grass ; not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrasive dust . You could n't keep clean if you wanted to , and after a few months at Minoa you did n't care . The garrison was lazy , surly , dirty , and tough . With little to do , except occasional brief and savage raids on the Bedouins , discipline was loose and erratic . There were no decent diversions ; no entertainment . When you could n't bear the boredom and discomfort another minute , you went down to Gaza and got drunk , and were lucky if you did n't get into a bloody brawl . As for that vicious old city , was not Gaza known throughout the world for the squalor of its stinking kennels where the elderly riff-raff of a half-dozen quarrelsome races screamed imprecations , and the younger scum swapped unpleasant maladies , and the haplessstranger was stripped and robbed in broad daylight ? Gaza had her little imperfections ; there was no doubt about that . But she had docks and wharves and a spacious harbor . Little coastal ships tied up to her piers ; bigger ships lay at anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and go , and felt you were still in contact with the outside world . Sometimes ships ' officers would come out to the fort for a roistering evening ; sometimes military men you had known in Rome would visit you while their vessel took on cargo . Paulus ' unexpected appointment to Capernaum had been receivedwith hilarious joy . He had never been there , but he had heard something about its quiet charm . Old Julian had been envied his post . For one thing  --  the fort was within a half-hour 's ride of Tiberias , that ostentatious seat of the enormously wealthy sycophant , Herod Antipas . Paulus had no notion he was going to like this toad : he had nothing but contempt for these provincial lickspittles who would sell their own sisters for a smile from some influential Roman ; but Herod frequently entertained interesting guests who , though they might despise him , must make a show of honoring his position as Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea . And Capernaum , everyone said , was beautiful ; ringed by green hills , with snow-capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . The people were docile . They were reputed to be melancholy over the execution of their Jesus , but they were not violently resentful . Doubtless that problem would solve itself if you gave it time . Old Julian 's tactics  --  listening at the keyholes of cottages for revolutionary talk , the posting of harsh edicts , floggingsand imprisonments  --  what did they accomplish but to band these simple , harmless people together for mutual sympathy ? Of course , if the foolhardy fishermen persisted in making a nuisance of their cult , you would have to punish them , or get yourself into trouble with Herod . That 's what you would be there for  --  to keep the peace . Now that you were here , you had much more peace than you had bargained for . Had the gods ever ordained such quiet nights ? Paulus had not fully appreciated this oppressive silence for the first day or two . There was the novelty of settling into his immeasurably better quarters . He proudly inspected the trim pleasure-craft that Herod had placed at the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking kindly of old Julian whom he had never had any use for . The fort buzzed with activity . A fairly large contingent from Minoa had accompanied Paulus . There had been the usual festivitiesat the Insula in Jerusalem during Passover Week  --  though Paulus had been moody and taciturn , anxious to have it over with , and move on . His retinue had come along to Capernaum , for defenseon the journey as well as to dignify his inauguration . A generousdinner had been served after the ceremonies to which Herod  --  represented by a deputy  --  had contributed lavish supplies of potent wine . It was a noisy night . Heads had been cracked , noses flattened , more urgent arguments had been settled with knives . Paulus had filled the courtroom with battered celebrants ; had crowded the guardhouse ; had stormed and shouted oaths new to the local legionaries ; and , well pleased with his first day 's duties , had gone to bed tight as a drum . Next day , the Minoa contingent had left for home  --  all but Sextus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premonition of loneliness  --  hadtold Sextus to remain , at least for a time . And when the last of them had disappeared , a strange quietness settled over the fort . That night , after Sextus had ambled off early to bed , Paulus sat by his window watching the moonlight on the lake . Except for Sextus ' snoring , the silence was profound . Perhaps it had been a mistake to retain Sextus . He was n't very good company , after all . What did one do for diversion in Capernaum ? The little town was sound asleep . The Herod family was away . Tiberias was dead as a doornail . If this was a sample of life at Capernaum , you had been better off at Minoa.  |p327The  days trudged along , scraping their sandal-heels ; sitting down , now and then , for a couple of hours , while Time remained standing . Paulus , strolling in the courtyard , paused before the sundial , read its laconic warning , Tempus fugit , ' and sourly remarked to Sextus , It 's apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulus was so restless that he even thought of contrivingsome errand to Jerusalem , though his recent visit there had been lacking in interest . Perhaps that was because the insufferable young Quintus , who had been sent by the Crown to reshuffle the Palestinian commands , was too , too much in evidence . Paulus , who was a good hater , had never despised anybody so quickly , so earnestly . Quintus was a vain , overbearing , patronizing , strutting peacock ; he was an insolent , ill-mannered puppy ; he was a pompous ass ! In short , Paulus did n't like him at all . But Quintus would have sailed for home by now . Maybe Quintus was what had ailed Jerusalem , this time . It was late afternoon . The sun was setting . Paulus and Sextus had been apathetically shaking the old leather dice-cup on the long table in the courtroom . Sextus yawned cavernously and wiped his eyes . If it 's bedtime , ' drawled Paulus , perhaps we 'd better light the lamps . ' He clapped his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guard saluted and made haste to obey . Nine , ' mumbled the Legate , handing the dice-cup to his drowsy friend . At this juncture , old Namius had come in with three disheveled slaves . Somewhere , Paulus felt , he had seen that tall Greek . Sextus jogged his memory . Ah  --  Demetrius ! He had always liked Demetrius , in spite of his cool superiority . Demetrius was a haughty fellow , but you had respect for him . Paulus suddenly recalled havingseen an announcement , posted at the Insula in Jerusalem , offeringa reward for the capture of a Greek slave belonging to Tribune Marcellus Gallio . The bulletin said that the Greek had assaulted a Roman citizen in Athens , and was thought to be in hiding in Jerusalem . So  --  here he was . Somebody had gathered him in . But no  --  a brief examination revealed that Demetrius had been arrested on suspicion . He had been loitering ; he was shabby ; he had money . In prison he had fought the rascally Syrians who denied him water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about Marcellus , who had been reported crazy  --  or the next thing to it  --  and was delighted to learn that his friend was in the neighborhood . But before he could release Demetrius , he must learn something about this charge against him . If it were true that he had ' struck a Roman , and run away , you could n't dismiss him so easily . Paulus put them all out , including Sextus , who did n't like it . ' Demetrius '  --  Paulus frowned judiciously  --  ' what have you to say about this report that you are a fugitive ; that you struck a Roman citizen in Athens ? That is very serious , you know ! ' It is true , sir , ' replied Demetrius , without hesitation . I found it necessary to punish Tribune Quintus severely . ' Quintus ! ' shouted the Legate . You mean to say you struck Quintus ? ' He leaned forward over the desk , eyes beaming . Tell me all about it ! ' Well , sir  --  the Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . While waiting for the reply , he made himself grossly offensive to the daughter of the innkeeper . They are a highly respected family , sir , and the young woman was not accustomed to being treated like a common trollop . Her father was present , but feared to intervene lest they all be thrown into prison : ' So  --  you came to the damsel 's rescue , eh ? ' Yes , sir . ' Do n't you know you can be put to death for so much as touchinga Roman Tribune ? ' demanded Paulus , sternly ; and when Demetrius had slowly and remorsefully nodded his head , the Legate 's frown relaxed , and he asked , in a confidential tone , What did you do to him ? ' I struck him in the face with my fist , sir , ' confessed Demetrius . ' And  --  once I had struck him  --  I knew I had committed a crime punishable by death , and could n't make my position any worse , so  --  ' So  --  you hit him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did he fight back ? ' No , sir . The Tribune was not expecting that first blow , and was unprepared for the next one . ' In the face ? ' Paulus ' eyes were wide and bright . Many times , sir , ' admitted Demetrius . Knock him down ? ' Oh , yes , sir ; and held him up by his helmet-strap , and beat his eyes shut . I was very angry , sir . ' Yes  --  I can see that you were . ' Paulus put both hands over his suddenly puffed cheeks and stifled something like a hiccough . And then you ran off ? ' Without a moment 's delay , sir . There was a ship sailing . The Captain befriended me . Tribune Quintus was on board , and would have had me apprehended , but the Captain let me escape in the small boat at Gaza . From there I walked to Jerusalem . '  |p329Did  n't the Captain know he could be punished for that ? ' growled Paulus . What was his name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demetrius , after some hesitation . That is undoubtedly a lie , ' said Paulus , but you are to be commendedfor your loyalty . So , then , you went to Jerusalem . Why ? ' My master expected to come shortly . ' What did you do there ? ' Demetrius told him of the weaver 's shop . Paulus grew interested again . I understand there is a weaver 's shop where the leaders of the Jesus-people meet . What was the name of your weaver ? ' Benyosef , sir . ' That was the name ! And how did you happen to be in that company , Demetrius ? Are you , perhaps , one of these  --  thesewhatdo they call them  --  Christians ? ' Yes , sir , ' confessed Demetrius , tardily . Not a very good one ; but I believe as they do . ' You ca n't ! ' shouted Paulus . You have a good mind ! You do n't mean to tell me that you believe all this nonsense  --  about Jesus returning to life , and being seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Demetrius . I am sure that is true . ' ' But  --  see here ! ' Paulus stood up . You were out there , that day , and saw him die ! ' Yes , sir . I am sure he died ; and I am sure he is alive . ' Have you seen him ? ' Paulus ' voice was unsteady . Demetrius shook his head and the Legate grinned . I had n't thought , ' he said , dryly , that you could be taken in by such a story . Men who die do not return . Only fools think so ! ' Paulus sat down again , relaxing in his chair . But you are not a fool . What makes you believe that ? ' I heard the story from a man who did see him ; a man of sound mind ; a man who does not lie . ' Demetrius broke off , though it was evident he would have said more . Very well ; go on ! ' commanded the Legate . It did not surprise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person like that before . Surely  --  you , sir , must have noticed that . He had something nobody else ever had ! I do n't believe he was an ordinary man , sir . ' How do you mean  --  not ordinary ? Are you trying to say that you think he was something else than a man ? You do n't think he was a god ? ' Yes , sir , ' said Demetrius , firmly . I think he was  --  and is  --  a god ! '  | Nonsense ! Do n't you know we are locking up people for saying things like that about this dead Galilean ? ' Paulus rose impetuously and paced back and forth behind the long table . I mean to let you go  --  for your master 's sake ; but '  --  he stopped suddenly and shook a warning finger  --  ' you are to clear out of Galilee  --  and there 's to be no more talk about this Jesus . And if you ever tell anyone that you told me about your assault on Quintus  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogged ! Do you understand ? I 'll have you stripped and lashed with a bull-whip ! ' Thank you , sir , ' said Demetrius , gratefully . I am very sorry that I struck him . ' Then you do n't deserve your freedom , ' growled Paulus . That 's why I am turning you loose  --  and now you 're sorry you did it . And you believe that dead men come to life . You 're crazy ! ' He clapped his hands , and a guard stalked in . Make this Greek comfortable , ' he barked . Have the physician attend to his cuts . Give him a good supper and a bed . He is to be realeased from prison . ' Demetrius wincingly brought his arm up in a salute , and turned to follow . One more thing ! ' rasped Paulus , to the guard . When you have finished with the Greek , return here . I want you to carry a message to Shalum 's Inn . Make haste ! ' Marcellus was pleased to observe that Paulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informality of their friendship was effortlessly resumed . A small table had been laid in the Legate 's handsomely furnished suite ; a silver cake-tray , a bowl of fresh fruit , a tall flagon of wine . Paulus , clean-shaven , wearing an expensive white toga and a red silk bandeau that accented the whiteness of his close-cropped hair , was a distinguished figure . He met his guest in the doorway and embracedhim warmly . Welcome , good Marcellus ! ' he exclaimed . And welcome to Galilee ; though , if you have been touring about up here , you may be better acquainted with this province than I : It is a delight to see you again , Paulus ! ' rejoined Marcellus . All my good wishes for the success and happiness of your new command ! It was most generous of you to send for me . ' With his arm around Marcellus ' shoulders , Paulus guided his friend to a chair by the table , and sauntered to its mate on the other side . Come ; sit down . ' He filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you must tell me what brings you into my quiet little Galilee . ' Marcellus smiled , raised the goblet to the level of his eyes , and bowed to his host . It would take an hour to explain my errand , Paulus , ' he replied , sipping his wine . A long story  --  and a somewhat fantastic one , too . In short , the Emperor ordered me to learn something more about the Galilean whom we put to death . ' A painful business for you , I think , ' frowned Paulus . I still reproachmyself for placing you in such an unhappy position that night at the Procurator 's banquet . I did not see you again , or I should have tried to make amends . If it is not too late to say so I am sorry it happened . I was drunk : We all were , ' remembered Marcellus . I bore you no ill-will . ' But it was n't drunkenness that ailed you , sir , when you groped your way out of that banquet-hall . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to you . Even I , drunk as I was , could see that . By the gods !  --  I thought you must have sighted a ghost ! ' Raising his goblet , Paulus drank deeply ; then , shrugging his dour mood aside , he brightened . But why revive unpleasant memories ? You were a long time ill . I heard of it and was sad . But now you are quite recovered . That is well . You are the picture of health , Marcellus . Drink  --  my friend ! You have hardly tasted your wine ; and it is good . ' Native ? ' Marcellus took another sip . Paulus grinned ; then suddenly stiffened to pantomime an attitude of cool hauteur . My eminent patron , ' he declaimed , with elaborate mockery , my exalted lord , the ineffable Herod Antipas  --  Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea , robber of the poor , foot-washer to any titled Roman that comes within reach  --  he sent the wine . And though Herod himself may be a low form of life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ august role , Paulus added , casually , I have had no native wine yet . By the way  --  the country people have a story that our Jesus once supplied a wedding-party with a rare vintage that he made by doing some incantations over a water-pot . There are innumerableyarns of this order . Perhaps you have heard them . ' Marcellus nodded , but did not share the Legate 's cynical amusement . Yes , ' he said , soberly . I have heard them . They are very hard to understand . ' Understand ! ' echoed Paulus . Do n't tell me you have tried to understand them ! Have we not plenty of such legends in Rome  --  tales that no one in his right senses gives a second thought to ? '  | Yes  --  I know , Paulus , ' agreed Marcellus , quietly , and I should want to be among the last to believe them ; but  --  ' At the significant pause , Paulus stood up , busying himself with refilling their goblets . He offered the silver cake-tray , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impatience . I hope you are n't going to say that these Galilean stories are credible , Marcellus , ' he remarked , coolly . This Jesus was a strange man , Paulus . ' Granted ! By no means an ordinary man ! He had a peculiar kind of courage , and a sort of majesty  --  all his own . But I hope you do n't believe that he changed water into wine ! ' I do not know , Paulus , ' replied Marcellus , slowly . I saw a child who had been born with a crippled foot ; now as active as any other little boy : How do you know he was born with a crippled foot ? ' demanded Paulus . The whole village knew . There was no reason why they should have invented the story for my benefit . They were suspicious of me . In fact , the boy 's grandfather , my guide , was reluctant to talk about it . ' Well  --  you can be sure there is some reasonable explanation , ' rasped Paulus . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they even believe that this man came to life  --  and has been seen ! ' Marcellus nodded thoughtfully . I heard that story for the first time about an hour ago , Paulus . It is amazing ! ' It is preposterous ! ' shouted Paulus . These fools should have contented themselves with tales of water changed to wine  --  and the magical healing of the sick . ' Paulus drank again , noisily . His ruddy face showed annoyance as he watched Marcellus absently toying with the stem of his goblet , his eyes averted . You know well enough that the Galilean was dead ! ' he stormed , angrily . No one can tell you or me that he came to life ! ' Drawing up the sleeve of his toga , Paulus tapped his muscular forearm with measuring fingers , and shrilled , I thrust my spear into his chest that deep ! ' Marcellus glanced up , nodded , and dropped his eyes again , withoutcomment . Paulus suddenly leaned forward over the table , and brought his fist down with a thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' you believe it ! ' There was a tense silence for a long moment . Marcellus stirred and slowly raised his eyes , quite unruffled by the Legate 's outburst.  |p333'I  do n't know what to believe , Paulus , ' he said , quietly . Of course my natural reaction is the same as yours ; but  --  there is a great mystery here , my friend . If this story is a trumped-up lie , the men who have been telling it at the risk of their lives are quite mad ; yet they do not talk like madmen . They have nothing to gain  --  and everything to lose  --  by reporting that they saw him . ' ' Oh  --  1 ' 11 concede that , ' declared Paulus , loftily . It 's no uncommonthing for a fanatic to be reckless with his life ; but  --  look you , Marcellus !  --  however difficult that is to understand  --  you ca n't have a dead man coming back from his grave ! Why  --  a man who could overcome death , could  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything ! He could defy any power on earth ! If he cared to , he might have the whole world for his kingdom ! ' Paulus drank greedily , spilling some of it on the table . Odd thing to say , ' he muttered , thickly . There was some talk at his trial  --  about his kingdom : remember ? Pilate asked him  --  absurdly enough , I thought  --  if he were a king . ' Paulus chuckled mirthlessly . He said he was  --  and it shook Pilate a little , too . Indeed  --  itstunned everybody , for a minute ; just the cool audacity of it . I was talking with Vinitius , that night at the banquet , and he said the Galilean explained that his kingdom was not in the world ; but  --  that does n't mean anything . Or does it ? ' Well  --  it certainly would n't mean anything if I said it , ' replied Marcellus . But if a man who had been out of this life were able to return from  --  from wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You 're talking rubbish , Marcellus , ' scoffed Paulus . I 'll assist you , ' he went on , drunkenly . You are my guest , and I must be polite . If it 's so  --  that a dead man  --  with some kind of elsewhere-kingdom  --  has come back to life :  --  mind you , now , I know it is n't so  --  but if it 's so  --  I 'd rather it were this Jesus than Quintus or Julian or Pilate  --  or the half-witted Gaius that old Julia whelped . ' He laughed boisterously at his own absurdity . Or old Tiberius ! By the gods !  --  when crazy old Tiberius dies , I 'll wager he stays dead ! By the way  --  do you mean to go back and tell the old fool this story ? He 'll believe it , you know , and it will scare the very liver out of him ! ' Marcellus grinned tolerantly , reflecting that the Legate  --  albeit pretty drunk  --  had said something worth thinking about . Good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a king who knows how to outlive all the other kings , it might be a great thing for the world if he were a person of good deeds and not evil ones :  | The Legate 's face sobered , and Marcellus , noting his serious interest , enlarged upon his impromptu idea . Consider these tales about Jesus , Paulus . He is reputed to have made blind men see : there is no story that he made any man blind . He is said to have changed water into wine ; not wine into water . He made a crippled child walk ; he never made any child a cripple . ' Excellent ! ' applauded Paulus . The kings have been destroyers , despoilers . They have made men blind , crippled , broken . ' He paused , and went on , muttering half to himself , Would n't the world be surprised if once it should have a government that came to the rescue of the blind and sick and lame ? By the gods !  --  I wish this absurd tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Paulus , or are you jesting ? ' demanded Marcellus , earnestly . Well '  --  compromised the Legate  --  I 'm as serious as the matter warrants , seeing it has n't a leg to stand on . ' His forehead wrinkled in a judicial frown . ' But  --  see here , Marcellus , are n't you going in for this Jesus business a little too far for your own good ? ' Marcellus made no reply , other than an enigmatic pursing of the lips . Paulus grinned , shrugged , and replenished his goblet . His manner said they would drop that phase of the subject . What else do they say about him , up here in the country ? ' he asked negligently . You seem to have been making inquiries . ' They have a story in Cana , ' replied Marcellus , casually , about a young woman who discovered she could sing . The people think Jesus was responsible for it . ' Taught her to sing ? ' No . One day she found that she could sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard her , Paulus . There has n't been anything quite like it  --  so far as I know . ' Indeed ! ' enthused Paulus . I must tell the Tetrarch . It 's part of my business , you know , to please the old rascal . He may invite her to entertain one of his banquets . ' No , Paulus , please ! ' protested Marcellus . This girl has been gently bred . Moreover , she is a cripple ; ca n't stand up ; never leaves the neighborhood . ' He gave her a voice , and left her a cripple ; eh ? ' Paulus grinned . How do you explain that ? ' I do n't explain it ; I just report it . But  --  1 sincerely hope you will say nothing about her to Herod . She would feel very much out of place in his palace , if what I have heard about him is correct . ' If what you 've heard is revolting , ' commented Paulus , bitterly , it 's correct . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their advantage if one of their daughters sang acceptablyfor the lecherous old fox . ' No ! ' snapped Marcellus , hotly . She and her family are friends of mine . I beg of you not to degrade her with an invitation to meet Herod Antipas or any member of his household ! ' Paulus agreed that they were a precious lot of scoundrels , includingHerod 's incorrigible daughter Salome . A dangerous little vixen , he declared , responsible for a couple of assassinations , and notoriously unchaste . He chuckled unpleasantly , and added that she had come by her talents honestly enough , seeing that her father  --  if he was her father  --  had n't even the respect of the Sanhedrin , and her mother was as promiscuous as a cat . He snorted contemptuously , and drank to take the taste of them out of his mouth . Marcellus scowled , but made no comment . Presently he became aware that Paulus was regarding him with a friendly but reproachfulinspection. 1 wonder if you realize , Marcellus , ' Paulus was saying , that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I talk to you about that , without giving offense ? ' Why not , Paulus ? ' replied Marcellus , graciously . Why not ? Because it may sound impertinent . We are of the same rank . It does not behoove me to give you advice  --  much less injunctions . ' Injunctions ? ' Marcellus ' brows lifted a little . I 'm afraid I do n't understand . ' Let me explain , then . I assume you know what has been happening in Palestine during the past year . For a few weeks , after the execution of the Galilean , his movement appeared to be a closed incident . The leaders of his party scattered , most of them returning to this neighborhood . The influential men of Jerusalem were satisfied . There were sporadic rumors that Jesus had been seen in various places after his death , but nobody with any sense took these tales seriously . It was expected that the whole affair would presently be forgotten . ' And then it revived , ' remarked Marcellus , as Paulus paused to take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't died . Undercover groups had been meeting in many cities . For a few months there were very few outward signs of it . The authorities had contempt for it , feeling that it was a thing of no importance , either as to size or quality . Then  --  one day  --  it began to dawn on the priests that their synagogues were not being patronized ; the tithes were not paid . Then the merchantsobserved that their business was increasingly bad . In Jericho ,  | more than half of the population now make no secret of their affiliations . In Antioch , the Christians are quite outspoken ; adding daily to their numbers . Nor is interest in this party limited to the poor and helpless , as was at first supposed . Nobody knows how many there are in Jerusalem , but the Temple is beside itself with anxiety and anger , prodding the Insula to do something drastic . Old Julian is being harassed by the priests and merchants , who are making it plain that he must act  --  or resign . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcellus . ' Well '  --  Paulus flicked his hands in a baffled gesture  --  it 's obvious that the movement can not be tolerated . It may look innocuousto a casual visitor like yourself ; but , to the solid respectables of Jerusalem , it is treason , mutiny , blasphemy , and a general disintegrationof their established ways . Julian does n't want a bloody riot on his hands , and has been playing for time ; but the city fathers are at the end of their patience . ' But  --  surely they ca n't find much fault with the things Jesus taught , ' interposed Marcellus . He urged kindness , fair dealing , good will . Do n't the influential men of Palestine believe in letting the people treat one another decently ? ' That is n't the point , Marcellus , and you know it , ' argued Paulus , impatiently . These Christians are refusing to do business on the old basis . More and more they are patronizing one another . Why  --  right here in little Capernaum  --  if you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shop , it does n't pay to open up . ' He studied his friend 's interested face  --  and grinned . I suppose you know what that fish stands for . ' Marcellus nodded  --  and smiled broadly . ' No  --  it is n't a bit funny ! ' warned Paulus , grimly . And I must strongly counsel you that the less you see of these Christians , the better it will be for '  --  he checked himself , and finished lamely in a tone almost inaudible  --  ' for all of us . ' But  --  for me  --  in particular , I think you mean , ' said Marcellus . Have it your own way . ' Paulus waved his arm . I 'm not having a good time  --  saying these things to you . But  --  I do n't want to see you get into trouble . And you easily could , you know ! When the pressure is put on , it 's going to get rough ! The fact that you 're a Roman Tribune will not count for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make war on the Christians , Marcellus , no matter who they are ! Why do n't you clear out before you are apprehended ? Take your slave  --  and go ! ' I do not know where he is , ' admitted Marcellus . Well  --  I do , ' grinned Paulus . He is in bed , somewhere here in the fort . '  |p337A  prisoner ? ' No  --  but he ought to be . ' The Legate laughingly recounted the afternoon 's revelations . By the way , ' he ended , did you see him destroy Quintus ? ' Marcellus , who had been much amused by the recital , shook his head . I saw the Tribune shortly afterward , ' he said . The work had been well done , I assure you . ' It gratified me to hear about it , ' said Paulus , as I have no respect for Quintus and his misfortunes do not annoy me ; but '  --  he grew suddenly serious  --  ' this was no light offense , and may yet have to be settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope he will not linger in this country ; at least , not in my jurisdiction . Nor you , Marcellus ! Consider your predicament : your slave is wanted for assaulting a Tribune ; moreover , he is known to have been in close association with the Christian party in Jerusalem . He can be apprehendedon either count . Now  --  it may be assumed that you know all this . In short , you have been harboring a criminal and a Christian ; and your own position as a friend of the Christians is of no advantage to you . What do you intend to do about it ? ' I had thought of remaining in Palestine for a few weeks , before proceeding to Rome , ' said Marcellus . I have no definite plans . ' Better have some plans ! ' advised Paulus , sternly . Your situation is more hazardous than you think . It will do your pious Galilean friends no good to have you championing their cause . I tell you candidly that they are all in imminent danger of arrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , go quietly across country to Joppa , and take the first ship that heads for home . ' Thanks for the counsel , Paulus , ' replied Marcellus , noncommittally . May I have a word with Demetrius now ? ' Paulus frowned darkly and dismissed the request with a gesture of exasperation . The fact that your Greek slave is a superior fellow and your friend , ' he said , crisply , does not alter his status in the opinion of my own retinue . I suggest that you wait until morning to see him . ' As you like , ' said Marcellus , unruffled . Paulus rose unsteadily . Let us retire now , ' he said , more cordially , and meet for breakfastat sunrise . Then '  --  he smiled meaningly  --  If you will insist upon leaving at once , I shall speed you on your way . I shall do better than that : I shall order a small detachment of legionaries , acquainted with the less traveled roads , to see you safely to Joppa . ' But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firmly.  | I am not leaving Palestine until I have fully satisfied myself about this story of the Galilean 's return to life . ' And how are you to do that ? ' demanded Paulus . By interviewinga few deluded fishermen , perhaps ? ' That 's one way of putting it , ' rejoined Marcellus , unwilling to take offense . I want to talk with some of the leaders . ' They are not here now , ' said Paulus . The foremost of them are in Jerusalem . ' Then I am going to Jerusalem ! ' For a moment , Paulus , with tight lips , deliberated a reply . A sardonic grin slowly twisted his mouth . If you start tomorrow for Jerusalem , ' he predicted ominously , you should arrive about the right time to find them all in prison . Then  --  unless you are more prudent than you appear to be at present  --  you will get into a lot of trouble . ' He clapped his hands for the guard . Show the Tribune to his room , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geniality , he smiled and said , I hope you rest well . We will see each other in the morning . ' THEY entered the city unchallenged two hours before sunset . The sentries at the Damascus Gate did not so much as bother to ask Marcellus his name or what manner of cargo was strapped to the tired little donkeys . It was evident that Jerusalem was not on the alert . The journey from Capernaum had been made with dispatch , considering the travelers were on foot . By rising before dawn and keeping steadily at it  --  even through the sultry valleys , where all prudent rested in the shade while the sun was high  --  the trip had been accomplished in three days . Warned by Paulus ' grim forecast of drastic action about to be taken against the Christians , Marcellus had expected to encounter arrogant troops and frightened people , but the roads were quiet and the natives were going about their small affairs with no apparent feeling of insecurity . If it were true that a concerted attack on them had been planned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capernaum had been almost without inci/dent . Arriving early at the tent , they found that Justus had disappeared . Shalum had no explanation to offer . The mother of little Thomas , when they stopped at her home to make inquiries , had no more to say than that Justus and Jonathan had left for Sepphoris an hour ago . Marcellus had a momentary impulse to follow them and reassure Justus ; but , remembering Paulus ' injunction that the Galileans would now be better served if he gave them no further attention , he proceeded on his way with many misgivings . It was no small matter to have lost Justus ' friendship . He wanted to stop in Cana and have a farewell word with Miriam , but decided against it . After supper that first night out  --  they had camped in a meadow five miles southeast of Cana  --  Marcellus had insisted on hearing all about Demetrius ' experiences with the Christians in Jerusalem , especially with reference to their belief in the reappearance of Jesus . The Greek was more than willing to tell everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the resurrection story . But  --  Demetrius  --  that is impossible , you know ! ' Marcellus had declared firmly when his slave had finished . Yes , I know , sir , ' Demetrius had admitted . But you believe it ! ' Yes , sir . ' ' Well  --  there 's no sense to be made out of that ! ' grumbled Marcellus , impatiently . To admit a thing 's impossible , and in the next breath confess your belief in it , leaves your argument in very bad shape . ' If you will pardon me , sir , ' ventured Demetrius , I was not arguing . You asked me : I told you . I am not trying to persuade you to believe in it . And I agree that what I have been saying does n't make sense . ' Then the story is nonsense ! ' reasoned Marcellus ; and after he had given his slave ample time to reply , he added crisply , Is n't it ? ' ' No , sir , ' reiterated Demetrius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it did . ' Feeling that this sort of conversation did n't have much to recommend it , Marcellus had mumbled good night and pretended to sleep . On the next day and the day thereafter , the subject had been discussedon the road , as profitlessly . Jesus had been seen after his death . Such things did n't happen ; could n't happen . Nevertheless , he had been seen ; not once , but many times ; not by one man only , but by a score . Demetrius was advised that he was losing his mind.  | it conceded the point without debate and offered to change the subject . He was told that he had been duped and deluded , to which accusation he responded with an indulgent nod and a smile . Marcelluswas thoroughly exasperated . He wanted to talk about it ; wanted Demetrius to plead his case , if he had one , with an air of deep conviction . You could n't get anywhere with a man who , when you called him a fool , calmly admitted it . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , taking pains to make it sound derisive , that a man with as sound a mind as yours would turn out to be so childishly superstitious ! ' ' To tell you the truth , sir , ' Demetrius had replied , ' I am surprised at it myself . ' They had been trudging along , with Marcellus a little in advance , stormily vaunting his indignation over his slave 's stubborn imbecility , when it suddenly occurred to him that he was n't having it out with Demetrius  --  but with himself . He swung about , in the middle of an angry sentence , and read  --  in his companion 's comradelygrin  --  a confirmation of his discovery . Falling into step , he walked along in silence for a while . ' Forgive me , Demetrius , ' he said , self-reproachfully . I have been very inconsiderate . ' Demetrius smiled broadly . ' I understand fully , sir , ' he said . I went through all that , hour after hour , day after day . It is not easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , then '  --  deliberated Marcellus  --  ' let us , just for sake of argument , batter our instincts into silence and accept this , for the moment , as the truth . Consider the possibilities of a man with a divine personality who , if he wants to , can walk up to Emperor Tiberius , without fear , and demand his throne ! ' ' He will not want to , ' rejoined Demetrius . If he were that sort of person , he would have demanded Pilate 's seat . No  --  he expects to come into power another way ; not by demoting the Emperor , but by inspiring the people . His rule will not begin at the top . It will begin at the bottom  --  with the common people . ' ' Bah ! ' scoffed Marcellus . The common people , indeed ! What makes you think they have it in them to set up a just government ? Take this weak-spined little handful of pious fishermen , for example : how much courage is to be expected of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his life , they were afraid to speak out in his defense . Except for two or three of them , they let him go to his death alone ! ' ' True , sir , ' said Demetrius , but that was before they knew he could overcome death . '  |p341Yes  , but Jesus ' ability to overcome death would n't make their lives any more secure than they were before . ' ' Oh  --  yes , sir ! ' exclaimed Demetrius . He promised them that they too would live forever . He said that he had overcome death  --  not only for himself  --  but for all who had faith in him : Marcellus slowed to a stop , thrust his thumbs under his belt , and surveyed his slave with a frown of utter mystification . Do you mean to say that these crazy fishermen think they are goingto live forever ? ' he demanded . Yes , sir  --  forever  --  with him , ' said Demetrius , quietly . Ridiculous ! ' snorted Marcellus . It seems so , sir , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is true or not will have no bearing on their behavior . If a man considers himself stronger than death , he has nothing to fear . ' Then why are these people in hiding ? ' asked Marcellus , reasonablyenough , he thought . They have their work to do , sir . They can not be too reckless with their lives . It is their duty to tell the story of Jesus to as many as can be reached . Every man of them expects to be killed , sooner or later , but  --  it wo n't matter . They will live on  --  somewhere else . ' ' Demetrius  --  do you believe all this nonsense yourself ? ' asked Marcellus , pityingly . Sometimes , ' mumbled Demetrius . When I 'm with them , I believe it . ' He tramped on moodily through the dust , his eyes on the road . It is n't easy , ' he added , half to himself . I should say not ! ' commented Marcellus . But , sir , ' declared Demetrius , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disparage it . Are we not surrounded with facts quite beyond our comprehension ? ' He stretched a long arm toward the hillside , gay with flowers . We ca n't account for all that diversity of color and form  --  and we do n't have to . But they are facts . ' Well  --  that 's beside the point , ' protested Marcellus . Stick to your business , now , and do n't let your mind wander . We 'll agree that all life 's a mystery . Proceed with your argument . ' Thank you , sir , ' grinned Demetrius . Now  --  these disciples of Jesus honestly believe that the world will eventually be ruled by faith in his teachings . There is to be a universal government founded on good will among men . Whoever believes and practices this has the assurance that he will live forever . It is n't easy to believe that one may live forever . I grant you that , sir . ' And not much easier to believe that the world could be governed by good will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' went on Demetrius , rules the world by force . That is not easy . Thousands of men have to lose their lives to support this form of government . Germanicus leads an expeditioninto Aquitania , promising his Legates riches in captured goods and slaves if they follow and obey him at the risk of their lives . They take that chance . Many of them are killed and have nothing to show for their courage . Jesus promises everlasting life as a rewardfor those who follow and obey him in his effort to bring peace to the world . His disciples believe him , and  --  ' And take that chance , ' interposed Marcellus . Well , sir ; it is n't a more hazardous chance than the legions take who follow Germanicus , ' insisted Demetrius . This faith in Jesus is not easy , but that does n't make it nonsense  --  if you will pardon my speaking so freely . ' Say on , Demetrius ! ' approved Marcellus . You are doing well , considering what kind of material you have to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on here forever  --  in some spectral form ? ' No . ' Demetrius shook his head . Somewhere else . He has a kingdom  --  somewhere else . ' And you truly believe that ! ' Marcellus studied his slave 's sober face as if he had never seen it before . Sometimes , ' replied Demetrius . Neither had anything to say for a while . Then , coming to an abrupt halt , the Greek faced his master with an expression of selfconfidence . This faith , ' he declared deliberately , is not like a deed to a house in which one may live with full rights of possession . It is more like a kit of tools with which a man may build him a house . The tools will be worth just what he does with them . When he lays them down , they will have no value until he takes them up again . ' It was nearly sundown when Demetrius arrived at the shop of Benyosef , for much time had been consumed in the congested streets on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Jerusalem . The travel equipment and Galilean purchases had to be unloaded and stored . The man who owned the donkeys had to be paid off . Marcellus was eager for a bath and fresh clothing . Having made his master comfortable and having attended to his own reconditioning , Demetrius had set off to find Stephanos . Since his course led directly past Benyosef 's , he decided to look in ; for it was possible that his friend was still at work . The front doorp343was closed and bolted . Going around to the side door which admitted to the family quarters , he knocked ; but there was no response . This seemed odd , for the aged Sarah never went anywhere , and would surely be here at suppertime . Perplexed , Demetrius hastened on to the shabby old house where he had lodged with Stephanos . Here , too , the doors were locked and apparently everyone was gone . A short distance up the street , a personable young Jew , John Mark , lived with his widowed mother and an attractive young cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Stephanos and Mark were close friends , though he had often wondered whether it was n't the girl that Stephanos went to see . He found Rhoda locking the high wicket-gate and preparing to leave with a well-filled basket on her arm . She greeted him warmly , and Demetrius noted that she was prettier than ever . She seemed to have matured considerably in his absence . Where is everybody ? ' he inquired , after a brief account of the closed houses he had visited . Oh  --  do n't you know ? ' Rhoda handed him the basket and they moved toward the gate . We all have supper together now . You must come with me . ' Who have supper together ? ' wondered Demetrius . The Christians . Simon began it many weeks ago . They leased the old building where Nathan had his bazaar . We all bring food every evening , and share it . That is , ' she added , with an impatient little shrug , some of us bring food  --  and all of us share . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' observed Demetrius . Well '  --  Rhoda tossed her curly head  --  It has n't turned out as Simon had expected . ' They were walking rapidly , Demetrius taking long strides to keep pace with the clipped steps that seemed to be beating time for some very vigorous reflections . He decided not to be too inquisitive . How is Stephanos ? ' he asked , with a sly smile that Rhoda tried unsuccessfully to dodge . You will see him presently , ' she replied , archly . Then you may judge for yourself . ' ' Rhoda '  --  Demetrius sounded at least sixty  --  ' those pink cheeks tell me that something has been going on here since I left . If this means what I think , I am happy for both of you . ' You know too much , Uncle Demetrius , ' she retorted , with a prim smile . Ca n't Stephen and I be friends  --  without  --  ' No  --  I do n't think so , ' interjected Demetrius . When is it going to be , Rhoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? '  |p344A  little one . ' She flashed him a bright smile . Promising that he would borrow a loom and begin work early in the morning , if his master could spare him the time , Demetrius found his curiosity mounting in regard to these daily suppers . How many people come ? ' he asked . You will be surprised ! Three hundred or more . Many have disposed of their property in the country and are living here now ; quite a colony of them . At least a hundred take all of their meals at the Ecclesia . ' The Ecclesia , ' repeated Demetrius . Is that what you call it ? That 's Greek , you know . Most of you are Jews ; are you not ? How did you happen to call your headquarters the Ecclesia ? ' Stephen , ' said Rhoda , proudly . He said it was a suitable name for such an assembly . Besides  --  fully a third of the Christians are Greeks . ' ' Well  --  it 's a comfort to see the Jews and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just one big , happy family ; eh ? ' he added , with some private misgivings . It 's big enough : no question about that ! ' murmured Rhoda ; and then , making hasty amends for this comment , she continued , Most of them are deeply in earnest , Demetrius . But there are enough of the other kind to spoil it . ' Quarreling ; are they ? I 'm afraid they wo n't get very far with this new idea that what the world needs is good will . ' That 's what Stephen says , ' approved Rhoda . He is quite disappointed . He thinks this whole business  --  of having all the Christianslive together  --  is a mistake . He believes they should have stayed at home and kept on with their daily work . ' What 's the rumpus about ? ' Demetrius could n't help asking . Oh  --  the same old story , ' sighed Rhoda . You Greeks are stingyand suspicious and oversensitive about your rights , and  --  ' ' And you Jews are greedy and tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not greedy ! ' exclaimed Rhoda . And we Greeks are not stingy ! ' retorted Demetrius . They both laughed . That 's a good little picture of the rumpus , ' said Rhoda . Poor Simon . He had such high hopes for the Ecclesia . I was so sorry for him , last night , I could have cried . After supper he made us a serioustalk , repeating some of the words of Jesus about loving one another , even those who mistreat us ; and how we were all the children of God , equal in his sight , regardless of our race . And  --  if you 'll believe it  --  right while Simon was speaking , an oldp345man from the country , named Ananias , got up and stamped out ! ' Demetrius could think of no appropriate comment . It gave him a sickish feeling to learn that so lofty an ideal had fallen into such disrepute in the hands of weak people . Rhoda sensed his disappointment . But please do n't think that Simon is held lightly , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in him ! When he walks down the street , old men and women sitting at their windows beg him to stop and talk with them . Stephen says they even bring out their sick ones on cots so that he may touch their foreheads as he passes . And  --  Demetrius  --  it 's wonderful how they all feel toward Stephen , too . Sometimes I think that if anything ever happened to Simon  --  ' Rhoda hesitated . Stephen might be the leader ? ' asked Demetrius . He is big enough for it ! ' she declared . But do n't tell him I said that , ' she added . He would think it a great misfortune if anythinghappened to Simon . ' They were nearing the rangy old bazaar now . Several women were entering with baskets . A few men loitered about the open door . No legionaries were to be seen . Apparently the Christians were free to go and come as they pleased . Rhoda led the way into the large , bare , poorly lighted room , crowded with men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which food was being spread . Stephanos advanced with a welcoming smile . Adelphos Demetrius ! ' he exclaimed , extending both hands . Where did you find him , Rhoda ? ' He was looking for you . ' Her tone was tenderly possessive . Come , then , ' he said . Simon will want to see you . You 're thin , my friend . What have they been doing to you ? ' Demetrius flinched involuntarily as Stephanos squeezed his arm . A little accident , ' he explained . It 's not quite healed . ' How did you do it ? ' asked Rhoda . You 've a cut on your wrist too ; a bad one ! ' Demetrius was spared the necessity of replying , Stephanos coming to his rescue with a little pantomime of pursed lips and a slight shake of his head for Rhoda 's benefit . You were fighting , I think , ' she whispered , with a reproving grin . Christians do n't fight , you know . ' Impishly puckering a meaningful little smile at Stephanos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . ' Preoccupied , Stephanos missed this sally , and beckoned to Demetrius to follow him.  | Conversation on the way back was forced and fragmentary . John Mark and his mother walked on ahead . The tall Greeks followed on either side of Rhoda , who felt dwarfed and unimportant , for it was evident , by their taciturnity , that they wanted to be alone with each other . She did not resent this . She was so deeply in love with Stephanos that anything he did was exactly right , even when he so plainly excluded her from his comradeship with Demetrius . After a hasty good night at Mark 's gate , the Greeks sauntered down the street toward their lodgings , silently at first , each waiting for the other to speak . Stephanos ' steps slowed . ' Well  --  what did you think of it ? ' he demanded , bluntly . Tell me truly . ' I 'm not quite sure , ' temporized Demetrius . But you are ! ' snapped Stephanos . You have seen our Christian Ecclesia in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think we have taken the wrong road ! ' Very well , ' consented Demetrius , with an indulgent chuckle . If that 's what I think , why not go on and tell me what you think ? You 've had a better chance to form an opinion . I have n't seen your Ecclesia do anything yet  --  but eat . What else is it good for ? I 'm bound to say , Stephanos , that if I were selecting a company of people to engage in some dangerous tasks requiring endless faith and courage , I might have skipped a few who were present tonight . ' There you are ! ' lamented Stephanos . That 's what ails it . Jesus commands us to carry on his work , no matter at what cost in privation , pain , and hazard of life ; and all we 've accomplished is a free boarding-house and loafing-place for anybody who will say , " I believe . ' Doubtless Simon 's intentions were good , ' observed Demetrius , feeling that he was expected to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the Ecclesia had the bravery and goodness of Simon Peter , the institutionmight develop great power . You see  --  at the beginning , what he wanted was a close-knit body of men who would devote their full time to this work . He thought they could inspire one another if they lived together . You remember how it was at the shop , Demetrius , the disciples spending hours in conference . Simon wanted to increase this circle , draw in other devoted men , and weld them together in spirit and purpose . ' And made the circle a little too large ? ' suggested Demetrius . Stephanos came to a halt , and moodily shook his head . The whole plan was unsound , ' he said , disconsolately . Simonannounced that any Christian might sell his property and bring thep347proceeds to the Ecclesia with the promise that his living would be provided for . ' No matter how much or how little he had ? ' queried Demetrius . Right ! If you owned a farm or a vineyard , you sold it  --  probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you had nothing but a few chickens , a milk-goat , and a donkey , you came with the money you 'd got from that . And all would live together in brotherly love . ' Gloomily Stephanos recited the misadventures of this unhappy experiment . The word had quickly spread that any Christian family could insure its living by joining the Ecclesia . There was no lack of applicants . Simon had rejoiced to see the large number of people who professed to be Christians . At an all-night conference in Benyosef'sshop , Simon had been almost beside himself with happiness . The kingdom was growing ! That night , ' continued Stephanos , it was decided that Simon should remain to oversee our Ecclesia . The others were to see how nearly ready the Christians were to attempt similar projects in Joppa , Caesarea , Antioch , and other good-sized cities . So  --  they scattered ; John , James , Philip , Alphaeus , Matthew  --  ' Stephanos made an encircling gesture that included all the rest of them . Simon is impetuous , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and rides away at a gallop ! ' And the Ecclesia grew ! ' assisted Demetrius . In numbers  --  yes ! Large families , with next to nothing , moved in to live in idleness , lustily singing hymns and fervent in prayer , but hardly knowing what it was all about , except that they had three meals a day and plenty of good company . ' And how did the other people like it , the ones who had owned considerable property ? ' Well  --  that was another problem . These people began to feel their superiority over the indigents . The more money you had contributed to the Ecclesia , the more right you thought you had to dictatethe policies of the institution . ' Stephanos drew an unhappy smile . Only this morning , one arrogant old fellow , who had been impudent and cross over something Simon had said , was discovered to have cheated in his dealings with the Ecclesia , and when Simon confronted him with it , he went into such a mad rage that he had a stroke . Died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . ' It must be very discouraging , ' said Demetrius . That is n't all ! ' sighed Stephanos . This daily supper ! Many merchantsare coming to these meetings now  --  bringing their food along ; I must give them credit for that  --  but quite clearly patroniz- ing the Ecclesia to make friends for business reasons . In short  --  the Ecclesia is becoming too , too popular ! ' What 's to be done about it ? ' Demetrius wanted to know . Stephanos moved on slowly , shaking his head . ' Demetrius  --  until this Ecclesia began to take in boarders , the Christian community in Jerusalem was a reckonable force . Men continued their gainful occupations , careful to deal honestly and charitably , eager to live according to Jesus ' commandments , and talking of his way of life to all who would give heed . And in the evening they would assemble to hearten one another . Simon would stand up and challenge them to greater efforts . He would repeat the words of Jesus , and renew their strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced his friend sadly . You heard him tonight  --  squandering his splendid energies in wheedling a lot of selfish , bickering people to forget their little squabbles and stop nagging one another . Did you notice that weak , solicitous smile on his face as he entreated them to be more generous with their gifts to the Ecclesia ? Well  --  that was n't Simon ! That was n't the Simon who fired the hearts of the men who used to meet in the night to repledge their all to the cause of our Christos ! It is a disgrace ! ' Stephanos clenched both hands in his tousled hair and shook his head hopelessly . Is it for this , ' he cried , that Jesus suffered on the cross  --  and died  --  and rose again ? ' Have you talked with Simon about it ? ' asked Demetrius , after a discreet interval . Not lately . A couple of weeks ago , when it became evident there was going to be an open ruction between the Jews and Greeks , several of us inquired whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven of us to oversee the fair apportioning of food and clothing ; but  --  Demetrius  --  my feeling for Jesus and his worth to the world is a sort of exalted passion that ca n't bring itself down to the low level of listening patiently to ill-mannered quarrels over whether Bennie Issacher was given a better coat than little Nicolas Timonodes . ' Demetrius snorted his sympathetic disgust and suggested that his friend would do well to keep away from such annoyances . I mean to do just that ! ' declared Stephanos . I made a decision tonight . I 'm not going back there , any more ! ' It is possible , ' said Demetrius , that Julian may soon solve the Ecclesia 's difficulties . Had you heard anything about an attack ? My master thinks the Christians are presently to be set upon by the Insula . ' Stephanos laughed bitterly  |p349If  the Procurator waits a little while , the Ecclesia will destroy itself , and save him the bother . But  --  tell me  --  how does your Roman master feel about Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed , Stephanos . He finds it difficult to believe that Jesus came alive , but he considers him the greatest man who ever lived . He wants to talk with you . He was deeply touched when you asked to see the Robe , and were so moved by the sight of it . ' He still has it , I suppose , ' murmured Stephanos . Do you think he would let me see it again , Demetrius ? So much has happened , lacely , to depress me . Do you know  --  my friend  --  that when I touched the Robe , that night , it  --  it did something for me ! I ca n't explain it  --  but  --  ' Let us go to the inn ! ' said Demetrius , impetuously . Now ! He will still be up , and glad to see you . I think you need to have a talk with each other . ' Are you sure he wo n't think it an intrusion ? ' asked Stephanos , anxiously . ' No  --  he will welcome you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision was made , Stephanos set the pace with long , determined strides . Are you going to tell the Tribune about the Ecclesia ? ' he asked . By no means ! ' declared Demetrius . I believe that Marcellus is on the way to becoming a Christian . He is infatuated with the story of Jesus , and talks of nothing else . If he decides to be a Christian , he will be a good one and a brave one ; you can depend on that ! But we must n't expose him to things that might disgust him . If he knew that some of his companions in this cause were mere quarrelsome idlers , he might not want to debase himself . ' Those are hard words , my friend , ' said Stephanos . It gave me no pleasure to say them , ' rejoined Demetrius . But I know the Tribune very well . It is true he has been brought up as a pagan , but he is particular about the company he keeps . ' They found Marcellus alone and reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Stephanos , who was ready with an apology for the untimely call . There is no one I would rather see , Stephanos , ' he said , cordially , offering him a chair . You sit down too , Demetrius . You men have had a pleasant reunion , I think . ' Did you have an interesting journey in Galilee , sir ? ' asked Stephanos , rather shyly . ' Interesting  --  and bewildering , ' replied Marcellus . Justus was a good guide . I heard many strange stories . It is difficult to believe them  --  and difficult not to believe them . ' He paused , his expression inviting a rejoinder ; but Stephanos , at a disadvantage in the presence of this urbane Roman , merely nodded , with averted eyes . I was greatly attracted by old Nathanael Bartholomew , ' went on Marcellus . Yes , ' said Stephanos , after a tongue-tied interval . Demetrius , growing restless , thought he would come to his timid compatriot 's rescue . I think Stephanos would like to see the Robe , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you find it for him , Demetrius ? ' After some moments in the adjoining room , during which time Marcellus and Stephanos sat silent , Demetrius returned and laid the folded Robe acoss his friend 's knees . Stephanos gently smoothed it with his finger-tips . His lips were trembling . Would you like to be alone  --  for a little while ? ' asked MarceIlus , softly . Demetrius and I can take a walk in the garden . ' Stephanos gave no sign that he had heard . Gathering the Robe up into his arms , he glanced at Marcellus and then at Demetrius , with a new light of assurance in his eyes . This was my Master 's Robe ! ' he announced , in confident tones , as if delivering a public address . He wore it when he healed the sick and comforted the sorrowing . He wore it when he spoke to the multitudes as no man has ever spoken . He wore it when he went to the cross to die  --  for me  --  a humble weaver ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  a wealthy Tribune ! ' He turned toward Demetrius . And for you  --  a slave ! ' Marcellus leaned forward on the arms of his chair , baffled by the suddenly altered manner of the Greek who had thrown aside his reticence to declare his faith in such resonant tones . You killed my Lord , Tribune Marcellus ! ' went on Stephanos , boldly . Stephanos ! Please ! ' entreated Demetrius . Marcellus held up a cautioning hand toward his slave . Proceed , Stephanos ! ' he commanded . It was forgivable , ' went on Stephanos , rising to his feet , for you did not know what you were doing . And you are sorry . The Temple and the Insula killed him ! And they did not know what they were doing . But they are not sorry  --  and they would do it again  --  tomorrow ! ' He took a step toward Marcellus , who rose from his chair , and stood , as one receiving an order . You  --  Tribune Marcellus Gallio  --  can make amends for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! I heard him forgive you ! Make friends with him ! He is alive ! I have seen him ! ' 1p351Demetrius was at his elbow now , murmuring half-articulate entreaties . Gently taking the Robe from him , he tugged him back to his chair . They all sat down , and there was a long moment when no one spoke . Forgive me , sir , ' said Stephanos , contritely . He clumsily rubbed the back of a nervous hand across his brow . I have been talking too freely . ' You need not reproach yourself , Stephanos , ' replied Marcellus , huskily . You have not offended me . ' There was a long , constrained silence which no one seemed disposed to break . Stephanos rose . It is late , ' he said . We should go . ' Marcellus held out his hand . I am glad you came , Stephanos , ' he said , soberly . You are welcome to come again . . . . Demetrius  --  I shall see you here in the morning . ' Badly shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . At length , he was overcome by the day 's fatigue . Stretchingout on his bed , he fell asleep . Shortly before dawn he was roused by hoarse cries and shrill screams accompanied by savage commands and thudding blows . It was not unusual , at an inn , to be annoyed at almost any hour of the day by loud lamentations signifyingthat some hapless kitchen-slave was being flogged ; but this pandemonium , which seemed to emanate from the courtyard below , sounded as if the whole establishment was in trouble . Marcellus pushed his long legs over the edge of his bed , walked to the window , and looked down . Instantly he knew what was happening . Julian 's threatened day of wrath had arrived . A dozen legionaries , in full battle equipment , were clubbing the household slaves into a corner of the courtyard . Evidently other troops were inside , chasing their quarry out . The entire lower floor was in confusion . There were blows and protestations , scuffling of feet , splinteringof door-panels . Presently there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown open . Who are you ? ' bawled a brutish voice . I am a Roman citizen , ' replied Marcellus , coolly . And you would do well , fellow , to show better manners when you enter the room of a Tribune . ' We have no manners today , sir , ' retorted the legionary , with a brief grin . We are searching for Christians . ' Indeed ! ' growled Marcellus . And does Legate Julian think these poor , harmless people are important enough to warrant all this racket at daybreak ? ' The Legate does not tell me what he thinks , sir , ' scored the legionary , and it is not customary for ordinary troops to ask him . I am obeying orders , sir . We are rounding up all the Christians in the city . You are not a Christian , and I am sorry I have disturbed you . ' He was retreating into the hall . Stay ! ' shouted Marcellus . How do you know I am not a Christian ? Ca n't a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged , tugged off his heavy metal helmet , and wiped his dripping forehead with a swipe of his rough sleeve . I 've no time for jesting , sir , if the Tribune will excuse me . ' He resumed his helmet , saluted with his spear , and stamped down the hall . The cries outside were subsiding now . Apparently the evacuation had been completed . A terrified group of slaves had huddled against the area wall , nursing their bruises . Apart from them a little way stood a few shabbily clad , frightened guests . The aging wife of Levi , the innkeeper , hovered close to them . She was pale , and her head kept jerking up involuntarily with some nervous quirk . Marcellus wondered whether she did that all the time or only when she was badly scared . The tall , handsome Centurion marched forward , faced the victims , shouted for silence , drew out an impressive scroll to its full length , and in a dry crackle read an edict . It was pompously phrased . There was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was to be no further mention , in public or private , of the name of Jesus the Galilean , who had been found guilty of treason , blasphemy , and offenses against the peace of Jerusalem . This edict was to be considered the first and last official warning . Disobedience would be punishable by death . - Rolling up the scroll , the Centurion barked an order , the detachmentstiffened , he stalked toward the street , they fell in behind him . After a moment , one old retainer , with blood oozing through the sparse white hair on his temple and trickling down over his bare shoulder , quietly crumpled into a shapeless heap . A slave-girl of twenty stooped over him and cried aloud . A bearded Greek bent down and listened with his ear against the old man 's chest . He raised up and shook his head . Four of them picked up the limp body and moved off slowly toward the servants ' quarters , most of the others trudging dejectedly after them . The innkeeper 's wife turned slowly about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broom . A limping slave with a crooked back took up the broom and began ineffectively sweeping the tiled pavement . Except for him , the courtyard was empty now . Marcellus turned away from the window , scowling . Brave old Julian ! ' he muttered . Brave old Roman Empire ! ' He finished his dressing and went below . Levi met him at the foot of the stairs with much bowing and fumbling of hands . He hoped the Tribune had not been disturbed by all the commotion . And would he have his breakfast served at once ? Marcellus nodded . We will have less trouble with these Christians now , ' declared Levi , to assure his Roman guest that his sympathies were with the Insula . Had they been causing you trouble ? ' asked Marcellus , negligently . Levi hunched his shoulders , spread out his upturned fingers , and smirked . It is enough that their sect is in disfavor with the Government , ' he parried , discreetly . That was n't what I asked you , ' growled Marcellus . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , given you any cause for complaint ? Do they steal , lie , fight ? Do they get drunk ? Are they brawlers ? Tell me  --  what sort of people are they ? ' In truth , sir , ' admitted Levi , I can not complain of them . They are quiet , honest , and faithful . But , sir , as the Insula has decreed , we can not tolerate blasphemy ! ' Blasphemy ? Rubbish ! ' snarled Marcellus . What does the Insula know or care about blasphemy ? What is it that these people blaspheme , Levi ? ' They have no respect for the Temple , sir . ' How could they , when the Temple has no respect for itself ? ' Levi shrugged a polite disapproval , though he still smiled weakly . The religion of our people must be protected , sir , ' he murmured , piously . Marcellus made a little grimace and sauntered out into the sunny arcade where he found , laying his breakfast table , the slavegirlwho had been so deeply grieved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were red with weeping , but she was going about her duties competently . She did not look up when Marcellus took his seat . Was that old man related to you ? ' he asked , kindly . She did not reply . Sudden tears overflowed her eyes and ran down her cheeks . In a moment she moved away , obviously top354return to the kitchen for his breakfast . Levi strolled toward his table . How was this girl related to the old man they killed ? ' asked Marcellus . He was her father , ' said Levi , reluctantly . And you are making her serve the table ? ' Levi 's shoulders , elbows , eyebrows , and palms came up in a defensivegesture . Well  --  it is her regular task , sir . It is not my fault that her father was killed . ' Marcellus rose , and regarded his host with cool contempt . And you prate about your religion ! What a mean fellow you are , Levi ! ' He strode toward the door . But , please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! I am sorry to have given offense ! ' He toddled off toward the kitchen . Marcellus , angrily returning to his table , wondered if the loathsomecreature would slap the girl for unwittingly creating an awkward incident . Demetrius had risen at daybreak so that he might have time to do an errand at the Ecclesia before going on to attend his master at the inn . He had tried to dress without waking his friend who , he knew , had spent a restless night ; but Stephanos roused and sat up , rubbing his eyes . I ' 11 see you this evening , ' whispered Demetrius , as if his companionwere still asleep and should n't be wakened . Shall I meet you here ? ' At the Ecclesia , ' mumbled Stephanos . Thought you were n't going there any more ? I ca n't let good old Simon down , Demetrius . He is alone , now that the other disciples are away on missions . ' Tiptoeing out of the house , Demetrius walked rapidly toward the Ecclesia , where he hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed almost disloyal not to counsel with Stephanos about this , but Marcellus had insisted upon secrecy . He wanted an interview with Simon . Demetrius was to arrange for it , if he could . There had been no opportunity to ask Simon , last night . Perhaps he would have a better chance to see him alone this morning before the day 's activities began . The Ecclesia was already astir . Cots were being folded up and put away to make room for tables . Tousled , half-dressed children of all sizes were racing about , babies were crying , old men werep355crouching in out-of-the-way corners , scowling meditatively as they stroked their patriarchal beards . The women were bustling back and forth between the kitchen at the rear and the breakfast-tables which their men were setting up . Demetrius approached the nearestgroup and inquired for Simon . One of them glanced about , and pointed . Simon was standing by a window , quite apart from the others , brooding over a tattered scroll . Even in this relaxed posturethere was something majestic about this huge Galilean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituency , thought Demetrius , Simon would have great weight . The man was of immense vitality and arresting personality , a natural leader . Not much wonder the people wanted him to lay his hands upon their sick . Approaching , Demetrius waited to be recognized . Simon glanced up , nodded soberly , and beckoned to him . Sir , my master  --  Marcellus Gallio  --  earnestly desires a conversation with you , at your convenience , ' said Demetrius . He that went into Galilee with Justus ? ' queried Simon . To look for homespun  --  or so he said . ' My master did acquire a large quantity of homespun , sir , ' said Demetrius . And what else ? ' asked Simon , in his deep voice . He became much interested in the life of Jesus , sir . ' ' I think he had that before he went , ' rumbled Simon , studying Demetrius ' eyes . I think that was why he went . ' Yes , sir , ' conceded Demetrius . That was his real object in going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . At present he is at Levi 's inn . May I tell him you will talk with him  --  in private ? ' I will talk with him  --  on the morrow  --  at mid-afternoon , ' said Simon . And as he desires privacy , let him come to me in the refusefield , north of the city , the place they call Golgotha . There is a path through the field which leads to a knoll in the center of it . ' I know where it is , sir . ' Then show him the way . Bid him come alone . ' Simon rolled up the scroll ; and , inattentive to Demetrius ' murmured thanks , walked toward the tables . There was a whispered demand for silence , and the confusion ceased , except for the crying of a baby . Those who were seated rose . In a powerful , resonant voice , Simon began to read . The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light . They that dwell in the shadow of death , upon them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unto us a son is given . The governmentshall be upon his shoulder . There was a clamor at the entrance , and all eyes turned apprehensively . Crisp commands were being shouted . The frightened peopledid not have long to wait in anxiety . The doors burst open , and a whole company of legionaries marched in , deploying fanwise as they advanced . With their spears held horizontally , breast-high , they moved rapidly forward , pushing the terrified Christians before them . Some of the older ones fell down in their excitement . They were ruthlessly prodded to their feet and shoved on in the wake of the scurrying pack that was massing against the rear wall . Demetrius , who had remained near the window quite apart from the residents , found himself in the position of a spectator . The troops swept on relentlessly . Simon , a towering figure , stood his ground . He was alone , now , all the others having huddled at the wall . The Centurion shouted an order , and the company halted . He strode arrogantly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of the same height , both magnificent specimens of manhood . Are you , then , the one they call The Fisherman ? ' demanded the Centurion . I am ! ' answered Simon , boldly . And why are you here to break up a peaceful assembly ? Has any one of us committed a crime ? If so  --  let him be taken for trial . ' As you wish , ' snapped the Centurion . If you want to be tried for blasphemy and treasonable utterances , the Procurator will accommodateyou . . . . Take him away ! ' Simon turned about and faced his desperate people . Be of good cheer ! ' he shouted . Make no resistance ! I shall come back to you ! ' That you will not ! ' broke in the Centurion . In obedience to a sharp command and a sweep of his sword , two burly legionaries leaped forward , caught Simon by the arms , whirled him about , and started for the door . The company pressed forward toward the defenseless crowd . The Centurion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the mouths of their screaming children . An edict was read . By order of the Procurator , there was to be no further assembling of the blasphemers who called themselves Christians . Demetrius began slowly edging his way along the wall in the direction of the front door . He caught fragments of the Centurion 's announcement . This building was to be vacated immediately . Any/one found on the premises hereafter would be taken into custody . The name of Jesus , the blasphemer and traitor , was never again to be spoken . Away with you now ! ' yelled the Centurion . Back to your homes ! And do not inquire for your Fisherman ! You will not see him any more ! ' As he neared the door , realizing that the speech had ended and the troops would be promptly moving out , Demetrius speeded his going , ran to the street and crossed it , dodged into a narrow alley , pursued it to the next street , slowed to a brisk walk , and proceeded to Levi 's inn . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to Marcellus ' quarters . Levi , observant , called him back . Your master is out , ' he said . Do you know where he went , sir ? ' inquired Demetrius , anxiously . How should I ? ' retorted Levi . Thinking that Marcellus might have left instructions in his room , Demetrius asked and was granted permission to go upstairs . A Greek slave-girl was putting the room to rights . She recognized him and smiled shyly . Informed of his errand , she joined in the search for a message . Did you see my master this morning ? ' asked Demetrius . She shook her head . ' We had much trouble here , a little while ago , ' she said . Demetrius pressed her for particulars , and she told him what had occurred . He went to the window and stood for a long moment , looking out , trying to imagine what might be Marcellus ' reaction to this cruel business . He would be very angry , no doubt . He would want to do something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Julian and remonstrate . The more Demetriusdeliberated on this possibility , the more reasonable it seemed . It would be an audacious thing to do , but Marcellus was impetuous enough to attempt it . After all  --  the word of a Tribune should have some weight . He turned about and met the Greek girl 's eyes . They were friendly but serious . Glancing cautiously toward the open door , she moved closer to him and whispered , Are you one of us ? ' Demetrius nodded soberly , and she gave him an approving smile .. With a sudden burst of interest in her duties , she began folding and patting the blankets on the bed , as if suspicious that she might be found idling . Better stay off the streets today , ' she said , softly , out of the corner of a pretty mouth . ' Go down to the kitchen . You 'll be safe there . ' Thanks , ' said Demetrius . That 's not a bad idea . Besides  --  I 'm hungry . ' He was crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve as he passed her . Does your master know you are one of us ? ' she whispered . Demetrius was not sure how this question should be answered , so he gave her an enigmatic smile which she was free to interpret as she chose , and left the room . The ever-present Levi met him at the foot of the stairs and unexpectedly informed him that it was a fine morning . Beautiful ! ' agreed Demetrius , aware that the Jew was sparring for news . Had your master left instructions for you ? ' asked Levi , amiably . I am to have my breakfast , sir , and await his return . ' Very good , ' said Levi . Go to the kitchen . They will serve you . ' He tagged along as far as the door . I suppose everything was quiet on the streets this morning . ' It was still quite early , sir , when I left my lodgings , ' replied Demetrius , unhelpfully . After his breakfast of bread , milk , and sun-cured figs , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants ' quarters . Nobody seemed inclined to talk . The girl who had served him was crying . He resolved to stroll over to the Insula and wait outside . Something told him that Marcellus was there . Where else could he be ? Having finished his breakfast , which Levi himself had served with a disgusting show of servility , Marcellus began to be apprehensive about the safety of Demetrius , who , he felt , should have arrived by this time unless he had encountered some trouble . He did not know where Stephanos lived , but they could tell him at Benyosef 's shop . Then it occurred to him that Benyosef 's might have been visited by the legionaries . Doubtless they knew it was a meeting-place of the disciples of Jesus , and might be expected to deal severely with anyone found there . Prudence suggested that he keep out of that storm-center . If Demetrius had been arrested , it would be sensible to wait until order had been restored . Then he could learn where his slave was , and make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a decision . Marcellus wasstalking up and down in the courtyard , feverishly debating whatto do , when the Jew appeared in the doorway , obviously much interested in his guest 's perturbation . Levi did not say anything ; justp359stood there slowly blinking his brightly inquisitive eyes . Then he retreated into the little foyer and emerged a moment later carrying a chair , as to say that if the Tribune knew what was good for him today , he would stay where he was and avoid getting into trouble . Marcellus scowled , lengthened his stride ; and , without a backward glance , marched down the steps to the street . To reach Benyosef 's shop , it was necessary to traverse a few blocks on the rim of the congested market district where the shabby hovels of the very poor huddled close to the reeking alleys . Here there was much excitement , frantic chatter , and gesticulations . Marcellusslowed his steps near one vociferous group of slatternly people and learned that the Christians ' meeting-place had been invaded , emptied , and locked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fisherman was to be beheaded . Marcellus quickened his pace . A little way down the street , in the vicinity of Benyosef 's shop , a crowd had gathered . At the edge of it , apparently waiting for orders , ranged a company of legionaries , negligently leaning on their spears . Someone in the middle of the crowd was making an impassioned speech . In a moment Marcellus had drawn close enough to recognize the voice . It was Stephanos . Bareheaded , and in the brown tunic he wore at his loom , he had evidently been dragged out for questioning ; and from the sullen silence of the throng , it was to be inferred that these people were willing to wait patiently until the reckless Greek had incriminated himself . Taller than most , Marcellus surveyed the spectators with curiosity to discover what manner of men they were . Instantly he divined the nature of this audience . They were well dressed , for the most part , representing the more substantial element from the business district . There was a sprinkling of younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surly , but everybody was listening in a tense silence . Stephanos was not mincing his words . He stood there boldly , in the open circle they had formed about him , his long arms stretched out in an appeal to reason  --  but by no means an appeal for mercy . He was not defiant , but he was unafraid . It was no rabble-rousing speech addressed to the emotions of ignorant men , but a scathing indictment of Jerusalem 's leaders who , Stephanos declared , had been unwilling to recognize a cure for the city 's distresses . You have considered yourselves the Chosen People ! ' he went on , audaciously . Your ancestors struggled out of one bondage into another , century after century , ever looking for a Deliverer , and never heeding your great teachers when they appeared with words of wisdom ! Again and again , inspired leaders have risen among your people , only to be thwarted and reviled  --  not by the poor and needy  --  but by such as you ! ' A concerted growl rumbled through the angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did your fathers not persecute ? And now you have become the betrayers  --  and murderers  --  ofthe just One ! ' ' Blasphemer ! ' shouted an imperious voice . You ! ' exclaimed Stephanos , sweeping the throng with an accusinghand  --  ' you  --  who claim to have received your law at the hands of angels  --  how have you kept it ? ' There was an infuriated roar , but no one moved to attack him . Marcellus wondered how much longer the suppressed fury of these maddened men would tolerate this rash excoriation . From far back on the fringe of the crowd , someone hurled a cobblestone . It was accurately thrown and struck Stephanos on the cheekbone , staggering him . Instinctively he reached up a hand to wipe away the blood . Another stone , savagely hurled by a practiced hand , crashed against his elbow . A loud clamor rose . For an instant , Marcellus hoped it might be a protest against this lawless violence , but it was quickly evident that the hoarse shouts were in denunciation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave sinister applause to the good aim of another stone as it struck the Greek full in the face . Two more , not so well thrown , went over Stephanos ' head and drove into the crowd . Trampling upon one another , the dignitaries on the other side of the open circle scurried for cover against the walls and fences . Stephanos , shielding his bleeding head with his arms , backed away slowly from the hostilethrong , but the stones kept coming . The Centurion barked an order now and the legionaries sprang into action , plowing roughly through the pack , tossing men right and left , with utter disregard of their importance . Marcellus , who had been standing beside a tall soldier , followed him through , and was surprised to see him jab his elbow into the face of a stocky priest whose ponderous dignity had n't permitted him to move swiftly enough . Now the legionaries were lined up inside the semicircle of spectators . They had made a fence of their spears . The stones were coming faster now , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no impulsive , impromptu incident . The better citizens were not throwing stones , but without doubt they had planned that the stones should be thrown . The men who were doing it were expert . Stephanos was down now , on his elbows and knees , trying to pro/tect his head with one bleeding hand . The other arm hung limp . The crowd roared . Marcellus recognized that bestial cry . He had heard it many a time in the Circus Maximus . He pushed his way on to the side of the tall legionary who , after a glance in his direction , made room for him . Several of the younger men in the shouting multitude now decided to take a hand in the punishment . The Centurion pretended not to notice when they dodged under the barricade of spears . Their faces were deeply flushed and contorted with rage . There was nothing more they could do to Stephanos , who had crumpled on the ground , but perhaps the stones they threw were to be merely tokens of their willingness to share the responsibility for this crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do . Had Julian been there , he might have protested , but to have denouncedthe Centurion would have done no good . The fellow was obeying his orders . Poor Stephanos lay dead , or at least unconscious , but the dignitaries continued to stone him . Immediately in front of Marcellus  --  on the other side of the barrier  --  stood a young , bookish man , wearing a distinctive skullcapwith a tassel , evidently a student . He was of diminutive stature , but sturdily built . His hands were clenched and his rugged face was twisted with anger . Every thudding stone that beat upon the limp body had his approval . Marcellus studied his livid face , amazed that a man of his seeming intelligence could be so viciously pleased by such an exhibition of inhuman brutality . Presently a fat man , in an expensive black robe , ducked through the line , took off his robe , and tossed it to the short one , bidding him hold it . Another man of lofty dignity followed his friend in ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawingup a stone from the pavement . Marcellus , towering over the short-legged fellow , leaned forward and demanded , sternly , What harm had he done to you ? ' The little man turned about and glanced up impudently into Marcellus ' eyes . He was a malicious creature , but no fool . It was a face to be remembered . He is a blasphemer ! ' he shouted . How does the crime of blasphemy compare with murder ? ' growled Marcellus . You seem to be a learned man . Perhaps you know . ' If you will come to the Rabbinical School tomorrow , my friend , ' replied the little man , suddenly cooled by the prospect of airing his theology , I shall enlighten you . Ask for Saul  --  of Tarsus ; he added , proudly . I am a Roman citizen  --  like yourself , sir . '  | There were no stones flying now . The crowd was growing restless . The young theologian had handed back the robes he had held and was shouldering out through the loosening throng . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weight uneasily as if impatient to be off . The Centurion was soberly talking , out of the corner of his mouth , to a long-bearded Jew in an impressive black robe . The multitude was rapidly disintegrating . Marcellus , with brooding eyes fixed on the broken body of the gallant Greek , thought he saw a feeble movement there . Stephanos was slowly rising up on one elbow . A hush fell over the people as they watched him rise to his knees . The blood-smeared face looked up , and the bruised lips were parted in a rapturous smile . Suddenly Stephanos raised his arm aloft as if to clutch a friendly hand . I see him ! ' he shouted , triumphantly . I see him ! My Lord Jesus  --  take me ! ' The eyes closed , the head dropped , and Stephanos crumpled down among the stones . The spectators , momentarily stunned , turned to go . Men did not pause to ask questions . They scurried away as if frightened . Marcellus ' heart was pounding and his mouth was dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were swimming , but his face trembled with an involuntary smile . He turned about and looked into the bewildered eyes of the tall legionary . That was a strange thing , sir ! ' muttered the soldier . More strange than you think ! ' exclaimed Marcellus . I would have sworn the Greek was dead ! He thought he saw someone coming to rescue him ! ' He did see someone coming to rescue him ! ' shouted Marcellus , ecstatically . That dead Galilean , maybe ? ' queried the legionary , nervously . That Galilean is not dead , my friend ! ' declared Marcellus . He is more alive than any man here ! ' Thoroughly shaken , his lips twitching with emotion , Marcellus moved away with the scattering crowd . His mind was in a tumult . At the first corner , he turned abruptly and retraced his steps . Nobodywas interested in Stephanos now . The troops from the Insula , four abreast , were disappearing down the street . None of the friends of the intrepid Greek had yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soon to expect that any of them would take the risk . Dropping to one knee beside the battered corpse , Marcellus gently drew aside the matted hair and gazed into the impassive face . The lips were still parted in a smile . After a long time , old Benyosef hobbled out of the shop . Hisp363eyes were red and swollen with weeping . He approached diffidently , halting a few steps away . Marcellus looked up and beckoned to him and he came , pale with fright . Stooping over , with his wrinkled hands bracing his feeble knees , he peered into the quiet face . Then he searched Marcellus ' eyes inquisitively , but without recognition . It was a cruel death , sir , ' he whimpered . Stephanos is not dead ! ' declared Marcellus . ' He went away with Jesus ! ' I beg of you  --  do not mock our faith , sir ! ' pleaded Benyosef . This has been a sad day for us who believe in Jesus ! ' But did he not promise you that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benyosef slowly nodded his head , staring into Marcellus ' eyes incredulously . ' Yes  --  but you do not believe that , sir ! ' he mumbled . Marcellus rose and laid his hand on the old man 's thin arm . Jesus may never come for me , Benyosef , ' he said , quietly , and he may never come for you  --  but he came for Stephanos ! Go , now , and find a younger man to help me . We will carry the body into your shop . ' Still pale with fright , the neighbors gathered about the mangled form of Stephanos as it lay on the long table in Benyosef 's workroom . They were all crying . Rhoda 's grief was inconsolable . Some of the men regarded Marcellus with suspicion that he might be there to spy upon them . It was no time to explain that he felt himselfone of them . Presently he was aware of Demetrius at his elbow , and importuned him to stay and be of service . Taking Benyosef by the arm , he led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom . There is nothing I can do here , ' he said , laying some gold coins in the weaver 's hand . But I have a request of you . When Justus comes again to Jerusalem , tell him I saw Stephanos welcomed into Jesus ' kingdom , and am persuaded that everything he told me  --  in Galilee  --  is the truth . ' It had been a long day for Simon , sitting there heavily manacled in the darkness . At noon they had brought him some mouldy bread and a pitcher of water , but he had not eaten ; he was too heartsick for that . For the first hour after his incarceration , derisive voices from adjoiningcells had demanded to know his name , his crime , and when he was to die . With noisy bravado , they jested obscenely about their impending executions , and taunted him for being too scared to speak . He had not answered them , and at length they had wearied of reviling him . The wooden bench on which he sat served also as a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Simon could not rest his back against the wall . This unsupported posture was fatiguing . Sometimeshe stretched his huge frame out on the bench , but with little ease . The wall was damp , as was the floor . Huge rats nibbled at his sandals . The heavy handcuffs cut his wrists . He thought that he could have borne these discomforts and the threat of a death sentence with a better fortitude had he been able to leave behind him a determined organization to carry on the work that had been entrusted to him . Obviously he had blundered . Perhapsit had been a mistake to establish the Ecclesia . Maybe the time had not come for such a movement . He had been too impatient . He should have let it grow , quietly , unobtrusively , like yeast in meal , as Jesus had said . What , he wondered , would become of the Christian cause now , with all of them scattered and in hiding ? Who would rise up as their leader ? Philip ? No  --  Philip was a brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leader would have to be audacious . John ? No . James ? No . They had the heart for it , but not the voice . There was Stephen . Stephen might do it  --  but not in Jerusalem . The Jews would insist on an Israelite , as perhaps they should ; for the Christian heritage was of the Hebrew people . Why had the Master permitted this dreadful catastrophe ? Had he changed his plans for the prosecution of his work ? Had he lost confidence in the leader he had appointed ? Simon 's memory reconstructedthe eventful day when Jesus had said to him , Simon  --  I shall call you Peter ; Peter the Rock ! I shall build on this Rock ! ' Simon closed his eyes and shook his head as he compared the exultationof that moment with the utter hopelessness of his present plight . When night fell , a guard with a flickering torch noisily unlocked each cell in turn and another replenished the water-pitcher . Noting that his bread had not been eaten , the guard did not give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it was not unusual for men , awaiting death , to take but little interest in food . At feeding time there had been much rattling of chains and scuffling of feet , but everything was quiet now . Simon grew drowsy , slumped back uncomfortably with his head and shoulders against the old wall , and slept . After a while , he found himself experiencinga peculiar dream ; peculiar in that it did n't seem like a dream ,  |p365though  he knew it was , for it could n't be real . In his dream , he roused , amazed to find that the manacles had slipped from his hands and were lying open on the bench . He lifted his foot . The weight was gone . He drew himself up and listened . Everything was quiet but the rhythmic breathing of his fellow prisoners . He had never had a dream of such keen vividness . Simon stood up and stretched his long arms . He took three or four short steps toward the cell-door , slipping his sandals along the stone floor as he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scuffling of his sandals on the flagging . Except for this , the dream was incredibly real . He put out his hand and touched the heavy , nail-studded door . It noiselessly retreated . He advanced his hand to touch the door again . It moved forward . He took another step  --  and another . There had never been such a dream ! Simon was awake and could feel his heart pounding , and the rapid pulsebeatin his neck ; but he knew he was still asleep on the bench . He put his hand against the damp wall and moved on with cautious steps that made no sound . At the end of the long corridor , a feeble light showed through the iron bars of a door . As he neared it the door swung open so slowly and noiselessly that Simon knew the thing was unreal ! He walked through with firmer steps . In the dim light he saw two guards sitting on the floor , with their arms around their knees and their heads bent forward in sleep . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing the ponderous lock that united them . He expected his dream to swing them open , but they had not moved . He put his hand on the cold metal , and pushed , but the heavy gates remained firm . By this he knew that the dream was over , and he would rouse to find himself manacled in his cell . He was chilly . He wrapped his robe more tightly about him , surprised that he still had the unimpededuse of his hands . He glanced about , completely bewildered over his strange mental condition . Suddenly his eye lighted on a narrow gate , set within one of the greater gates . It was open . Simon stepped through , and it closed behind him without a sound . He was on the street . He started to walk briskly . At a crossing , he stumbled against a curbing in the darkness . Surely this rough jar would waken him . Simon stood still , looked up at the stars , and laughed softly for joy . He was awake ! He had been delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? With lengthened steps , he made his way to Benyosef 's , where all was dark . He moved on to the home of John Mark . A frail light showed from an upstairs window . He tapped at the high wicket gate . After a little delay , the small port in the gate was opened and he saw the frightened face of Rhoda . She screamed and fled to the open house-door . It is Simon ! ' he heard her shout . Simon has returned from the dead ! ' Rushing back to the gate , she unbolted it and drew it open . Her eyes were swollen with weeping , but her face was enraptured . She threw her arms around Simon , hugging him fiercely . Simon ! ' she cried . Jesus has brought you back from death ! Did you see Stephen ? Is he coming too ? ' Is Stephen dead , Rhoda ? ' asked Simon , sadly . Her grip relaxed , and she slumped down into a dejected little figure of hopeless grief . Simon raised her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We heard they had killed you , ' said Mark . No , ' said Simon . I was delivered from prison . ' They moved slowly into the house , Rhoda weeping inconsolably . The place was crowded with Christians . Their grieving eyes widenedand their drawn faces paled as Simon entered , for they had thought him dead . They made way for him in silence . He paused in the midst of them . Some great experience had come to Simon . He had taken on a new dignity , a new power . Slowly he raised his hand and they bowed their heads . Let us pray , ' said Peter the Rock . Blessed be God who has revived our hope . Though in great heaviness for a season , let us rejoice that this trial of our faith  --  more precious than gold  --  will make us worthy of honor when our Lord returns . ' After walking up and down on the other side of the street facing the Insula for an hour or more , Demetrius ' anxiety overwhelmed his patience . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian himself on behalf of the persecuted Christians . Abandoning his vigil , he made off rapidly for Benyosef 's shop . While still a long way off , he began meeting well-dressed , sullenfacedmen , apparently returning from some annoying experience . When he saw the sunshine glinting on the shields of an approaching military force , Demetrius dodged into an alley , and continued the journey by a circuitous route . In spite of the edict prohibiting any further assembly of Christians , fully a score were crowded into the shop , silently gathered aboutp367a dead body . To his amazement , Demetrius saw his master in the midst of the people , almost as if he were in charge . He shouldered his way through the sorrowing group . Rhoda was down on her knees before the body , sobbing piteously . It seemed very unreal to find Stephanos , with whom he had talked only a few hours ago , lying here broken and dead . Marcellus had taken him aside , when he had regained his composure . You remain with them , Demetrius , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My presence here is an embarrassment . They cannotaccount for my interest , and are suspicious . I am going back to the inn . ' Did you see this happen , sir ? ' Demetrius had asked . Yes : Marcellus drew closer and said confidentially , And much more happened than appears here ! I shall tell you  --  later . ' After they had put poor Stephanos away  --  and no one had molestedthem while on their errand  --  Demetrius had returned home with John Mark , thinking he would be free presently to rejoin Marcellusat the inn . But Mark 's mother , Mary , and Rhoda too , had insisted so urgently on his remaining with them that he dared not refuse . When their unwanted supper had been disposed of and darkness had fallen , friends of the family began to arrive singly and by twos and threes until the lower rooms were filled . No one acted as a spokesman for the pensive party . There was much low-voiced conversation about a vision that appeared to Stephen before he died , but none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Demetrius had not attached much significance to the rumors . The only one who felt confident was Rhoda . And then , to the utter amazement of everyone , Simon had arrived ; a more important , more impressive figure than he had been before . He seemed reluctant to tell the details of his release from prison ; but , by whatever process that had come to pass , the experiencehad built Simon up . He even seemed taller . They all felt it , and were shy about initiating conversation with him ; hesitant about asking questions . Oddly enough , he had quietly announced that henceforth they should call him Peter . Beckoning John Mark apart , Demetrius had suggested that they ask Simon Peter to lodge there . As for himself , he would cheerfullysurrender his room and return to the inn . So  --  it had been arranged that way and Demetrius had slipped out unobtrusively . It was nearing midnight when he tapped at Marcellus ' door , finding him awake and reading . They had talked in whispers until daybreak , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's bewildering experiences.  | I too am a Christian ! ' Marcellus had declared , when he had finished his account of the stoning of Stephanos , and it seemed to Demetrius that the assertion had been made with more pride than he had ever put into I am a Roman ! ' It was very strange , indeed , this complete capitulation of Marcellus Gallio to a way of belief and behavior so foreign from his training and temperament . Early in the afternoon , Demetrius accompanied him to the edge of the disreputable field that was called Golgotha . They were quiet as they approached it . Acrid smoke curled lazily from winnows of charred refuse . In the distance a grass-covered knoll appeared as a green oasis in a desert . Do you remember the place , sir ? ' asked Demetrius , halting . Vaguely , ' murmured Marcellus . I 'm sure I could n't have found it . Is it clear in your memory , Demetrius ? ' Quite so . I came late . I could see the crosses from here , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' asked Marcellus . You and the other officers were casting dice . ' For the Robe ? ' Yes , sir . ' Neither spoke for a little while . I did not see the nailing , Demetrius , ' said Marcellus , thickly . Paulus pushed me away . I was glad enough to escape the sight . I walked to the other side of the knoll . It has been a bitter memory , I can tell you . ' Well , sir , ' said Demetrius , here is the path . I shall wait for you at the inn . I hope you will not be disappointed , but it seems unlikely that Simon Peter would try to keep his appointment . ' He will come , I think , ' predicted Marcellus . Simon Peter is safer from arrest today than he was yesterday . Both the Insula and the Temple have tried to convince the public that the Christians have no legal or moral sanction for their beliefs . Having captured their leader , with the expectation of making a tragic example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their victim has walked out of prison . Neither Julian nor Herod will want to undertake an explanation of that event . I think they will decide that the less said or done now , in the case of The Big Fisherman , the better it will be for everybody concerned . I fully expect Simon Peter will meet me here  --  unless , in all the confusion , he has forgotten about it . ' Peter had not forgotten . Marcellus saw him coming , a long way off , marching militantly with head up and a swinging stride thatp369betokened a confident mind . The man had leadership , reflected the admiring watcher . As The Big Fisherman neared the grassy knoll , however , his steps slowed and his shoulders slumped . He stopped and passed an unsteadyhand over his massive forehead . Marcellus rose and advanced to meet him as he mounted the slight elevation with plodding feet . Peter extended his huge hand , but did not speak . They sat down on the grass near the deep pits where the crosses had stood , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter roused from his painful meditation and glanced at Marcellus with heavy eyes , which drifted back to the ground . I was not here that day , ' rumbled the deep , throaty voice . I did not stand by him in the hour of his anguish . ' Peter drew a deep sigh . Marcellus did not know what to say , or whether he was expected to say anything . The big Galilean sat ruefully studying the palms of his hands with a dejection so profound that any attempt to relieveit would have been an impertinence . Now he regarded Marcelluswith critical interest , as if noting him for the first time . Your Greek slave told me you were interested in the story of Jesus , ' he said , soberly . And it has come to me that you were of friendly service , yesterday , when our brave Stephen was taken away . Benyosef thought he heard you profess the faith of a Christian . Is that true , Marcellus Gallio ? ' I am convinced , sir , ' said Marcellus , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of great power . But I have much to learn about him . ' You have already gone far with your faith , my friend ! ' said Peter , warmly . As a Roman , your manner of living has been quite remote from the way of life that Jesus taught . Doubtless you have done much evil , for which you should repent if you would know the fullness of his grace . But I could not ask you to repent until I had told you of the wrongs which I have done . Whatever sins you may have committed , they can not compare to the disloyalty for which I have been forgiven . He was my dearest friend  --  and , on the day that he needed me , I swore that I had never known him . ' Peter put his huge hands over his eyes and bowed his head . After a long moment he looked up . ' Now '  --  he said  --  tell me how much you know about Jesus . ' Marcellus did not immediately reply , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard himself saying , as if someone else were speaking : I crucified him . '  | The sun was low when they rose to return to the city . In those two hours , Marcellus had heard the stirring details of a story that had come to him previously in fragments and on occasions when his mind was unprepared to appreciate them . They had found a strange kinship in their remorse , but Peter  --  fired by his inspiring recollections of the Master-man  --  had declaredit was the future that must concern them now . He had daring plans for his own activities . He was going to Caesarea  --  to Joppa  --  perhaps to Rome ! And what will you do , Marcellus ? ' he asked , in a tone of challenge . I am going home , sir . ' To make your report to the Emperor ? ' Yes , sir . ' Peter laid his big hand heavily on Marcellus ' knee and earnestly studied his eyes . How much are you going to tell him  --  about Jesus ? ' he demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom we thought dead , is alive  --  and that he is here to establish a new kingdom . ' It will take courage to do that , my young brother ! The Emperor will not like to hear that a new kingdom is coming . You may be punished for your boldness . ' Be that as it may , ' said Marcellus , I shall have told him the truth . ' He will ask you how you know that Jesus lives . What will you say ? ' I shall tell him of the death of Stephanos  --  and the vision that he had . I am convinced that he saw Jesus ! ' Emperor Tiberius will want better proof than that . ' Marcellus was silently thoughtful . It was true , as Peter had said , such testimony would have very little weight with anyone disinclinedto believe . Tiberius would scoff at such evidence , as who would not ? Senator Gallio would say , You saw a dying man lookingat Jesus . How do you know that is what he saw ? Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You say he worked miracles : but you , personally , did n't see any . ' Come , ' said Peter , getting to his feet . Let us go back to the city . ' They strode along with very little to say , each immersed in his thoughts . Presently they were in the thick of city traffic . Peter had said he was going back to John Mark 's house . Marcellus would return to the inn . Now they were passing the Temple . The sun was setting and the marble steps  --  throughout the day swarming with beggars  --  were almost deserted.  |p371One  pitiful cripple , his limbs twisted and shrunken , sat dejectedly on the lowest step , waggling his basin and hoarsely croaking for alms . Peter slowed to a stop . Marcellus had moved on , a little way , but drifted back when he observed that Peter and the beggar were talking . How long have you been this way , friend ? ' Peter was saying . Since my birth , sir , ' whined the beggar . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money , ' confessed Peter ; then , impulsively , he went on  --  ' but such as I have I give you ! ' Stretching out both hands to the bewildered cripple , he commanded , In the name of Jesus  --  stand up  --  and walk ! ' Grasping his thin arms , he tugged the beggar to his feet  --  and he stood ! Amazed  --  and with pathetic little whimpers  --  half-laughing , half-crying , he slipped his sandals along the pavement ; short , uncertain , experimental steps  --  but he was walking . Now he was shouting ! A crowd began to gather . Men of the neighborhood who recognized the beggar were pushing in to ask excited questions . Peter took Marcellus by the arm and they moved on , walking for some distance in silence . At length Marcellus found his voice , but it was shaky . Peter ! How did you do that ? ' By the power of Jesus ' spirit . ' ' But  --  the thing 's impossible ! The fellow was born crippled ! He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he will walk now , ' said Peter , solemnly . Tell me , Peter ! ' entreated Marcellus . Did you know you had this power ? Have you ever done anything like this before ? ' No  --  not like this , ' said Peter . I am more and more conscious of his presence . He dwells in me . This power  --  it is not mine , Marcellus . It is his spirit . ' Perhaps he will not appear again  --  except in men 's hearts , ' said Marcellus . Yes ! ' declared Peter . He will dwell in men 's hearts  --  and give them the power of his spirit . But  --  that is not all ! He will come again ! '  |p372IT  was common knowledge that Rome had the noisiest nights of any city in the world , but one needed a quiet year abroad to appreciatethis fully . Except for the two celebrated avenues intersecting at the Forum  --  the Via Sacra and the Via Nova  --  which were grandly laid with smooth block of Numidian marble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size from plums to pomegranates . To relieve the congestion in these cramped , crooked streets and their still narrower tributaries , an ordinance  --  a century old  --  prohibitedthe movement of market-carts , delivery wagons , or any other vehicular traffic from sunrise to sunset , except imperial equipages and officially sanctioned parades on festal occasions . Throughout the daylight hours , the business streets were gorged with milling crowds on foot , into which the more privileged ruthlesslyrode their horses or were borne on litters and portable chairs ; but when twilight fell , the harsh rasp and clatter of heavy iron wheels grinding the cobblestones set up a nerve-racking cacophony accompanied by the agonized squawk of dry axles , the cracking of whips , and the shrill quarrels of contenders for the right of way ; nor did this maddening racket cease until another day had dawned . This was every night , the whole year round . But the time to see and hear Rome at her utmost was during the full of a summer moon when much building construction was in progress , and everybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unable to sleep , thousands turned out in the middle of the hideous night to add their jostling and clamor to the other jams and confusions . Shopkeepers opened up to serve the meandering insomniacs with sweets and beverages . Hawkers barked their catchpennywares ; minstrels twanged their lyres and banged their drums ; bulging camel-trains doggedly plodded through the protesting throng , trampling toes and tearing tunics ; great wagons loaded with lumber and hewn stone plowed up the multitude , pitching the furrows against the walls and into open doorways . All nights in Rome were dreadful , and the more beautiful nights were dangerous.  |p373Long  before their galley from Ostia had rounded the bend that brought the city into full view on that bright June midnight of their homecoming , Marcellus heard the infernal din as he had never heard it before ; heard it as no one could hear it without the preparationof a month 's sailing on a placid summer sea . The noise had a new significance . It symbolized the confounded outcry of a competitive world that had always done everything the hard way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show for its sweat and passion . It knew no peace , had never known peace , and apparentlydid n't want any peace . Expertly the galley slipped into its snug berth to be met by a swarm of yelling porters . Demetrius , one of the first passengers over the rail , returned in a moment with a half-dozen swarthy Thracians who made off with their abundant luggage . Engaging another port-wagon for themselves , the travelers were soon swallowedup in a bedlam of tangled traffic through which they inched along until Marcellus , weary of the delay , suggested that they pay off the driver and continue on foot . He had forgotten how insufferably rude and cruel the public could be . Massed into a solid pack , it had no intelligence . It had no capacity to understand how , if everyone calmly took his turn , some progress might be made . Even the wild animals around a water-hole in the jungle had more sense than this surly , selfish shoving mob . Marcellus ' own words , spoken with such bland assurance to the cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kingdom of good will , he had declared , would not come into being at the top of society . It would not be handed down from a throne . It would begin with the common people . Well  --  here were your common people ! Climb up on a cart , Marcellus , and tell the commonpeople about good will . Admonish them to love one another , aid one another , defer to one another ; and so fulfill the law of Christ . But  --  look out !  --  or they will pelt you with filth from the gutters ; for the common people are in no mood to be trifled with . The reunion of the Gallio family , an hour later , was one of the happiest experiences of their lives . When Marcellus had left home a year ago , shaky , emaciated , and mentally upset , the three who remained mourned for him almost as if he were dead . True , there had been occasional brief letters assuring them that he was well , but there was a conspicuous absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a desire to come home . Betweenthe lines they read , with forebodings , that Marcellus was still in a state of mental upheaval . He had seemed very far away , not only in miles but in mind . The last letter they had received from him , a month ago , had said , in closing , I am trailing an elusivemystery for the Emperor . Mysteries are his recreation . This one may turn out to be something more serious than a mere pastime : The Senator had sighed and shaken his head as he slowly rolled up the scroll . But now Marcellus had come back as physically fit as a gladiator , mentally alert , free of his despondency , in possession of his natural zest and enthusiasm . And something else had been added , something not easy to define , a curious radiance of personality . There was a new strength in Marcellus , a contagious energy that vitalized the house . It was in his voice , in his eyes , in his hands . His family did not at first ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him know that it was noticeable ; neither did they discuss it immediately with one another . But Marcellus had acquired something that gave him distinction . The Senator had been working late in his library . He had finished his task , had put away his writing materials , and had risen from his desk-chair when he heard confident footsteps . Leaving Demetrius in the driveway to await the arrival of their luggage , Marcellus  --  joyfully recognized by the two old slaves on guard at the front door  --  had walked swiftly through to the spaciousatrium . His father 's door was partly open . Bursting in on him unceremoniously , he threw his arms around him and hugged him breathless . Although the Senator was tall and remarkably virile for his years , the Tribune 's overwhelming vitality completely engulfedhim . My son ! My son ! ' Gallio quavered , fervently . You are well again ! Strong again ! Alive again ! The gods be praised ! ' Marcellus pressed his cheek against his father 's and patted him on the back . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And you , sir , grow more handsome every day ! How proud I am to be your son ! ' Lucia , in her room , suddenly stirred in her sleep , sat up wideawake , listened , tossed aside the silk covers , listened again with an open mouth and a ' pounding heart . Oh ! ' she called . Tertia ! My robe ! Tertia ! Wake up ! Hurry ! My sandals ! Marcellus is here ! ' Racing down to the library , she threw herself into her brother 's arms , and when he had lifted her1P375off her feet and kissed her , she cried , Dear Marcellus  --  you are well ! ' And you  --  my sweet  --  are beautiful ! You have grown up ; have n't you ? ' He lightly touched her high coronet of glossy black hair with caressing fingers . Lovely ! ' The Senator put his arms around both of them , to their happy surprise , for it was not his custom to be demonstrative with his affection . Come , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very late , ' said Marcellus . Should we waken her ? ' Of course ! ' insisted Lucia . They crowded through the doorway , arm in arm . In the dimly lit atrium , a little group of the older servants had assembled , tousled and sleepy , their anxious eyes wondering what to expect of the son and heir who , on his last visit home , had been in such a distressing state of mind . Ho !  --  Marcipor ! ' shouted Marcellus , grasping the outstretched hand . Hi !  --  Decimus ! ' It was n't often that the stiff and taciturn butler unbent , but he beamed with smiles as he thrust out his hand . How are you , Tertia ! ' called Marcellus to the tall , graceful girl descending the stairs . They all drew in closer . Old Servius was patted on the shoulder , and the wrinkled , toothless mouth chopped tremulously while the tears ran unchecked . Welcome ! Welcome ! ' the old man shrilled . The gods bless you , sir ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my horses ? ' And when Lentius had made bold to reply that Ishtar had a filly , three months old  --  which made them all laugh merrily as if this were a good joke on somebody  --  Marcellus sent them into another gale of laughter by demanding , Bring in the filly , Lentius ! I must see her at once ! ' There were more than a score of slaves gathered in the atrium now , all of them full of happy excitement . There had never been such an utter collapse of discipline in the Gallio household . Longtimeservants , accustomed to moving about soberly and on tiptoe , heard themselves laughing hilariously  --  laughing here in the atrium !  --  laughing in the presence of the Senator ! And the Senator was smiling , too ! Marcellus was brightening their eyes with his ready recognition , calling most of them by name . A pair of pretty Macedonian twins arrived , hand in hand , dressed exactly alike ; practically indistinguishable . He remembered having had a glimpse of them , two years ago , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did everyone else , to their considerable embarrassment.  | Are you girls sisters ? ' he inquired . This was by far the merriest thing that anyone had said , and the atrium resounded with full-throated appreciation . Decimus ! ' shouted the Senator , and the laughter ceased . You will serve supper ! In an hour ! In the banquet-room ! With the gold service ! Marcipor !  --  let all the lamps be lighted ! Throughout the villa ! And the gardens ! ' Marcellus brushed through the scattering crowd and bounded up the stairs . Cornelia met him in the corridor , outside her door , and he gathered her hungrily into his arms . They had no adequate words for each other ; just stood there , clinging together , Cornelia smoothing his close-cropped hair with her soft palm and sobbing like a child , while the Senator , with misty eyes , waited a little way apart , fumbling with the silk tassels on his broad sash . Her intuition suggesting that Marcellus and their emotional mother might need a quiet moment alone together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word with Decimus about the supper . All the other servants had scurried away to their duties , their very sandal-straps confiding in excited whispers that this was a happy night and a good place to be . Not too much food , Decimus , ' Lucia was saying . Some fresh fruit and cold meats and wine  --  and a nut-cake if there is one . But do n't cook anything . It is late , and the Senator will be tired and sleepy before you have time to prepare an elaborate dinner . Serve it in the big dining-room , as he said , and use the gold plate . And tell Rhesus to cut an armful of roses  --  red ones . And let the twins serve my brother . And  --  ' With suddenly widened eyes , she sighted Demetrius  --  tall , tanned , serious , and handsome  --  entering the atrium . Dismissing the butler with a brief nod , Lucia held her arm high and waved a welcome , her flowing sleeve baring a shapely elbow . Decimus , keenly observant , scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strides , Demetrius came to a military halt before her , bowed deferentially , and was slowly bringing up his spear-shaft to his forehead in the conventional salute when Lucia stepped forward impulsively , laying both hands on his bronzed arms . All thanks , good Demetrius , ' she said , softly . You have brought Marcellus home  --  well and strong as ever . Better than ever ! ' No thanks are due me for that , ' he rejoined . The Tribune needed no one to bring him home . He is fully master of himself now . ' Demetrius raised his eyes and regarded her with frank admiration . May I tell the Tribune 's sister how very  --  how very well she is looking ? ' P377Why not  --  if you think so ? ' Lucia , toying with her amber beads , gave him a smile that meant to be non-committal . There is no need asking you how you are , Demetrius . Have you and the Tribune had some exciting experiences ? ' Her eyes were wincingly exploring a long , new scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a droll grin . How did you get that awful cut ? ' she asked , squeamishly . I met a Syrian , ' said Demetrius . They are not a very polite people . ' I hope you taught him some of the gentle manners of the Greeks , ' drawled Lucia . Tell me  --  did you kill him ? ' You ca n't kill a Syrian , ' said Demetrius , lightly . They die only of old age . ' Lucia 's little shrug said they had had enough of this banter and her face slowly sobered to a thoughtful frown . What has happened to my brother ? ' she asked . ' He seems in such extraordinarily high spirits . ' He may want to tell you  --  if you give him time : You 're different , too , Demetrius . ' For the better , I hope , ' he parried . Something has expanded you both , ' declared Lucia . What is it ? Has Marcellus been elevated to a more responsible command ? ' Demetrius nodded enthusiastically . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , suddenlyapprehensive . Oh , yes , indeed ! ' he answered , proudly . He does n't appear to be worrying much about it . I never saw him so happy . He has already turned the whole villa upside-down with his gaiety . ' I know . I heard them . ' Demetrius grinned . I hope it wo n't spoil them , ' she said , with dignity . They are n't used to taking such liberties ; though perhaps it will not hurt  --  to have it happen  --  this once . ' Perhaps not , ' said Demetrius , dryly . It may not hurt them  --  to be really happy  --  this once . ' Lucia raised her brows . I am afraid you do n't understand , ' she remarked , coolly . I 'm afraid I do , ' he sighed . Had you forgotten that I too am a slave ? ' No : She gave a little toss of her head . But I think you have . ' I did not mean to be impudent , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious , you know ; discipline , slavery , mastery , human relations  --  and who has a right to tell others when they may be happy . '   Lucia searched his face with a frown . Well  --  I hope my brother 's genial attitude towards our servants is not going to make us lose our control of this house ! ' she snapped , indignantly . It need not , ' said Demetrius . He believes in a little different kind of control ; that is all . It is much more effective , I think , than controllingby sharp commands . More pleasant for everybody ; and , besides , you get better service . ' Marcellus was calling to her from the head of the stairs . I am sorry I spoke impatiently , Demetrius , ' she said , as she moved away . We are so glad you are home again . ' He met her level eyes and they smiled . He raised his spear-shaft to salute . She pursed her lips , shook her head , and made a negligentgesture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this once . ' Marcipor , who had been lingering impatiently in the alcove , waiting for this conversation to end , came forward as Lucia disappeared up the stairway . He fell into step with Demetrius and they strolled out through the peristyle into the moonlight . It is amazing  --  how he has recovered ! ' said Marcipor . What happened to him ? ' I shall tell you fully when there is an opportunity ; later tonight , if possible . Marcellus has become an ardent believer . He toured through Galilee  --  ' And you ? ' asked Marcipor . Were you not with him ? ' Only part of the time . I spent many weeks in Jerusalem . I havemuch to tell you about that . Marcipor  --  the Galilean is alive ! ' ' Yes  --  we have heard that . ' " We " ?  --  and who are " we " ? ' Demetrius took hold of Marcipor'sarm and drew him to a sudden halt . The Christians in Rome , ' replied Marcipor , smiling at his friend 's astonishment . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many months ago  --  brought by merchants from Antioch . ' And how did you find out ? ' It was being , whispered about in the markets . Decimus , who is forever deriding the Greeks , was pleased to inform me that certain superstitious traders from Antioch had brought the report of a Jewish carpenter who had risen from the dead . Remembering what you had told me about this man , I was devoured with curiosity to hear more of it . ' And you found the men from Antioch ? ' encouraged Demetrius . The next day . They were quite free to talk , and their storyP379sounded convincing . They had had it from an eye-witness of many astounding miracles  --  one Philip . Seeking to confirm it , several of them went to Jerusalem where they talked with other men who had seen this Jesus after his death  --  men whose word they trusted . All that  --  added to what you had reported  --  gave me cause to believe . ' So  --  you are a Christian ! ' Demetrius ' eyes shone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Marcipor 's face grew suddenly grave . Not yet  --  Demetrius . My course is not clear . Decimus made it his business to inform the Senator of this new movement , describingit as a revolution against lawful authority . ' Has the Senator done anything about it ? ' Not that I know of , but is it not natural that his feeling toward the Christians should be far from complacent ? He associates all this with his son 's misfortunes . Now  --  if Marcellus is told that we have a large body of believers here in Rome , he might impetuously throw himself into it . That would be dangerous . The Christians are keeping under cover . Already the patrols are beginning to make inquiries about their secret meetings . We must not cause a breach between Marcellus and his father . ' Very well , Marcipor , ' agreed Demetrius . We will not tell the Tribune , but he will find it out ; you may be sure of that . And as for estrangement , it is inevitable . Marcellus will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Senator could be persuaded of its truth . Old men do not readily change their opinions . However  --  thisnew cause can not wait , Marcipor , until all the opinionatedold men have approved of it . This story of Jesus is our only hope that freedom and justice may come . And if it is to come  --  at all  --  it must begin now ! ' I believe that , ' said Marcipor  --  ' but still  --  I should n't like to see Marcellus offend his father . The Senator is not going to live long . ' There was just such a case reported to Jesus , ' said Demetrius . I had this from a Galilean who heard the conversation . A young man , very much impressed that it was his duty to come out openly for this new way of life , said to Jesus , " My father is an old man , sir , with old views . This new religion is an offense to him . Let me first bury my father , and then I shall come  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in Marcipor , who was sixty-seven . Jesus did n't think so , ' went on Demetrius . It was high time for a drastic change in men 's belief and behavior . The new message could n't wait for the departure of old men with old views . Indeed ,  | these old men were already dead . Let them be buried by other dead ones . ' Did he say that ? ' queried Marcipor . ' Well  --  something like that . ' Sounds rather rough  --  to me  --  coming from so gentle a person . ' Demetrius slipped his hand affectionately through the older Corinthian 's arm . Marcipor  --  let us not make the mistake of thinking that , because this message of Jesus concerns peace and good will , it is a soft and timid thing that will wait on every man 's convenience , and scurry off the road , to hide in the bushes , until all other things go by ! The people who carry this torch are going to get into plenty of trouble . They are already being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , I know , ' murmured Marcipor . One of the traders from Antioch told me of seeing a young Greek stoned to death by a mob in Jerusalem . Stephanos was his name . Did you  --  by any chance  --  know him ? ' Stephanos , ' said Demetrius , sadly , was my closest friend . ' Marcellus had not finished his breakfast when Marcipor came in to say that Senator Gallio was in his library and would be pleased to have a talk with the Tribune at his early convenience . You may tell the Senator that I shall be down in a few minutes , ' said Marcellus . He would have preferred to postpone , for a few days , this serious interview with his father . It would be very difficult for the Senator to listen to his strange story with patience or respect . For some moments Marcellus sat staring out the open window , while he absentlypeeled an orange that he did n't intend to eat , and tried to decide how best to present the case of Jesus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than an advocate . Marcellus would be on trial , too . Marcus Lucan Gallio was not a contentious man . His renown as a debater in the Senate had been earned by diplomacy ; by his knowing when and how much to concede , where and whom to appease , and the fine art of conciliation . He never doggedly pursuedan argument for vanity 's sake . But he was proud of his mental morality . If , for example , he became firmly convinced that at all times and everywhere water seeks a level , there would be no use in coming to him with the tale that on a certain day , in a certain country , atP381the behest of a certain man , water was observed to run uphill . He had no time for reports of events which disregarded natural laws . As for miracles , ' the very word was offensive . He had no tolerance for such stories and not much more tolerance for persons who believed in them . And because , in his opinion , all religions were built on faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only contemptuous of religion , but admitted a candid distaste for religious people . Anybody who went in for such beliefs was either ignorant or unscrupulous . If a man , who had any sense at all , became a religious propagandist , he needed watching ; for , obviously , he meant to take advantage of the feebleminded who would trust him because of his piety . Some people  --  according to Senator Gallio  --  seemed to think that a pious man was inevitably honest , whereas the facts would show that piety and integrity were categorically irrelevant . It was quite proper for old Servius to importunehis gods . One could even forgive old Tiberius for his consuminginterest in religion , seeing that he was out of his head . But there was no excuse for such nonsense in a healthy , educated man . Marcellus had been treated with deep sympathy when he had come home a year ago . He had suffered a great shock and his mind was temporarily unbalanced . He could n't have said anything too preposterous for his father 's patience . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell the Senator this morning an amazingstory of a man who had healed all manner of diseases ; a man who , having been put to death on a cross , rose from his grave to be seen of many witnesses . And this would undoubtedly make the Senator very angry  --  and disgusted . Bahl ' he would shout . ' Non-sense ! ' This forecast of his father 's probable attitude had been appallingly accurate . It turned out to be a very unhappy interview . From almost the first moment , Marcellus sensed strong opposition . He had decided to begin his narrative with Jesus ' unjust trials and crucifixion , hoping thus to enlist the Senator 's sympathy for the persecutedGalilean , but he was not permitted to build up his case from that point . I have heard all that , my son , ' said Gallio , crisply . You need not review it . Tell me of the journey you made into the country where this man lived . ' So  --  Marcellus had told of his tour with Justus ; of little Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam , who had been given a voice ; of Lydia , who had found healing by a touch of his Robe ; of old Nathanael Bartholomew , and the storm at sea  --  while his father gazed steadily at him from under shaggy frowning brows , offering no comments and asking no questions . At length he had arrived at the phase of the story where he must talk of Jesus ' return to life . With dramatic earnestness he repeated everything that they had told him of these reappearances , while the lines about the Senator 's mouth deepened into a scowl . It all sounds incredible , sir , ' he conceded , but I am convinced that it is true . ' For a moment , he debated the advisability of telling his father about the miracle he had seen with his own eyes  --  Peter 's healing of the cripple . But no  --  that would be too much . His father would tell him he had been imposed upon by these miracle stories reported to him by other men . But there would be nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' if he told him that he himself had seen one of these wonders wrought . ' On the testimony of a few superstitious fishermen ! ' growled Gallio , derisively . It was not easy for me to accept , sir , ' admitted Marcellus , and I am not trying to persuade you of it . You asked me to tell you what I had learned about Jesus , and I have told you truly . It is my belief that this Galilean is still alive . I think he is an eternal person , a divine person with powers that no king or emperor has ever possessed , and I further believe that he will eventually rule the world ! ' Gallio chuckled bitterly . Had you thought of telling Tiberius that this Jesus intends to rule the world ? ' I may not need to say that to Tiberius . I shall tell him that Jesus , who was put to death , is alive again . The Emperor can draw his own conclusions . ' You had better be careful what you say to that crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to believe you , and this will not be pleasant news . Do n't you know he is quite capable of having you punished for bringing him a tale like that ? ' He can do no more than kill me , ' said Marcellus , quietly . Perhaps not , ' drawled Gallio ; but even so light a punishment as death  --  for an aspiring young man  --  might be quite an incon-venience : Marcellus humored his father 's grim jest with a smile . In sober truth , sir , I do not fear death . There is a life to come . ' Well  --  that is an ancient hope , my son , ' conceded Gallio , with a vague gesture . Men have been scrawling that on their tombs for three thousand years . The only trouble with that dream is that it lacks proof . Nobody has ever signaled us from out there . Nobody has ever come back to report . '  |p333Jesus  did ! ' declared Marcellus . Gallio sighed deeply and shook his head . After a moody silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big desk , as Marcellus rose to meet his approach . My son , ' he said , entreatingly , laying his hands on the broad shoulders , go to the Emperor and tell him what you have learned of this Galilean prophet . Quote Jesus ' words of wisdom . They are sensible and should do Tiberius much good if he would heed them . Tell him  --  if you must  --  about the feats of magic . The old man will believe them , and the more improbable they are the better they  --  and you  --  will please him . That , in my opinion , should be sufficient . ' Nothing about Jesus ' return to life ? ' inquired Marcellus , respectfully . ' Why should you ? ' demanded Gallio . Take a common-sense view of your predicament . Through no fault of yours , you have had an unusual experience , and are now obliged to report on it to the Emperor . He has been mad for a dozen years or more and everybody in Rome knows it . He has surrounded himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diviners of oracles . Some of them are downright impostors and the rest of them are mentally unhinged . If you tell Tiberius what you have told me , you will be just one more monkey added to his menagerie . ' It was strong medicine , but Marcellus grinned ; and his father , feeling that his argument was gaining ground , went on , pleadingly . You have a bright future before you , my son , if you will it so ; but not if you pursue this course . I wonder if you realize what a tragedy may be in the making for you  --  for all of us ! It will be a bitter experience for your mother , and your sister , and your father , to know that our friends are telling one another you have lost your mind ; that you are one of the Emperor 's wise fools . And what will Diana say ? ' he continued , earnestly . That beautiful creature is in love with you ! Do n't you care ? ' I do care , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sadly disappointed in me , but I have no alternative . I have put my hand to this plow  --  and I am not turning back ! ' Gallio retreated a step and lounged against his desk , with a sly smile . Wait until you see her before you decide to give her up ! I am indeed anxious to see her , sir . ' Will you try to meet her , down there , before you talk to Tiberius ? ' If possible , yes sir :  | You have made your arrangements for the voyage ? ' Yes , sir . Demetrius has seen to it . We leave this evening . Galley to Ostia . To Capri on The Cleo . ' Very good , ' approved Gallio , much encouraged . He slapped Marcellus on the back . Let us take a walk in the gardens . And you have n't been to the stables yet . ' A moment , please , sir  --  before we go . ' Marcellus ' face was serious . I know you have a feeling that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be happy to follow your counsel if I were free to do so . ' Free ? ' Gallio stared into his son 's eyes . What do you mean ? ' I feel obliged , sir , to tell the Emperor of Jesus ' return to life . ' Well , well , then , ' consented Gallio , brusquely , if you must talk about that , let it be as a local rumor among the country people . You do n't have to tell Tiberius that you believe it ! If you want to say that a few fishermen thought they saw him , that should dischargeyour obligation . You have no personal knowledge of it . You did n't see him ! ' But I saw a man who did see him , sir ! ' declared Marcellus. saw this man looking at him ! ' And that constitutes proof  --  in your opinion ? ' scoffed Gallio . In this instance  --  yes , sir ! I saw a Greek stoned for his Christian belief . He was a brave man , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trusted him . When everyone thought him dead , he raised up , smiled , and shouted , " 1 see him ! " And  --  I know that he saw him ! ' But you do n't have to tell that to Tiberius ! ' said Gallio , testily . Yes , sir ! Having heard and seen that , I should be a coward if I did not testify to it ! For I , too , am a Christian , sir ! I can not do otherwise ! ' Gallio made no reply . With bent head , he turned away slowly and left the room , without a backward glance . Lamenting his father 's disappointment , Marcellus sauntered out to the pergola , feeling sure that Lucia would be waiting for him . She saw him coming and ran to meet him . Linking their arms , she tugged him along gaily toward their favorite rendezvous . What 's the matter ? ' she insisted , shaking his arm . Have a row with the Senator ? ' I hurt his feelings , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about that awful business up there in Jerusalem that made you sick ! ' No , dear ; but I was telling him about that man  --  and I would be glad to tell you , too . '  |p385'Thanks  , my little brother ! ' chaffed Lucia . ' I do n't want to hear a word of it ! High time you forgot all about it ! . . . Here , Bambo ! .. Make a fuss over him , Marcellus . He hardly knows you . ' Her lips pouted . Neither do I , ' she murmured . ' Are n't you ever going to be happy any more ? Last night we all thought you were well again . I was so glad I lay awake for hours , hugging myself for joy ! Now you 're blue and moody . ' Big tears stood in her eyes . ' Please , Marcellus ! ' ' Sorry , sister . ' He put his arm around her . ' Let us go look at the roses . . . . Here , Bambo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted . The Emperor had not been well for many weeks . Early in April , while rashly demonstrating how tough he was , the old man had ambled down to the uncompleted villa on the easternmost end of the mall in a drenching rain and had taken a severe cold , the effects of which had depleted his not too abundant vitality . In normal circumstances Tiberius , customarily careful of his health , would have taken no such risk ; or , having taken it , would have gone at once to bed , fuming and snorting , to be packed in hot fomentations and doctored with everything that the court physicians could devise . But on this occasion the Emperor , having renewed his youth  --  or at least having attained his second childhood  --  had sat about with Diana in the dampness of the new villa , wet to the skin , after which he had sauntered back to the Jovis pretending to have enjoyedthe rain and refusing to permit anyone to aid him , though it was clear enough that he was having a hard chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while hoarsely protesting that he was sound as a nut . That the young daughter of Gallus had been innocently but unmistakablyresponsible for this dangerous imprudence  --  and many another hazardous folly on the part of the aging Emperor  --  was now the unanimous opinion of the household staff . The beauteous Diana was getting to be a problem . For the first few weeks after her arrival , more than a year ago , the entire population of Capri  --  with the exception of the Empress Julia , whose jealousy of her was deep and desperate  --  had rejoiced in the girl 's invigorating influence on Tiberius . His infatuation for Diana had done wonders for him . Boyishly eager to please her , he was living more temperately , not only in what he ate and drank , but in what he said and did . Not often now was the Emperor noticeably
