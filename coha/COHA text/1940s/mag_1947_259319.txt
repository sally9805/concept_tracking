FLORA &; FAUNA <P> " God help the horse and the driver too , " sang the Irish Poet James Stephens , " and the people and beasts who have never a friend . " <P> Like the people , the beasts of the world needed help in this worst of postwar winters , but they were not all friendless . Some beasts set out to help themselves . In Britain , Lincolnshire crows , hard put to find fodder under the heavy snows , were attacking sheep ; one herder last week reported three sheep killed by the raiders . In the U.S. , a huckster 's horse with a will of his own staged a sit-down strike smack in the middle of a busy Baltimore street . <P> In Evesham on the River Avon , a respectable British workhorse named Smokey who had long frightened picnickers by stealing and eating their sandwiches also took on sterner ways .
