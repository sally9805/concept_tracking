This is a special announcement to the 1,400,000 women who read TIME every week . Men may read it , or not , as they please ( see cut ) . <P> Beginning Jan. 2 , you will find on your radios a news program , TIME FOR WOMEN , written and edited each day by TIME . The American Broadcasting Company will broadcast it five afternoons a week , Monday through Friday , coast-to-coast , at 4:30 E.S.T. It will give you the news , as it comes to TIME every day , and the personalities who make it . <P> By no means the least feature of this new program is its commentator , Shelley Mydans . With her husband , LIFE Photographer Carl Mydans , she has covered most of the warfronts of the world for TIME &; LIFE . As a result , she has seen more of the world in the last six years than almost any other woman journalist . <P> Shelley Mydans ' father , Everett Wallace Smith , was a newspaperman who became professor of journalism at Stanford University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she invariably went to sleep to the sound of typewriters . She left Stanford in her senior year to go to Broadway to become a dancer and an actress . She became , instead a LIFE researcher and , in 1938 , married her favorite photographer . <P> They went abroad together for the first time in the fall of 1939 as the German Wehrmacht was slicing up Poland . Shelley worked in Sweden while her husband photographed the misbegotten Russo-Finnish war . She was in Portugal on the " balcony of Europe " when France fell . Eight months later she was in China , finding and setting up stories for her husband , placating unwilling camera subjects , dodging Japanese bombs and shellfire , writing her own copy . They got to Burma and Singapore ahead of the Japs , taking pictures and writing stories . Then they went to Manila-in October , 1941 . <P> They were still there when Manila fell . They were interned in Santo Toms prison . Shelley describes what followed as 21 months of " constant , oozing fear . " She became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sanitation committee , one of the detail which picked the weevils out of the cereal . Eventually transferred to another internment camp in Shanghai , she was repatriated with her husband aboard the exchange ship Gripsholm , in December , 1943 . <P> Shelley wrote a novel ( The Open City ) about her experiences , did some pieces for FORTUNE 'S issue on Japan , and , late in 1944 , went back to the Pacific . Her beat was Guam , Saipan , the Philippines-where she saw the Japanese surrender-and then , Japan . <P> Of all Shelley Mydans ' admirers , none tops the hard-bitten G.I. editor of the Mid-pacifican , who wrote , on Dec. 2 , 1944 : " Shelley Smith Mydans , the Pacific 's first gorgeous war correspondent , is here . . . . ( She ) can not be summed up in a sentence , but a sentence can report that she 's an able newspaperwoman who has been more places than a globetrotter , has had more adventures than a soldier of fortune , knows more about the Japs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better to look at than 75% of the movie stars . <P> " I talked to Shelley Mydans for three hours the other day . . . and whether she 's telling a joke , talking seriously , or relating adventures that would scare Superman , she 's cool as a Tom Collins . . . . Shelley Mydans is one of the relatively few people on our side who knows much about our Pacific enemy . "
