Since war 's end , no schoolchild in Berlin has studied history . The Allies had made the subject verboten in all Berlin schools . Last week , the holiday from history ended . <P> A commission of professors-headed by a Frenchman , an Englishman , an American , and a Russian-had finally agreed on a new Outline of History suitable for young German minds . They had carefully ironed out Nazi distortions-and had added some new twists of their own . Soviet Major Vassily Bagrov wanted to say a good deal about " The Shady Aspects of Celibacy " when discussing the Renaissance church . The other powers said no ; but they agreed to let him have a chapter on " The Class Struggle on the Eve of the Reformation . " <P> The Russian major also hoped to climax a section on 17 of the world 's greatest political thinkers with a contrast between " Socialist Structure and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat " and " The Unbalanced Structure of Capitalism . " Protested the Englishman : " Then I think it 's hardly worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history . " The Russian 's feelings were hurt ; 83% of the men to be studied , he said , " represent theories thoroughly unacceptable to the Soviet Union . " But he finally backed down and settled for a big section on " Countries with a New Democracy . " <P> The major seemed willing to learn . ( " You mean a Republic is not necessarily a Democracy ? That is a new historical revelation to me . " ) But he was most anxious for a chapter on " The Inevitability of Wars in the Capitalist System . " All the other powers protested hotly . Said the U.S. delegate ( jovial , white-haired Harry R. Wyman of the Phoenix Junior College in Arizona ) : " It is n't our purpose here to turn prophet . . . " Replied Major Bagrov : " I did n't mean that at all ... and General Stalin has announced that with a definite will on both sides , both the Socialist and the Capitalist systems can and must exist together . . . I will now attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the others assented : " The Dangers of Crises in the Capitalist Economy . " <P> The West claimed a sizable victory when the major apparently heaved Marxian determinism overboard . " Every historical event , " the powers agreed , " is a result of the interaction and interdependence of ... economic factors , political factors , cultural and social factors . " Just how complete the victory would be , Berlin school children would learn next fall when their history books arrive . Each power will write texts for its own sector , then get the approval of the other powers .
