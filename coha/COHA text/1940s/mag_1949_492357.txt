T O the average American landholder , who may fret over the squireship of anything from a weedy lawn plot to a few hundred acres , the prospect of managing an area well over half the size of the state of Rhode Island would be a Brobding-nagian nightmare . Ranger Lee Luckinbill , of the United States Forest Service , a stalwart six-footer of thirty-seven , has been doing just this for some years without any visible signs of wear . Furthermore , lest the word " forest " foster a misapprehension , Ranger Luckinbill 's 502,000-acre national-forest district  --  one of the largest in the country  --  includes not only woods , mountains and a wilderness area ; it also contains several hundred square miles of grazing land , fifty miles of roads , eighty miles of telephone line , 378 miles of trail , a gold mine or two , several timber-cutting operations , 5200 cattle and 10,000 sheep in season , a heavy population of elk , moose , deer , antelope , black bear and mountain sheep , a dozen or so grizzlies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this and these are , in whole or in part , Ranger Luckinbill 's responsibility . Before examining the many-sided routine this minor sovereignty imposes , it will be well to take a closer look at Luckinbill 's domain and the constitutional charter under which it operates . A national forest , managed by the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture , should neverbe confused with a national park , run by the National Park Service as part of the Interior Department . A national in the interests of good clean fun . A national forest is an area of restricted and supervised land use in which the Forest Service acts as sort of a watch-and-ward society in protecting the natural resources of the area for you and me in perpetuity . National forests , generally speaking , include vital watersheds , marginal-grazing lands and some wilderness areas in which the protection of native game population is considered important . A national forest is thus a going concern , a producing part of the public domain . You can own land in a national forest ? though most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run a farm or a business , cut timber , dig a mine , hunt and fish in season and generally live just about as you like , so long as you observe the general rules of conservation laid down by the Forest Service . The fact that not everyone reads the same meaning into the words " use " and " conservation " is what makes the service the interesting business it is . The Shoshone National Forest , created by a presidential proclamation in 1891 , was the first such area set aside by the Federal Government . The Shoshone lies on the eastern flank of the Continental Divide in the northwestern corner of Wyoming , bordering on Yellowstone Park on the west , on Montana on the north and sloping into Bighorn Basin on the east . This vast area , larger than Delaware , is divided into seven ranger districts  --  the Clarks Fork , the Wapiti , the South Fork , the Greybull , the Lander , the Wind River and the Absaroka . Lee Luckinbill 's section , the Clarks Fork District , occupies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pulse of the Clarks Fork District is Sunlight Basin  --  a gigantic , shallow crease of range land which climbs slowly and , it seems , reluctantly to the timbered feet of the mountain barrier in the west . Sunlight , with its mountain meadows , its half a dozen ranches , its blind draws which lead up to the rocky rim that forms the sky line , could be a stock background for any western horse opera . The fact that the valley , at its eastern outlet , abuts on an 8000-foot road block called Dead Indian Hill probably prompted the early topographers to call this melodramatic scoop of land a basin . Though the twisting ascent of Dead Indian affords the casual traveler one of the most exciting panoramas in the West , it is a geological ( Continued 4 , ri Page 90 ) FOREST RANGER ( Cnnrinued front Page 32 ) stab in the back to native Sunlighters , for it cuts them off from the rest of the world with a snowy curtain for at least four months of the year . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Hill briefly tells the long story of Sunlight Basin : DEAD INDIAN SUMMIT ALTITUDE 8000 FEET THIS PASS IS THE SUMMIT OF DEAD INDIAN HILL .

OVER THIS ONE AND ONLY OPENING TO THE VALLEYS TO THE WEST TRAVELLED A VAST ARMY OF MINERS TO SEEK THE WEALTH OF COOKE CITY AND DOWN THIS STEEP HILL THE EARLY SETTLERS OF SUNLIGHT BASIN BRAVED ITS DANGERS . There follows a list of fifteen early settlers  --  the same pioneers who , according to a local legend , named the basin Sunlight " because sunlight was the only thing that could get in here . " Dead Indian Pass , one of the two doors to Lee Luckinbill 's district , takes the traveler , over forty miles of indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he wants to go farther , he keeps on driving . In good weather the trip from Sunlight to Cody demands two hours of energetic driving ; in bad weather it may take two days  --  when the snow builds up during early December it can take four months . Then you either shovel through the drifts or wait till the snow melts . Cody is where the Clarks Fork residents must go for church , a movie , medical attention , their general shopping needs and a look at a sidewalk . The district 's mail comes in once a week from Cody . The second door to Clarks Fork opens northward into Montana and leads to Billings , more than 100 miles away . Just outside the district , on the highway that funnels good-weather tourists into the Yellowstone , lies the old mining town of Cooke City , where Clarks Fork residents can find a store . The administrative center of the Clarks Fork District is the ranger station , which lies well up in Sunlight Basin some ten miles from Dead Indian Hill . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willows , the Government has fenced off 160 acres of grassy hillside and erected a group of neat one-story log buildings of the native lodgepole pine , and here the Luckinbills and their two young sons make their home and Lee has his headquarters . There is a seven-room house , an administration building containing an office , a bedroom and bath and a two-car garage , a small barn and corral , a warehouse with additional garage space , a small bunkhouse , a root cellar and a coal-andwood shed . The house and the administration building have coal furnaces . The station generates its in elec-tricity  --  as must everyone n the district ? and gets its water from a free- flowing spring . The Forest Service telephone connects the station with Cody ( no toll  --  it 's on the Cody exchange ) and most of the other permanent residents in the district . Aside from the fact that the utilities break down occasionally , the ranger station at Sunlight is fitted for a comfortable life . And this is just as well , for living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarks Fork country . According to the book , Lee Luckinbill works a five-day week which he apportions among his various duties  --  forest protection , timber management , range management , wildlife control in co-operation with the state game-andfish commission , land use , recreational supervision , water use and road , telephone line and trail construction and maintenance . In practice , Luckinbill finds that , like most rangers who have isolated districts , he is on call seven days a week . This is not to suggest that Lee 's routine exerts any particular pressure upon him ; except in the case of a forest fire or similar emergency , Luckinbill lives an evenly paced existence in which his chief worry is the paper work which awaits him whenever he gets back to his desk . The vicissitudes of a forest ranger 's work may break bones or freeze parts of the anatomy , but they seldom breed ulcers . Through some abracadabra of its own , the Forest Service has computed that there are three man-years of recurrent supervisory work to be done every year in Luckinbill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , Lee is given the services of an assistant ranger during the eight months ' open season the country enjoys . The assistant lives in a guard station twenty miles away during this period and is assigned to another district during the snow months . In addition to this part-time helper , Luckinbill 's table of organization theoretically includes one camp guard or cleanup man for three months of the year , four smoke chasers for three months , two lookouts during the fire season ( May to September ) , a two-man road crew for four months and a two-or-three-man trail crew for three months . Lee considers himself lucky if he has half this roster filled during any given period . " For heaven 's sake , if you 're going to tell the real story of a ranger 's job , have him doing something besides fighting forest fires . " Betty-Rae and Lee Luckinbill voiced this plea in chorus when I arrived at Sunlight and made the purpose of my visit known . As 8 Forest Service family the Luckinbills are allergic to the conventional picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infernos on every side . Though these singed heroics are a part of the job , they are only a part , as Lee likes to point out . " There 's probably nothing in a ranger 's job that 's more important than preventing and fighting forest fires , mind you , but the point is that we spend a relatively small part of our time on the fire business and a lot of time doing other things that most people never even suspect are a part of a ranger 's duties . " To prove his argument , Luckinbill went to his fire . record . In his Clarks Fork District the period of lire hazard is considered to lie between May twelfth and October fifteenth . Those five months bridge the oftentimes dry gap between the spring rains and the earlY-autumn snows . Lee had seven fires in 1948 ? all man-caused . The largest restaged eighty acres . Luckinbill put twelve men on it  --  he recruits , in addition to his regular staff , paid volunteers from the local timber operations and the ranches  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job himself . The six other fires were small stuff . Lee admits he was lucky last year . Sure , we had the breaks . It was a dry summer and anything might have happened . As it was , our worst scare developed out of a Custer National Forest fire  --  it crept over our line and wiped Out three hundred acres . Their crews put it out . Another year we may not so lucky  --  but , as you can see , there 's lots to do on this job besides the days I spend on the fire line . Remember that three man-year business . " This , of course , is an oversimplification . All forest rangers live their lives with their eyes on the horizon and thee ' noses cocked for smoke in the woods . The Central and Northern Rockies , with their cover of pine , fir and spruce , and a high evaporation rate which dissipates ground moisture , are fire hazards of a high order , and for weeks on end Luckinbill keeps a wary eye on the complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry period he makes three or four routine ascents to the district 's two fire towers  --  one of which , standing against the far sky line , can be seen from the ranger station  --  to check with the lookouts . " They 're seasonal workers , usually one to a tower , and they live right there in the lookout . It 's a good spot for Young forestry students , if they can Stand being stuck alone on a mountaintop . Our big job is to keep them up there ? it gets darn lonesome after a few weeks . We had women on Windy Mountain for three seasons . They worked out all right . The year before I came to the Clarks Fork , one of the women came down during the evening in an early snowstorm . She met a game warden when she reached the road and he gave her a ride into Cody . The ranger knew she was leaving and , when she did n't check in , he figured she had had an accident or bad got lost . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for her in the snow . Then , next morning , she called in from Cody . " Lookouts report fires to the ranger station by phone . The watchers scan the horizon every fifteen minutes and locate suspicious smoke by an azimuth reading . Sunlight headquarters often receives the two towers ' reports on a suspected fire within seconds of each other . " The folks who live around here complete our fire coverage  --  that 's one of the big reasons why they 're tied in with the eighty miles of Forest Service telephone line in the district . The smoke chasers ? usually college boys who live in the bunkhouses at Crandall or Sunlight during the summer  --  go out on small blazes , but if the conditions are right for a bad one everyone is on call . " Though fire is Luckinbill 's most urgent preoccupation , his biggest continuing job is range management . The Clarks Fork District has forty permittees  --  ranchers or sheepmen who sumrner-graze their stock on federally owned range land . Such grazing privi leges are calculated on a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rancher can summer-graze on public land no more cattle than he can winter on his own land . As winter feeding in this country depends almost entirely on hay , a cattleman 's rights to public-range land depend on his hay-raising potential . The ranches in the district average , probably , 300 acres of patented land . Luckinbill 's function in this setup is to assay periodically the state of the range land , to make reports which can be used by his superiors in Cody and Washington to formulate local policy , and then to allot the grazing rights . His primary concern is , of course , to prevent overgrazing of the range ; his chief worry is to keep everyone involved moderately happy . As most of the district 's ranchers have , by continued use , established priorities over certain areas of range , Lee usually rides these ranges with the interested permittee . After all the range in a given area has been examined , Luckinbill confers with the ranchers and discusses grass conditions and allotments . " That way , everyone knows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been generally reasonable , though of course you occasionally run across an old-timer who was out here back-when and is against anything in which the Government has a hand . But even in the best of circumstances , it 's a situation which calls for tact and understanding on both sides . A ranger who bickers with his permittees can lead a miserable life . " Last year Lee found it necessary to cut grazing on the winter range in the lower end of Sunlight by 20 per cent . This meant taking a month and a half off the cow season on public land , and two and a half months off the horse season  --  and has resulted in a lot or extra bites out of the ranchers ' winter-feed supply . It is at times such as this that a ranger can use whatever diplomacy he brings to the job with him . The bands of sheep which range in the Clarks Fork area are driven in from outside the forest and forage on the lofty table top which forms Beartooth Plateau . The problems involved in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle raisers , and Luckinbill limits his work with the sheepmen to an occasional check of the range . Oddly enough , elk give Lee more range-management problems than those lower-case nibblers , the sheep . In Wyoming , as in other Western states , the wildlife is owned and managed by the state , with co-operation from the Forest Service within the national forests The state authorities regulate the hunting and stock the streams . This makes it unnecessary for the ranger to act as a game warden . Luckinbill is more than satisfied with this arrangement . " We 've got enough to do without worrying about who 's shooting what , when . Matter of fact , the average hunter looks at the ranger as the Law , anyway , so it works out about the same . " Luckinbill 's chief concern with game is to keep tabs on the wildlife which throngs the 300,000-acre North Absaroka Wilderness Area that forms the western half of his district . Counting noses on wild game is really a matter of getting out in the country and keeping your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of herding animals such as elk , deer , moose and antelope , but with some of his wards  --  black bears , grizzlies and mountwin sheep ? Luckinbill has to be satisfied wish an informed guess . The Clarks Fork district went into this winter with approximately 2800 elk living on the countryside . Lee considers that 's at least 800 too many for the area and , in a meeting with the permittees , it was decided to ask the game commission 's co-operation in cutting the elk herds down to size . Elk feed off the same range that supports cattle , and when there are too many elk , it 's bad for the range , the elk and the cattle . In many national-forest areas timber sales keep the ranger and his assistants constantly busy . All cutting in the forests is done on a selective logging basis  --  certain mature , surplus and otherwise expendable trees are marked for cutting and the rest left untouched  --  and this entails a good deal of work in selecting the merchantable trees , scoring them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaling the cut timber so that the sawyer can be billed . Luckinbill has but five small timber-cutting operations in his territory ; he may spend a morning or two a week working sections of timber with his marking ax and scaling logs at the sawmill site . Lee and his immediate superior , Supervisor Ed Miller , of Cody , first discuss proposed sales and decide what sections will be offered for timber sales . During the tourist season Luckinbill keeps an eye on the five public campgrounds in his district , seeing that they are kept clean and that their facilities are in working order . The grader and road crew must be kept at work on the district 's roads during good weather , and the trails examined for windfalls and washouts as often as possible . Keeping a trail crew on the job is difficult these days , so Luckinbill often does some ax work himself when he 's riding the back country . The telephone line is a fairly constant annoyance  --  the poles have been in about ten years now and are beginning to rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which come the ranger 's way . Lee throws up his hands when he tries to enumerate them . " You just ca n't figure out what may come next . We may help a warden pack trout fingerlings up to a high lake or I may check on some cabins someone 's put up for tourists . I may go out looking for a lost hunter or , in the winter , I may help get an emergency case down to Cody to the hospital . Then twice a year , during the early spring , I have to go up into the mountains on snowshoes to read the snow courses . That 's routine , of course , but a ranger seldom knows from one day to the next what he 's going to be called on to do . " Luckinbill made two trips to town last winter after the basin was snowed in , once with a suspected case of appendicitis ( it later turned out to be heart trouble ) and on the second occasion , a week later , with a pneumonia case who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sled , a four-wheel-drive truck and plenty of shoveling got the parties through to Cody in eight hours . Lee has , on several occasions , made the trip by horse in twelve hours . Winter temperatures in the basin range to forty degrees below zero , while drifts on Dead Indian are sometimes ten feet deep and a quarter of a mile long . Luckinbill travels the back country ? which is any place off the two roads in his district  --  as often as possible during open weather . The trips range from overnight to week-long safaris . His account of a routine five-day trip last summer suggests the sort of duties these journeys cover . Though Lee usually travels alone , this particular trip was made in company with the assistant supervisor from Cody . Lee 's older son , nine-year-old Pete , went along for the ride . The party traveled by horse and took a pack mule and two pack horses along . They left Sunlight ranger station on the twenty-eighth of July . " We rode north the first day , classifying range for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber and hit Lodge-pole Trail and followed that out to Crandall , where we stayed the night at the guard station . Next day we went farther north into the Ghost Creek allotment , doing more range inspection  --  we list it in five classifications , from excellent to depleted . That carried us up on to Beartooth Plateau , where we inspected sheep range and redivided some allotments by changing the marker posts around . Camped at Fantan Lake that night . Next day I met a sheep permittee and his herder , by appointment . Looked over his grazing allotment and decided on some changes . " The third night out we also camped at Fantan . When we woke up in the morning  --  this was the last day of July  --  there was five inches of snow on our sleeping bags . That day we in-inspected the fire-tool cache at Bear-tooth Lake and looked over some more sheep range . We spent that night at the Morrison Cow Camp on Beartooth . The following day we moved down to the cattle range , had lunch at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-mile jeep road he 'd just built . We wanted to make sure that it was properlg drained , so that it would n't start erosion . That afternoon we inspected Dead Indian Trail and then looked over the cone crop in a Douglas-fir area . We collect seed there for a Government nursery near Monument , Colorado . After that we looked over some winter range and then completed the circle and arrived back here at the station in time for a good dinner . " Luckinbill does his own cooking on such trips , but he is no green-woods gourmet and he keeps the menu as simple as possible . If it were practical , he 'd probably take all his food ready prepared . Though he likes to fish and travels along some of the world 's best and least-fished trout streams , Luckinbill is not the man to split a still-wet rainbow over a red-hot grill . He does n't Like fish . The horses Luckinbill uses on such trips are his own . Though Clarks Fork is known in the service as a " horse district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts for the Shoshone rangers as yet . This is quite acceptable to Lee , who is a horse fancier and likes to own and break his own riding stock . At present he has nine personal horses . The station also plays host to two Government mules and a Percheron work horse . Lee gets rations for four of his own horses and the Government-owned stock . He figures that his five other animals represent an annual feed bill of eighty dollars each , with pasturage thrown in for free . In addition to the working stock , the district is supplied with four trucks of various sizes  --  none of them less than six years old . The Luckinbills have a personal jeep , which Lee often uses for travel around his district . When on official business he is paid five cents a mile for the jeep . A ranger 's subsistence expenses away from the station come to $2.40 a day within his district and $4.00 a day for town assignments . Luckinbill 's love of horses and his familiarity with the ways of mountain living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally to a man who spent his boyhood on a Colorado ranch . Lee 's folks had a 480-acre cattle ranch in the sand-hill country not far from Greeley , Colorado . After the death of his father  --  when the boy was eight  --  the family moved to Denver and there Lee went through high school . He continued to spend his summers in the country on his uncle 's ranch fifty miles from Denver . " I got to know my first ranger out there at Bailey . His name was Jesse Fitzimmons and he was quite a fellow . I remember Fitz 's wife giving the lowdown on a ranger 's life to a girl in the store one day  --  the young lady had made the mistake of saying that she thought being a ranger 's wife must be very romantic . I listened and still wanted to be a ranger . When I got out of high school in 1930 , my grandparents advanced me some money and I signed up for the forestry course in what is now the Colorado State College . There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forest pathology , lumbering , plant anatomy , dendrology and forest finance . We spent a summer in a school field camp where we did some timber cruising and topographic mapping and made some range studies . We went to one forest fire , I remember , and on the way it rained so hard the gophers were flooded out of their holes . I also remember that our car had no top to it . " After his graduation in 1934 , Luckinbill spent a summer as a CCC foreman Jutztutry 80919 of a crew building trail bridges in the Rocky Mountain National Park . Dui ' ing this period he passed his civil-service examination for the Forest Service and that October he was given his first assignment by the service in the Hal ' ney National Forest in the Black Hills ' Once again he became foreman of a CCC " My starting pay with Forestry Val8 twenty-one hundred dollars . When my permanent appointment came through in December , the salary , due to my changed status , dropped to two thousand . Betty-Rae and I married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was a sophomore in college . Betty-Rae attended Colorado during my last two years . She was more of masetumd student good . " than haoolIwas , so that did n't do At his first post in the Harney , Luckinbill spent most of his time in timber-stand improvement , insect control and roadside cleanup . In July , 1935 , he became forest ranger for the Custer Digtrict of the Harney  --  thus skipping the customary period of apprenticeship to an assistant ranger . The dearth of trained men at that time gave many young rangers a similar opportunity . " My chief job at Custer was timber sales and land use . Most of our traveling there was done in cars . There was a good deal of recreational activity in the forest and we had a lot of fires-1 remember sixteen in one day , seven of them in my district . But those days we had plenty of CCC boys to help fight them . I also remember marking timber at thirty below zero . The wood was so cold it would n't cut ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had a couple of saddle horses and used to do a lot of riding . She 's a Colo- rado Cgoirult  --  os , , B.etty-Rae Baxter ? from The Luckinbills ' first taste of back-country living came in 1937 when Lee was transferred to the South Fork District of the Shoshone . He succeeded ranger who had been burned to death in a forest fire  --  fifteen fire fighters lost their lives in that one blare . The move , as are most ranger transfers , was optional . It carried with it a $200 raise- " South Fork was strictly a hOrse district . I understand that when they were discussing prospects for the move , someone suggested : Let 's send Luckinbill to South Fork ? he 'll get his bellyful of riding horses down there . ' It was a range-and-dude-ranch district of three hundred and twenty-three thousand acres  --  many of those acres being inaccessible to anything but goats . Betty-Rae and I lived at the ranger station forty-five miles south of Cody . You can get in and out of that country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of food after three days .

Since then I 've never ridden while Lee was away from home  --  someone has to be able to look after the children . " Lee 's accident  --  his only serious one in years in the woods ? fortunately ha p ( Conti:am-ft on Page 91 ) ( Continued frana Page 92 ) polled while he was accompanied by another ranger . Chopping wood , he included his big toe with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , the two men rode three miles to the nearest ranch and were driven to the hospital in Cody . With this accident in mind , Lee always leaves a rough plan of his route with Betty-Rae when he goes off on a woods trip alone . Luckinbill added a number of firsts to his backlog of practical experiences during his four-year trick on the South Fork . It was there that he did his first big-game hunting and there that he learned how to throw a diamond hitch and shoe a horse and how to handle snowshoes in the brush . Like most of his woods and range lore , Luckinbill picked up skills as he needed them . As a reserve officer , Lee was called to active duty with the Army in 1941 . He spent four years on domestic duty , part of it as a paratroop captain with the 17th Airborne , and was returned to inactive duty in July , 1945 . Larry was born about the time Lee received his discharge . The following month the Luckinbills reported to their present post in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunlight can be just about what you make it . If you like country living and can get along happily with yourself and your family and a few neighbors for long periods of time , if you can be philosophical about natural inconveniences such as distance and weather , if you 're self-sufficient enough to be content with simple pleasures  --  if , in other words , you have an adjustable disposition  --  it can be a very satisfactory existence . The Luckinbills surely find it so . Though both Betty-Rae and Lee grumble occasionally that Forest Service families are trapped by the very specialization of the job ( and this is true , for there are few other fields in which a Government forester can use his experience and skills ) , they are also ready to admit that the service offers certain perquisites and advantages it would be hard to match in private industry . Not the least of these are the attractive living quarters the Government provides . A comfortable , modern seven-room house with a picture window framing some of the most magnificent scenery in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd to take for thirty dollars a month , the rent the Luckinbills pay the Government . Lee 's present salary ( Ramapeck Act promotions , which bring annual raises of $125 , continued while he was in the service ) is $4605 . The chief burden of living at the end of the road falls on the lady of the house . Betty-Rae , a cheerful , competent young woman who has learned to take things as they come , knows most of the tricks by now . During good weather the Luckinbills shop in Cody about once a week  --  though Betty-Rae can avoid the trip by simply phoning in her order and having it delivered with the mail . About the middle of September the family goes to town in one of the trucks and Betty-Rae lays in an eight-month supply of staples and a stock of simple medicines , including sulfa drugs . Because Sunlight Basin is too high to permit successful gardening , the Luckinbills rely on canned vegetables during the winter months . Elk , kept through from the fall hunting season in the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat dish . Young elk tastes like an excellent grade of beef . Milk and cream come from a neighboring ranch . Betty-Rae cooks on a modern coal stove , has an electric refrigerator and the usual line of household gadgets . The coal furnace , which Betty-Rae minds when Lee is away on field trips , burns twenty tons of lump coal ( and produces " forty tons of ashes " ) a winter . She also takes care of the horses on such occasions . Though many urbanites would be horrified at the thought of living so far from municipal services and medical help , Betty-Rae points out that , at least as far as the children are concerned , she probably has fewer worries than a city housewife . There is little traffic and no juvenile delinquency in Sunlight . The Luckinbills , a healthy family , dose themselves through their minor ailments . Though bears have been known to rummage around the garbage pit , they never bother their human neighbors , and the occasional elk or moose that appears on the lower range is spectacular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belled him , so that he could be traced if he wandered into the willow thickets along the creek ; now the young fellow , usually accompanied by the Luckinbills ' two dogs , wanders around wherever his fancy leads him . The local school  --  one of the three pupils is the schoolteacher 's son  --  is two miles down the road ; Pete takes his lunch and commutes back and forth on Freckles , a sedate old lady who could have cast her first vote in the last elections . The Luckinbills have five rancher-neighbors within several miles of the ranger station . During the summer , two of these outfits run dudes ; these visitors , plus the comings and goings of the various seasonal workers on IA-e 's staff , make for a good deal of activity during the open-weather months . After the vacationers have gone and the smoke chasers and fire guards have departed , life quiets down . The first snow flurries come drifting into the basin during early October , the surrounding peaks and ridges take on a powder of white , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun-lighters settle down for the long hard winter . From then on , the Luckinbills ' social life is limited to their own hearth-side and to occasional games of penny ante with the more accessible of their neighbors . On such visits the two boys usually take along their sleeping bags and bed down in a spare room or , if the weather is mild enough , in the back of the jeep . During the long winter evenings at home , Lee likes to work in his basement shop , where he has a few power tools and makes very commendable furniture . Lee gets a twenty-six-day annual vacation . The Luckinbills usually take this during the off season while the roads are still open , and divide the time between their families and a.visit to Denver . Last year Lee put asele.e week of his vacation for a hunting tile during which he acted as guide for a Sheridan dentist .

Later in the season , Luckinbill brought home an ells for winter eating . As one of approximately 800 rangers scattered through this country 's 15 ? national forests , Luckinbill now enjoys a seniority ( and a good record ) which , will probably qualify him for the pot. ? of assistant supervisor sometime within the next four or five years . This would mean a base in town and administrative work over an area embracing four or five ranger districts . The Luckinbills are n't sure whether they 'd welcome such a change or not  --  though by that time schooling for Pete may be , 7 more of a problem . Beyond an assistant supervisor 's post  --  which would care with it the same relative pay grades as those enjoyed by the rangers  --  would come the job of supervisor and a step into the executive hierarchy of the Forest Service . Supervisors , depending upon their length of service , make from $6000 to $7000 a year . The possibilities of advancement are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-service families they have learned to await promotions with patience . What interests both Lee , and Betty-Rae more is the future ? , ' their domain . Irate Sunlighters , angere by the state and Federal Government refusal to keep the roads to the outer I world open last winter , sent petitions and ultimatums to both the governor and the chief forester . If some attempt to open the roads is not made this winter , Sunlighters threaten to secede from Wyoming . And perhaps from the national forest . It suggests an interesting possibility  --  Luckinbill may find him " self a forest ranger without a forest or a range over which to rule .
