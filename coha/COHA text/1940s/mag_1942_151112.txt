Like it or not , Adolf Hitler had to write off his winter campaign as a dead loss . For last week was the sixth of German retreat in Russia . <P> Red Armies assaulted Axis positions before Murmansk so fiercely that even the Berlin radio conceded retirement of German forces to new positions . Around Leningrad , Russia readied the offensive that would relieve the siege of her second city . South of Moscow Germans had been pushed back in some places more than 120 miles , and their newest stand , on a line from Bryansk to Vyazma , was breached . In the Crimea , having recaptured the naval base of Sevastopol , Russian troops threatened to reclaim the entire peninsula . A Soviet communiqu reported wholesale German surrenders on the Eastern Front . <P> What Was Wrong ?

But German aerial operations over Russia dwindled to the merest trickle . Tanks and trucks , oil frozen , bogged in the deep snow and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Dec. 10 , after the second Moscow offensive , the Hamburg Fremdenblatt said that German winter quarters were being established on an arcing line , running roughly from Leningrad to Smolensk to Orel to Kharkov to Odessa , in an area embracing excellent north-south rail communications . Subsequent German dispatches termed it " a loose network of strong points-an elastic winter line . " By last week the winter-quarters alibi was wearing thin . The Germans would have to hump if winter quarters were to be established before warm weather .
