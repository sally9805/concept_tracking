James Caesar Petrillo , swarthy son of a ditchdigger , profane boss of the American Federation of Musicians , has been the Mussolini of Music in the U.S. for 20 years . His 130,000 dues-paying union fledglings pay him an annual salary of $46,000-plus , to be " protected " from the competition of amateurs . ( Once , when eight Chinese Boy Scouts wanted to hail the arrival of a giant panda in Chicago with a fanfare of bugle blasts , Tsar Petrillo insisted that eight paid union musicians be hired as well . ) <P> Last week Protector Petrillo-who spent nine years in getting through four grades in a Chicago grammar school-perpetrated his newest outrage in the name of labor . Twenty-two hours before the National High School Orchestra was to begin its thirteenth season of NBC concerts from Interlochen , Mich. , Dictator Petrillo ordered NBC to cancel the broadcasts . The 160 boys &; girls in the orchestra , who had asked their parents in 40 States to listen in on their radio debut , are not professional musicians , hence can not play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Dr. Joseph E. Maddy , president of Interlochen 's National Music Camp , was shocked but helpless . The camp , a nonprofit organization , accepts many pupils on scholarships , has , in its 14 years , furnished competent musicians to many symphony orchestras . The weekly summer broadcasts have been a sustaining feature for twelve years . Dr. Maddy , who boasts an A.F.M. membership for 33 years , " longer than Caesar Petrillo , " argued that the high-school musicians , even if they wanted to join the A.F.M. , would be ineligible because of youth . Said Dr. Maddy : " The broadcasts have created thousands of new listeners to classical music . " <P> Next week , or soon after July 31 , the U.S. would begin to suffer from another Petrillo edict : henceforth musicians may make no recordings for juke boxes-a move which might well stop the recording of all popular music ( TIME , June 22 ) .
