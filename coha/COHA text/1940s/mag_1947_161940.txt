The Department of Agriculture reached into the nation 's sugar bowl last week and pulled out some sweet news for housewives . The allotment for civilian users in the third quarter of 1947 will be raised to 1,970,000 tons , some 350,000 more than in the same period last year . To speed up sugar distribution , the department announced that 1 ) sugar stamp 12 , which originally was to become valid July 1 , could be used immediately , and 2 ) another stamp for ten pounds-bringing the year 's total ration so far up to 35 pounds per user-will be validated Aug. 1 . " If recent improvements continue , " it added , " a moderate increase above the 35-lb. figure is in prospect . " <P> Did this mean that sugar is so plentiful it might be decontrolled before Oct. 31 ? This week the Senate began to consider a bill to end sugar rationing immediately . But the Department of Agriculture has not committed itself on the bill . Its chief concern is to get housewives to buy sugar for canning now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to move the bumper wheat crop later . <P> Nevertheless , there is more sugar on hand than at any time in the last four years , thanks chiefly to a bumper Cuban crop of 6.1 million tons . In all , the U.S. expects to get 6.8 million tons of sugar , or almost half of this year 's total world sugar supply of 15 million tons . The U.S. share is 1.4 million tons more than last year . The supply , enough for 85 to 90 pounds per capita , will still be short of the prewar consumption of 96.5 Ibs. , and sugar men think that present demand is enough to push consumption up to 100 Ibs. if consumers could get all the sugar they want . So even if rationing is maintained until the Oct. 31 deadline , the sugar industry expects retail prices to jump when free trading is restored .
