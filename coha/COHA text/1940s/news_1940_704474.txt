txt Oliver Iron Mining Co. , subsidiary of the United States Steel Corp .. has sold approximately 150.000 tons of iron ore to the Ford Motor Co . While the price has not become known , it is the general impression that it was in the neighborhood of $3.75 a ton , involving a total of $562,500 . Thus , the Ford sale apparently was made at a concession of $1.20 a ton from the $4.95 a ton quotation which has been recognized as the regular market on ore of 51% to 53% iron content heretofore , and has , consequently , broken a price which had held for some time . Of even greater importance , however , is the fact that the sale indicates conclusively a new policy by United States Steel in selling in the open market excess production , not only of ore . but of other raw materials used in the steel industry . This is a radical departure from the practice heretofore , as United States Steel in its ore activities in the past produced only for its own subsidiaries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ore for blending purposes Lower Ore Prices The result of this sale by Oliver is likely to have considerable influence in the making of steel . Companies which are compelled to purchase or from independent companies will naturally get a lower ore price and thus bring about a reduction in the cost of producing steel . It is estimated , however , that at best the lower cost will amount to less than $1 a ton of steel . Independent mining interests charge that the breaking of the ore price may result in new price competition in the steel industry However . this view is not shared by steel interests , who insist that the ore action is independent of the steel market , with the exception of the slightly lowered cost per ton of production , and competition in the future , as in the past , will depend upon conditions within the steel industry Itself . It is considered certain that future open market transactions in iron ore will be at quotations more in line with that paid by the Ford company . and while it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered doubtful that a steel company buying ore at this time will pay more than $4 a tom at the most . Adjustment of Contracts A number of steel companies have contracts with independent mining companies which have some time to run . The result will be that such contracts will be adjusted to the average pri , . e ruling on transactions in the open market at the lower lake ports Independent ore mining interests sre disturbed over the new situation . It is assertrt that to sell at $3 75 a ton . the companies must be in a position to mine the ore at a price n1 around $1.90 a ton . from which must be paid mining Costa , taxes . royalties. etc .. if the $1. s5 a ton transportation charge is maintained It is problematical whether some of the properties can produce at that figure . One result will be a reduction in the profits of the ore mining companies . Some authorities assert that open pit mines can make a small profit at a $3 75 a ton price . providing the //lacy* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underground miner however . will not be able to earn expenses . taxes . royalties and other costs , unless there is a reduction in the transportation charger from the mines to the lower lake ports , including Cleveland and Detroit . At present it is estimated that there is a the tonnage underground and that extracted The freight rate , rail and boat , amounts to $1.86 a ton , of which the water carrier receives b6 cents a ton . As the latter is not under control of the Interstate Commerce Commission it is probable that the first pressure for a transportation cut will be against the shipping interests . Some of the mining companies have to a royalty of 25 cents a ton on the ore taken nut . Others . including the Oliver company . are believed to have a royalty of as little as 10 cents per ton , and these charges also must come out of the new selling price Oliver Shaded Other Offers Advices from Detroit state that two of the smaller independent ore mining companies had offered the For*oompany a cut of $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the later quotation by the Oliver company shaded this figure and secured the business . That the Oliver Iron Mining Co was about to enter the market as a seller was indicated recently when an advertisement appeared in a Duluth mining publication offering iron ore for sale . Previously the United States Steel subsidiary was not a factor in the so-called open ore marketFor a long time there have been charges of collusion in ore prices among so-called smaller independent mining interests . Thus the action of the Oliver company may be considered the first break in the situation and could result in the elimination of any further assertions that ore quotations are being artificially maintained .
