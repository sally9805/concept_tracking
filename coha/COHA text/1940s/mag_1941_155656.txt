THE LAST TYCOON-F . Scott Fitzgerald - Scrlbner ( $2.75 ) . <P> When Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald , aged 44 , died of heart disease in Hollywood last winter ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) , he left part of a novel which he had been pondering for three years , and a voluminous pile of notes on the unwritten part of the story . There was some talk , then , of having another writer complete the novel from the notes . But Critic Edmund Wilson , friend of Fitzgerald and his " intellectual conscience , " chose another way to get this truncated work before the public . <P> The Last Tycoon contains 128 pages of completed manuscript , covering a little more than half the story contemplated by the author ; a synopsis of the rest ; a selection from the notes , a letter to the publishers , some fragmentary scenes . To give bulk to the volume the publishers also reprinted in it The Great Gatsby and five Fitzgerald short stories . <P> In his foreword , Critic Wilson states his belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , that Hero Monroe Stahr was the most thoroughly explored of all Fitzgerald characters . Stahr was an executive and creative genius of motion pictures , a " boy wonder " at 22 , later boss and three-quarters owner of a big studio . Under him the movies reached a sort of golden age . After him the industry grew too complicated for one man to keep his hand on everything in a studio . Stahr " had flown up very high to see , on strong wings , when he was young . And while he was up there he had looked on all the kingdoms , with the kind of eyes that can stare straight into the sun . " He had chosen a kingdom in the west where he saw a " new way of measuring our jerky hopes and graceful rogueries and awkward sorrows . " There he had everything except leisure and someone he could love . <P> One night after an earthquake Stahr found a girl who was almost a replica of his dead wife , and they were shortly having an atmospheric affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Stahr , the girl married another man . Stahr , no drinker , got dismally drunk . Fitzgerald 's manuscript stops at that point . The synopsis , and notes carry the tale down to Stahr 's death in an airplane crash , and its curious aftermath . <P> If Monroe Stahr was the last Hollywood tycoon , F. Scott Fitzgerald was the last U.S. romantic . To the end his writing was preoccupied with flowers , perfume , rain , the rustle of women 's clothes , warm darkness and music in the night . He sometimes deliberately blurred his narrative line , resulting now in effective suspense , now in mere teasing . Yet this fragment contains scenes of beauty and power . Completed , it might or might not have been a Citizen Kane about the movie industry .
