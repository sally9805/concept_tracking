Fermi Says Scientists Are Sane <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Dec. 3 under Science , you imply that U.S. scientists are a group of madmen who are itching to exterminate life on earth in order to prove their theories . The possibility of an uncontrollable , disastrous chain reaction has been carefully considered , and there is no known or foreseeable way of starting one . Furthermore , your statement that Dr. Fermi bet that the New Mexico test would end in worldwide disaster is completely false . <P> We need only point out that in a development so new and so dangerous , in which many thousands of people were involved , only one fatal casualty occurred , aside from ordinary industrial accidents . As a matter of record , it has been stated officially that every possible consideration was given to all conceivable dangers of every step in the development and use of nuclear bombs and other chain reactions . This is true in any potentially hazardous research undertaking . Where calculated risks were taken , the extent of the worst conceivable damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science is to extend our knowledge and thereby our control of the forces of nature . The whole history of civilization is witness to the compelling necessity of this process . Any danger to mankind lies in the destructive use of discoveries which could have been used for its benefit . It does not lie in the discoveries themselves , least of all in the possibility that they may get physically out of control as you suggest in your article . . . . <P> <P> ENRICO FERMI and <P> The Executive Committee Association of Los Alamos Scientists Santa Fe , N. Mex . <P> <P> TIME , which wondered why there were no takers for such a bet ( what could they lose ? ) , is glad to be reassured that U.S. scientists are not really mad-just very , very inquisitive. - ED . <P> <P> The World v. The Bomb <P> Sirs : <P> ... In the atomic bomb all the nations , all the people of the earth have a mutual enemy . This enemy is an inanimate object that can not be fought with men 's lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newfound age is what will be used to unite the world . . . . To get flowery-the atomic bomb is the long awaited antagonist against which the world , a United World , will be the protagonist . <P> MAYNARD W. KENDALL Ensign , U.S.N.R. c/o Fleet Post Office San Francisco <P> Not Atom but Adam <P> Sirs : <P> I submit that the problem is not the control of Atom but of Adam . We do not stand in terror of a thing but of ourselves . In this subterfuge of speaking about the Atom we simply give credence to the words of Jeremiah : The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked . <P> <P> GILBERT A. JENSEN <P> Chaplain , U.S.N.R. <P> Mayport , Fla . <P> A Humanitarian Jap <P> Sirs : <P> While atrocities committed by the Japanese are being brought to light , why not also give tribute to some of our former enemies who proved themselves humanitarians ? They are probably slightly harder to find , but they still exist . I , a former war prisoner , can vouch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
