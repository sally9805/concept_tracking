Some people said that vindictive old John L. Lewis itched to hotfoot the Administration on Nov. 5 . Some said that crafty old John L. Lewis wanted to get a wage oar in for his United Mine Workers before the rival C.I.O. began its new race for raises . Still others said that , after five months of relative personal anonymity ( while his U.M.W. grubbed along on its Government contract ) , egomaniacal old <P> John L. just had to see himself in headlines again-even if he had to take on the Government to do it . <P> For once , every guess seemed to be close . Despite the generous terms of the contract handed him by Interior Secretary " Cap " Krug last May , Lewis found sudden fault with it last week . The whole agreement , he growled , would have to be reopened on or before Nov. i . And if not re-opened by then , said John L. , the U.M.W. would consider itself without a contract . Everybody knew that that meant a strike ; to the miners , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic as their breathing . <P> The Lewis timing could not have been more fiendish . Cap Krug , electioneering on the West Coast , hurriedly denied Lewis ' charge that Government " misinterpretations " of the contract had cost the miners " millions . " Then he bluntly told the great stentor that the meeting would have to wait until after election day . <P> But in Washington , harassed Harry Truman paled at the thought of what an election-eve coal strike might mean in votes , or what capitulation to Lewis might do to his vanishing prestige . Then he made his decision - the Administration boat must not be rocked again , not by so much as a millimeter . Promptly , Cap Krug changed his tune , agreed that November 1 would be fine for the meeting .
