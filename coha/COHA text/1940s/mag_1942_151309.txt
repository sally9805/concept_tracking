The Vichy Government , not knowing who will win the war , remains a split personality . Until something decisive happens , Vichy does well to keep its aching head . <P> Last week Pierre Laval , slickest collaborationist of them all , talked again with Marshal Henri Philippe Ptain in Randan forest , where they met last fortnight ( TIME , April 6 ) . There were the same rumors that Laval brought Adolf Hitler 's demands and threats , insisted that the Riom trials be stopped. * Diplomatic circles also heard that Laval appealed to Ptain 's friendship by telling him , truly or falsely , that an arch-collaborationist coup d ' tat was being planned in Paris . Afterward Laval reminded the press that it was he who had instigated French with Germany and announced that his talks with Ptain had ended . These remarks may have meant that Laval had been warded off by the old Marshal , who is still stalling for time and events . <P> The U.S. last week recognized the Free French administrative control of French Equatorial Africa and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Free French in New Caledonia . The U.S. was obviously hearing the eloquence of General Charles de Gaulle . In London he sharply reminded the Allies that , while Hitler might not yet have the French Empire and Navy , Vichy 's policy in neutralizing them had given Hitler a protective screen in northwest Africa and the Mediterranean . Continuing in a belligerent mood , General de Gaulle said : " Fighting France intends to go forward with her allies on the express condition that her allies go forward with her . . . . Who could . . . continue to keep French territories , French forces and French ideas in the battle , and even add to them , if the Allies themselves did not give them their wholehearted support ? . . . " <P> Vichy heard this eloquence , too , and it increased Vichy 's schizophrenic headache . <P> <P> * They were-ostensibly for two weeks , perhaps for good &; all .
