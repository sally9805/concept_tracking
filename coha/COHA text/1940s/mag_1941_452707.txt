FIVE years ago Margaret Leech began collecting from letters , diaries , old newspapers , and memoirs every scrap of information about life in our national capital at the time of the Civil War . Her true narrative begins in December 1860 when General Scott limped into town to suppress the sedition openly threatening that Lincoln would never live to be President . Southerners held key posts in the Army and Navy ; with their thoroughbreds , their mansions , and their slaves , they had turned Washington into a Southern town . To this place of uncertainty and suspicion came the President-elect . A horde of Westerners followed him ? office seekers and men loyal to the Union , to replace the Southerners . After the attack on Sumter , Southern sympathizers cut the wires and tore up the rails , and for a few days the capital lived in dread of invasion . To its rescue came the regiments of the North , storming through rebellious Baltimore , landing by ship at Annapolis , striding up the Avenue with bands playing and flags flying . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Virginia . But before he marched his exact plans had been passed through the lines by a spy , Mrs. Greenhow . All Washington turned out to see the spandy regiments in their first engagement ; but the picnic parties joined the frightened rabble when the Union forces broke and swirled back in sullen retreat . Desperately in need of a new leader , Lincoln telegraphed to McClellan in the 1 Vest . While McClellan prepared the Army of the Potomac for its long ordeal on the Peninsula , Washington entertained the hopes and fears of the nation . For one hectic day the Merrimac threatened to destroy the Federal Navy . Then it met the Monitor , and that fear subsided . The charming Southern spies ? Mrs. Greenhow , Mrs. Phillips , and their associates ? were rounded up by Pinkerton 's men and interned in the dreary Old Capitol . The country , confident of its new army , chafed at McClellan 's delay . At last , at , Lincoln 's insistence , he moved south to lay siege to Yorktown . But from the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that McClellan , with his army of 100,000 , had been outfought and outgeneraled during the Seven Days . As the fever-stricken and wounded men were shipped back to Washington , the city suddenly awoke to the fact that it had neither nurses nor doctors nor hospitals enough . The cull went out for volunteers ? surgeons and doctors ? and , privately , for a better general . . . . REVEILLE IN WASHINGTON : 1860-1865 BY MARGARET LEECH XXVI AFTER the second battle of Bull Run , President Lincoln asked McClellan to take command of Washington and of the troops falling back on it from the front . In the great emergency there was no one else to choose . Hafleck had gone to pieces . Pope 's gasconade was over . It was McClellan or chaos . There is no man in the army , ' Lincoln said , ' who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he . ' The incapacity of the Union commanders was a scandal over which Cabinet members shook their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which instilled a defensive policy , and , quite overlooking Lee and Jackson , declared that ' no efficient , energetic , audacious , fighting , commanding general had yet appeared from that institution . ' Montgomery Blair blamed Stanton for the defects of the generals , and said that he should not give way to narrow prejudices and personal dislikes , but should search out good officers ? ' should dig up these jewels . ' ? The reputation of the soldiers of the East , as well as of the officers , was blighted . The ranks of the veterans were thinned , not only by death and wounds and capture , but by the dark contagion of desertion . Exhaustion and hunger and loss of faith had demoralized thousands of the soldiers . They flooded back in disorder on the Alexandria road , flopped down to rest , indifferent to the tumult of the retreating infantry and cavalry , artillery and wagons . Their great fires illuminated the whole country side . Across the bridges they crowded into the capital , congregating in low groggeries and staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officers , absent from their commands , were rounded up in Washington hotels and other public places in ' such general hauls . . . as the police of New York are at times compelled to make of the inmates of the notable dance houses . ' Washington saw the dead beats ' and the shirking officers , and believed that they represented the armies of the Union . Monotonously , every day , the new incoming volunteers lined up at , the depot . One morning the Soldiers ' Retreat fed over seven thousand men . ' We are coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more . ' Into a soured and despairing city they brought their awkwardly held rifles , their inexperienced faces that had never looked on war . For over a week the wounded came back to Washington by train and boat and in vehicles of every description . The provost guard commandeered private carriages for service between the wharves and depot and the hospitals . To the consternation of the State Department , the Prussian Minister , Baron Gerolt , was unceremoniously deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to prevent diplomatic incidents , Frederick Seward hastened to get safeguards for all the foreign ministers 3 75 from Wadsworth . A horrified sergeant rode up in time to rescue the President 's barouche , stopped by one of the troopers . Lincoln said that the man was doing his duty . Meanwhile Lee 's army appeared to have withdrawn . Rumors came that it was crossing the upper Potomac . The President , consumed with anxiety to find and hurt the enemy , ordered Hal-leek on September 3 to organize an army immediately for active operations . Hal-leek passed the word along to McClellan . That week McClellan performed some-I ling very like a miracle . In the camps and fortifications , the broken brigades seemed to re-form by magic . This had been a conglomeration of soldiers . When McClellan spoke the word , it was an army . Its organization was imperfect , its clothing , ammunition , and supplies were all in sad condition . No commander over had more excuse for saying that his men were not ready to fight ; but for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection not attainable in human enterprise . He took command on Tuesday . On Thursday ho threw out the advance of his force to the north . On Friday the army marched . Every reduced brigade had its iron column of fighting men . With the tendrils of home and family and staid ' ambitions quick about them , they had learned to subdue their strongest traditions and yield uncritical obedience to an arbitrary command . Scarred by war and weather , with their bleached and scanty uniforms and their dirty , shredded flags , they wore a look of hard utility . Their collars had been wilted in the sweat of the Chickahominy , leggings and gaiters had littered the Peninsula from Mechanicsville to Malvern Hill . Men marched in shirt sleeves or blue blouses , open at the throat , with trousers rolled at the ankle and tucked into gray woolen socks . There were worn-out caps of every style , and hats of straw and of palm leaf , of brown and black and soiled white wool . The trappings of the officers ' horses no longer glittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by common metal , and the crimson sashes were faded or gone . It was a shabby and seasoned army that brought the gaping citizens to the pavements . The troops did not . pass the White House , but turned into Street , to cheer McClellan lustily as they went by his house . McClellan had been expressly informed that his command was confined to the troops defending Washington . Burnside , again offered the active command , had for a second time declined it , The Army of the Potomac was advancing on Lee 's forces without a leader . McClellan prepared to follow his men . Halleck said that the President told McClellan to take command in the field . Lincoln said that the responsibility was Halleck 's . There was no written order , and McClellan affirmed that he received no directions at all . He thought that , in the excited state of feeling in the capital , he might well be condemned to death if the army were defeated . Firmly and promptly he made his decision ; but sonic puerility in his nature persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a gentleman leaving a town where he has been hospitably received , he inscribed on three of his visiting cards the initials , P. P. C. ? ' Pour prendre conc . ' With his staff and personal escort , he rode on Sunday to the White House , the War Office , and Seward 's house , and left a card at each . XXVII On September 15 , Washington had news of a victory at South Mountain , a spur of the Blue Ridge , beyond which Lee 's army was massed . The hotels , public offices , and promenades were filled with smiling Unionists , and ' McClellan stock went up generally . ' In the evening a large crowd gathered before the bulletin board at the Star office . When a man said that he wanted the news confirmed , for ' McClellan was no // more reliable than Pope , ' he was struck instantaneous blows on each side of the head by two bystanders . ' Divil take the man who would say a word agin ' McClellan after hearing that news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days later there was furious fighting at Sharpsburg , along the Antietam Creek . There , in the golden air of September , for fourteen hours the armies contended ; and at the close of day twenty thousand men from North and South lay dead and wounded in the narrow country lanes , the ripe cornfields , and the laden orchards . McClellan claimed a great victory ? ' a masterpiece of art . ' Lee called it a drawn battle . The losses of the Union were a little the heavier . But the tide of gray rolled back from Maryland , and the North went wild with joy . Lee 's army made its escape into Virginia . McClellan did not follow . His thirst for battle had been quenched in the blood of Antietam . He had learned to fight aggressively , but he could not pursue or destroy . After South Mountain he had received a telegram , signed Winfield Scott . ' Bravo , my dear general ! ' it ran ; ' twice more and it 's done . ' But once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach between McClellan and the government widened , His partisans included not only patriotic members of the Democratic Party but peace advocates , soreheads with a grudge against the administration , and secession sympathizers . He was being spoken of as the Democratic nominee for President in 1864 . The military proclamation of emancipation which the President issued that month was said to have awakened great dissatisfaction among McClellan 's soldiers . There was a story that he did not pursue the enemy because it was not ' the game ' to destroy the rebel army and end the war , but rather to bring about a compromise settlement which should preserve the institution of slavery . The President traced the report to a major , who was the brother of one of McClellan 's staff officers , and personally examined and dismissed him from the service as an example . The President sent McClellan orders to cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy or drive him south . McClellan did not obey . For six weeks the Army of the Potomac lay in Maryland . The country groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the State ballot boxes gave a verdict adverse to the administration . The President repeatedly begged , persuaded , and ordered McClellan to advance . McClellan said that the army was not ready . It was true that his soldiers were in need ? like those of General Lee , though not so sorely ? of shoes , , blankets , clothing , horses , and camp equipment . McClellan 's mood was one of proud , dark , brooding resentment . His communications with Stanton and Halleek were few and rigidly formal . He regarded himself as the savior of his country , who should be spared interference . Much of his time was spent in controversies with the quartermaster 's department over his supplies ? those supplies that he had been able to forget in his great phase of resolution in September . At last he got his army across the Potomac . Moving east of the Blue Ridge , it marched slowly down to Warrenton . Lee was at Winchester . The road to Richmond was open to the Fed-orals . A committee of patriotic ladies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introverted look end Isis half-staggering gait . ' He shook their hands mechanically . He could give them no encouragement , he told them . There was agony ahead for the people , and they were not prepared for it . The army did not realize that they were in a terrible war that had to be fought out . General Lee brought his army through the passes of the Blue Ridge , and occupied Culpeper Court-House , between he Army of the Potomac and Richmond . For Mr. Lincoln it was the deciding factor . On November 7 , General Catharinus P. Buckingham , Stanton 's confidential assistant . adjutant-general , took a journey by special train on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad . He did not go direct to McClellan 's headquarters , but made his way through a heavy snowstorm to Burnside 's camp . After all , Burnside was the only jewel that the War Department was able to dig up . For the third time the command of the Army of the Potomac was offered to him ? it was in the form of an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarters the November gale whirled the snowflakes . In the thick white twilight he made his reluctant decision to obey , and rode with Buckingham to McCiellan 's tent .. The two officers stood watching while McClellan read the order which relieved him of command . He made no sign while they were there . ' Alas for my poor country ! ' he wrote his wife when they were gone . In all that stricken and saddened army , the most unhappy man was its new commander . McClellan pitied him . He thought ? or so he later said ? that his old friend was not competent to command more than a regiment . Of his own incapacity , Burnside had no doubt . Ile was an honest . man , cinch he went about telling the other officers that he was not fit for the posit ion . McClellan declared that there were hotheads in the army who were in favor of his refusing to obey the order , who wanted to march on Washington to take possession of the government . But. , if revolution might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never spoke that word . For a few days he remained at his headquarters , helping Burnside with his arrangements . Then he bade farewell to his troops and quietly took his departure . He had been directed to go to Trenton to await orders . There had been no military operations around Trentonsince that icy December morning of 1770 when General Washington had marched from the Delaware to capture a thousand Hessians there . Stanton was not a man much given to smiling , but surely his Cupid's-bow tipper lip must have widened over his abundant whiskers when he contemplated that order . XXVIII Washington , which had been a camp , had been transformed into a hospital ? the vast base hospital of the Army of the Potomac . Clusters of white buildings and tents had changed the aspect of the city and its surrounding hills . The E Street Infirmary , destroyed by fire in the autumn of 1861 , had been replaced by the rectangular pavilions of the new Judiciary Square Hospital . Stanton Hospital , at New Jersey Avenue and I Street , was another modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansions of Douglas , Breckinridge , and Rice now constituted Douglas Hospital . Lincoln and Emory Hospitals were being constructed on the plain to the east of the Capitol . Near the Smithsonian , beside the open sewer of the canal , lay the clean , parallel sheds of the great Armory Square Hospital , conveniently accessible from the Maryland Avenue depot and the wharves . On the distant heights long one-story buildings , lavishly whitewashed and encircled by huts and tents , seemed to bloom like monstrous flowers in the soft light . In Washington , as well as in Georgetown and Alexandria , sick and wounded men lay in hotels and warehouses , in private houses , schools , and seminaries , and the lodges of fraternal orders . On Independence Day of 1862 , it had been observed that the church bells could not be rung because of the suffering that lay beneath them . The seizure of the churches had begun in June , when an officer of General Wadsworth waited on the rectors of Trinity , the Ascension , and the Epiphany , three edifices which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least inconvenience to loyal worshipers . Carpets , cushions , and hymnbooks were packed away . Carpenters covered the pews with scantling on which floors were laid , and the pulpits and other furniture were stowed underneath . The mains were tapped to supply water for kitchens established in the basement , or in hastily constructed outbuildings . Presently appeared wagonloads of furniture , drugs , and utensils . The flag of the Union was run up . Wardmasters , nurses , orderlies , cooks , and stewards arrived . Ambulances began to stop at the church doors . Last of all came the surgeons , with their knives and saws and dirty little sponges . Since the preceding year the Patent Office had been used as a hospital . One thousand more beds were placed on the second floor and on the gallery which ran around the lofty hall . At night , in the glare of the gaslight , it was a curious scene . Like some new exhibit of ghastliness , waxy faces lay in rows between the shining glass cabinets , filled with curiosities , foreign presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels clicked on the marble floor , and over all lay the heavy smell of putrefaction and death . Yet , as the wounded came in from Pope 's campaign , there was still not room enough . Georgetown College was turned into a hospital ; so was the H Street mansion of the rebel sympathizer , Mr. Corcoran . At last it was found necessary to make a temporary requisition of the Capitol , and two thousand cots were placed in the halls of the House and Senate , in the corridors and the Rotunda . The sick of the early regiments and the beaten stragglers of First Bull Run had been charitably treated . Ladies whose hearts were with the Southern cause joined their Northern sisters in sewing and picking lint for the wounded . As the hospitals multiplied in the capital , so did the visitors who came to tend the soldiers and to bring them presents . These ministrations were not invariablywelcome . The hospital doors were wide open , not only to relatives and friends and the agents of relief organizations , but to any strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick . Others wearied them with impertinent questions . Even desperately ill men were not protected from the intrusions of the tactless and the curious . When wounded prisoners began to be sent to Washington from the Peninsula , the more virulent secessionist ladies made themselves a nuisance . To the irritation of doctors and attendants , they strolled through the wards casting freezing looks at the Union cots , while they showered the rebels with flowers , fruits , and clothing . The constant civilian inspection served the purpose of advertising the defects of the institutions . The shortcomings of old hotels and schoolhouses , of churches and public buildings , were glaringly apparent to the most casual caller . The renovated barracks were dark and badly ventilated , and usually lacked municipal conveniences , while their grounds , particularly those of the cavalry barracks , were filthy . Moreover the administration of the hospitals left much to be desired . There was no trained personnel on which to draw . Where institutions were hastily improvised , it was inevitable that some surgeons should be careless and incompetent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost as soon as the Washington hospitals opened their doors their abuses became a scandal , to be exposed and deplored by public-spirited citizens . The new and scientifically planned pavilions were popularly admired . It could not have occurred to anyone that a generation later their fine operating rooms would be considered abominable places . They were scrubbed and odorless . There was running water . Large mahogany boxes held the instruments ; and the heavy centre table was covered with a freshly wiped rubber cloth . But asepsis was not understood . The surgeon deleted material // Lion of Grace Church , coming to worship , took one look at the figures on the pew cushions and dispersed to bring a fresh supply of food and drink . This was an exceptional case of neglect , and resulted in the doctor 's dismissal from the service ; but delays and maladjustments were unending . By ship , as well as by train , the Nand received the wreckage of the army in Virginia . Throughout June , hospital ships had come up from the Peninsula . In July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Seven Days . Crowds gathered at the Sixth and Seventh Street wharves to see the men carried from the ships and loaded on the ambulances . At night there were fewer spectators . In the flaring light of the torches , the workers of the Sanitary Commission moved about the sheds where coffee and beef soup steamed in cauldrons . The watchman 's hoarse voice cried , ' Steamers in sight ! ' Through the mist loomed the white top-heavy shape of a great river boat . In silence , like a ghost ship , it moved alongside the wharf . There were no lights , no figures at the rails , no stir of arrival or greeting . The passengers lay on the decks , in the cabins and the saloons , even on the stairs and the gangway . The light of the relief workers ' candles flickered on beseeching eyes , for these men were pitifully afraid of being stepped on . The business of transferring them to the ambulances went on quietly . There were a few groans . Now and then a man screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers were as silent as their companions who lay with covered faces in the bow . The ghost ship moved on , to make way for another . All night the ambulances rattled out to the hills beyond the city . XXIX Often , when at long last he lay in a quiet bed , the wounded soldier opened his eyes on a strange apparition ? the figure of a woman . The example of Miss Florence Nightingale in the Crimea had made seemly the presence of ladies in hospitals devoted to men . In June of 1861 , Miss Dorothea L. Dix of Massachusetts had been appointed Superintendent of Women Nurses , with authority to select and assign them to the military hospitals . Miss Dix had for many years been engaged in public work . She had devoted her life to lunatics paupers , and prisoners . By her revelations of the inhumane conditions in almshouses and jails , particularly in the treatment of the insane , she had brought about reforms , influenced legislation , and enlarged the social consciousness of the nation . All this she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement . She had a low , sweet voice . The knot of hair seemed too heavy for the gentle head set on a long neck . But her mouth and chin were firm , and her blue-gray eyes could dilate with holy indignation . Her reputation cast a final respectability over the position of female nurse ; and on the news of her appointment applications flooded into Washington , while many young women came in person to offer their services . The majority of these thousands of applicants met with a stern rejection . Miss Dix in 1861 was nearly sixty yOar.s old . She considered all persons under thirty disqualified for nursing . She re . quested the provost marshal , who had been receiving a number of aspiring ladies , to send her only those who were able to turn a full-grown man around in bed , and to do the most menial work . This , he remarked , thinned the ranks of the candidates very much . Good looks met with as little favor as youth . Miss Dix had a detestation of wasp waists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superintendent 's approval , an applicant must be ' plain almost to repulsion in dress . ' Certainly hospital wards were no place for crinolines . The nurses , in their perpendicular skirts , seemed to themselves laughably ' angular ' and deleted material opposition from corrupt politicians . His health had suffered from the strain ; and a fall from his horse , while inspecting the work , had given him a badly broken thigh . Yet his leave of absence for patriotic duty brought him no rest for two laborious years . In July of 1861 , ho shared with a competent doctor the labor of inspecting twenty camps near Washington . That year the servants often found him still at work when they came to set the breakfast table . In the spring of 1862 ho went to the Peninsula to spend himself in untiring service . His wasted , autocratic face , with its feminine features and straggling moustache , burned with the same harsh flame of consecration that lighted the features of Miss Dix . But Olmsted had a genius for organization ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sanitary Commission into an immense and powerful agency for the relief of suffering among the soldiers . Theirs were the plans for the new pavilion hospitals ; theirs too were the monographs that acquainted country practitioners turned army doctors with hygiene and vaccination , with the treatment of dysentery and malaria and venereal diseases . They forced the necessity for camp sanitation on the government 's attention . Their barrels of potatoes and onions abated scurvy in many regiments . They equipped and staffed the hospital ships , and later built hospital cars , with swinging litters , kitchens , and dispensaries . For all this great work , however , the Sanitary Commission might have remained little known to the general public had it not been for the secondary phase of its activities ? the distribution of supplies . By the sheer force of their patriotic benevolence , the ladies overwhelmed the scientific preoccupations of Dr. Bellows and Mr. Olmsted and their associates . Everywhere the war was bringing women out of the seclusion of domestic life . Timid ones grew bold as lions . Invalids arose from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to draft constitutions and bylaws , to serve on committees and preside at meetings , even to raise and handle money . From t housancls of aid societies in all parts of the Union a steady stream of stores flowed to the Sanitary Commission . Enriched by large dona ( ions , it established enormous storehouses and then administered them efficiently . It organized a relief service for hospitals and camps and installed its own refreshment saloons . Trained agents , in charge of the Commission 's wagonloads of supplies , moved with every army . The name , which had been derived from an int crest in preventive hygiene , became a household word ; and everything sent to the soldiers , from currant wine to Canton flannel drawers , went by the name of ' sanitary stores . ' At Antietam the Sanitary Commission first developed its system of relief on the battlefield . The reforms in the army medical department never made civilian assistance superfluous in alleviating the sufferings of the wounded ; and to the end of the war the Sanitary Commission continued to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps . Another group , the United States Christian Commission , also went with supplies to Antietam . This organization was an outgrowth of the Y. M. C. A. Before either of these large organizations had found means of reaching the front , they had been anticipated by a solitary little maiden lady  --  Miss Clara Barton , who had singlehanded succeeded in forcing her way through official red tape and military restrictions . The April evening of 1861 when she had sprung forward at the Washington depot to dress the wounds of the Sixth Massachusetts with handkerchiefs had marked a turning point in a hitherto obscure and unrewarded life , Miss Barton had many temperamental resemblances to Miss Dix . She too was timid , high-strung , and willful ; but , unlike the other spinster from Massachusetts , she had no national reputation and no background of public service . From schoolteaching she had gone to the job of Patent Office clerk at a salary of $1400 a year . It was unusual for a female to be employed by the government , particularly at a wage which equaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified for the work by her fine , copper-plate handwriting . Although she was morbidly sensitive and shy , suffered agonies of self-consciousness and was subject to nervous breakdowns , the soldiers in the Senate Chamber were only the first of many audiences she would address in a long career as an eloquent and dramatic public speaker . After First Bull Run , she advertised in the Worcester Spy for provisions for the wounded . As quantities of boxes were shipped to her from Massachusetts , she established her own distributing agency ; but she was not satisfied with the role of dispensing supplies . In the hospitals and on the wharves she heard many heartbreaking stories of the neglect which had preceded the soldiers ' arrival in Washington . Miss Barton began to badger the SurgeonGenerc : ' s office for permission to carry her supplies to the front . In some manner she secured an authorization from Hammond , who asked the Assistant Quartermaster-General , Colonel Daniel H. Rucker , to give her every facility for taking supplies to the sick . Her eloquent plea touched Bucker 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped her with the complicated business of obtaining the various passes necessary to permit her to travel with her stores and a lady companion through the army lines between Washington and Fredericksburg . On a Sunday morning in early August of 1862 , Miss Barton , in a plain black print skirt and jacket , climbed over the wheel of an army wagon in full view of the Washington churchgoers , plumped herself down beside the Negro driver , and drove off to take a government transport for the camps near Aquia Creek . A few days later she was ministering to the wounded of Banks 's corps on the battlefield of Slaughter Mountain , Clara Barton was a shining exception to the useless civilians who went out from the capital to tend the wounded of Second Bull Run . Few timid women have spent such a week-end as that she passed near Fairfax Station . The disgruntled male nurses , drunken and otherwise , who reached that point on the Sunday morning after the battle might have found plenty of opportunity to be of service on a hillside near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the battlefield . The men were laid among the trees on the ground , where hay had been scattered to make an immense bed . That night , in the mist and darkness , Miss Barton , with a little band of helpers , prepared to feed the crowd , She had almost no utensils , but she had many boxes of preserves , and as jam jars and jelly tumblers were emptied she filled them again and again with soup or coffee or bread soaked in wine . Monday brought many wounded who had lain three days without food . To ensure that none should be loaded on the cars without receiving nourishment , Clara Barton personally fed that clay 's arrivals in the wagons , climbing from wheel to brake . By evening her supplies were almost gone . As the wounded still came in she stirred the leftovers together ; and in the pouring rain , amid the uproar of the thunder and the artillery at Chantilly , the famished men greedily ate a concoction of hard crackers pounded into crumbs and mixed with wine , whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , Miss Barton made thorough preparation for the next . battle . An army wagon , drawn by a string of frisky mules , was assigned to her by the Quartermaster 's Department . Her own baggage was contained in a handkerchief , but the wagon bulged with stores . She had even had the forethought to bring lanterns , so that the surgeons could see to work at night . In the middle of September , a solitary woman in the wagon train of an advancing army , she journeyed over the hills of Maryland , slicing bread and passing it out to the stragglers along the road . Progress was slow ; and , pushing on at night while the drivers of the other wagons slept , this indomitable lady reached the artillery by morning and followed the cannon to Antietam Creek . The work she did on that field caused the Quartermaster 's Department to capitulate to her completely . When the Army of the Potomac advanced in Virginia , Clara Barton accompanied the Ninth Corps with her own train of four heavily laden wagons and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they became her devoted servants . This shy little lady had overridden the regulations of the army and the conventions of society . Hardship and danger had cast out all her nervous fears ; and , in the giddy elation of service and self-sacrifice , she bumped triumphantly to Warrenton . XXX The army , which had been advancing , was now halted stock-still . Presently , a presage of activity , the sick began to come up from Warrenton on the cars . The army was marching toward the Rappahannock , On November 18 , the Star was confident that General Burnside had crossed the river and made his headquarters in Fredericksburg , and would take Richmond in less than ten days . On November 21 , that newspaper admitted that the rebels still occupied Fredericksburg ; Lee 's army was firmly entrenched on the heights around the city . On the twenty-fifth , the Star conceded that the rebels apparently designed making serious resistance to the Federal army 's crossing the Rappahannock . The officers of the Army of the Potomac had been peremptorily ordered to rejoin their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were the officers of the large force left for the protection of Washington under the command of General Heintzelman , who had succeeded General Banks in command of the defenses . Staff officers were legion , as were those of the Commissary and Quartermaster 's Departments . There were paroled prisoners and members of courts-martial , convalescents and a multitude of surgeons . Handsome Fitz-John Porter was there , to learn the verdict that would wreck his career . Irvin McDowell had come to hear his name traduced at the court of inquiry which lie had demanded . On Saturday , December 13 , the rumbling rumors from Fredericksburg culminated in the report of a heavy engagement . The story unfolded slowly . ' When I get nothing clear and explicit at the War Department , ' Welles wrote in his diary , ' I have my apprehensions . . . . Adverse tidings are suppressed with a deal of fuss and mystery , a shuffling over of papers and maps , and a far-reaching vacant gaze . ' The military censorship was suppressing the news of the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outcome of the engagement . From early morning until night the President sat in suspense in the telegraph office . Burnside , with every one of his generals opposed to him , wanted to renew the assault . The uncertainty at the War Department lasted until the early hours of Tuesday morning . The border town of Washington had access to first-hand information . On Sunday night a steamerload of officers and soldiers arrived from Aquia Creek ? men who had been slightly wounded in the battle , who were able to walk , who were able to tell of the hopeless courage and the slaughter of the repeated assaults which Burnside had ordered on the Fredericksburg fortifications . That same evening the correspondent , Henry Villard , reached Washington from the front . The censor refused to pass his dispatch to the New York Tribune , which Villard then represented . He sent it off by messenger on the night train , but the Tribune , in advance of confirmation , was afraid to print the full story , which told of the blundering command and the perilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a fate which frequently overtook early reports of bad news during the war . After his story was written , Villard went into Willard 's to get some suppor , told , ' meting Senator Henry Wilson , told him that Burnside was defeated . Wilson hurried to t he White House . A little before ten o'clock he came to the ' Tribune office to take Villard to the President . Still in his soiled campaign clothes , the young correspondent answered Lincoln 's anxious questions . He spoke of disaster to the army if the attack were renewed . ' I hope it is not so bad as all that , ' the President said with a sad smile . Senator Wilson was pleased that Villard had spoken so frankly , and , though his report did not cause the government to take action , Villard felt proud that ho had performed a patriotic duty , From the accounts of eyewitnesses , the Washington newspapers on Monday began to rumor defeat and fearful losses . On Tuesday the whole Union learned that the battle of Fredericksburg had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than twelve thousand Federal soldiers had been killed and wounded , and the Army of the Potomac had staggered back across the Rappahannock in retreat . Th . Senate met , but had no heart to do business and adjourned . The Republicans gathered in caucus , to air , apart from the Democrats , their criticisms of Lincoln and his Cabinet . At the wharves the stir of trade ceased , as out of the Potomac mist moved the white anti silent transports . Thousand after thousand , men littered the landings , like spoiled freight . First the lesser injuries arrived ; then the more serious ; at length the frightful cases , the thigh ampule .. lions and the belly wounds . After Fredericksburg , Burnside came to Washington in anguish of mind . He took on himself the full blame for his ill-judged attack ; yet the responsibility fell heavily on the administration . Many believed that Burnside was a scapegoat , that his manly and disarming attitude had been assumed to protect the government . The want of faith that had long been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The official New Year 's festivities at the White House took place in the midst of grave and painful perplexity . At noon , after the official calls , the gates were flung open , and the scuffle of the public reception began . In struggling installments the crowd was admitted to the mansion , whose elegant carpets had been covered to protect them from the mud . In the midst of the melee in the Blue Room , Lincoln stood serene , but his eyes often looked over the heads of the greeters as though they were fixed on something far away . He had a proclamation to sign , after the crowd was gone . XXXI McClellan arrived in Washington to give testimony before the Fitz-John Porter court-martial . Such crowds turned out to see him that it was difficult for him to pass from the courtroom to his hotel . The most popular song in the capital was ' McClellan Again at the Head of His Men . ' When it was sung in the music halls , every bluecoat in the audience sprang to his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army of the Potomac occurred at the rate of about two hundred a day . Many resulted from loss of morale and discontent over the Government 's delay in paying the troops . Other deserters belonged to a new class of soldiers who had never had any // morale to lose ? the bounty jumpers , who had enlisted with the intention of seizing the first opportunity to run away after pocketing the large State and local bonuses . In the face of all the disaffection , I3urnside stubbornly persisted in a plan he had formed to cross the Rappahannock a few miles below Fredericksburg . The march began in a deluge of rain . The army ? men , guns , wagons ? stuck fast in the glutinous mud ; and , as it struggled back into camp , Burn-side 's reputation petered out to the sound of the nation 's bitter laughter . In agitation , Burnside journeyed again to Washington , with his resignation in his pocket . As an alternative he had prepared an order dismissing the antagonistic generals of his command . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biddy Smith , Sturgis , and others . Lincoln accepted Burnside 's resignation . Late in January the Chase interests had their way , and Hooker was placed in command of the Army of the Potomac . While the blond war god , Hooker , rode out on his milk-white horse , a big , blowzy fellow in a gray suit was begin-rag to be known in the streets and the hospital wards of Washington . He had been one of a crowd of anxious people who rushed to the capital after Fredericksburg , as after every great battle of the Army of the Potomac . His brother , an officer in the Fifty-first New York , had been wounded , and he was seeking word of him . After a reassuring visit to Falmouth , he returned to linger in Washington , looking for an office . Even in the heterogeneous company of the capital , Walt . Whitman had no counterpart . His scarlet face , bushy beard , and wide-brimmed sombrero gave him a delusively robust and rural aspect which caused one politician to tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home was in Brooklyn , and he loved the life of cities . Though he was stout and gray and slow-moving , with opaque , heavy-lidded eyes , he was only forty-three years old . A friend compared him to ' sonic great . mechanic , or stevedore , or seaman , or grand laborer of one kind or another . ' The word ' grand , ' with its hint of apotheosis , betrays that the resemblance is not to be taken quite literally . In his youth , Walt had been a dandy . His rough garments were carefully selected . He never wore a tie , but his spotless shirt , with its open collar , was Byronic rather than proletarian . There was a queer daintiness about this big , bluff man . Ile looked as though he had just taken a bath . He wore a flower or a green sprig in the lapel of his coat . His flesh was soft and rosy , like a woman 's . In his strolls about . Washington , Whitman was impressed by the low white buildings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the hospitals , to talk with the soldiers and give them little presents . As Whitman wrote to his family and friends and to the newspapers about his hospital work , people began to send him money . He dispensed it . carefully , making it go as far as possible . Through the wards on Sundays , and some weekday afternoons , he trudged with his slow , rolling walk . A haversack hung heavy on his shoulder , and the pockets of his cheap gray suit were bulging . To one man lie would give an orange , to another an apple or a small quantity of pickles or horehound candy . He brought pens and pencils , writing paper and envelopes . Sometimes he carried a good-sized jar of jelly , and spooned it out to the occupants of a ward . He did not encourage the use of tobacco , but he had a store of cut plugs in his pocket , to dole out to men who craved it . Often he left money , in ' bright new ten-cent and five-cent bills . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale through the wards , and Walt thought that it raised their spirits to have a little cash by them . The penuriousness of his own life was reflected in his tiny girls ; but the recipients were simple men ? poor , often das- titute . They understood Walt , and were grateful to him . He regarded his presents as a means of making friends with the soldiers . Once a relationship was established , he talked with them , wrote their letters home , read aloud , or played Twenty Questions . Between him and some of the very young soldiers a deep tenderness developed . In gifts of the heart , in love and tact and sympathy , Walt was lavish . As fervently as the most sentimental of the women nurses , he believed in the curative properties of affection . His hands were gentle . His red face bent kindly over the sunken , childish features on the pillow . Sometimes it pressed close . ' Many a soldier 's kiss dwells on these bearded lips . ' Anxiety about the demoralization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders in restoring the spirit and confidence of the troops . He had judiciously administered punishment. , and granted furloughs and leaves of absence . Increased drill and field exercise kept the soldiers fit and lively . Their health , under intelligent medical supervision , was excellent . Staff departments were reorganized . The units of cavalry in the various corps were consolidated in one effective force and placed under the command of Major-General George Stoneman . To fix responsibility for straggling and marauding and to stimulate morale , Hooker assigned to each corps a distinctive device . Its color ? red , white , or blue ? differentiated the divisions . The emblems were proudly painted on the wagons and ambulances of the respective corps , stenciled on all articles of public property , and sewn on the caps of every officer and soldier . Early in April , Hooker said that Ile had ' a living army . ' He was boastfully certain of success , and the reinvigorated troops shared his high spirits . At this time Ito received a visit from the President , Mrs. Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavalry , watching the parade of the troops , or visiting the hospital tents , was received with tremendous enthusiasm . Before his eyes passed in grand review the six magnificent infantry corps , the large and disciplined cavalry corps , and the great reserve artillery force of the Army of the Potomac . The fame of Hooker 's army circulated in Washington . The entire country , primed by an opt imist ic press , had grown elated and hopeful . War industries flourished , business was booming . A prosperous people invested confidently in the new issue of government bonds . The upturn in business had conspired with the defeats of the last year and the weariness of the long war to discourage volunteering . The State militia drafts had been a failure . In March , Congress passed the Enrollment Act , applying to men between the ages of twenty and forty-five . New regiments were not needed , but replenishments for the depleted organizations already in the field , The measure , which provided for a military draft when necessary , removed prospective levies from State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . The Union was divided into districts , under provost marshals who reported to a ProvostMarshal-General , at the head of a special bureau of the War Department . Conscription , dreaded by the country , did not affect the man who was well-to-do . If drafted , he could avoid service either by furnishing a substitute or by paying $300 . This sum , when the first draft was ordered in May , became the purchase price of the substitute soldier , who also received the Federal bounty of $100 , paid to those drafted and their substitutes , as well as to volunteers . In 1863 , able-bodied men were plentiful , and $400 was a good sum . To obtain it , worthless soldiers crowded into the Federal ranks , while the swindling and extortionate brokers , who traded in men , multiplied and flourished in every State of the Union . April ran out on a tide of rumors that General Hooker had crossed the Rappahannock . Washington clacked with reports of fighting , all vague , all unofficial . The first five days of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that victory had been purchased at a terrible price ; and still the military telegraph was mufilecl and the press was jubilant . The War Department was only half informed . The President was feverishly anxious for facts . Gideon Welles picked up tidbits of news from correspondents and naval officers who came up from Aquia Creek . In spite of the general impression that the Federal arms had had a great , if costly , triumph , Welles was not satisfied . ' If we have success , ' he wrote in his diary , the tidings would come to us in volumes . ' On Wednesday , May tt , the Secretary of the Navy saw a letter from Dahlgren 's boy , Ulric , who was on Hooker 's stair . He had telegraphed his father that he was all right , ' and the message carne from headquarters near Falmouth , on the north side of the Rappahannock . Stanton , when Welles questioned him , said that he had no information that Hooker had retired across the river . An hour later Senator Sumner strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lost , lost ! All is lost ! ' In a White House bedroom the President stood , with a telegram from Butterfield in his hand . His face was the color of the French gray paper on the walls . At Chancellorsville the Army of the Potomac had paid a terrible price ; but it was the price of defeat . Confronted by an aggressive enemy , Hooker had lost his impetus . He ordered the army to fall back , astounding his vigorous corps and division commanders and disheartening the troops . On May 8 , Stonewall Jackson attacked the Eleventh Corps , and the German soldiers , surprised and unprepared , were routed . The next morning Hooker had been knocked insensible by a cannon ball that struck a verandah pillar against which he was leaning . The great defeat of that day was ascribed to the effects of this accident ; but in fact the battle was already lost . Soon afterward General Stoneman , dining in Washington with the Pennsylvanian , A. K. McClure , gave his explanation of Hooker 's failure : ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it came to the point when he should go a thousand better , and then he would flunk . ' As the tale of incompetence and vacillation unfolded , there was only one detail which might bring comfort to the Union . At Chancellorsville , Stonewall Jackson had been wounded . The week after the battle , it was known that his sombre figure would ride no more at the head of his ragged rebel troops . Though the calamity of this defeat appalled and discouraged the nation , there was not the black despondency that had followed the Seven Days , Second Bull Run , and Fredericksburg . Business was good . Factory wheels were turning . There was wild speculation on the Stock Exchange . The humblest man could pocket a large bounty by donning the uniform of his country . If the people of the Union could not win this war , at least they were making money out of it . Two bitter years had made them callous to the loss of thousands of men ; and above the sighs and the weeping arose a shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , to give parties , to dine and dance and be merry . Again the wounded cumbered the Washington wharves , but few sightseers gathered to see the transports arriving , clay after day , with the men from Chancellorsville . Now each of those prostrate young bodies seemed the very figure of the Union itself , and people turned away from the heart-sickening , habitual scene . The compact caravans of the ambulances had become a monotonous part of the pageant of the streets . The procession of the maimed , with their empty sleeves and trouser legs , no longer attracted attention . Even death had grown corn- monplace . There had been a time when the loss of one young Ellsworth had thrown the capital into mourning . Now , from the silver-mounted rosewood of the higher officers to the cheap pine slats of the ordinary soldiers , the business of death was plied like any other prosperous trade , There was a section of the city where the rat-tat of the coffin makers ' hammers sounded all day , and the stacks of long , upended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever chart of the battles . The capital had had a surfeit of misery ; and , if the horror of blood beat like a wound in the back of every mind , the faces on the streets were The soft spring air carried the plaintive mechanical melodies of the organ grinders ; and on the Avenue , under the huge transparency which advertised embalming , the promenaders sauntered in the sunshine , Busy hacks rolled among the wagons and the caracoling horses of the officers . Fashionable ladies drove in berouches , with black coachmen and footmen . On the sidewalks , salesmen cried the merits of patent soaps , and proprietors of telescopes and lung-testing machines clamored for customers . Pineapples , oranges , and tomatoes were piled in colored pyramids , ice-cream dealers were stationed in the shade of the trees , and Italians roasted chestnuts in little portable stoves . Children shrieked for pieces chipped from big , variegated rocks of candy and for the artificial bugs which were swung enticingly up and down on strings , while sharper children bawled the evening newspapers , and swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a cosmopolitan air . Every nationality seemed to be represented in the gaudy crowd . The swords and sashes , plumed hats and riding cloaks of the army officers , the gold lace of the naval officers , the outlandish dress of the Zotmves , gave Washington the look of a carnival , a huge and lively masquerade . The spring bonnets of the ladies were fantastic , extravagantly high and narrow , ' with overhanging balconies of flowers . ' They were wearing much red that season , for the color of the Garibaldians ' shirts was still the fashion , There was a shade called Magenta , and another paler red called Solferino ? warm , bright , amusing names . Those smiling ladies knew that they were the names of battlefields , where alien men had died for some vague cause . But no one named a shade of red for Fredericksburg ; and the silliest of the officers ' trollops would have shrunk from a scarlet dress that bore the name of Chancellorsvi Ile . XXXII In contrast to the demagogues and fanatics of his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above all things he desired to save the Union , and in his mind emancipation was always subsidiary to this great central ambition . Neither sentimentality nor vindictiveness blinded him to the social upheaval which a sudden overthrow of the institution would entail . He had repeatedly voiced his cherished hope that the loyal slaveholding States would voluntarily adopt some plan of gradual emancipation with compensation to the owners from the Federal Government , In March 1862 , to the accompaniment of heated oratory , the Senate took up the bill for emancipation in the District . The slaves were to bo freed immediately , but loyal masters were to receive compensation at an average of $300 per slave . Moreover , an amendment appropriated money for a project dear to Mr. Lincoln 's heart , one to which he strongly adhered and with which he unsuccessfully experimented ? the colonization of such freed blacks as might wish to leave the country . Neither compensation nor the hope that some Negroes might take their departure calmed the anxiety of the capital 's citizens . In their eyes the abolitionists were bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man . ' The Emancipation Bill was passed in both Houses , and on April 10,1802 , was signed by the President . Early in May , the commission was receiving the petitions of the owners , while the long lists of itemized human property , to be examined and valued by a Baltimore slave dealer , began to appear in the newspapers . Eventually , 979 persons in the entire District presented claims for 3128 slaves . Among those who received their money was a free Negro , who asked compensation for a wife he had purchased and for the half-dozen children born of the union . At least this fact was vouched for by Horace Greeley , the pink-faced , goggle-eyed , anti-slavery editor of the New York Tribune . Although the congressional legislation on behalf of the Negroes created much commotion in the District , it brought little immediate change to the colored people themselves . For the most part , the manumitted slaves continued to work for their masters . They were not assertive in laying claim to their new civil rights . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special labeled cars were presently provided for them . This discrimination became nearly a personal issue between Senator Sumner and the street railway company , and was at length abolished . A year and a half after Congress provided public schools for Negro children , none had been opened in the District . The expected revenues from taxes on Negro property and philanthropic contributions proved disappointing , and the community had no mind to saddle itself with the expense . The Freedman 's Aid Society , formed by sympathetic persons in the capital , set up schools in shabby rooms and church basements on the Island and in the Northern Liberties . Teachers volunteered their services . The pupils in the night classes , from ten years old to sixty , supplied their own books and lights , That same month , May 1862 , a Foe- Imitation of military emancipation was issued in the Department of the South . It was the act of Lincoln 's old friend , Major-General David Hunter , who , after serving for sonic time in the West , had been placed in command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , which had passed under Union control as the result of successful military and naval expeditions . The department was under martial law , and the white population had fled , abandoning their slaves . These thousands of blacks were cared for by the government and by private philanthropy , and it was their freedom which Hunter , in all sincerity exceeding die powers of a military commander , proclaimed . On reading of this order in the press , the President publicly annulled it , with the quiet consistency which allied him in abolitionist minds with the slave-catching Lamon . To Hunter himself Lincoln expressed I17 ) disapprobation , and their friendship was not disturbed by the incident . At this same time the President again besought the loyal slave States to adopt gradual and compensated emancipation , not rending or wrecking anything . ' Against the conservatism of his course the radicals of Congress fulminated . The President signed the bill prohibiting slavery in the territories ; but when he forced the modification of a second Confiscation Bill , more drastic and explicit than the first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the breaking point . In public speech or writing the President made no sign . Yet , after a hopeless conference with the representatives of the loyal slave States , his resolve was taken . The reverses on the Peninsula and the fierce political pressure forced him to the precipitate act of military emancipation of the rebels ' slaves . It was designed to weaken the Confederacy by drawing off the Negro laborers who released their men for military service . In July of 1862 , Mr. Lincoln had come to believe that this war measure was the 392 REVEILLE IN WASHINGTON : 1860-1865 alternative to surrendering the Union . He said as much to Mr. Seward and Mr. Welles , as they drove out to the funeral of Stanton 's baby , James . A week later he discussed the subject with his Cabinet . In September , after Antietam , he issued Isis preliminary proclamation : on the first day of January , 1803 , the slaves of persons in rebellion against the government were to be proclaimed forever free . The country , in the main , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State elections which soon followed as a protest against the President 's capitulation to the radicals . Abolitionists , on the other hand , were still dissatisfied with Mr. Lincoln 's moderation . His wholehearted support came from the Negroes themselves . From the beginning his name had been to the race the simple synonym of their deliverance . Colored folk , when crowds gathered at the White House , wildly demonstrated their love for the President , shouting and swinging their hats with abandon . In long columns the contrabands came toiling over the dusty roads to the city he inhabited . Some were in rags , some wore the rough and sweat-stained garments of the field , some were decked in the antique finery of their masters and mistresses . The pickaninnies who rode their fathers ' backs , the tiny black Abraham Lincolns who nuzzled at the breast , were scarcely more helpless than those who carried them . For these were primitive and childlike people , adrift without a plan from the dependence of slavery . They understood nothing of the political complexities in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolitionists who pressed the President to his reluctant decision . They knew only that Lincoln was a man raised up by God to work the miracle of their deliverance . Their simple imagination had its own power . They and other millions like them , flocking to the Union armies of the West and South , or waiting on the plantations of their masters , impressed their faith on a nation 's mind . The abolitionists of Congress ? Wade , Stevens , Chandler , Wilson , Lovejoy , even the lofty Sumner ? have been all but forgotten by their countrymen . The Lincoln who lives in the American legend was shaped in the slave 's long dream of a kindly master who should set his people free . In their crowded and comfortless barracks , the contrabands patiently awaited the coming of the day of jubilee . On New Year 's Eve they filled the chapel to overflowing . An old man named Thornton arose to testify . ' I cried all night , What de matter , Thornton ? Tomorrow my child is to be sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! no more dat ! no more dat ! . . . Ca n't sell your wife and children any more ! ' Ecstasy mounted with the passing hours , and the silent prayer enjoined by the superintendent at midnight gave place to fervent invocations and hallelujah hymns . Young and old wrung one another 's hands , dancing and shouting in a frenzy of joy . Around the bleak , dark camp they paraded , singing . Many marched until daybreak . The sun rose on the first day of January , 1863 . The air was clear and brilliant . The President opened his tired eyes on a momentous day . Since he had issued his preliminary proclamation , the defeat of his party in the State elections had been followed by the military disaster of Fredericksburg . The radical Senators , demanding the removal of the conservative Seward , had nearly wrecked his Cabinet . The thing he was about to do had alienated some of his warmest adherents among moderate men . In Washington , that winter , he seemed to stand alone , almost without friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's callers about the White House came the slender , amiable man whom the radicals hated , with his slender , ? uniuble son by his side . and Frederick Seward climbed the stairs to the President 's office . There were less than it dozen persons in I he mum to witness the signing of 11u , Emancipation Proclaim ' t ion , Conscious of a moment or history , the President closed his aching lingers on a pen . 11 is whole right arm was numb from the ordeal of 1 he morning 's wee/Akins .

All ( lay , while an artificial conviviality surrounded the bowls of eggnog in the INtashingl on parlors , I he wastes of North Twelfth Street rang wil h the choruses of the contrabands .

Twin lamps suspended from the low chapel roof and candle or two set on it rafter cast a dim light on their dark , expectant faces . The superintendent , 1 ) r .

X XX Ill By tine of 18611 , the capital had muse to welcome new defenders . Louder and more perilous to the city than the distant roar of guns at . Vicksburg , an ominous rumble had sounded beyond the Blue Ridge . Raids and skirmishes had at first been ascribed to the rebel guerrillas , who hovered in small squads along the Federal lines across the Potomac . But a hundred startling rumors flew along the Avenue . The details were Various and contradictory , but they had one constant theme : General Lee was marching north .
