This week two enemies celebrated two strangely symbolic anniversaries : <P> On Feb. 11 , 660 B.C. , in a splendid palace on the peninsula of Yamato , the mighty Emperor Jimmu celebrated his various successful aggressions by offering up sacrifices to Ama-terasu -- mi-Kami , sometimes known as the Sun Goddess , his great-great-grandmother . Thus was founded ( so Japanese chroniclers say ) the Empire of Japan . <P> On Feb. 12 , 1809 , in a shabby Kentucky cabin with a floor of packed-down dirt , a door swung on leather hinges and a stick-clay chimney , a boy was born with the help of an old midwife named Peggy Walters . The boy was Abraham Lincoln , who devoted his life , against terrible odds , to justice , humanity and freedom .
