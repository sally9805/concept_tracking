Should the press submit to voluntary censorship in peacetime ? When Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal put the question to a committee of press , radio and newsreel representatives last spring ( TIME , March 15 ) , he got a short no . The responsibility for keeping military secrets , the committee decided , rested on the armed services ; they should not give out " secret " information . <P> With this view many working newsmen wholeheartedly disagreed ; they felt that such a policy would be an open invitation to military men to slap the " top-secret " stamp on matters of legitimate public interest . Such newsmen felt that the press has the right to know what is going on ; it should be responsible for keeping vital military secrets in peacetime just as it did in wartime . <P> In his first annual report last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , Secretary Forrestal agreed . Wrote he : " . . . It is the responsibility of the press , radio and other agencies which gather and disseminate news , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I agree , that in peacetime no type of official censorship is workable or desirable . "
