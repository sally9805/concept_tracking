txt Having been sent to a current political convention this reporter proposes to defy tradition and write about a convention that took place in this spot eight years ago . One reason for this is that there is not much news about the convention opening today . nor will there be until President Roosevelt chooses to tell whether he will run or not run . Also it may not be a bad idea to recall that we had some troubles eight years ago and that in one way and another the country took care of them , even though the convention itself seemed not quite to appreciate them . It may not even be superfluous to express a belief that the country will do so again with or without the assistance of political conventions . Not a Cheerful Trip in ' 32 It was n't a very nice trip coming into Chicago in the summer of 1932 . The train crawled among lines of factory buildings . Most of them were marked by smokeless chimneys . Some were boarded up . Some had that disheveled appearance that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things you heard in Chicago were n't very cheerful either Some of the big banks had already been bolstered by government funds . You heard that more support would have to come , or else ? . Jesse Jones happened to be in town . He said confidentially the funds would be forthcoming for the big banks . Some of the little outlying banks could n't be saved In fact some already had closed . You met people who had thought themselves pretty well fixed , . Now their bank was closed . They were worried about where they might get the money with which to eat . Merchants and small plants were worried about payroll funds . They let men oat . In the morning the lake front parks were littered with newspapers . Men who had slept on the grass the night before had used them for protection . The Prohibition Plank A lot of - viewers with alarm " went around darkly predicting that it did n't make much difference about this convention anyhow because we were on the verge of revolution . Even the people who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - cognizance of the banks that were closing right and left over the country . The delegates did n't think so though . The delegates said , yes , banks were closing and things were n't so good , but what about the prohibition plank That they said , was what interested the people back home . They agreed that closing banks was bad business and it had to stop . More vociferously they agreed that liquor had to come back , but the old-time saloon must not reopen . In the convention they had a big debate about prohibition . Al Smith led the repeal fight and when he took the rostrum to make his speech , he got from the floor and galleries one of the most spontaneous demonstrations any convention ever gave any man . Hull Led Anti-Repeal Fight : he then-senator from Tennessee . Cordell Hull . led the anti-repeal fight . Probably no one knows better than Mr. Hull that he is no match for Mr. Smith in rough and tumble debate . In addition the galleries did n't like his views . Anyway the speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumped for repeal and then went about the business of nominating a candidate . It may be recalled that it was n't long after this convention that the banks did close and that the saloons did reopen . In fact the two events were so nearly simultaneous that some of the saloons moved into the quarters which the banks lately had occupied . That 's the way with convention crises . Things turn out exactly the opposite of the way conventions think they should . Somehow the country goes on pretty much the same as before . Almost surely it win again . Huey Long Was There There was another little battle at the convention . It was about contesting delegations from Louisiana . One was led by a man named Huey Long . The convention had heard great stories about Huey , his uncouth mannerisms. his idiosyncracies of speech and all that . He took the rostrum to defend his case . He was correctly dressed . His diction was excellent . He presented his claim in a speech that was lucidly logical . The convention might have been warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bad not quite appreciated . It apparently did not It seated him and it was n't long before he had the whole Democratic administration and the leadership of the Senate by the ears . Huey got to be kind of a minor national crisis all in his own right and the time since the remains of his state machine was broken up can be counted in days . The convention took three ballots on a presidential nominee . Governor Roosevelt of New York led but had n't the necessary two-thirds . They adjourned early in the morning to meet again that night . During the day California . which had been supporting John Nance Garner switched to Roosevelt . So did Texas , the native state of Mr. Garner . There is an interesting story about that Tomos switch . It has been said and never denied that the delegation voted to support Governor Roosevelt by a majority of one-half vote . The other votes were for Albert C. Ritchie of Maryland . Governor Roosevelt needed those Texas votes right then . If he had not gone over on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready to switch .
