WAGGONER Spcolai to THE Nzw YORK TracEs . WASHINGTON , June 2 ? The ( Senate , going into a night session ( because of the closeness of its ad ) ournment date , gave its approval to the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 . The vote was 63 to 13 , re1fleeting regional rather than party divisions . The opposition of thirteen numbered only one Reppublican , Senator Albert W. Hawkes of New Jersey . The twelve Democrats who voted against . the measure were from Southern and border states . The bill would admit into this country in the next two years up to 200,000 " displaced " victims of wartime persecution . With the draft and the reciprocal trade program , the bill is one of three having top priority from Republican policy-makers for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders have fixed June 19 as their hoped-for date of adjournment . The bill now will go to the House , which has the choice , however , of acting upon its own somewhat similar bill sponsored by Representative Frank Fellows , Republican , of Maine . The Fellows bill has been reported out of the Judiciary Committee , but awaits clearance by the Rules Committee for introduction on to the floor . Substantial Changes in Bill As passed by the Senate at 10:30 P. M. tonight , the bill had undergone substantial Changes from the form in which it emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 2 . The major change was the increase in the two-year total of admissions from 100,000 to 200 , - 000 persons . Further liberalizing the quota , however , was a " carry-over " feature , which provides that the number short of the 100,000 limit for the first year could be applied to the second year ceiling . Thus , if only 80,000 DP 's ? enter the country in the first year the second // year total may go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is from June 1 , 1948 , through June 30 , 1950 . The late debate was marked by a scathing attack on the bill for its " inadequacies " by Senator Claude Pepper , Democrat , of Florida , who nevertheless voted for it in ' the final roll call . He said that he did so with reluctance . He denounced the bill for what he called excessive restrictions and false morality . Citing its provisions requiring that 50 per cent of the eligible DP 's come from the Baltic states , he charged that the measure discriminated against a " most persecuted , most massacred , most butchered of people  --  the Jews . " He also took issue with the requirement that 50 per cent of the eligible persons have an agricultural background , holding that it discriminated not only against the Jews , but against American farm labor . He declared that the bill might be " so tightly- drawn " that no one would be able to get through except persons with wealthy and responsible relatives in this country . Passage followed 11% hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote was taken soon after rejection , 50 to 27 , of a substitute offered by Senator James P. Kern , Republican , of Missouri , which would have reduced the total two-year admissions to 140,000 persons and charged them against the regular immigration quotas . Opposing the Kern substitute , Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican leader , said he felt " strongly " that at least 200,000 refugees should be admitted to this country . Earlier the Senate rejected moat of a large number of amendments seeking to modify either the total to be admitted or the classifications of Europeans to be eligible . A major setback for champions of a " liberal " bill was the defeat in the afternoon of an amendment by Senator - Homer Ferguson , Republican , of Michigan , to extend the date of eligibility for the victims of - Nazi or Fascist aggression from Dec 22 , 1945 , to April 21 , 1947 . With party lines disregarded , the proposal was rejected 49. to 29 . Supporters of the amendment contended that a large number of displaced Jews would be excluded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Sews , it was stated , fled from pogroms in Poland after Dec. 22 , 1945 . Opponents of the amendment , especially Senators Chapman Revercomb , Republican , of West Virginia , and Richard B. Russell of Georgia and James 0 . Eastland of Mississippi , Democrats , argued that the extension of - the eligibility period might permit the entrance of Communists . Senator Revercomb , chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee to Investigate Immigration and Naturalization , and a key figure in the preparation of the original bill , led throughout the day the opposition to " liberalizing " amendments , most of which were sponsored by Senator Ferguson . Another proposal by Senator Ferguson , the third which he offered , would substitute " adequate " housing - for the " decent , safe and sanitary " housing in the bill , Senator Revercomb opposed it , but finally accepted a compromise by Senator Millard E. Tydings , , Democrat , of Maryland , which omitted ' the word " decent " and left the bill requiring that housing for the ar- , riving DP 's be simply " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , classes of eligibility , but in a. manner contrary to that sought by advocates of liberal DP emigration , were passed late in the afternoon . One , proposed by Serkator C. Wayland Brooks , Republican , of Illinois , would give priority among eligible adult refugees to those who in the last war " bore arms against the enemies of the United States " and who were " unable or unwilling " to return to their homelands because of possible persecution . The other , proposed and argued at length by Senator William Langer , Republican , of North Dakota , was the " Volkdeutsche " rider . This is generally believed to have greater bearing on the national immigration laws than on the DP problem . It provides that all persons of " German ethnic ? origin " born - in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Rumania or Yugoslavia , but who reside in Germany or Austria on the effective date of the DP law , will be deemed , for the purposes of the immigration laws , ' to have been born in Germany or Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Sudeten Germans of Czechoslovakia , as well as others regarded by many as having strong ties with Nazism . To be regarded as-natives of Germany or Austria , this group would compete in the immigration quotas for these countries with Germans acknowledged to be victims of or dissenters from the Nazi regime . Other actions on amendments included the following : Rejection , 50 to 30 , of a Ferguson proposal to enlarge and strengthen the powers of the three member Displaced Persons Commission . Rejection by a close vote of a proposal by Senator Irving M : Ives , Republican , of New York , to enable-any American citizen to adopt , outside of the 200,000 limit , an immigrant orphan under 14 years of age who lost either parent as a result of the war . Adoption by a voice vote of a much narrower amendment relating to adoption of orphans , introduced by Senator Joseph McCarthy , Republican , of Wisconsin .
