Last week Cornell 's Big Red was still the No. 1 football team of the U. S.-according to the American Football Statistical Bureau , which is slowly gaining recognition as an appraiser of college teams . But the nation 's sportswriters , polled weekly by Associated Press , rated Minnesota first . <P> Minnesota is accustomed to good football teams . The State is full of husky farm boys who make powerful linemen , powerful backs . When Minnesota gets a smart quarterback , to boot , it invariably has a great team . This year Minnesota has such a quarterback : Bobby Paffrath . <P> Though not as super-colossal as the undefeated Gophers of 1934-35 , quarterbacked by Phi Beta Kappaman Seidel , this year 's powerhouse has been good enough to beat all its opponents in a schedule far tougher than Cornell 's . On seven successive Saturdays , Minnesota defeated : Washington ( one of the two top teams on the Pacific Coast ) , Nebraska ( best team in the Big Six ) , Ohio State , Iowa ( which knocked Notre Dame out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan ( otherwise undefeated ) and , last week , Purdue . <P> Purdue is probably the weakest opponent on Minnesota 's schedule . Hence , a Dad 's Day crowd of 30,000 , huddled in Minnesota 's Memorial Stadium last week , were scarcely surprised when Bernie Bierman 's titans ran roughshod over Purdue . The bewildered Boilermakers managed to score a touchdown on a series of forward passes , but six points were nowhere near enough . Minnesota , rolling up 327 yards on power plays , plunged over Purdue 's goal line four times , kicked two field goals , chalked up their seventh straight , 33-10-6 . <P> Thanks to Michigan 's giving Northwestern its second licking of the season ( 20-10-13 ) last week , Minnesota , with only one more game to play ( against so-so Wisconsin ) , clinched the Big Ten title , toughest of the country 's nine big intercollegiate championships . <P> Other big games of the week : <P> &gt;At Boston 's Fenway Park , a Boston College team , just as big and fast as Minnesota 's but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first defeat in three years . Score : 19-to-18 . <P> &gt; At College Station , Tex. , the Texas Aggies , another steam roller , squashed Rice , 25-10-0 , for their 19th victory in a row and a probable bid to the Rose Bowl . Mighty Jack Kimbrough , the Aggies ' 220-lb . All-America fullback , carried the ball 18 times for a gain of 108 yards . Bill Henderson , a gangling sophomore , stole the show by catching eight successive forward passes for a gain of 117 yards . <P> &gt;At Hanover , N. H. , an inspired Dartmouth team that had lost more games than it had won this year kept mighty Cornell away from its goal line until three seconds before the final gun . Then , in the snowy dusk , a beautifully timed forward pass gave Cornell the game , 7-10-3 . Later , after viewing moving pictures of the game . Referee W. H. Friesell admitted that the winning touchdown was made on an illegal fifth down . Cornell 's Athletic Director James Lynah promptly relinquished claim to victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
