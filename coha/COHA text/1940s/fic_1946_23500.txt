TROUT IN THE OUICKENING RIVER A Story SALLY CARRIGHAR O NLY a sharpened , seeing look in the trout 's eyes proved that he had wakened . No shift of the eyes had flashed their crystalline shine . The wrongness of some sound had roused him . He peered from his nook along the west shore of the pond . Was there a glisten of wet fur in the polished darkness ? Or did he see the pale clouds hung in the water , moonlight , which had turned to luminous froth the bubbles clinging to the underwater plants ? His shelter was a groove among the sticks of the beaver house . He was holding himself as still as the sticks , so quiet in their tangle that a slippery ooze had grown upon them . His breathing lightened until the water drained through his gills with no perceptible beat , no pulse to send its circular waves out through the pond , revealing that he lay at the center of them . From the edge of the beaver 's sunken pile of aspen boughs a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Some animal must have touched a branch and rubbed out air that was held within its fur . The water swayed ; the creature had begun to swim . Its stroke was not familar to the trout , not one of the rhythms that he knew as harmless or a threat . It had more pulse than a beaver 's paddling or the striding of a moose . It was rougher than the swimming of a fish and heavier than a muskrat 's sculling . At first the trout hadto steady himself with his fins to keep from being slapped against the sticks . But the underwater waves diminished . The last of them struck the shores and clattered back , a liquid echo . The only motion in the pond was its regular mottling flow , a current from the brook to the beaver dam . The surging had torn the film of sleep from a thousand little minds . After it ceased , constrained breaths made the pond seem lifeless . But hunger was a danger too . It rose above the fear of the animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twinkling prowls of the mayfly nymphs , the quickstrokes of the water-boatmen , and the foraging of even tinier creatures mingled in a hum like that of insects in the air , but louder . The lightest sounds were wave-beats in the pond . To the trout 's ears came the twanging of minute activity . Night was nearly over . The trout knew by the brightening of the water , by his own hunger , and the stiffness in his muscles . kle saw the webs of the pelican start to push the bird 's breast over the top of the pond . Its wing-tips dipped in the water , the webs were shoveling back with greater vigor , the breast was shrinking upward . Only the kick of the feet now broke the surface . When the bird was gone , the fin on the trout 's back stood a little higher , and a ripple scalloped from its front edge to the back . The beaver swam to the entrance of the house and climbed in onto the floor . His angry voice came through the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to share his home . The feet of a mother moose and her calf had waded off the bank . They dragged their splashes down the shore to a patch of horsetail . The big soft muffles plunged beneath the surface , closed around the plants , and pulled them dripping from the water . Even yet the trout would not risk showing himself . He was the wariest of all the animals in the pond . B SIDES the stranger 's threat , a more fa- miliar danger kept him hiding . Three times a day an osprey dived in the pond for fish . The trout 's good time-sense held him under cover when its strike was due : at dawn , as soon as the hawk could see its prey ; at noon ; and at sunset , with the first receding wave of light . Most mornings the trout went out for an early swim , returning to his nook before he would be visible from the air ; but not on this day . His wait was an exquisite balancing of instincts . Hunger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow was a stimulation . The current , passing through the walls of the beaver house , divided around the trout . All night its touch had slid along his skin , from nose to tail , as though he endlessly swam forward . Now he was awake to feel the fine strokes down his sides  --  the touch of moving water ; only the sight of moving prey could be more quickening to a trout . But he submitted to the quieting urge . He stayed in his groove , with ears and lateral lines both listening for the hawk . The fluffs of moonlight disappeared in a tremulous green shine . No wind rocked the surface now , but the trout could see the current draining toward the dam . It was a checkered wavering , unhurried and unaltering . Daylight reached the bottom , where the water 's ripples had been fixed in sandy silt . Directly over him the trout could look into the air . His view was circular , and small ; his own length would have spanned it . Beyond that opening the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reflected in it were the floor ofthe pond , the swimming animals , and the underwater plants . The trout could see the lustrous belly of a leopard frog spring past . He also saw , in the mirror spread above , the frog 's bronze spotted back . The pond was a shallow layer of the world , with a ceiling on which its life was repeated upside-down . Upon the surface crashed a huge light-feathered breast . Claws reached and speared a bullhead . A brown throat , then a beak and head came through the top of the pond , and wings and tail . A shower of bubbles scattered downward as the long wings lowered in a sweep . The wings began to lift the osprey . A final thrashing took him out of the surface , leaving the reverberations of his dive . The wariness of the trout released its check . He floated from his groove . He still seemed motionless , as if the current had dislodged him , but slowly his fins commenced a ribbonlike stroke . His tail pressed gently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength in a tail-thrust then , he was across the pond . A spinning turn , and , energy closely held , he slanted toward the bottom silt  --  the touch , and a spasm of upward speed had flung him into the dangerous , dazzling air . A slicing dive back deep in the pond , a glimpse of another trout , and he whipped in its pursuit . But just before his teeth would have nicked its tail , he whirled , and the trout ahead whirled too , in perfect unison . He cut forward in the channel of the current , throwing his tail from side to side as he tried to find in his own speed some full outlet for his strength . The water of the pond would nowhere give him more than a mild and yielding pressure . He was a native of the Snake , a turbulent , swift river , but the placid pond and little brook that fed it were the only home that he had known . In the early summer of the year the beavers built the pond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new dam trapped them and their offspring . The river poured along the east side of the marsh , so near that the trout could feel its deep vibration . He had not seen it , but his spirit cried for its stronger flow , its more combative force . Yet idle swimming could be pleasant . He glided to the backwash past the brook , toward food not scented , seen , or heard , but certain to appear . Sculled by his tail , he wove through bare elastic water-lily stalks , beneath a cover of translucent leaves . He was at rest in motion , fins outspread to ride the smooth support , his slippery skin quick-sliding through the wetness . But he stiffened , shot ahead , bent nose to tail , kicked back the tail in a sharp return , perhaps to savor the grace of a body incapable of awkwardness in an element incapable of angles : beautiful play . He saw a streaming like fine grasses drawn by the current  --  dace ! With a forward spring he snatched a minnow at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the leaders swung to flee into the brook . The milling of the others would have made each one available to the trout , but he swerved away . He 'd seen a pair of reedy , jointed legs , seeming to be rooted in the silt , but still , not quivering as reeds would in the flow of the pond . The dace swam toward them . The dace had left the safety of the shallows because a harmless moose was splashing there . The trout had captured one , and now the great blue heron certainly would catch another . But would not catch the trout ! Already he was far beyond the stab of the bird 's beak . He had fled , although the heron could not take so thick a fish into its gullet . The water near the shore was swishing with the feet of ducks . A quick look ; no mergansers ' feet , with paddle-toes for diving , there among the webs of mallards , pintails , and of baldpates . The trout swam under them . He need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were moving the duCks about in search of food , while they were easy , pushing webfuls of water back and folding in and drawing forward ; not while one foot hung , a pivot , and the other swung an oval breast ; or both of a duck 's webs splashed at the surface , holding him bill-down . As long as no fear tensed the feet , the trout felt safe . MHE long stripe on a pintail 's neck I shone white as it lowered the bird 's head , swanlike , to the bottom . But swiftly it was pulled above the surface . Now all MAGAZINE the feet were quiet , spread from the feathered bellies , ready for a leap . The trout , alert , poised in midwater , He did not learn what animal had frightened the ducks . While they continued their wary wait , the white keel of the pelican dipped through the surface , slid ahead , and , checked by its wide webs , glided to a stop . The trout streamed down to the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed since he became too large for a pelican to bag . His caution was a habit . When he was a young fish , nearly every animal he saw seemed hungry for him . One by one then he outgrew the threat of frogs , kingfishers , snakes , and larger trout . He learned the tricks of human fishermen . Minks and mergansers chased him still but could not capture him . No other creature in the pond was quite so swift . And he was almost too heavy to be carried by an osprey . Soon the trout would reach security that few wild creatures know , unless the alien of the early morning proved a danger . Every instinct whispers some command ; for him the loudest command was always , live , He listened for it , always deferred his other urges to it . Survival was so strong an impulse in him that the most involuntary workings of his body helped him hide . The sheen on his pale belly matched the cover of the pond , to an eye below . One watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales with the scales of sunlight on the ripples . The black spots spattered on his skin disguised his shape when seen from any angle . To a mate or rival he might show two crimson gashes on his throat , but usually he folded them beneath his jaws . After he dived from the pelican , he started to the beaver house . First he passed a bank of sedges . In summer when their shade was green , the trout had turned to emerald here . This autumn day the grass was tawny , and its color , focused in his eyes , had caused the grains of yellow in his skin to scatter out and tint him olive . If the inborn guardian in his tissues could arrange it , he would live . Yet other animals also had ingenious aids , some useful in attack . He circled an island near the dam , now slipping through a tunnel of fowl-grass , bent with the tips of the blades awash . The sun was laying gold bars over him . He moved with a little flourish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side of the island a floating log pressed down the top of the pond . He started under  --  and was circled with a crash . Escape ! Escape to a nook in the dam ! He split the water and was there . Wheeling , he shot in the hole and flung out his fins to check him . The water bulged in after him , as the one who chased him surged to a stop outside . He had not seen what creature dived from the log . But his dash to the shelter , finished between heartbeats , was long enough to tell him that the other gained . Gained ! Did panic echo , now , from days when the rush of most pursuers swept upon him like a wave ? His refuge was a space in the roots of a cottonwood , a dead tree anchoring the dam . Through interwoven fibers he could see his enemy , an animal he did not know , an otter . The creature darted around the root-maze , trying to peer in . His eyes would show in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a quick foot and the brown-furred face would push into another hole . Eagerly it was weaving forward , cocked ears sharp as claws . The otter found a looser tangle , which his paws began to tear . The water was tainted with the scent of his excitement , acrid in the nostrils of the trout . Close beside the trout 's face now a lean webbed paw had grasped a root . The claws were scratching , as the toes kept tightening in convulsive grips . The otter tried to burrow through , but the tangle held . Should the trout attempt to reach the sturdier beaver house ? No longer was there safety in a flight . He tensed his tail for a great thrust ; yet he hesitated . As suddenly then as if the otter had smelled a more accessible fish , he drew back out of the roots . The trout could see him swim with a vertical sculling , so that each roll took him to the top . The pulses in the water matched the surging that had stirred the pond at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming and with others ' startled movements . When the trout could feel the light , quick overlap of wavelets nearly spent , he knew that the otter had gone to the far end of the pond . Then he could have fled to the beaver house , but he was waiting for the osprey 's midday dive . His new fear had not blurred his sense of the older menace . The osprey 's perch was in the tree whose roots now hid him . He could not see the hawk in the boughs , but when the spread wings glided out , they came into his air-view . He watched , as he never had from the beaver house , the way the osprey hovered high above his victim , and how he plunged , so slanting his dive that he dropped from behind an unsuspecting fish . The trout could recognize the jolting of the pond , the splashing as the osprey struggled from the water , the sudden quiet , and the widening of the echoes . The hawk returned in his air-view , carrying a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he flew back down to clean his claws . The trout could see them cross the pond , thin hooks that cut the surface , trailing silvered sacs of air . At last the water near the cottonwood roots sucked up , a motion meaning that some heavy animal was climbing out . A gust of drops fell onto the surface , as the creature shuddered the moisture from its fur . Feet ran over the top of the dam . As they passed the base of the tree , a sift of dirt fell through the roots and briefly stuck to the mucous coating on the skin of the trout . MHE pond was all in motion , for the wind had risen . The wind had stirred the marsh for several days , with brief lulls . The trout sensed that it brought a change of season . He could even taste the proof of summer 's end , as dust , seeds , crumbling leaves , and bark washed through the pond . Bright-edged shadows of the waves were racing over the bottom silt . They swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surface layer of the pond was blowing to the upper end . There the water turned below , to sweep back down along the bottom . At the dam this flowing sheet rolled up again . It lifted beneath the trout 's fins , as a breeze will lift against the wings of a bird . Whenever the wind would press the top of the rigid dead tree , he could feel a pulling in the roots . Suddenly they began to writhe , to tear . The trout was out of the maze and back in the beaver house as if the water had parted for him . The osprey 's tree , upturned by the wind , fell into the pond . Billows met rebounding billows , whirls and eddies struggled , surges rocked the trout . Gradually the violence quieted . Through a cloud of mud he dimly saw that the trunk of the tree was under the surface , propped up from the bottom on its boughs . H E SETTLED himself to feel the current 's long touch on his sides . But what disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular , yet took a new course  --  not from his nose to tail , but downward now . The water 's pressure was becoming lighter and its color rosier . The top of the pond was falling . Inherited memories warned him that the change was ominous . But he did not leave his shelter . For it seemed that a greater danger threatened : the otter had returned . Sometimes he was in the water , sometimes out along its narrowing shores . Victims were everywhere , as the animals , distracted , tried to flee from the pond . The trout would not be caught through panic . He lay in his nook and watched the drop of the surface over him . Only when it reached the nook itself did he nose outside . Hearing the otter near , he turned down to a refuge lower in the wall . The top of the pond descended on him there . He hovered in the entrance . The water , draining off the bank beside the house , was roily . He could not see where he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide him . The currents were not flowing in familiar paths . They all converged in a powerful new suction . Since the cottonwood tree had braced the dam , its fall had torn apart the beavers ' masonry of mud and sticks . The whole marsh seemed to be swirling toward the gap and plunging through it . The trout turned back against the pressure . He would escape to the brook . He sensed that he must leave the doomed pond and would seek the water 's source , as the other fish had done . He could notreach it . While he , the one most wary , had stayed in the house to avoid the otter , the pond had fallen far below the mouth of the brook . Now the only water that connected them was a thin sheet crinkling over a pebble bar . Gone , lost above the surface , were the undercut banks of roots , the grassy tunnels , brush , and other shoreline hideaways . The trout returned to the lower end of the pond . He glided with his fins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slight a sculling that he might be trying to make smoothness hide him . As he approached the dam , he saw the otter . Dodging up the bottom toward the island , he slipped beneath the log , which drifted now with one end resting on the silt . The otter was walking on the floor of the pond , moving with a swing from his shoulders to his high arched rump . He somersaulted to the surface for a breath , then looped and tumbled through the water . He straightened toward the hole in the dam . The fluent column of his body merged with the strands of the current , and he vanished . The surface soon was shattered by a splash . The otter was back . He had climbed up over the dam , beside the gap . He dived in , disappeared through the break , and again returned . A plunge , a joining with the water 's sweep , and a swift ride : he had found a game . The trout was holding down his top fin , tense with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under side of the log . Yet his belly touched the silt . The log was the pond 's last refuge , but the water soon would leave it . Nothing in the trout 's experience could help him . He only could give himself to the instinct that so intensely pressed to have him live . He waited until the otter had dived and once more swung into the hole . Leaving the log with a jet of speed , the trout had reached the gap . A gushing force took hold of him . It hurled him through the break . Too quick for thought he dodged the wreckage of the darn . He leapt to pass the brink of the fall and dropped in the foam beneath . He stayed with the current pulling out . The tumult slowed . He found himself in a shallow creekbed , moving over cobblestones . His high emotion quickened his choice of route : to the left , through streamers of emerald algae ; right , along a slit between the stones ; here a turn to miss a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close above him . Sometimes he drew a breath of it , and it seared his gills with dryness . Avoiding one by one the unfamiliar hazards , he progressed . His lateral lines were jarred by a new sound , a tremendous , heavy pouring . He swam around a bend in the creek and slid across a bar . And there a torrent plunged upon him , water more swift than any he had known . He was in the river , the violent flood of the Snake . It nearly overwhelmed him , but he found a milder flow along the bank . A curve there held a pool as in a shell . The pool was covered by a sweeper , a willow with its caught debris . The trout discovered the refuge , entered it , and spiraled down in cool green quiet . ffiHROUGH the afternoon he stayed I there , gaining back his poise and fitting his spirit to the strange new shape of his life . Most of the time he hung in the water , motionless , but now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breaths as with excitement . When the first gray wave of dusk washed over the pool , he rose to the top . He swam along the bank , where small waves pattered into crevices among the roots . The motion of the water here was light and peaceful like the pond 's . Turning out , he met a crisper current , stimulating as the pond had never been . But a greater challenge growled from the center of the river , from grinding rocks that yielded to the push of water irresistibly strong . The trout began to slant his strokes into the torrent . With a leap he sprang to the very heart of its taut pressure . Enormous weight bore down upon him , but he gripped it , driving his way against it with exultant power . To fight ! To fight the turbulent river ! To sharpen his nerves on its chill ; to cut quick arcs through the weaving water ; to throw so much force into his muscles ' swing that they could drive him upstream , past the rocks beneath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the air and see the river under him , a river wider than the pond , wide for his play  --  all this , the heritage of a trout , he knew now for the first time . He faced the flood and , sculling exactly at the current 's pace , remained above the same stone . Swirling past were many , insects , blown in the river . He stayed only to take a cricket , for exhilaration sang in his nerves . He leapt But stopped , caught . Talons had stabbed into his flesh , were now locked through it : They were holding him in the center of a splash . A feathered throat was lowering before his eyes . Wings were sweeping , down at the sides , enclosing him . The os prey , forgotten in his conquest of the river , had made its sunset dive . H is torn nerves stung the trout to action . The claws were powerful that bound him , but his thrashing bent their grip . They almost rigidly resisted , but they did bend. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force  --  to fight ! His instinct focused on one urge , to get himself in deeper water . Arching his body downward , he furiously tried to scull from side to side . The hawk 's wings beat , attempting to lift his own weight and the trout 's . The wings and the driving paddle of the trout 's tail pulled against each other . So far the trout had not been able to drag the bird down , but he held him under the surface of the water . The torrent was aiding the fish . For the hawk was growing desperate for a breath . At first the spines on the pads of his feet had pierced the skin of the trout . They no longer pressed their hold . And the trout could feel the talons in his flesh release their clutch . The hawk was trying to withdraw them , but their curving points were caught securely . The bird and fish were swirling downstream . They jolted to a stop , snagged by the willow sweeper . The water 's force was beating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push of the wings was weakening . They suddenly relaxed , awash in the flow . And the claws were limp . The trout had fought another pressure , his exhaustion . When the straining of the talons ceased , he too relaxed . For long enough to gather a little strength , he waited . Then he began an intermittent thrashing . With bursts of effort he tried to jerk himself away . One by one the claws worked out , some slipping loose but more of them tearing through his sides . Finally a twist of his body sent him forward , free . He turned down under the willow , lower and lower in the dark pool . With his flesh so cut , his lateral lines no longer caught so well the echo of his motions , thus to guide him . So he was careful not to swim against the bottom . His chin touched , and he sank upon a stone . It was smooth , and soft with slime-coat algae . Soon he had drifted over on his side . His eyes were dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T HE stimulation of the torrent had in- duced him to ignore his innate caution . But now he was listening again to instinct , not to the water 's roar . As he lay and waited for his strength to seep back into him , no creature could be alive and yet more passively obedient . The water 's cold had numbed the anguish in his severed nerves . It would draw his wounds together . Already it had put in winter sluggishness the parasites that possibly would enter his exposed wounds . And gradually , as he rested , the cold became a tonic to his temper . Cold was as sharpening to him as the warm sun is to insects . By midnight he was swimming experimentally around the bottom . He circled higher . The osprey was gone from the willow . The trout moved out of the pool , but stayed in quiet water . He found a backwash near the bank and held himself on the edge , where a smooth flow passed . Moonlight , falling on the surface , showed that a drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . His eye discovered a bright bit up ahead . He swayed forward . His mouth opened , touched it , and it broke with a singing snap . More came floating toward him  --  little round stars . Some winked out . He let the others pass . But here was what he liked , a mayfly . Earlier in the day the year 's last swarm had left the river for their brief erotic life . Now their delicate spent bodies would be nourishment for the trout , if there would be enough of them . There were . After his hunger had been satisfied , he took another , shot it out of his mouth for the chance of catching it again , of biting it in two and tossing out and snapping up the pieces . He was no longer shaped like a smooth wedge , for the cover of one gill was hanging loose , and his sides were ragged . And so his balance in the turns of the water was not perfect ; his fins were all spread , needed now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an easy motion , easy as a creature can be only when it feels that more of living is ahead . The winter , when a trout was quiet , would be long enough for his wounds to heal , and for his nerves to sharpen . Soon the last migrating osprey would be gone , but would come back . And otters might be hunting here . The trout must learn the dangers of this flood , and learn to be wary even while he was exhilarated by it . He would . The wisdom of instinct , as of intelligence , can be disregarded , and it also can be drawn upon . By the time he would be ready to try his strength once more against the river , the Snake would be a slapping , dodging , driving , wild spring torrent .
