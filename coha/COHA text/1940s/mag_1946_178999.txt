Astronomers last week rejoiced in a blessed event : the birth of a nova ( " new " star ) . In the constellation Corona Borealis , the humble star called " T " had jumped its luminosity a thousand times . First to take notice was Astronomer Armin Deutsch of Wisconsin 's Yerkes Observatory . Promptly , his beaming boss , Director Otto Struve , sent a telegram to Harvard , world clearinghouse of astronomical news . Back came a pat on the back . That same star , said Harvard , had misbehaved before . A crude old photograph , taken in 1866 , proved that T Corona Borealis was a " repeating nova , " very rare . <P> Alerted from Harvard , astronomers all over the world excitedly swung their telescopes toward the exploding star . For novae , especially repeating novae , attract astronomers as porch lights attract June bugs . <P> Exploding stars are the unfinished business of science . Astronomers can measure the speed of the white-hot gases billowed out by the blast ( up to 3,000 miles per second ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One theory : when the interior of a star reaches a certain critical temperature , an atomic reaction takes place which releases vast amounts of energy . Astronomers hope that these " atomic bombs " of the sky will teach them more about earthly atomic energy . <P> Most famous nova in history was the Star of Bethlehem , which led the Wise Men from the East . If it was as brilliant as Christmas cards show it , it may even have been a " super-nova " - an extra-fancy explosion which takes place in the Milky Way about once in 300 years , and for a short time gives off more light than all the rest of its stars put together .
