REPUBLICANS Mr. Willkie 's Man Farley <P> ( See Cover ) <P> GOPoliticians last week were sure that the thing they had dreaded all along had come to pass : the holy-rolling crusade of Wendell Willkie had gone sour . <P> The first rumor to get around was that Wendell Willkie was just a super-hawker who had sold the Republican Convention a bill of goods . Last week , spreading rapidly through professional ranks was the belief that maybe Willkie was only a fatter , louder Alf Landon . When was he going to settle down and tend to his muttons-to winning an election for the Republican Party ? Groaning Republicans saw Franklin Roosevelt , looking as insouciant as a gambler with a sure thing , planted before a backdrop of big guns , while Vice-Presidential Candidate Wallace anointed him the only true St. George . In Washington Republican politicians fumed with frustration . As GOPropaganda in an ironic vein , Missouri 's Congressman Dewey Short croaked : " Franklin Roosevelt is not running against Wendell Willkie . He 's running against Adolf Hitler . ' ' Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . " Polls showed that Willkie vas ho ' . dmg his own , momentarily . He still drew curious crowds . But these things failed to cheer many Republican politicians . In their gloomy minds , they recalled the black year of 1936 when Alf Landon had had an early lead in polls . In 1928 , the whole U. S. turned out to see Al Smith roll by , with cigar , brown derby , wisecracks , East S:dese ard all . As one sad Old Guardsman pontificated to another : dead whales on flat cars also attract crowds . <P> The pessimism of professionals sprang from simple instinct . They had not wanted Willkie in the beginning . But for nine weeks they had tried to show him loyalty , proffer their service and support , make suggestions , consult . Some of them had been waved in &; out of Colorado Springs for a smile , a handshake , a drink . Many - like William ( " Bill " ) Ditter , chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee-had never been consulted at all . Others-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to Colorado Springs with a 14-page legalistic essay on how the G. O. P. could get around the Hatch Act limit of $3,000,000 on national-campaign spending-had been shown the door . How could anyone so politically insensible win the biggest political game of all ? Up &; down the corridors professionals wailed that a renegade Democrat , rammed down their throats , was wrecking the first real chance of a G. O. P. national victory in eight bitter years . <P> Renegade Democrat . If Candidate Willkie had any inkling of all this , last week , he showed small concern . The only gloom in Rushville , Ind . was a deep , cool shade beneath black walnut and apple trees , out in back of t ie 80-year-old worn brick house on Harrison Street which he had rented as a temporary residence . Wearing carpet slippers , Willkie lolled under the trees , supremely confident of victory .
