txt Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio said today at a press conference that he would enter the Ohio Presidential preference primaries May 9 . The Governor declined to make a statement regarding any other 1944 campaign plans , but re-marked : " I will definitely enter the Ohio primaries as a Republican Presidential candidate . " This was the first public statement of his Presidential aspirations , which were considered to have been helped by his sweeping victory as a third-term candidate for Governor of Ohio in 1942 . Under Ohio law , the written consent of a candidate in a Presidential preference primary must be obtained before the name can be entered on the ballot . The Ohio Governor is the first potential candidate to formally announce his intentions . But Wendell Willkie has made it clear that he is seeking the nomination . Supporters of Harold E. Stassen , former Governor of Minnesota and now a lieutenant commander in the Navy , have announced they will enter his name in the Nebraska Presidential primary to be held April 11 . Governor Bricker , answering questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-war planning is not feasible at present . " Our Government must , in cooperation with other Governments , meet post-war problems as they arise , or anticipate them before they come up and eliminate them , " he added . " I think it would be dangerous to say what we are going to do when the war is over , because we are fighting a world war in cooperation with other nations , and one of the quickest ways to destroy that cooperation would be for the United States to take an adamant stand on their post-war position now . We must await developments . " The nation can not blueprint its post-war plans now because it does n't know what conditions will be . Post-war planning now is just not feasible simply because we can not anticipate those conditions . " Governor Bricker said he did not want to see America " give up her sovereignty as long as I am an American citizen , but , on the other hand , we should not insist on being the big power . " " I think there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England for real cooperation , " he went on . " I take their statements at face value . We must ; they are our allies . " Says Election Showed Trend Commenting on last week 's elections , he said : " The New Deal is through . There is n't any question in my mind but that the American people are through with it . I do n't think the Republican trend demonstrated in last week 's elections will change even if the war is going on . We are in the midst of a definite trend . " A Republican victory at the polls next year " would be an assurance to the world and to ourselves that we still govern ourselves , " he said . Although the Governor declared he was in favor of a soldier ballot , he said such ballots must be secret to be effective . " Frankly , I think the soldiers should be given every opportunity to vote , but it should be just as secret as any in the States , " he went on . " It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good idea if we can not preserve secrecy , which would be more essential in the Army than any place else . The ballot ought to be exactly the same ballot the civilians vote on , with the names of candidates printed on it . " Would " Tolerate " Subsidies Although Governor Bricker said he would " tolerate " wartime subsidy programs " if they are necessary , " he added , " there is no justification for a subsidy program when peace is finally established . " The idea of appropriations for the education of soldiers after the ' war is sound , he stated , . " but that ought to be handled through establisher schools and departments of education in various States , and not through another NYA . " The Governor listed these as his " dissatisfactions with the New Dear : " Inefficiency of government . Tremendous building up of bureau power . Inefficiency with which it has been carried on . Arrogance of Federal bureaucracy . Breaking down of local government . Attempts to suppress the States . Domination of the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of public policy with which vital interests of the nation are concerned . Continuing of that program , costly as it is , in the midst of the war . "
