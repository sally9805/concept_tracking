txt Representative Clarence J. Brown of Ohio , campaign manager for Senator Robert A. Taft , and Herbert Brownell Jr . of New York , one of the three campaign managers for Gov . Thomas E. Dewey , arrived today to open headquarters for these two candidates for the Republican nomination for President . With the opening of the Republican National Convention only a week away , the battle for delegates by the three leading avowed contenders or the nomination has gained full headway . Ted Gamble , campaign manager for Harold E. Stassen , former Governor of Minnesota , has been here for a week with headquart rs at 1424 Walnut Street . The Taft headquarters are in the Benjamin Franklin Hotel and the Dewey headquarters are in the Bellevue-Stratford . In a press interview at Taft headquarters , Mr. Brown repeated his prediction that Senator Taft would lead on the first ballot and estimated his first ballot strength at 312 votes , if it was found advisable to throw them all in at that time . Mr. Brown was asked how many votes he expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - six delegates from that state finished casting a complimentary vote for Gov . Dwight H. Green . " We will get our full share , " he replied . Mr. Brown added that he did list want to discuss the delegate situation state by state . He said that he had offered one of the major magazines a breakdown of the Taft first ballot strength to justify his claim of 312 votes if the Dewey and Stassen campaign managers would make public a similar breakdown . Mr. Brown said he did not think it would be a deadlocked convention and predicted that the nomination for President would come from the fourth to the seventh ballot . " That would not be a deadlocked convention , " he said . " My idea of a deadlocked convention is the Democratic convention in 1924 , when that convention was deadlocked between Alfred E. Smith and William G. for more than a hundred ballots . " Mr. Brown was asked if there has been any conference with supporters of Mr. Stassen to organize a Taft-Stassen stop-Dewey movement . " You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he replied . " If I were managing the Stamen or Dewey campaign , I would be trying to find some way to beat Taft . " Mr. Brown said that Senator Taft would come to Philadelphia as soon as adjournment of Congress made it possible and that he possibly would arrive on Saturday and certainly by Sunday . At the Bellevue-Stratford , Mr. Brownell said that he and Edwin F. Jaeckle , of Buffalo , had come here to open Dewey headquarters , and that J. Russel Sprague , national committeeman , the third of the New York Governor 's campaign managers , would be here tomorrow . Dewey 's headquarters will be opened Sunday night with a reception for Governor and Mrs. Dewey sponsored by the New York Women 's Committee for Dewey . " Governor Dewey will have more first-ballot votes than any other candidate , " Brownell said , adding that he did not wish to give specific figures at this time . Asked if ne agreed with Mr. Dewey 's statement made at the Governor 's Conference in New Hampshire , that he regarded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he did , and added : " As I recall it , the Governor said he based that statement on reports from Messrs . Sprague , Jaeckle and Brownell . " Mr. Brownell said that supporters of the New York Governor had been encouraged by the result of the most recent Gallup Poll which showed Governor Dewey leading in a poll , of Republicans and going ahead of Mr. Stassen . " We have a candidate who is leading in the number of delegates ' supporting him and who is the most popular among the rank and file of party members , " he said . " It 's pretty hard to beat that combination . " The Dewey supporters also have been encouraged by the apparent ; strength Governor Dewey has developed in the Pennsylvania delegation . It ' has become apparent that G. Mason Owlett , National Committee man and a leader of the group which looks to Joseph R. Grundy for advice , is inclined to support Mr. Dewey after the Pennsylvania delegation with 73 votes stops voting for Senator Edward Martin . Jay Cooke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates , who declined to estimate the Stassen strength in the Pennsylvania delegation , said : " My feeling is that the Pennsylvania delegates are desperately anxious to do a good job , but are not crystallized on any candidate , * In that connection , they , do not propose to allow the vote of the Pennsylvania delegation to be as meaningless as it was in 1940 . Mr. Cooke 's reference to the 1940 convention was an allusion to the fact that the Pennsylvania delegation , most of which had been voting for Arthur H. James , then Governor , were in caucus at the time when the late Wendell L. Willkie already had obtained a majority on the roll-call for the Presidential nomination , and the vote of Pennsylvania was cast for him after the nomination had been decided , The national committee will meet Thursday to hold hearing on contests . Contests so far filed include Alaska with 3 delegates , the District of Columbia with 3 , Georgia with 16 , Mississippi with 8 and South Carolina with 6 . The committee also has received word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sixteen delegates .
