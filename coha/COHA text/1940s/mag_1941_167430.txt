One of the biggest , heaviest pieces of sculpture on sale in the U.S. last week was bought by a museum with a name so new that no one seemed to know it . The Norton Gallery and School of Art in West Palm Beach ( Fla. ) paid $10,000 for the yellow , 1,000-pound Youth , by William Zorach . The man who signed the check , and who has signed all the checks so far for Florida 's newest palace of culture , was a spare , 65-year-old , fiddle-playing Chicago tycoon ( Acme Steel ) , Ralph H. Norton . <P> It was Ralph Norton who decided that what West Palm Beach needed was an art museum . He first visited the town in 1898 , when it sported only two resort hotels .

When at last he and his wife decided that their picture collection had outgrown their Chicago house , he knew exactly what to do about it .

Says Norton : " It is just the right kind of place for such an institution . Results since the gallery opened confirm our belief . Lots of lookers . " <P> Donor Norton is pretty well satisfied with the 145 paintings he gave the museum : he and his wife spent 20 years collecting them . Sixty are by contemporary U.S. artists-Robert Brackman , Eugene Speicher , Leon Kroll , Maurice Sterne , Robert Philipp , Jerry Farnsworth . Earlier U.S. artists like Inness , Whistler , Frederick Waugh , Elliott Daingerfield , are represented . English portraitists , a few illustrative old and French Impressionist masters help round out the collection . <P> With last week 's purchase of the bulky Zorach , plus six other American sculptures , adding up to a total of 17 pieces , Donor Norton felt he had done his bit for the museum 's sculpture . He still cocks a collector 's eye at new pictures : a good new American can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.Y. , where he has sailed his boats and presided over the Board of Trustees since 1937.
