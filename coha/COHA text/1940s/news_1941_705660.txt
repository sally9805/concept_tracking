txt The war proclamations delivered yesterday by Hitler and Molotoff as the mouthpiece of Stalin sound like a dialogue in hell , supposing hell to be some subeellar in the moral universe where evil is good and falsehood is truth . Each accuses the other of " unparalleled perfidy " ; each charges the other with all the crimes he himself has committed ; each calls the other a liar and a traitor . As the curtain-raiser for an act of aggression that breaks all precedents , as Hitler boasts , for an invasion that begins at the White Spa and does not end at the Black Sea , these speeches strike the perfect key . They suggest why it is that anything can happen in this war . You can not count on the expected or the unexpected when you are dealing with minds moving in an unknown dimension , cut loose from every standard of reason , decency or consistency that shapes the common law of mankind . " Weighted down with heavy cares , condemned to months-long silence , the hour has now come when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed the fantastic monologue in which he tells all comes close to the truth in the sense that it paints a true picture of his own mental processes . In Tux TIMES Magazine yesterday appeared an excerpt from " Mein Kampf " which might have been an introductory note to Hitler 's pronouncement . From the beginning he has advocated lying as an instrument of policy and the big lie in preference to the little lie . Asserting that propaganda must appeal forever and only to the masses , he wrote that " with the primitive simplicity of their minds they will more easily fall victims to a great tie than to a small . " " By propaganda even heaven can be palmed off on a people as hell , " he added , " and the most wretched life as paradise . " Nobody knew Hitler 's philosophy as well as Stalin , who is a past master in the same tactics . One can not waste much sympathy on the Soviet leader for the betrayal he has suffered . He gave the signal for the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own skin by turning the tide of battle westward . He cynically cleared the way for " the clique of bloodthirsty Fascist rulers of Germany , " to quote the words of Molotoff , " who have enslaved Frenchmen . Czechs , Poles , Serbians . Norway , Belgium , Denmark , Holland , Greece and other nations . " By an act of retributive justice his pact with the Germans has turned out to be a boomerang . The sad annals of appeasement furnish no such examples of bribes and concessions as those made to Stalin by Hitler and to Hitler by Stalin . These two , after all , are not merely the appeased but the prize appeasers , and it is somethineto see that even between themselves the policy failed to work . This time , however , Russia is the victim of German aggression , and this does tilt the scales in her favor sufficiently to justify Mr. Churchill 's instant declaration of support for the Soviets . Hitler 's charge that there has been a " coalition " between the British and Russians is sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ignored in Moscow . He was always threatening to leave because his position was intolerable . This is only one of a hundred whoppers which Hitler weaves into an apologia that reaches a new high in falsification and a new low in self-contradiction . Either he has become the liar who has come to believe his own lies  --  and this is fatal to the success of duplicity  --  or he is unnerved by the knowledge that nobody believes them . The moment must arrive when the whirling-dervish policy will appear like madness to the German people . Hitler 's repeated allusions to Russian efforts to undermine not only the Balkan govennments but that of the Reich itself suggest that he is already troubled by signs of distrust of his own regime . Making war on Russia is the best proof not simply that Hitler 's pacts are worthless but that they do not work . Molotoff says that Germany made no demands on the Soviet Government , and while the tension of the past fortnight contradicts this statement , there is every reason to believe that the concessions asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and remain in power . This would signify that the Nazis were determined to invade , and this in turn implies one of two things . The first is that control has passed into the hands of the super-confident as distinct from the cautious minds that have so far directed German war moves . The gamblers have been convinced by the success of the lightning moves in Poland , France and the Balkans that Russia can be quickly subdued by a swift advance in force all along the line . The other and more likely explanation is that Hitler can not wait for the slow process of wearing Stalin down . The war against Russia means that he needs Russian oil and wheat , not merely to feed his war machine for the big task ahead now that American intervention is an actuality , but to feed the hungry and restless populations of the Europe he has reduced to misery . Perhaps he can win as quickly as he evidently must , though here again he may not have counted on the difficulty of exploiting the Russian resources after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own power but on the power of German organization and efficiency . Or perhaps victory has gone to his head . But the German people today must be asking one bitter question : What price victories for us ?
