When the steel industry dropped the basing-point system ( TIME , July 19 ) , Big Steel 's Ben Fairless began to worry about the fate of Pittsburgh . Because it normally makes more steel than local industries can use , he thought some of the steel plants would have to move away to find a market . But last week , it seemed likely that the market would come to Pittsburgh . <P> Detroit 's Kelsey-Hayes Wheel Co. ( 6,000 employees ) bought a plant near Pittsburgh and planned to turn out 30% of its manufacturing there . The replacement of basing points by f.o.b. pricing had boosted the company 's steel bill $9.20 a ton , and it would save money by being at Pittsburgh . Encouraged by the plant shift , the Pittsburgh Industrial Development Council began tootling its horn to attract other fugitives from freight charges . But Detroit , which uses twice as much steel as it produces , started a campaign to make more . Said . its board of commerce : " We have iron ore going right past our door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coal . "
