Publisher George W. Greene ( TIME , Dec. 21 ) of the weekly Waupun ( Wis . ) Leader-News last week advertised in the Publishers ' Auxiliary : <P> Help Wanted <P> EDITORIAL <P> GIRL JOURNALISM GRADUATE <P> with at least a year 's weekly experience on news and ads needed badly to assist publisher of good weekly . Prefer gal who is a perfect 36 , beautiful , smart , willing to work for $5 a week , interested in weekly papers . Protestant , Catholic , Jewish , white or colored . Because of the war we might waive some or all preferences . Office is cold in winter , hot as hell in summer , the toughest weekly joint in the state to work in because we 're ornery . We also expect perfection in other folks . We serve beer when the 40-year-old has a birthday and serve sarcastic remarks anytime . You 'll suffer here , but you 'll be a newspaper man or fired before you go , so do n't come for a two-month holiday ...      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
