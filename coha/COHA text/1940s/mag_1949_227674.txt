RETAIL TRADE Have a Shirt <P> The familiar gold-and-black " A. Schulte " cigar-store signs on 186 busy streetcorners in the East and Midwest will be coming down soon . Up in their places will go flashy new signs reading : " D. A. Schulte , Inc. , Fashion Haberdashery for Men &; Women . ' ' Instead of cigar stores that dabbled in men 's ties , shirts and socks , this week Schulte 's was turning itself into clothing stores that dabbled in tobacco . <P> Schulte has been flirting with the haberdashery business for nearly ten years , ever since the company went through bankruptcy reorganization in 1940 . The new management figured that those who came in for cigarettes and tobacco might also walk out with a shirt or tie . Many did . But since men who knew tobacco best were running things , the haberdashery business was not pushed very hard . It failed to halt a decline in sales , and profits shriveled to a paltry $30,276 in 1948 . <P> When Schulte turned in a $93,091 loss for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldvogel up to chairman of the board and brought in 50-year-old H. Cornell Smith , onetime merchandising manager of Manhattan 's Gimbel Bros , department store . Smith has tackled some big jobs in his time . As a World War II colonel on General Somervell 's staff , he helped organize the billion-dollar Wartime Post Exchange system , and the Pacific supply centers for the never-launched invasion of Japan . <P> Smith studied store traffic , found that 50% of cigarette customers were women , and announced the new policy . To catch the feminine eye , Smith will stock nylons , purses , costume jewelry and cosmetics . If the new-type store catches on , he hopes to make Schulte the " fastest-growing chain in America .
