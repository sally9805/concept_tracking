There was a whoopla in Toronto last week that should soon spread all over Canada . The Canadian Army unloosed a high-spirited , always likable , often lavish soldier show . The Yank 's This Is The Army had given it a model to learn from and then disregard . Two Toronto sergeants , 26-year-old Frank Shuster and 24-year-old Johnny Wayne , had authored a peppy book , some perky tunes and lyrics . Canada 's Jack Arthur , Broadway 's Romney Brent and Hollywood 's Aida Broadbent had punched the show into shape . And civilian donations had decked it out in mighty fine feathers . <P> With only a quarter as many as This Is the Army 's cast of 300 , The Army Show provides no breath-taking spectacle of massed men in uniform , no rafter-shaking choruses . Nor has it an Irving Berlin to give it tunes like I Left My Heart at the Stage Door Canteen or This Is the Army , Mr. Jones . But it has the CWACS ( Canadian Women 's Army Corps ) to lend it lure . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities to swell the Troops Welfare Fund , it will tour Canada 's army camps ( in shortened form ) , later troupe for the boys overseas . <P> The first half of the show , laid in a canteen , moves fast with sentiment , boogie-woogie , corn with butter and salt , corn without them , a male cancan , a brass-hat quartet , which warbles : <P> On behalf . . . of the General Staff <P> We 'd like to warn the critics to be careful what they write , <P> Their write-ups should be written in a favorable light ; <P> Who knows what letters for the draft are on their way tonight <P> On behalf . . . of the General Staff. * <P> The second half of the show verges on large-scale revue . Soldiers dream of beautiful white-clad women ; a handsome ballet to Chopin has a lyrical start , a lunatic finish ; a big South American number combines hot dancing with jokes ( " Army life is terribly strict-lights out at 9 o'clock , women out at 10 " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the stage while the cast slides into the past with Tipperary , Pack Up Your Troubles , Mad'moiselle from Armentieres . Then the cast roars into the future with : <P> We 'll make a job of it this time , <P> We 're gon na show them and how ; <P> For this time is gon na be the last time , <P> So let 's make a job of it now. * <P> <P> *Reprinted by permission of the copyright owners : Gordon V.
