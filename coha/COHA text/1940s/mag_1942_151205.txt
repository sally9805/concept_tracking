The brown , lean men gazed down the barrels of their Dutch and American rifles at the yellow visitors . The brown men fired . The yellow men fell . Dutch officers urged on the Amboinese-the best native troops in The Netherlands East Indian Army . Japanese aircraft appeared again &; again with bombs for Amboina . There were very few Dutch , U.S. or Australian planes to meet them . Soon more yellow men came than the brown men could kill . The brown men 's green uniforms melted back into the green jungles . So fell Amboina , the Indies ' second naval base , a key to Java . <P> Japanese bombers ravaged the hot and busy streets of Surabaya in eastern Java , heralding a seaborne drive at the Indies ' No. 1 naval base . The U.S. Asiatic Fleet was based at Surabaya , and before the bombs came U.S. sailors strolling among the stucco shops , the bright roadways , the bungalowed suburbs thought it was all remarkably like home . <P> At the northern approaches to Java the Jap strengthened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought southward toward Banjermasin on Borneo 's south coast , 300 miles from Java . <P> Japanese planes dropped their first bombs on Batavia , the capital . Slowly the lines tightened about Java . The Dutch bombed back , claimed the sinking of a Japanese cruiser and a transport . A few U.S. P-40 fighters joined a few U.S. Flying Fortresses in the Indies air . A few hundred more could save Java . <P> When &; if Jap wins Java , he wins the Indies with their riches and mastery of seaways which link the Western Hemisphere , Australia , Africa , India , Suez and their imperial routes . <P> Crocodiles &; Cannon . This week a new book about Java and all Oceania appears : Australian Paul McGuire 's Westward the Course ! ( Morrow ; $3.75 ) . Author McGuire is a professional traveler , lecturer , writer of mystery stories . His book was written before the Jap struck , but Westward the Course ! is a timely introduction to the coming Battle for Java . <P> In Batavia , doves cluster at dusk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals ( " They are a very clean people , but they like their water dirty " ) . An ancient cannon , sacred but now annoyingly useless , stands at Batavia 's Amsterdam Gate . The native women pray to it for fertility and have so many babies that Java has 817 people per square mile . According to native superstition , the cannon has a wife at Bantam on the western end of the island . When the two meet , Dutch rule in Java will end . <P> High in the western interior lies Bandung , the Indies Army 's main citadel and headquarters . From its suburban gardens , its well-guarded bastions , civilians and soldiers can see the great , three-cratered volcano of Tangkoeban Prahu ( " The Overturned Boat " ) . ( Volcanoes-some dangerously alive , some long dead-rib the narrow island from end to end . ) The city of Bandung lies in a flat-bottomed bowl in the hills . And " the thunderstorms roll about the hills all the afternoons , retired Dutch officers roll about the golf courses all the mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and practice jungle war on the higher slopes .
