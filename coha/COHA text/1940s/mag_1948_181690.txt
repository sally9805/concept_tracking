Six days after the year 's most dramatic appendectomy ( TIME , March 15 ) , Argentina 's Strong Man left the hospital to vote for a Peronista Congress . He got what he wanted . Though ballot-counting was slow , particularly in the provinces , his party had captured more than two-thirds of the Congress seats . That will be enough to pass the constitutional amendment which will let President Pern run for a second term in 1952 . <P> During the campaign , the police had given Peronistas every break , had gone out of their way to make life difficult for the opposition . But the elections themselves were free and fair ; the opposition admitted it , and the results showed it . At week 's end , with all their disadvantages , the opposition had managed to get about 35% of the vote ( compared with 45% two years ago ) . Moreover , though Pern 's much-publicized candidate Father Virgilio Filippo ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) was elected deputy from Buenos Aires , he ran well behind the others on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest gain . <P> Rumpled , round-faced Amrico Ghioldi , Socialist editor of the lively , clandestine weekly La Vanguardia and brother of Communist Chief Rodolfo Ghioldi , was making a strong bid for a seat as deputy from Buenos Aires . That would give him official immunity and possible relief from the police , who had dogged him ever since the 1943 revolution . It would also assure him a big pulpit for his trenchant criticism of Pern &; Co.
