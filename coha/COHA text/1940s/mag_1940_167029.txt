War Sentiment <P> &gt; Almost overnight after the invasion of Belgium and Holland , isolationist and pacifist letters practically disappeared from TIME 'S incoming mail . The following letters are a cross section of recent comment about the U. S. and the war . It shows the emergence of feelings and beliefs that have evidently been long latent and inarticulate , the sharpest apparent change in reader-opinion in TIME 'S experience . - ED . <P> Sirs : Two alternatives face the people of the U. S. in the event that Hitler 's drive to the west produces a Nazi victory . Either his influence will invade the Western Hemisphere to such an extent that the U. S. A. will find itself actually fighting the German juggernaut in our own sphere of influence ; or , in the effort to discourage his stepping into South America , we will be forced to compete with his armament production . <P> It would seem that , whether we like Allied policies or not , it is necessary for the U. S. to recognize their stake in an Allied victory . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces with thousands of planes-it will not come to troops . But if we do not help stop the drive now , we shall be fighting Hitler for 20 years . . . <P> CYNTHIA J. WILLETT Lincoln , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . The U. S. should do something besides " holler " for peace . Each generation must do its share toward continued welfare . . . . <P> There are too many professional peacemongers in this country . <P> FRANCIS D. CHAPIN Saco , Me . <P> Sirs : . . . For the first time in many years people in this little town are no longer finding arguments for Germany 's aggressions . They did it after the invasion of Austria , after Czechoslovakia , after Memel , after Poland , even after Norway-that is , some of the people . <P> They would say with a shrug of their shoulders : " Well , Britain and France brought it on themselves . That Treaty of Versailles . . . . " For the first time in many years , that argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that if Germany ca n't beat France and England without raping those little nations , she ought to have the grace to take her licking . . . . <P> DAN Ross <P> Clarksville , Tenn . <P> Sirs : <P> ... Is American behavior . . . supporting Oswald Spengler 's theory of Western decadence ? Have a half-dozen decades of comparatively easy living so softened our pioneer spirit that we of the U. S. are proving ourselves to have been as little aware of the realities of German and Japanese social dynamics as the English Conservatives have proved themselves to be ? <P> . . . Whether we yet realize it or not , we have still the same responsibility for order in the world that we brilliantly assumed and then shortsightedly rejected in 1917-20 . <P> Just as the necessity to make a few over-rapacious individuals respect law became so obvious to the fair-minded majority in the California gold camps and elsewhere on our borders that they organized for a job no one could do alone , equally obvious to us by this time , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by fairdealing people to gang up on the international lawbreakers and enforce a peace we can all work under . <P> RALPH WESLEY WESCOTT Camden , N.
