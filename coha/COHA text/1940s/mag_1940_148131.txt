Man of the Year ( See Cover ) <P> On the year 's shortest day , 60 years ago , in Gori , near Tiflis , a son was born to a poor , hard-working Georgian cobbler named Vissarion Djugashvili . The boy 's pious mother christened him Joseph , after the husband of Mary , mother of Jesus . <P> But names were not to stick very long to this newest subject of the Tsar ; he was to answer to Soso , Koba , David , Nijeradze , Chijikov and Ivanovich until at length he acquired the pseudonym of Stalin , Man of Steel . <P> Last week , as another Dec. 21 rolled around , the little town of Gori was a mecca for 450 Russian writers , " intellectuals " and students sent to gather material on Joseph Vissarionovich Djugashvili 's birthplace and early surroundings .
