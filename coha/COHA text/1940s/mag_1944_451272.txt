As A boy in Hannibal , Missouri , Sam Clemens had a love of deviltry that often landed him in hot water . He was also a tall talker . These two attributes ? his cussedness and his storytelling ? are among the strongest impressions of those who knew him when he was young . When Sam began his training as a river pilot , he made his home with his sister , Pamela Clemens Moffett , in St. Louis . Pamela 's daughter Annie was five years old at the time . She promptly fell in love with her uncle Sam , and her recollections of him then and throughout the rest of his life are a treasure-trove from which the Atlantic will draw in this and subsequent issues . When Annie grew up she married Charles L. Webster , who for many years was to be Mark Twain 's publisher , man of business , and close friend . Annie 's recollections , the hundreds of Mark Twain letters to her husband , and the earlier Clemens family letters whirls she inherited have been skillfully edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of this correspondence has been published before . In later installments we shall see the middle-aged Mark Twain , as extravagant a business man as ever lived.  --  EDITOR MARK TWAIN was over seventy when he dictated to Albert Bigelow Paine an account of his experiences as a publisher . This was supposed to be the first true autobiography ever written . But once Mark Twain started talking , his imagination took him in hand and no facts were allowed to cloud the document . He never reread it and he did not want it referred to again . In this account , published in : 1940 as a chapter of Mark Twain in Eruption , he attributes the failure of Charles L. Webster &; Company entirely to my father , Charles L. Webster . Fortunately I have an almost day to day record of the activities of that publishing house , one of the foremost in America , up to the time my father retired ; a record in Mark Twain 's own letters ? some four hundred and fifty of them . Mark Twain 's self-portrait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milquetoast Copyright 1944 , by the Mark Twain Company.dominated by an incompetent tyrant . The letters he wrote at the time make him seem much more like a dynamo happily unloading surplus electricity on the helpless head of a man he had already overcharged . On my mother 's side the Mark Twain connection started , according to him , with her birthday , and according to her , three days later . He claimed she was born on July 4 , whereas she and the family Bible and her mother said it was July 1 . He said ho had to stop for a Fourth of July parade when he was on his way to see his new niece . And as for the Bible , he never did consider it a trustworthy record of any scientific or historical event . My mother , Annie Moffett Webster , who is now nearly ninety-two , was the daughter of his sister Pamela ( pronounced Pa-me-la ) ; she grew up in St. Louis in the same house with him and was devoted to him . He was like an elder brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers him as a young man . A brief summary of Sam Clemens 's early life will explain the family relationship . He was born in Florida , Missouri , on November 30 , 1835 , but grew up in Hannibal about thirty miles away . Ile was born in Florida because the family made a last-minute change of plans , according to a story his mother told Annie , her granddaughter . They had intended to settle in St. Louis at the end of their long journey from Tennessee , but when they got there they were horrified to hear that a Negro boy had recently been lynched by burning . Moreover , there was cholera in the city . So they moved on to Florida , where their relatives , John Quarles and his wife , were already settled . The wife was Patsy , the adored younger sister of Jane Lampton Clemens , Mark Twain 's mother . If they had settled in St. Louis , Uncle Sam 's background would have been quite different , and Huckleberry Finn might never have been written . The poor Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clemens , father of Mark Twain , came originally from Virginia . When he was twenty-five John Clemens married Jane Lampton , who was in a hurry to get away from her stepmother . She had never known any form of restraint and did not like it . All through her life she put stepmothers in the same category as Yankees . John Clemens was always hard up . He was elected justice of the peace in Hannibal , but his judgeship paid more in honor than in salary , and very little in either , and the Tennessee lands that he had banked on most of his life could not be turned into cash even at a low price . Yet from letters of the time , we find him spending his money on learning the principles of grammar from a " course of twenty oral lectures " and sending on the information to his oldest son , Orion , who was learning the printing trade in St. Louis . No doubt Sam , who was nine years old , was getting the same information at first hand from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament , and his red hair from the Lamptons , his accuracy in workmanship came from his father . His accuracy in facts he never got from anybody . The Tennessee land that Mark Twain was to make famous is the subject of a letter written by John Clemens . This land consisted of 75,000 acres of virgin soil which unfortunately remained virgin for a good many years , although it had everything . John Clemens had paid nearly a cent an acre for this land many years before , and the letter shows that hewas asking twenty , which would have been a good profit even for those days . Mark Twain in The Gilded Age gives the impression that the family was always hanging on to the land . It was the other way around ; the land was hanging on to them . They were always trying to get rid of it . Here is the record of one attempt : ? HANNIBAL , Mo , 1011 Sept. 1840 , MESSRS . BIJITUM &; Co. 112 BROADWAY NEW Yonx Gentlemen Messrs . Meredith &; McCullough have placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which you make certain propositions for the sale of my Tennessee lands . Although the terms you propose are not so favourable as I hoped to obtain ? yet , being persuaded that they are proposed in a spirit of candour and fairness , as the best that in your opinion can be afforded ? and impelled , as I am , by circumstances to resort to the avails of those lands rather than continue to hold them an indefinite length of time ? I have concluded to accede to those terms . Your propositions are so plain and direct that I have no fear of misapprehending them , or that we shall ever disagree as to their import ; but , that you may be assured of a perfect agreement in our understanding of them , I will here state , substantially , the terms proposed in your letter , as I understand them , and to which I agree , to wit . That you are to have the exclusive sale of my Tennessee lands for two years on the terms proposed . ? That you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter mentioned ; and will make sales as speedily and advantageously as possible . That you shall not sell any of the lands for less than twenty cents per acre . ? That I shall receive first five cents per acre of the purchase money , and secondly I shall receive one half of what you sell for , over and above five cents per acre ? so that I shall get at the least twelve &; half cents per acre ? and for lands sold at fifty cents per acre , I shall get twenty-seven &; half cents per acre , &c.; That you shall be entitled to half the amount received over and above five cents per acre ? and , that as you make sales of the land I shall execute to the purchasers Warrantee deeds . ? This is the substance , as I understand it , of all that is material in your propositions . But if this statement is , in any particular , defective , we may still recur to the letter ? for I mean to accede to the terms therein stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be in my power to give re-specting the lands , it shall be promptly furnished . Yours very respectfully Rum M. CLEMENS P. S. Messrs Meredith &; McCullough will not henceforth be considered as having anything to do with this matter ? as I could not afford to divide with them what I shall get , and they do not expect it . J.M.C. 2 JUDGE CLEA1ENS died in March of the following year , when Sam was eleven years old . After that Sam convinced his mother that school was not for him . No doubt else could see that though school was developing his ingenuity , it was not accomplishing its main purpose . He spent most of his time making visionary plans for getting even with his teachers . Jane Clemens was a strong-minded woman , and experimental . If school did not work she would try something else . So she apprenticed him to a printer . He came home to meals when he was hungry or homesick . The other Clemens children had taken school in an amenable spirit . Except for Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0-rion ) was the oldest son . It was unusual to name a child for the constellation under which he was born , but not an unheard-of practice . We can be pretty certain that the idea was his mother 's . To the end of her days anything mystical interested her , and when she was an old lady in Fredonia , New York , there was nothing she enjoyed more than the visits from her physician , Dr. Brown , wino was a Spiritualist . Jane Clemens always answered his questions about her ailments as fast as possible so that she would have time to hear the latest news from the spirit world . Ten years older than Sam , Orion exasperated Sam throughout his life in spite of , or because of , the bond of affection between them . Pamela , my grandmother , Caine next , eight years older than Sam ? old enough to remember something of the life in remote Tennessee before the family moved to Missouri , What she remembered most vividly was a fascinating aspect of school life that most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor from the pigs that sought shelter underneath the seat of learning . Two other children , Margaret and Benjamin , died during Sam 's childhood , the latter when Sam was old enough to feel the loss keenly . Sam came after Benjamin , and after Sam came Henry . Samwas named for his grandfather , and probably also his uncle , His middle name , Langhorne , according to family traditions , came from a friend of Isis father who had been most kind to him in Virginia . For the first three years of Sam Clemens 's life ho was probably the spoiled darling of the household . Then along came Henry . Sam was advanced to the ranks and became of secondary importance . It was when Sam was four years old , and Henry eleven months , that the well-known incident of Sam 's accidental abandonment occurred . The family left Hannibal to pay a visit at John Quarles 's farm at Florida . Jane Clemens took the baby and the older children , and Judge Clemens was to have taken Sam . Through a misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued till dusk , crying and hungry , after having been alone all day . Psychoanalysts might feel that this experience of abandonment would leave a deep mark in the unconscious of a supplanted baby . They might find significance in the fact that Sam 's great affections for his gentle younger brother went along with a desire to jibe at him . For the three years following the death of Judge Clemens , Sam continued to learn the printing business . Orion worked at a printing plant in St. Louis , sending the family three dollars weekly , and Pamela gave piano and guitar lessons . Mr. Paine says : " It was a hard task for the girl , for she was timid and not over-strong ; but she was resolute and patient and won success . Pamela Clemens was a noble character and deserves a fuller history than can be afforded in this work . " The letter to Orion that follows is written partly by Pamela and partly by her mother . Sam , coming back from the printing house for an evening at home , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jane Clemens describes . I think he used this memory when he wrote The Mysterious &ranger.; HANNIBAL Jan. 29 , 1850 MY DEAR BROTHER Orion We received a few days since your letter enclosing $300 $3.002 for which accept our thanks and assurances that it will not be at all in our way . I suppose you have not been attacked with the yellow fever , that by the way is raging so here that it is feared it will carry off nearly half the inhabitants , if it does not indeed depopulate the town . In consequence of it many of our best citizens intend starting to California so soon as they can make preparations , among whom are Charles Bowes Mr. Moss Mr. Shoots Mr. Melon and others too numerous to mention . Nearly all those who went from here last spring have written back that they are making large fortunes in California .. ( The letter is continued by Pamela 's mother . ) January the 80th 1800 DEAR SON The last Journal of Mr. Buchannan to day the next one will be Rayman and Buckhannan they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not heard much said about it . I have heard nothing favourable about it . Sam says little Joe told him his mother said she would rather have Orion than Sam Rayman . I think about the time you come up they will be through and you can get it your own way . Now I do n't want you to have it . I think if you could get some of the printers in St. Louis that are doing well to buy the of i.e. , " office " j and give you an intrust , let you come up and take charge of the office , get some old person to assist a little in editing merely to have their name . Robert Buchannan will have the office in his hands and I think will be sick of his bargin by that time . If you could have a partner in St. Louis to help you , I could board the hands and you could have Henry .

Tomorrow evening the music scollars meet again . Margaret Saxton Sarah Fuqua and Mary Buckhannan all play dewets , the scollars are improving very fast . When you come I think they will play well . . . . J. CLEMENS The more I try to analyze Jane Clemens the more dazed I get . There is a tendency in her letters to leave the sentences sliding off into space , to omit essential words , and to let the letters fall where they will . She never seemed to look over a letter and correct it . Once , about twenty-five years after this period , in a letter to Uncle Sam , she meant to say " Kiss Susy for me " and instead wrote " Kill Susy for me . " She told Pamela what a funny mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , did you ? " asked Pamela , naturally shocked . " Oh , yes , " her mother answered calmly , " Sam will understand what I meant . " Sam 's answer came promptly . He wrote : " I said to Livy ' It is a hard thing to ask of loving parents , but Ma is getting old and her slightestwhim must be our law ' ; so I called in Downey , and Livy and I held the child with the tears streaming down our faces while he sawed her head off . " His mother 's reaction to that letter was outraged indignation at the method by which the child had been dispatched . " Sawed her head off ! " she kept saying . " Sawed her head off ! " 3 ORION secured ownership of the Hannibal Journal and Sam and Henry went to work for him . But Orion never seemed to be able to make things go , and in 1853 when Sam was seventeen he broke away and went forth to see the world . He made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then he went to Philadelphia and got a job as a printer on the Philadelphia Inquirer . Like most travelers , he found that foreign parts had been both over- and under-estimated . He liked Philadelphia and the Philadelphians " amazingly , " but he had this to say in a letter home : " I always thought the eastern people were patterns of uprightness , but I never saw so many whiskey-swilling , God-despising heathens as I find in this part of the country . I believe I am the only person in the Inquirer office that does not drink . One young fellow makes $18 for a few weeks and gets on a grand bender ' and spends every cent of it . " After he left Philadelphia , Sam went back to New York for a brief visit and then returned to Missouri . Orion had married Mollie Stotts in 1854 and with his mother and brother Henry had moved to Keokuk , Mollie 's home , where he had opened a shop for commercial printing . Sam worked for Orion for five dollars a week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't guess . Maybe he thought it was his duty to help Orion out . Sam could be noble , but he did n't enjoy a sense of virtue as much as he hated frustration . He stuck it out in Keokuk for a year , but Orion 's business methods irked him , as usual , and the urge to move on grew stronger as he approached his twenty-first birthday . South America at this time was being played up as a promised land , offering the combination of adventure and wealth that always ignited Sam Clemens . On August 5 , 1856 , he wrote to his brother Henry what his mother later called a " scolding letter . " At this time Annie , Pamela 's four-year-old daughter , was visiting her Keokuk relatives , who had a new baby of their own . This was not just the atmosphere to suit an adventurous young man of twenty . MY DEAR BROTHER : Annie is well . Got your letter postmarked 5th about two hours ago ? came d d quick ( to be a little profane ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to South America ! ( This reminds me that Annie is well ) . Although Orion talks grandly about furnishing me with fifty or a hundred dollars in six weeks , I am not such an ass as to think he will retain the same opinion such an eternity of time ? in all probability he will be entirely out of the notion by that time . Though I do n't like to attribute selfish niotives to him , you could see yourself that his object in favoring my wishes was that I might take all the hell of pioneering in a foreign land , and then when everything was placed on a firm basis , and beyond all risk , he could follow himself . But you would soon discover , when the time arrived , that he could n't leave Mollie and that " love of a baby " . With these facts before my eyes , ( I must not forget to say that Annie is well ) I could not depend upon Orion for ten dollars . So I have " feelers " out in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one source ( keep it to yourself ) . . . . .. Emma Graham has gone home and Bettie Barrett has gone up the country . I may as well remark that Annie is well . I spent Sunday afternoon up there and brought away a big bouquet of Ete 's d d stinking flowers . ( I mean no disrespect to her or her taste . ) Any single one of the lot smells worse than a Sevastopol " stink-pot " . Between you and I , I believe that the secret of Ma 's willingness to allow me to go to South America lies in the fact that she is afraid I am going to got married ! Success to the hallucination .. . . Write soon . Your brother , SAw P.S. I will just add that Annie is WELL . To earn the money to take him to South America , Sam went to Cincinnati and spent the winter of 1856-1857 working as a printer . There he associated with a Scotchman named Macfarlane , a vast reader and a philosopher . Nothing else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . In April Sam started out for South America , by way of New Orleans , on the steamer Paul Jones . Fate was one of the passengers . His old love of the river came back to him , and before he reached New Orleans he had struck up a bargain with the veteran pilot , Horace Bixby , to take him on as a cub pilot and teach him the river for five hundred dollars ? one hundred down and the rest after he had begun to draw pay . There was only one member of the family at that time who could produce a hundred dollars ; so when he reached St. Louis on his maiden trip Sam went at once to his , brother-in-law , William A. Moffett , a well-to-do produce merchant , and borrowed the money . Says my mother : " One of my earliest recollections is the stir caused by the announcement that Uncle Sam had decided to become a pilot . It seemed to me as if everyone was running up and down stairs and sitting on the steps to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic and well-paid profession , and in a river town it was a great honor to have a pilot in the family . " The Moffetts decided to move into a larger house so that Sam , and presently his brother Henry , as well as their mother , could live with them . It seemed to Annie , a child just short of five years old , as if they moved instantly , but there must have been some interval of preparation . She has a vivid memory of moving to the new house on Locust Street , a few blocks away , because as she was walking between her uncle Sam and her grandmother , carrying what she probably considered the family 's most valuable possession , the current cat , the cat very naturally added to the excitement by getting away , and Annie recaptured it by the tail . Her uncle Sam was delighted by the whole performance . 4 BY AUGUST Sam seems to have been up the river as far as Keokuk , and again as far as Cairo , below St. Louis . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Sam would usually reach home as soon as a letter . But we have a letter to Belle Stotts , sister of Orion 's wife . The reason it is among our family letters is that after Orion 's death Mollie sent on to us all the letters that Sam had sent to Orion , and included this one to her sister . When Albert Bigelow Paine was compiling Mark Twain 's letters we let him use all the family letters , and they constitute most of the material in the early part of his book . This one seems to have been overlooked ? or perhaps Mr. Paine was wary of including it . Almost any time Uncle Sam mentioned any female in a letter , Mr. Paine would duck . The Ella Creel referred to in the letter was a cousin . Colonel William Casey of Kentucky had three daughters : Jane Paxton , Polly Creel , and Peggy Lampton ? the second name in each case being the husband 's name . Peggy Lampton was the mother of Jane Lampton Clemens . Ella Creel 's mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saturday , Aug. 11 1857 DEAR BELLE : Confound me if I would n't eat up half a dozen of you small girls if I just had the merest shadow of a chance this morning . Here I am , now about 3 weeks out from Keokuk , and 2 from St. Louis , and yet I have not heard a word from you ? and may not possibly , for 2 or 3 more weeks , as we shall go no further up the river at present , but turn back from here and go to New Orleans . Just go on , though ? go on . I have had a pleasant trip , and there is consolation in that . I quarreled with the mate , and " made it up " with him ; and I quarreled with him again , and made it up again ; and quarreled and " made up " the third time ? and I have got the shell of half a watermelon by me now , ready to drop on his head as soon as he comes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , if I have made my calculations properly . Yes , and I have disobeyed the Captain 's orders over and over again , which produced a " state of feeling " in his breast , much to my satisfaction ? ( bless you , soul I always keep the law on my side , you see , when the Chief Officer is concerned , ) and I am ready now to quarrel with anybody in the world that ca n't whip me . All me , I feel as strong as a yoke of oxen this morning , and nothing could afford me greater pleasure than a pitched battle with you three girls . It ca n't be , though . However , I 'll " fix " the mate when he comes out . Belle , you ought to see the letter I wrote last night for a friend of mine . He is fearfully love-sick and he feared he should die , if he did n't " pour out his soul " ( he said ?

Poor devil ? he said " Make the letter sweet ? fill it full of love , " and I did , as sure as you live . But if the dose do n't turn the young lady inside out she must certainly be endowed with the stomach of an ostrich . But did you girls see the Aurora Borealis last night ( Friday ? ) It was very beautiful , but it did not last long . I reckon you girls had been home from choir-meeting about an hour when I saw it  --  or perhaps you were out on the bluff ? Somebody remarked " Snag ahead ! " and I lost the finest part of the sight . Now , Belle , ca n't you write to me right away , to " Care of Eclipse Wharf Boat , Memphis , Tenn ? " Of course you can , if you will . I sent you 2 pieces of instrumental music and a song to Ella Creel from Vicksburgh ? did they arrive safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the next four years Sam 's home was the Moffett house in St. Louis . As far as Annie was concerned , he would appear unexpectedly and leave in the same way without warning . His arrival was a big moment . He always brought her some kind of present . She especially remembers a white Canton flannel rabbit with pink eyes , and a book about a mouse that lived in a cake ? he ate a hole for himself and moved in . The memory of that book has never faded . " In 1858 or ' 59 , " my mother recalls , " a traveling portrait painter named Brady came to St. Louis and our whole family was painted . There are six portraits ? my grandmother , mother , father , Uncle Sam , Uncle Henry , and myself . It was after Uncle Henry 's death in the explosion of the river boat Pennsylvania , and his portrait was copied from a daguerreotype . I can remember Grandma curling my hair when I was to sit for my portrait . I also remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sam is not now in the collection . Aunt Mollie , Uncle Orion 's wife , gave it to the Keokuk library a good many years later . My grandmother was only fifty-five at this time , but her portrait looks older because of the cap she is wearing . " Uncle Sam at this time was a young man of about twenty-four . He wore sideburns and had chestnut hair , I should have said , though some call it red . It was very curly . My grandmother said that as a boy he would soak his hair in a tub of water and plaster it down to try to make it straight . " I was very fond of Uncle Sam , " she says , " but I did not think he was the genius of the family . I remember when I was about eight I thought he needed a little religious instruction , and started to tell him the story of Moses . Uncle Sam was strangely obtuse , and finally I went to my father and said , Papa , Uncle Orion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think Uncle Sam has good sense . I told him the story of Moses and the bullrushes and he said he knew Moses very well , that he ? kept a secondhand store on Market Street . 1 tried very hard to explain that it was n't the Moses I meant , but he just could n't understand . ' " When I think of Uncle Sam during those early years it is always as a singer . He would sit at the piano and play and sing by the hour , the same song over and over : ? " He seems to have been flattered by my appreciation of this effort because he began to call me Old Horse . ' It was Old Horse , get me that book ' or ' Old Horse , run up to my room for a paper . ' " As I grew a little older it must have struck me that to be called ' Old Horse ' even by Uncle Sam was not suitable . My cousin , Jenny Clemens , Uncle Orion 's daughter , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had taken to calling her ' trundle bed trash , ' a current term for the extra children who had to sleep in little trundle beds . Jenny and I sat on the stops of our house and invented what has now come to be known as a sit-down strike . We resolved to run no more errands for Uncle Sam until he stopped calling us by these names . I do not remember how the strike was adjusted . He probably knew how to make us forget our resolutions , " I remember being taken to a lecture on mesmerism , and trying out my own mesmeric powers on Uncle Sam afterwards . He proved an extraordinary subject . No sooner had I made passes in front of him than he went into a rigid trance , under which he did just what I told him to , and made the most astonishing remarks . I boasted about my powers , but had no success with other members of the family or the children in the neighborhood . " In later years I asked Grandma if she noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said yes ? when he had gone anywhere , if only downtown , when he came home all the children would gather around to hear what he had to tell . He knew even then how to make things interesting . She also said that when she saw a crowd running she did n't ask what was the matter , but ' What has Sam done now ? ' " When Sam was about three he was distressed because he had ' no tail behind behind . ' He said , ' The dog has a tail behind , the cat has a tail behind , and I have n't any tail behind at all at all . ' His uncle ( I think it was his uncle Hannibal ) made a tail of paper and pinned it on his little dress and he went around very proud and happy . " According to Mark Twain his mother had the gift of telling a joke with a straight face , but my mother thinks that very often she did n't see the joke herself . My mother writes : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit Kentucky she heard two men behind her in the train discussing whether Mark Twain was born in Hannibal . She asked the man who was with her to tell them that he was born in Florida . One of the men was unconvinced . That was too much for Grandma . She turned around and said , ' I 'm his mother . I ought to know . I was there ! ' " 5 ON account of the paper shortage we skip Uncle Sam 's reaction to the Civil War , which was so emotional and so full of contradictions that it dazed my mother , a child of nine . It leaves me dazed , too . The war forced Uncle Sam to leave the river , and he went West with Orion , who had been appointed Secretary of the Territory of Nevada . Sam immediately came down with the gold fever . It was a nervous time for him . Rich veins were being discovered on all sides . Men would coins in one day without a cent , and the next be rolling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . He was not a gambler in the strict sense of the word . He did n't bet on races , play cards for large stakes , or even play the market to any extent . But he enjoyed taking chances where adventure was involved . And he tried to reinforce optimism with judgment . In one of his letters to Orion he wrote : " I have 75 feet in a spur of the ' Antelope ' , which promises nothing save that it is an offshoot from a good family ? and I am aristocrat enough to attach some importance to that sort of thing . " Orion of course caught the craze , and Sam appointed himself Orion 's financial adviser . Uncle Sam had gone to Nevada as Orion 's secretary , but somewhere along the road the roles seem to have changed around . The following letter does n't quite show the restraint of a man writing to his boss : ? ESMERALDA , May 17. 18611 MY DEAR Boo : . . . Yes , I have received the $100 ? much obliged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract on the Flyaway to-morrow , which will cost about $100 ? sink a shaft 65 feet deep .

And post yourself about Carson property , too ? so that you can sell your town lot for all it is worth . The cards are the Flyaway and the Monitor ? and we will stake the whole pile on them . If they win , we are all right ? if they lose , I am busted . . . . Never send anything by that d ? d stage again , that can come by MAIL , as I have said before .

If I was n't so glad to hear that the " old man " is back again , and if I had n't been swearing so much to-day that I am about run out , I would give him a dose of slang just because I am at a safe distance and can do so with impunity . He be d -- d anyhow ? just for a starter . Ask Tom to give my dear love to Miss P. ? she with the long curls , out there under the hill . Yr . Bro . SAM . The reason he wanted to leave the " S.L.C. " off his letters to the Keokuk paper was to avoid repercussions from home . " Ma and Pamela seem to be clown on my last to the Gate City , " he had written to Orion several weeks earlier . Orion may have been difficult to work with , but he does seem to have had some practical ideas . In May , Sam had written him : " Do you own in those water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? it is bully . Is n't confiscating ten miles of one of God Almighty 's rivers coming it rather strong perhaps ? The more the better , though , if the thing can be stood . " For a minute here Uncle Sam was letting his conscience get the better of him . But scruples over water power were unheard of at this time . He wavered , but he did n't waver long . In the middle of the first page of a letter Uncle Sam wrote to his family from Nevada in May , 1862 , is a tiny flake of gold . In a postscript to the letter he wrote : " ' Prospect ' from ' Mil : ledge sticking to piece of yellow paper in the middle of this page . " This gold has always stuck to the letter . It is a symbol of the fabulous riches Uncle Sam dreamed of when he was down with the gold fever . His failure as a miner did not shake Sam 's confidence in his own judgment . Years later his letters from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why he always picked the losers I have n't been quite able to make out . The only money he ever made was from writing and lecturing and the large profits of Charles L. Webster &; Company , which he promptly lost . When he worked for other people , Mark Twain made good at everything he undertook . He was a good printer , a good pilot , and a good newspaperman . He might have made a good President . But making both ends meet was not his line . When he tried to run a newspaper in Buffalo , he says himself he lost $20,000 in one year. , Jane Clemens 's wish ? expressed in a letter dated October 12 , 1862 ? that Sam would give up gold mining and go into newspaper work had 1 I do n't believe it . S. C. W.been granted even before she wrote the letter . He had already accepted an offer from the Virginia City Nevada Enterprise . Reporters on the Enterprise were real people who were allowed to express their opinions and let out their ernotions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch into their fellow reporters , write up absurd hoaxes seriously , and have a good time generally . This was just up Sam 's alley . His side line in reporting became getting rid of grudges that bothered him . Very soon an official named Sewell , a coroner at Humboldt , was incautious enough to incur Sam 's wrath by withholding news from the reporters in an officious and irritating manner . Sam got back at him by inventing the story of the petrified man , which was copied in other newspapers and spread all over the country . The petrified man was supposed to be a prehistoric man whose body had been found in a cave . Sam wrote him up as a great discovery , and only a careful reading of the text would show that the petrified man was found in a sitting posture , thumbing his nose . Sewell , he reported , was holding an inquest over the deceased to try to find out how he had died , and whether anybody could be held accountable . The " Hon.

" It is an unmitigated lie , made from whole cloth . I got it up to worry Sewell . Every day , I send him some California paper containing it ; moreover , I am getting things so arranged that he will soon begin to receive letters from all parts of the country , purporting to come from scientific men , asking for further information concerning the wonderful stone man . If I had plenty of time , I would worry the life out of the poor cuss . remainder missing 6 UNCLE Sam would go to a good deal of trouble to teach anyone a lesson . As a small boy in Hannibal , when he had to stop something he wanted to do to escort some young lady callers home , he went out of his way to lead them through the Jimson weeds , which was very unpleasant going . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the habit of writing on any sheets of paper that happened to be handy . She had no particular feeling for uniformity . In a letter from Virginia City he wrote : " Ma , write on whole letter sheets . Is paper scarce in St. Louis ? " To reinforce his orders he sent her a letter composed of papers of every size , color , and shape , including wrapping paper , the scraps all jumbled together and stuffed into an envelope . She spent several indignant hours sorting it out . But the mere joy of teasing his mother was enough , even without a reform motive . Another time a letter came marked in each corner " Private , " " Strictly Confidential , " and so on . The family were all on edge to hear what it was about , but Grandma Clemens refused even to open it in their presence . She marched upstairs to read it ? but in a minute she was down again , blazing with wrath . It was written in Chinese . The Chinese letter has disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Beck Jolly will read Ma 's Chinese letter for her . " This was probably a further hoax . Beck Jolly was the pilot of the river boat John J. Roe . His mother could always be trusted to rise to the bait . Once she said to Sam : " What do you think Annie said ? She thought goobers grew on trees ! " ( Goobers are peanuts . ) He responded at once , " Is n't that silly ? Everyone knows they grow on bushes . " " Bushes ! " she cried . " Why ? of course they do n't grow on bushes ! " ? and she was off , with Sam adding just enough argument to keep the fire blazing . Mark Twain 's Virginia City days were among his happiest . He was leading an easy life , doing just the work he enjoyed , a friend of everybody in town , or an enemy . But occasionally he would get a little irritated when some other vagabond struck it rich , as the next letter shows : ? Vineknon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; SISTER : I suppose I ought to write , but I hardly know what to write about . I am not in a very good humor , to-night . I wanted to rush down and take some comfort for a few days , in San Francisco , but there is no one here , now , to take my place . They let me go , about the first of the month , to stay twenty-four hours in Carson , and I staid a week . Perhaps they have n't much confidence in me now . If they have , I am proud to say it is misplaced . I am very well satisfied here . They pay me six dollars a day , and I make 50 per cent profit by only doing three dollars ' worth of work . . . .

I pick up a foot or two occasionally for lying about somebody 's mine . I shall sell out one of these days , when I catch a susceptible emigrant . If Orion writes you a crazy letter about the " Emma Gold &; Silver Mining Company , " pay no attention to it . It is rich , but he owns very little stock in it . If he gets an eighth share in the adjoining company though let him blow . It will be all right . He may never get it , however . What do you show my letters for ? Ca n't you let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , without exposing me ? .. . Uncle Sam brought back some nice-looking stock in various gold and silver mines . I remember taking some of the revenue stamps off them in later years , so they were not a total loss . From Virginia City Uncle Sam went to California as a reporter on the San Francisco Call . Here he got the California fever , which is harder to get rid of than the gold fever . But San Francisco was a much larger town than Virginia City . In Virginia City , where everybody knew everybody else , he could give his writing a personal touch that was not possible in San Francisco . From being a local celebrity he dropped to a place of secondary importance . However , when The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County was published in 1865 , he became known all over the country . In one of its chapters he gives a dissertation on the perfect letter and uses one from my mother as a good example . She tells him that her cat has had more kittens than Lottie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to die , that she gave Miss Doosenberry one of his pictures but she said she did n't want it , and similar pieces of news . He said it was the only letter he ever got from the States that had any information in it . My mother thinks he doctored it a little , but Aunt Mollie told her she really did write him some such letter . After a while he drifted away from the Call , and the Sacramento Union sent him on a trip to the Sandwich Islands . In a letter of May 4 , 1866 , published in the Letters , he tells how a spirited colt " let out with his left " in the Letters the word " leg " is inserted ! and kicked him across a ten-acre lot when he was all ready to take a girl to a party . The unpublished part of the letter goes on : ? TIE next two pieces of unpublished matter from letters of the period require a little background of family history to make them clear . Fate began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother writes in her family story : " One Hannibal story that both my mother and grandmother told me many times was of an election for mayor . One of the candidates furnished free whiskey , and practically every man in town was drunk . Something in the whiskey made them all very silly . Uncle Orion came home and the family were all gathered around . He was very foolish . Sam would exclaim , ' Why Orion ! Why Orion ! ' He enjoyed it at first , but after a while lie said , ' Orion , do n't be such a fool . ' " I do not know what they put in whiskey in those days , but the " something in the whiskey " which my mother says affected Orion also affected the family fortunes . The next day Orion went out and signed the pledge , and with his natural conscientiousness he took it seriously . It was the pledge that ruined the family . At one time Orion refused to sell the Tennessee land to some winegrowers , and this fine-edged piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Honolulu , on May 22 , 1866 , he wrote to Orion 's wife , Mollie : ? . . . It is Orion 's duty to attend to that land , &; after shutting me out of my attempt to sell it ( for which I shall never entirely forgive him , ) if he lets it be sold for taxes , all his religion will not wipe out the sin . It is no use to quote Scripture to me , Mollie , ? I am in poverty &; exile now because of Orion 's religious scruples . Religion &; poverty can not go together . I am satisfied Orion will eventually save himself , but in doing it he will damn the balance of the family . I want no such religion . He has got a duty to perform by us ? will he perform it ? I have crept into the old subject again , &; opened the old sore afresh that cankers within me . It has got into many letters to you &; I have burned them . But it is no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of Ma &; Pamela grieving at our absence &; the land going to the dogs when I could have sold it &; been at home now , instead of drifting about the outskirts of the world , battling for bread . If I were in the east , now , I could stop the publication of a piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches . . . . Yr Bro SAM Shortly afterward , on June II , he mentions the subject in a letter to the family . His mother was still the Supreme Court . He begins his letter : " I expect I have made Orion mad , but I do n't care a cent . He wrote me to go home and sell the Tenn. land &; I wrote him to go to thunder and take care of it himself . I tried to sell it once and he broke up the trade ... . " Perhaps if the Clemens family had sold the Tennessee land for a large sum Uncle Sam would have sidetracked his writing . The moral lesson to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family fortune made because there was " something " in the whiskey ? The Tennessee land finally drifted away somehow . Perhaps there was a flood . My mother remembers getting $150 from it for a quitclaim deed . I think I remember signing some papers about it myself . I know Uncle Sam would n't allow it to be mentioned after a while . Anyway , the family has always been careful since then to see that there is no water or other foreign substance in the whiskey .
