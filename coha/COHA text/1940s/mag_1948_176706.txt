When the baseball season ends , Doc Hyland 's busiest season begins . For nine weeks , ailing ballplayers have come to his St. Louis office to see the man known as " baseball 's surgeon-general . " Dr. Robert Hyland has a physician 's professional reticence about discussing patients ; besides , baseball 's big winter meetings are coming up . " Some of the men are liable to be up for trading , " said Doc . <P> Back in 1938 , he had examined Dizzy Dean 's great pitching arm , found Dizzy a victim of bursitis , and predicted that his pitching days were numbered . Shortly afterwards , the St. Louis Cardinals sold Dizzy to the Chicago Cubs for $185,000 , even though the Cubs knew of Dr. Hyland 's findings . Last week three of the doctor 's patients were easily identifiable as Cardinals . It was no secret either that the 1949 pennant hopes of the New York Giants would rise or fall on how skillfully Doc Hyland carved a bone growth from Catcher Walker Cooper 's kneecap this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire 17 years ago , at least 5,000 big leaguers have visited baseball 's two surgical meccas-St . Louis and Baltimore . Doc Hyland , a good-natured , husky 60 , gets all the St. Louis trade , and a lot of Eastern clients besides . In Baltimore , the man to see is testy , trim Dr. George Bennett , a famed orthopedic surgeon and a rabid baseball fan , like Hyland . Dr. Bennett 's most recent patient : Joe DiMaggio , who walked out of Johns Hopkins hospital on crutches last week after having a spur cut from his right heel . <P> Forkballs &; Sliders . Dr. Hyland , a frustrated ballplayer himself , resents any suggestion that the present-day frequency of " elbow chips " and bone growths means that players are less durable than of old . Says Doc , who often talks the way sport-writers write : " Today 's crop is obviously better educated and , if anything , up to a faster type of baseball . The culprit in the injury woodpile is the development of trick pitching . " <P> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with improved batting techniques , pitchers throw an assortment of forkballs , knuckle balls , screwballs and sliders . " Try it yourself and feel the strain on your elbow , " says Dr. Hyland . His commonest operation-removing calcium deposits from elbows-made new men of Pitchers Howie Pollet and Red Munger . The list of patients who have consulted him would make an impressive line-up for an All-Star game . Among them : Ty Cobb ( one of his steadiest customers ) , Frank Frisch , Rogers Hornsby , Joe Cronin , Mel Ott , Bobby Doerr . <P> Big , home-run-hitting John Mize might never have been a big leaguer but for Doc Hyland . The Cincinnati Reds passed him up 13 years ago when another doctor discovered an old pelvic injury ( the result of riding mules bareback in his Georgia childhood ) . Doc Hyland operated and Big John did the rest .
