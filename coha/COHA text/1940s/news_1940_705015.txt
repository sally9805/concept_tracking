txt HOOVER HOLDS WAR BY US WOULD BRING NATION A DICTATOR Declares Hope to Maintain a Free Economy Would Be Gone if We Took Part URGES PLANT EFFICIENCY Technological Advance Is Now Essential , He Asserts at U. of P. Conference The text of Mr. Hoover 's speech is printed on Page 14 . By LAWRENCE E. DAVIES Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . PHILADELPHIA , Sept. 18 ? All hope of maintaining a free economy in the world would be gone for a generation if this country entered the war , Herbert Hoover asserted tonight in an address at the University of Pennsylvania bicentennial conference . Totalitarian dictatorship for the United States , he said , would be " inevitable " with such a step . Voicing the , belief that the British Empire would not fail " in its heroic defense , " the former President nevertheless examined the world situation as one of " the realists who wish to prepare for the worst . " He assumed , for his basis of discussion , that for some time to come the totalitarian areas would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 40 per cent of the world 's trade . In so doing he termed " nonsense " the idea of free states combining against totalitarian nations in trade at the end of the war . " The world has to live , " he said . " Moreover , the interests of the free states are too divergent to consummate such combinations . " For instance , our South American cousins can not live unless they sell their agricultural surpluses into the totalitarian areas . " They can not sell their surpluses to us . We produce a surplus of the same things . They will buy totalitarian manufactured goods in return . Any other expectation is sheer illusion . " Asks Rise in Efficiency Although he presented a long list of economic ills threatening their appearance at the end of the war , Mr. Hoover voiced his conviction that this country could defend itself economically without adopting totalitarian methods . The alternative to reducing wages , lengthening hours of labor and lowering the standard of living to meet competitive conditions from the autocracies , he said , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he explained , " I mean to produce more goods and services per capita of the kind we can use at the prices we can sell them at . And that is a vital right now as well as after war . " The speaker contended that technological advance was essential in gaining this goal and that , therefore , the first step to be taken toward " mobilizing " national efficiency was giving more support to research in pure science , expenditures for which he estimated at less than $20,000,000 a year , or " about 7 per cent of our allowance for cosmetics . " The second step , he added , was increasing support to applied science research , for which he estimated $200,000,000 a year , or " only 15 per cent of our cigarette bill , " now was being spent . " We must bring our plant equipment out of its present slump of obsolescence , " he went on . " We must eliminate more industrial waste motion and more waste of materials and men . We must apply every labor-saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both capital and labor which impedes or penalizes the use of better methods and better machines . " We must maintain free competition so that lower costs will be passed on to the consumer at lower prices . " And we must have constructive tax systems and removal of unnecessary governmental restrictions which lessen or destroy the initiative of men . " Coupling it with his contention that at present costs of production the country would be " flooded with foreign goods that we could produce ourselves , " Mr. Hoover said external pressures pointed inevitably to our diminished export market . He suggested the use of " reciprocal quotas " both " to protect our own people and to secure outlets for exports . " Describing the quota as " far more ironclad " than tariffs , he said reciprocal quotas were " more potent than reciprocal tariffs against the economic dive-bombers of the new era . " Within the quotas , he argued , private traders in this country could " carry on for themselves and avoid barter , price control and other totalitarian methods . " Stupendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " mostly negative , " but he recommended as " positive " and lasting the building of a nation upon " scientific research and its applications . " The speaker warned that , in spite of the consequent loss of much productive power for articles and services which might have been " part of our standard of living , " the country was faced with " years of stupendous expenditure upon military preparedness " if it wished to " keep I evil eyes away from the Western Hemisphere . " In another conference address , Frank B. Jewett , president of the Bell Telephone Laboratories and a member of the National Defense Research Committee , said ? that to combat the Nazi total war there was " only one possibility  --  that of ' total peace . ' " If a potential enemy chooses to focus all of his powers upon the operation and coordination of a modern war machine by the same carefully drawn schedules that characterize industry , " Dr. Jewett declared , " he leaves no choice but for other nations to adopt the methods of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , " he said , called for " closer coordination between specialized groups to the end that more rigidly guided and more narrowly confined spheres of action are imposed on the individual , be he human or corporate . " Specialization Called Peril He offered this warning : " Such expanding specialization connotes planning , while the expanding need of guidance suggests dictatorship . We see , therefore , that the two conditions are likely to merge unless great care is exercised to hold them apart . " A panel discussion on " current issues in industrial relations " brought general agreement that government had a place in the field of labor relations but some disagreement as to what its role should be . Dr. William M. Leiserson , a member of the National Labor Relations Board , contended that the government 's part essentially ought to be that of " mediator and intervener , a friend of both sides , " although " strangely enough " the least progress had been made in that area . " People still look upon this problem from the volunteer fire department point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes it 's time then to act . " The panel discussion was based on the idea of the " junto " of Benjamin Franklin , founder of the University of Pennsylvania . Willits Poses as " Secretary " Dr. Joseph H. Willits , director for social science of the Rockefeller Foundation , posed as the secretary of the eighteenth century junto transplanted to 1940 and seeking information on labor problems from a board of experts composed of Dr. Leiserson , Dean James M. Landis of the Harvard Law School ; Cyrus S. Ching , director of industrial and public relations of the United States Rubber Company ; Clinton S. Golden , northeast regional director of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee ( C. I. 0. ) , and Joseph A. Padway , general counsel of the American Federation of Labor . Mr. Ching began the discussion by calling for a broad study " by someone " which would result in the placing of definite limits within which the government should operate in the labor relations field . " We now have the National Labor Relations Board to decide who is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they get off to a good start the conciliation service of the Department of Labor steps up to put salve on the wounds . " Mr. Ching conceded that the right of labor to organize should be protected by legislation , but he contended it was not a function of government to " encourage " labor organization . According to Dr. Leiserson , it is necessary for Congress " to define personal and property rights , " after which the government 's place is mediation . " What we need mainly , " he said , " is a national mediation board working with state mediation boards . " Labor Board Is Defended Interposing a defense of the National Labor Relations Board , he remarked : " You say the labor board has not maintained a high standard . What about the courts ? It was necessary for Congress to step in because the courts used to issue injunctions without giving employes a hearing . We do n't do that . " Dean Landis took issue with a statement by Mr. Ching that American industry had accepted the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " in the light of thousands of complaints received yearly by the National Labor Relations Board . " Mr. Padway agreed , on the other hand , that most employers had accepted the collective bargaining principle but he added : " While they obey the law , they would like to have a law saying collective bargaining was not necessary . " Mr. Golden warned that the government would not get far " with mediation and conciliation efforts " until the Wagner Act was " more fully accepted . " He said one of the big jobs of industrial union leaders was persuading " a great body of persons with newly acquired power to do things to the boss that the boss did to them . " The panel unanimously condemned incorporation of unions . Dr. Leiserson said such a step would lead to entrenchment of the " worst element of the racketeering group in labor . " Recalling that Samuel Gompers obtained passage in 1886 of a law permitting unions to incorporate , he said not a single union did so until 1928 , when a " smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evade some ? taxes . Congress repealed the law in 1932 , he added , to end the racket.
