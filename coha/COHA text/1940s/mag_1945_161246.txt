One spring night in 1921 the angry torches of 10,000 white mobsters set fire to Tulsa 's Negro district . The flames roared through the tinderbox houses , completely destroyed the new $92,000 Mount Zion Baptist Church ( Negro ) . It had taken Mount Zion 's 600 members seven years to finance and build their first church . All that remained were charred walls and a $50,000 mortgage . <P> There was an out : the congregation could go into bankruptcy , default on the debt and start over . But they decided to pay . First , money was raised for a brick , dirt-floored , basement ; it would be the foundation of a new church building , and could serve as a meeting place meanwhile . Then the congregation settled down to collecting the $50,000 . It took 21 years-until Nov. 23 , 1942 . Pulpit-filling ( 236 Ibs . ) Rev. J. H. Dotson promptly started a building fund , installed three small boxes near the door for contributions . <P> The plan worked well . Last week the first buff bricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June all the brick work will be finished , and the congregation will move from the basement into an auditorium seating 856 . After that , bit by bit , still paying as they go , Mount Zion 's members will complete their $150,000 building , a monument to patient perseverance-and a quietly Christian rebuke to racial intolerance .
