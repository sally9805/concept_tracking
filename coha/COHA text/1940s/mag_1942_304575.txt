Hedging its stake in the vital Soo Canal ( see map ) , the War Production Board last week set aside $30,000,000 to develop a second route by which the iron ore of the Mesabi and Marquette ranges can travel down the Great Lakes to the steel mills of Gary , Youngstown and Pittsburgh . The new route will add perhaps a month to the open-water season , expand ore-carrying capacity , and keep the ore moving even if something should happen to halt shipments through the Soo . <P> Through the locks at Sault Ste. Marie some 84,000,000 tons of rust-red iron rock will pass this year . WPB hopes to raise this total to 100,000,000 this next year by developing the little ore port of Escanaba on the warmer waters of Lake Michigan , so that when needed it can handle 5,000,000 tons a month . This means not only new docks , but also improved rail supply lines to Escanaba direct from Duluth-Superior and from Marquette . <P> Biggest threat is ice , which closes the Soo more than four and a half months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas not even Paul Bunyan could get a boat through the 70-foot barriers piled up by the freezing winds . But Lake Michigan freezes six days later than Lake Superior , thaws eleven days earlier in the spring ; and additional ice breakers ( one of them big enough to cut through ice 9 ft. thick ) will keep boats going for perhaps another two weeks . An extra month of open water would mean perhaps 10,000,000 added tons for the hungry furnaces of the lower lakes .
