Here is a brief outline of the TIME process : the Newsmagazine " goes to bed " Monday night so that it can be printed and distributed across the nation on Thursday , for reading over the weekend . TIME editorial workers have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off . TIME 'S editorial operations are laid out in a series of concentric circles . As the week wears on , the focus of activity contracts from circle to circle toward the center . <P> The outermost circle is the Associated Press report , other news services , the newspapers , and TIME 'S correspondents . On Thursday , TIME 'S New York office has story suggestions from the bureaus . Editors there send correspondents detailed queries . On Thursday and Friday the correspondents are busy getting answers to these queries . Meanwhile , in New York a writer and a researcher are assigned to each story . <P> The researchers , under the direction of Senior Editor Content Peckham and five departmental chief researchers , form the next circle . They spend Thursday afternoon and Friday digging up material available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview New York sources of information . <P> By late Friday or Saturday , activity is concentrated in the next circle , the writers , who have spent the preceding day going over available material . <P> TIME writers rarely make Saturday night engagements ; that is the time when they are trying to shape the research-yards of cables , pounds of memoranda , newspaper clippings , books-into stories . <P> Their stories go to the copy desk , which bears no resemblance to a newspaper copy desk . It is a busy traffic center where stories are typed , " styled " for capitalization , etc. , counted for an estimate of how much space they will take in the magazine . <P> The copy desk sends the stories back to the department 's senior editor . There are six departmental senior editors , each with a staff of writers and researchers . The senior editors form the next circle ; their day of misery or joy is Sunday , and their task is to act as " arms " of the managing editor . They sometimes hand stories back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , if the stories are not " right , " the senior editor rewrites them . <P> When stories are passed by senior editors , the copy desk sends them to the circles ' center , Managing Editor Matthews . From the start of the work week he has been reading papers , magazines , dispatches , trying to get the " feel " of the week 's news , to figure out what is important and what is n't . He has probably sent out 40 or 50 notes to editors and writers . These include suggestions ranging from an outline of the lead story in National Affairs to a nice phrase from the Economist . A dozen times a day , he is in touch with his senior editors and with Executive Editor Roy Alexander , whose job is to keep the editorial machinery running smoothly .
