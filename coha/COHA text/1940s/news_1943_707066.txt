txt WASHINGTON , . April ** House , in its third tempestuous session in two weeks devoted to consideration of the Justice Department 's War Security Bill , passed the measure with a voice vote today . It tightens existing law to provide adequate punishment , including death , for spies , saboteurs and others convicted of hostile acts against the United States . The measure now goes to the Senate . Passage of the bill came after the House , voting 93-133 , rejected a motion , supported for the most part by Republicans , which would have sent it back to the Judiciary Committee without recommendaItions . Before final votes were taken , however , the measure had undergone numerous modifications , designed to but down the broad sweep of the committee 's draft and to insert statutory safeguards , against " hysterical " or overzealous enforcement of its severe provisions . Protection for Free Press To give specific protection to freedom of speech and the press , the House adopted , 123-95 , an amendment sponsored by Representative Fish of New York which provides : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any citizen or citizens or any newspaper or othel ? publication at any time from freely discussing or openly criticizing the domestic or foreign policies of the Administration or the Federal Government or of any public official or from discussing or criticizing any existing or proposed law , regulations , directive ; or executive order .

The gaps in law which Attorney General Biddle asked the Congress last Autumn to close promptly in the interest of internal security are Many .

If an enemy agent planned a campaign of sabotage and collected large quantities of explosives and incendiary materials for the mission , it was emphasized , he would not be guilty of any serious crime under present statute unless he was close enough to an actual dynamiting or burning of a factory or bridge to be charged with " an attempt . " The harboring of enemy agents , the Justice Department complained , was not covered adequately by existing law . Nor , it held , was law sufficiently stringent to impress all those with information regarding actual or impending hostile acts with the necessity for disclosing it to proper authorities . Harsh Penalties Imposed As drafted by the committee the measure provided that whoever , when the United States is at war , commits any hostile act , as defined in the bill , shall , upon conviction , suffer death or imprisonment for life or for such terms of years as the court may direct . The House specified that the commission of a hostile act must be shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same provision was inserted in the clause under which those who attempt or conspire to commit a hostile act , upon conviction , would suffer life imprisonment , or less , if the court directs , though the death penalty could be imposed where an official , employe or agent of an enemy country were involved . As recommended by the Justice Department , a corporation or association convicted of committing a hostile act would be fined not more than $100,000 , but the committee raised the maximum to $500,000 . The House , through an amendment by Representative Rankin of Mississippi , increased the top fine to $5,000,000 . At first the committee recommended that any person knowing " or having probable cause to believe " that another had committed , was committing or was about to commit a hostile act against the country , and failed to report the information to the F. B. I. within a reasonable time , would be liable to up to ten years ' imprisonment or a fine not to exceed $10,000 , or both .

As the third day of fighting over the legislation drew to a close , Representative Sumners , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , stated that there appeared to have been abundant opportunity for discussion , and proposed that a vote be taken . The House agreed readily .
