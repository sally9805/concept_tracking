London 's Colonial Office stiffly announced : His Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor has resigned , effective on April 30 , as Governor and Commander in Chief of the Bahamas . The resignation , said the Government , need occasion no surprise : the Governor 's " normal tenure " of five years is almost up . The Bahamas have enjoyed a greater measure of prosperity since the Duke took office . <P> On Nassau 's palm-fringed Government House a barrage of phone calls and cables descended . For half a day the Duke of Windsor was not at home to any queries . Then he donned a dapper , grey check suit , pinned a red carnation in his lapel , and with his well-dressed Duchess at his side , gallantly went forth to meet the press and explain his second abdication . <P> There was not much to explain , really . On April 30 , when he had asked to be relieved , his normal five-year tenure would still have three months to run . ( The newsmen had heard the rumor that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand the heat of the Bahamian summer . But the Duke said nothing about that . ) Some distant day , said the Governor , he and the Duchess would like to return . " I have a deep affection for the Bahamas . . . . " <P> Even with the woman he loved , the onetime King-Emperor who had ruled over a domain on which the sun never sets could not be very happy ruling 29 islets , 661 cays and 2,387 sandspits . In public , however , he was always correct . Only in private did he say " This Elba ! " and she echo " This St. Helena ! " <P> It had been a long time . When they first came , there had been that embarrassing scene at the Emerald Beach Club when Nassau high society had formally welcomed the Duke and snubbed his Duchess . The colonials had to be more British than the British . <P> " Both the Duchess and I love to travel , " the Duke said , and added : " Nearly five years in Nassau is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my adolescence , and the longest I hope to spend in any place in the future . . . . We have no immediate plan beyond going to New York and probably to my ranch in Canada . " <P> Said the Duchess : " With the world as it is , one could not make a decision now . But we shall definitely visit France . Our possessions are scattered all over France. * We must see what is left . . . . " <P> To one more question the Duke answered : <P> " My resignation does not mean a permanent severance from public life . After the war men with experience will be badly needed , and I 'll fit in anywhere that I can be helpful . ... I have interests in Canada , America and Europe . ... I shall go to England some day . . . . " <P> But the fact was , and he knew it , that in a world where there is little demand for men whose only training is as King-Emperor , he was technologically unemployable , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General of Canada , but there was scant chance of it-not so long as straitlaced Bachelor Mackenzie King was the Dominion 's Prime Minister . Australia had already received his brother Gloucester . And the British were not likely to make David 's Wally Vicereine of India . Perhaps France and conspicuous unemployment were inevitable . <P> <P> *Mostly at their house in Paris and at La Cre , their faintly colonial villa on the Riviera.
