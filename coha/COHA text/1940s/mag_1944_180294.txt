When one identical twin gets heart trouble , the other usually has it or soon gets it . But not so in the case of G.G. and R.G. Of these medically anonymous twins , G.G. is known to his friends as " SpeedUp George , " R.G. is known as " Lead in the Pants . " In the process of living up to his twin brother , who is huskier and a little smarter , G.G. has become a highly sociable live wire , a Mason , a Woodman . He has also achieved a blood pressure of 180 ( normal blood pressure : around 140 ) , and has had a ngina pectoris for the last twelve years . ( The twins are 56 . ) <P> R.G. is slow and solid . Though he weighs 250 lb . ( G.G. weighs only 175 lb. ) , there is nothing the matter with R.G. 's heart . His blood pressure is only 135 . His health is excellent . <P> Drs . Meyer Friedman and Jacob Sergei Kasinin became interested in G.G. 's and R.G. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover some organic difference in the twins . There was no difference . The doctors even tested the flow of blood to the kidneys , because a poor kidney blood supply is believed to lead to heart trouble . Both twins had a poor kidney blood supply . Mystified , the doctors conclude that 1 ) Lead in the Pants has something the matter with him that the doctors can not find ; 2 ) Speed-Up George ( who now has a heart attack daily ) hardened his arteries and exhausted his heart solely by his " tension and drive . " This , if true , shows that bad psychological habits can bring on heart disease without any help from infection or inheritance .
