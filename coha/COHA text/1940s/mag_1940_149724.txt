Most U. S. citizens regard totalitarians as a foreign breed , find it hard to believe that they can grow in U. S. soil . Yet not every totalitarian is trained in a totalitarian school . Last week one appeared at Harvard . TIME herewith reports the brief case history of a native U. S. Nazi . <P> Dale H. Maple , 20 , is a clean-cut U. S. boy , with hazel eyes , white , even teeth , a firm , straight jaw . Born in San Diego , Calif , to middle-class U. S. parents , he went to San Diego High School , shone in his studies , showed talent in music . A devout Catholic , he attended church every Sunday . In school he studied German , became interested in German culture . He graduated from high school at 16 . <P> At home , affairs went less well . His father and mother eventually separated . His father wanted Dale to be a chemical engineer , his mother , a diplomat . Three years ago Dale entered Harvard . To please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; second year , to please his father , he majored in chemistry . Third year , he pleased himself , concentrated on comparative philology-because he had always wanted to be a linguist . <P> Shy and unhappy , Dale made few friends , immersed himself in the study of difficult languages-Assyrian , Catalan , Hungarian . For relaxation , he joined the Verein Turmwchter ( Harvard 's German Club ) , became its treasurer . With fellow club members , he spoke German , drank beer , sang German songs , heard German speakers , discussed German culture . For all their Germanic carousing , his companions remained good democrats . But they soon began to discern in Dale Maple a growing admiration for Adolf Hitler , and for Nazi " efficiency . " Dale took perverse pleasure in shocking his associates by singing the Horst Wessel song and Deutschland Uber Alles . When pink-cheeked Faculty Adviser James Hawkes became perturbed and tried to squelch his Nazi talk , Dale conceived a cordial dislike for Instructor Hawkes , became still more defiant . To the dismay of his roommate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week Dale Maple shocked arch-patriotic Harvard by resigning from the Verein Turmwchter and publicly applauding Hitler and all his works . To the Harvard Crimson 's editors , who could scarcely believe their ears , he defiantly exclaimed : " Even a bad dictatorship is better than a good democracy . " To educators , Dale Maple 's case proved little about Harvard , much about the psychology of frustration .
