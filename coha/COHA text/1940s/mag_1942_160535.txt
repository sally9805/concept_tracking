Seven nights a week the dusky , barnlike basement of Manhattan 's 44th Street Theater is crammed and crawling with pleasure-seekers . No liquor is served , but there is dancing to hot name bands , with pretty show girls and such movie stars as Bette Davis and Janet Gaynor waiting to be picked off as partners . On the walls are gay murals by the theater 's top scene designers-Jo Mielziner , Donald Oenslager , Raoul Pne du Bois , Gertrude Lawrence , Eddie Cantor , the dancing De Marcos , the Quiz Kids with Tallulah Bankhead as Quizmaster , are part of the endless floor show . The food is good , and Producer Brock Pemberton , Novelist Carl Van Vechten , Actor Sam Jaffe are among the busboys . And the whole thing is free . <P> But only men in the uniforms of the United Nations are admitted . Established by the American Theater Wing War Service , the Stage Door Canteen represents the joint efforts of the whole entertainment field ( stage , cinema , vaudeville , radio , music ) to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get cruising through town and paying through their noses . With hundreds of people cheerfully providing time , skill and materials , a $20,000 reconstruction job was done on the theater basement for less than $300 . <P> Opening at five , closing down tight at midnight , the Canteen in its first week entertained 8,800 boys , last week entertained 14,000 . In its month 's history , it has only once removed the welcome sign , and then for five minutes : after 2,300 boys had clogged the place to asphyxiation . <P> High point in entertainment is from 6 to 7 p.m. , when the big musicals rotate parts of their shows ; after that , there is special entertainment at intervals all evening . A big draw is Blonde Colette Lyons , who tosses her torso around , shouting lines like : " I 'm a sport with the boys at the Fort " or " I 'm the toast of the boys at the Post . " Anything raw on the performers ' part is out . Betweenwhiles , the boys dance , or sit eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about 50 to 100 show-girl " hostesses " a night , there are also an increasing number of " senior hostesses " ( older actresses like Antoinette Perry and Constance Collier ) , because the Canteen has found that lots of the kids are skirt-shy , only feel at home with substitutes for Mother . For all hostesses there are two ironclad rules : They must be members of the entertainment professions ( or the daughter or wife of a member ) , and they may not leave the place with a service man . <P> So far , except for an occasional brush between soldiers and sailors , there has been no roughhousing at the Canteen . But in case there is , it has the advice of the Army morale branch as to what to do : " Play The Star-Spangled Banner . The boys in uniform must stand at attention or get thrown in the clink.
