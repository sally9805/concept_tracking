SCORN AND COMFORT A STORY BY CHRISTOPHER LA FARGE ' s nearly four years now since Jimmy Tr Massa. left us . I get letters from him at regular intervals from Middlefield School . in Connecticut , where he 's the physical director . That is the sort of job he should be doing  --  working with young boys , not laboring on my little farm . He got the job for himself , and in spite of his pride  --  first he got the Cottrellton High School , and then , because he was so obvious a choice , Middlefield . What his letters reflect is a man who , having found a way he had lost , is now happily occupied . That makes me happy too , for I grew to be very fond of Jimmy , and I shall never forget what he was like when he came to work for us in 1935 . He had a battle to win in those days , and now he has won it ; but it was a hard battle . The day he turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants out in a body once a week in summer , so as to leave the decks clear for the rest of the week . That day Missy was canoeing with the three children on Naius River and I was in the kitchen , tired from a day 's good work , getting things ready for the children 's supper . He did n't knock at the kitchen door , because it was open . He just appeared at it . One minute there was nothing there but the July sun on the lilac bushes and the next , there was a large man in dirty clothes with a face very clean though unshaved . It gave me a start , because the farm is rather off the beaten track and tramps do n't drop in there as they do near the Post Road . " How de do , " he said . " Hello , " I answered him , and set the top of the double-boiler with the soup in it on the kitchen table . " What can I do for you ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm the owner , " I said . " Oh , so ? " he said , and sort of nodded his head . " You could n't do with a little work , could you ? " " No , " I said . " We 're in good shape here . " It was n't true , but I 've never much liked handing out odd jobs to strangers with so many of the local people wanting work . " Those pines , " he said , jerking his thumb over his shoulder . " The ones that blew down . If they 're yours I could clean them up . Pm handy with an axe and a saw . " " They went in the ice-storm last winter , " I said . " Worse than usual here . Yes , they 're mine but I figured to let the local boys clean them up . I 'm sorry . Want something to eat ? " He shook his head but I saw him swallow . " No , thanks , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm no bum . It 's just I have n't a nickel . " " For a cup of coffee ? " I said and smiled at him . I wanted to see if he 'd try a touch . He did n't smile back but nodded his head and said , " For a cup of coffee . That 's it . " He had his hat on all this time , a wider-brimmed felt hat than one sees in Rhode Island . He raised his hand to it in a rather grand salute and said , " Well , O.K. I 'll be going . " Then he turned away at once . " Sorry I ca n't help you , " I said . " There 's plenty of food here . Better have a bite before you go . " " No , thanks , " he said and did n't turn back but kept going . There must have been something about his walk and his manner that moved me ( and I 'm not too easily moved by bums ) , for I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went out after him into the hot sun and I called out , " Wait a minute . " He stopped and turned round , but slowly  --  it reminded me of someone in a car with bad brakes , trying to stop while going down hill . He did n't just stop and turn : he slowed down and made a wider turn than most men do and then stopped . " Yeah ? " he said . " Where are you from ? " I asked . " Idaho , " he said . I could n't resist it  --  it had been used on us so often in the West that it had become a family joke  --  I said , " You 're a long way from home . " " Yes , " he said , and he added , " That 's it . " Still he did n't smile . I thought to myself , You 're a solemn sort of bloke . I looked at him again . He had clear gray eyes and a long , straight nose . I rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine . His face under its stubble , now that I saw it out of doors , had an unhealthy color . I made up my mind to help him although it occurred to me then that Missy might be upset by having a complete stranger on the place . Still I could put him in the Old Room in the barn , and Fred was up there with his wife and his brother in the tenement . I 'd never done anything like this before and it made me nervous . " Listen , " I said . " Come back now and get some coffee and something to eat . Then we 'll talk of work . " " 0 . K. , " he said , " and thank you . " I led the way back into the kitchen and gave him a chair . He sat on it , holding the wide-brimmed hat in his hands and saying nothing . I put on some coffee , got the leg of lamb out of the ice-box , and set a plate and knife and fork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown bread and a cup and saucer and some butter on a plate . " Draw up to the table , " I said . " You can begin on these and the coffee wo n't be long . Want some soup ? " " I do n't mind if I do , " he said and rose and hung his hat on a peg and pulled his chair up to the table . " Could I use the sink ? " he asked . " Help yourself , " I said . He went over to the sink and washed his hands with the yellow soap and dried them on the roller towel . Then he sat down again . The water in the bottom of the double-boiler was boiling and it did n't take long to heat the soup . He waited for it . I noticed that he sat very still , never twiddling his hands , and that he swallowed constantly . Now that his hat was off I saw his hair was so blond as to be almost white . / did n't try to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup and coffee and finally remembered the sugar , and when he 'd had one helping of the meat , cut him some more . He ate rapidly and silently . With very little urging he finished all the bread and the butter and there was n't much left of the meat . He had three cups of coffee . Then he wiped his mouth with a surprisingly clean but crumpled white handkerchief out of his hip pocket and said , " I sure am obliged . " " Not at all , " I said . " Have a ciga-rette . " " Thanks , " he said and took one . He did n't even have a match , so I pushed over the kitchen box . He lighted his cigarette and said , " I sure feel better now . " " Yes , " I said , " food helps . " " Yep , " he said . " You bet . " " You 're good with an axe , you say ? " " Done plenty of that sort of work , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " we 'll try it out and see how it goes . They get three-fifty a day hereabouts . Some get four . But they feed themselves . " " All right with me , " he said . " Job 's the thing . " " Trying to get home ? " I asked . " No , " he said and shook his head . " No , sir . " " Like it East ? " He looked straight at me and he said , after a brief pause , " No . Do n't like it any place . But you got to live . " " Yes , " I said . " My name is James Massell , " he said . " Pocatello . " " I 'm Jonathan Walters , " I said . " Pleased to meet you , " he said , and nodded his head . " That your wife and kids in the canoes down yonder ? " " That 's right , " I said . " You need n't to worry about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's right , " I said . " I figured you were n't . Let 's go up to the barn now and I 'll show you where you can sleep and introduce you to the farmer here . " There was a certain dignity about him that made a lot of questions seem impertinent . Some people carry their dignity with them very palpably : he was one of them . He rose and took his hat from the peg and put it on . Then he said , " Want I should help you clean up here ? " " No , " I said . " The servants will do that later . " " You bet , " he said . As we came out the kitchen door we ran into Missy and the children , carrying cushions and backrests and paddles , and the littlest boy , Edgar , was dragging a ginger-ale bottle behind him on a long string . Missy looked slightly surprised but she smiled and said , " Hello . " " Missy , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to help clean up the down pines . This is my wife , " He took off his hat , and said , " How do you do , ma'am ? " " How do you do ? " she said and offered her hand . He shook it politely . George , who was thirteen , said , " Gee , do you come from Idaho ? " Massell turned to him and then for the first time he smiled . " Yes , sir , " he said . " Plumb all the way from Idaho . " " Gee , " said George , and then , as though it had been prearranged , all three of the children said in chorus , " You 're a long way from home . " " Yes indeedy , " he said . " Sure is a long way . " Elizabeth sidled up to him and said , " Oh , Mr. Massell , did you ride your horse here ? " " No . Did n't ride no horse . " He smiled at her and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such a long way . " " Oh , " she said , and giggled . She had noticed , as I had not till then , that he wore Pendleton trousers . " Well , " I said . " Come along . I 'm taking him up to the barn to see Fred . Are there blankets in the Old Room ? " " Yes , " said Missy . " The bed 's made up , I think . " I started off and Massell followed me . Edgar called out , " Good-by , good-by , " and the other two said , " See you soon . " " You bet , " said Massell . He waved his hat at them and smiled . As we walked up toward the barn , he directly beside me , I took a look at his face . I do n't ever remember having seen a man wear an expression of such pain . " You 're not ill , are you ? " I said . / could n't help it . " No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't ask questions of a man that looked like that , so I shut up . I 'm glad I did . It took just about three days to find out all you 'd ever need to know about Jimmy Massell as a worker : he was magnificent . Fred Warder , who 's a worker himself , took to Jimmy on sight , and Fred is hard to please . Jimmy knew more about horses and cows and sheep than Fred did , and as Fred is the sort of man who is born to learn , that was fine , for he could learn from Jimmy . By the end of September we did n't any of us know how it was possible we 'd run the place all these years without him . I put him on permanent wages and he bought himself a few shirts and necessaries , and the only bother we ever had with him was to get him to come in for his dinner . But no one except the children could ever make him smile . I do n't mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was just solemn and permanently sad-looking : a serious man , who avoided all intrusion on himself . With the children , whom he never avoided and who seemed never to be able to annoy him when they were with him , he was uniformly pleasant and kind though not very talkative . He 'd show them how to make the things children are forever busy at  --  huts in the woods and flag-poles and additions to the henhouse and laying-boxes and bows and arrows , and a rudder for the skiff  --  which last seemed to me a surprising accomplishment for an Idaho man . They asked him countless questions but he never answered any that were personal , and George was full of curiosity about him . George would ask me about him , but I knew little more than the boy did . " What makes him so sad ? " George asked . " I do n't know , " I said . " Some secret of his own . " " Something bad ? " said George . " I doubt it , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do you think he looks like a bad man ? " " Oh , no ! " said George . " He 's nice . He 's a good man . Anyone could see Jimmy was a good man . " " How do you figure that out ? " " Well , " he said , " it 's just he looks good . Does n't he look good , Daddy ? " " Yes , " I said . " He 's a good worker too . " " He 's so strong , " said George . " I wish I knew why he looks sad . I wish he 'd tell me . " " That 's his business , " I said . " Do n't go asking questions of grown-ups about what is n't your business . " " O.K. , " said George . " He knows all about all kinds of games . Lizzie thinks he looks sad too . " " All right , " I told him , " but you tell Lizzie what I 've said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand ? I 'll not have you children bothering Jimmy Massell . " " O.K. , Pop , " he said . " I 'll tell Lizzie . I 'll see she does n't bother Jimmy . But you know what ? " " What ? " I said . " When Fred went out to shoot the crows he asked Jimmy if he wanted to come too and Jimmy said No ' and Fred said why did n't he and Jimmy said he did n't shoot no more  --  I mean any more ? and I said to Jimmy ' Why not , ' and he said just ' Never no more guns , ' and so I said Oh yes a farewell to arms ' ? you know that book you said I 'm not to read till I am more mature ? " " Yes , " I said . " Well , " said George , " he looked at me and he said what 's that and I said it 's a book that my father said I was not to read till I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a farewell to arms . Then Jimmy said , ' Oh , quotations , ' he said , ' Eh , oh quotations again , ' and he turned round and went away looking sad again . Is n't that funny ? " " Yes , " I said . " Why did he do that ? " asked George . " I have n't the faintest notion , " I said , but after George had gone his way I thought it over . Later I reported all this to Missy and we speculated about it , but I ca n't say we got very far with it . One day late in October , when the two older children were away at school , Edgar escaped from Nurse . Edgar was the member of the family who had to find out everything , good or bad , for himself . At his stage then he was experimenting with string . Jimmy had diverted his mind from the experiment of swinging bottles on the end of a long string into stone walls , to see how much force it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy a tin can on a string and had got him started on the experiment of how fast must the can be swung , when full of water , to retain most of the water , and at what point in the proceedings did it soak the swinger . It was better than the bottles , but Nurse disapproved of it . Now Edgar had run away and Nurse , intelligently , asked me where Jimmy was working that morning . I said I had to see Jimmy and Fred and that I 'd find the boy and send him up to her . I knew the men were repairing the stone wall back of the oak grove . When I got near where they were working , I heard Jimmy speak . He said : " You do that so good , son , that it 's a pity not to show Nurse how good you do it . " " Yipee ! " cried Edgar . " Lookit ! Yipeel " " How strong is the string ? " said Fred . He was a cautious man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the trees and out to the clearing by the wall . Edgar was there . He was swinging the can ; it was full of water , and he was n't spilling a drop  --  but when he saw me it distracted him , and he tried to slow it down too quickly and it soaked his legs and shoes . " Hi ! " I said . " Now then , young man , off with you . Nurse wants you . " Edgar was already headed for a pool of rain water to refill his can . " I 'll just fill it up once more , " he said . " No , " I said . " Go now , Edgar , do you hear me ? " " I 'll just do it all once more , and as soon as it spills , I 'll go , " he said . " I promise . " He was busy filling up the can . " Edgar , " said Jimmy . " Yes , " said Edgar , looking round from where he squatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and winked . Edgar rose , emptied the can neatly back into the pool with the remark , " We might need that water some day , " and rising , said , " So long . Be good , " and started off toward the house , swinging the empty can roundhim . It made a whooshing noise . " Yipee ! " said Edgar . " All the way to the house ? " said Jimmy . " You bet , " said Edgar . He disappeared . Fred laughed . He has children too . " How do you do it ? " I asked . " We get on fine , " said Jimmy . " I see you do . But I have to argue , always . Why not you ? " " I 'm not his , " said Jimmy . " That 's true , " I said , " but it 's not all of it . " " Practice , " said Jimmy . " I worked with kids . " It was the first time he had made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an idea : the possible answer to a problem that had bothered me for weeks . " Look , " I said . " Did you really work with kids ? " " Yes , " he said . " Five years of it . " " Like it ? " " I liked it fine . " " Ever done camping and that sort of thing ? " " Plenty of it . Plenty . " " We need you then , " I said . " See here . There 's no one to take the Boy Scouts here . The troop is going to pieces . It would mean just about one full day a week . There are ten Scouts here . Would you take that on ? " " And the work here ? " " It would n't cut into your pay , " I said . " I 'd be glad to keep that up as usual , sort of a contribution ; I have n't done what I should have about it . Is n't that a good idea ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Fred . " Who 'd appoint me ? " said Jimmy . " Why , I do n't know , " I said . " If you 'd just tell us what you 'd done , working with boys and like that , and who to write to , we could get you appointed easily enough . " " No , " said Jimmy . " It 's just a formality , " said . " I 'd vouch for you really . And you , Fred ? " " Surely , " said Fred . " Any time . " " No , " said Jimmy , " It would n't add to your work , " I said , " and it would mean a little more money . " " That 's not it , " said Jimmy . " Do n't like the work then ? Working with the Scouts ? " " The Scouts are good , " he said . " You get someone else . " " No , " I said , " I 'd like you . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have accepted it , but it had been such a good idea : he had a wonderful hand with the young . I could see too that Fred agreed with me . " Damn it , Jimmy , " I said , " that 's too bad . I 've offered to keep up the pay , you 'd get whatever small sum they give , and I 'd be willing to make that up too , and you 'd do a fine service here . A fine service . Badly needed . Ca n't you see that ? " He looked at me for a minute without speaking or moving . " Listen , " he said . " This is Rhode Island . " " Yes , " I said . " I come from Idaho , " he said . " Once you said to me , ' You 're a long ways from home . ' Yes sir , it 's a long way . In Idaho I worked with kids . Here I work for you . I aim to work good ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could see he was not to be moved . " Too bad , " I said . " Let it go . But it 's too bad . If you change your mind let me know , will you ? " " I wo n't , " he said . I dropped it then , as I should have done before , and we spoke of the work on the wall and other matters of that sort . As i walked back to the house I puzzled the matter over in my head and could make but little of it . Some trouble of course , but with a man like that it was hard to guess what trouble it could have been . It was n't till mid-November that I got the answer to it . It was one of those fine , still days , cold in the shade , warm in the sun , that come in November after a northeaster . Unfortunately for me , Fred had promised to go over to the Island to look at a stud-ram , and the only other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woodchuck were busy . Remembering George 's story of the crows , I did n't ask Jimmy to go , but went shooting by myself . The birches and alders had lost most of their leaves and the sumachs were already a dark brown , their boughs leafless too . I was fairly lucky and I shot three woodcock and four snipe . By the time I got home it was dusk , and I was good and tired and so was the dog . I came in through the new pasture we were fencing for sheep , and I found Jimmy there , still digging up the patch of sheep-laurel that grew beyond the south hill overlooking the river . You can spot the green of the sheep-laurel easily at that time of year when the low huckleberries are red . It was all uphill from that spot to the house , so I said " Hello " to him and sat on a tuft of broom-sedge to rest for a minute and pass the time of day . I had that lovely feeling of being tired and triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " Hello , Jonathan , " and went right on digging . " How are you doing ? " I asked . " O.K. , " he said . " Plumb O.K. I 've got just one more of these patches to go . " " Good , " I said . " It 's going to make a good pasture . " " Yes , " he said , " it 'll be a fine run . " " I had a good day , " I said . " I 'm tired now . " " Yes ? " he said . " I found plenty of birds , " I said . " But it 's hard alone . They always get up the other side of something . Woodcock and snipe . " " Snipe ? " he said . " Yes , they do . " " I got three woodcock and four jacks , " I said . " One of the jacks is very big . " I fished in the game pocket and pulled out the birds and sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the big snipe . " Look at that . You know these birds , these snipe ? " " Yes , " he said . " Ever see a bigger snipe than that ? " " He 's sure big , " he said , glancing at it . He stood with one foot on the spade and both hands on the handle . " And heavy , " I said , holding it out to him . " Heft it . " " Do n't need to , " he said , never moving . I looked at him . Perhaps it 's the green light of dusk , I thought , or else he looks plain common or garden ill . " Are you all right , Jimmy ? " I asked . " You look sick . " " No , " he said . " I 'm all right . " But his voice sounded choked and remote . He stood too still . I took my courage in both hands  --  because I was already fond of this big man  --  and I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats you . We do n't know what it is , but from time to time we raise it up , so to speak , without meaning to . " He said nothing . " Like the Boy Scouts , " I said . He did n't answer me . " Too bad to tell of ? " I asked . " I 'd like to help . " " Talking do n't help , " he said , his voice hard . " Oh , " I said , " that 's not so ! " I have never known why I should have said then what I did , for I have never been a great hand at quotations . Nevertheless I quoted then , for the lines leaped into my mind : " Give sorrow words ; the grief that does not speak whispers the o'erfraught heart . " He made a slight movement of his body and grunted the way a man does when you spar with him and hit him lightly on the button , just enough to let him know you can do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his face clearly . His voice was still hard . " You saying that , or someone else ? " he said . " Someone else , " I said . " Shakespeare , to be exact . " " Why not say your own says ? " he said . " He said it better than I can . A long time ago . And it 's still true . " " Snipe , " he said . " First kids and then snipe and then quotations . It would happen that way . " I said nothing at all , having nothing to say . He was silent a moment or two . I wondered what I should do . I was beginning to feel chilly as well as uncomfortable in his presence in this evening darkness . " Listen , " he said suddenly . " Just listen to this , pal . Once I knew a man , a married man with a wife that liked me plenty , and two small children , and he was a great man for quotations . He taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face without he quoted something at you . One day I shot him as well as a snipe , with one shot . Now you know . Now I 've told you . What good does it do you to know ? What the hell good does it do me to have you know ? Do I go around the rest of my life saying to folks , ' See here , do n't quote to me , you literary bastards , and do n't say nothing to me about snipe ? ' " There was a pause . I said then , " I 'm sorry . It was none of my business . " " It 's O.K. , " he said . I had just made the first move to rise and go home when he said , " It was an accident . Which do n't help so much . " " No , " I said and sat still . " I did n't mean to be so tough about it , " he said . " No , " I said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pay you work . We do n't neither of us owe the other for anything . I do n't owe you but work . " " That 's correct , " I said . " It 's just that these things are your own . " " As you choose , " I said . He stood there , a huge man against the fading light of the southwest . I sat still then . After a little he spoke again , but his voice was less harsh than it had been . " I used to kid him about it , " he said . " Always quoting this and that at me . I 'd say , ' Why in hell do n't you say it in your own words , eh ? Ca n't you speak without you get someone else n't like his kind  --  soft , a borrower ; but there was n't anyone else , like here , who would hunt snipe . It 's like you said , it 's tough alone . Two can work it . He was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spook a snipe out your side half the time anyways . I used to go longer than I meant to just because it amused me to see how tired he got , and how pooped out he was when we got back to the car at the end of the day . He 'd a hated so to say he was too tired to go on . I did n't like him , and I shot him , by accident , and now all my money 's got to go to his widow and the kids . It is n't that I liked her so much , it was just a cheap jack stunt . Someone else 's wife when your own is dead and no children . The kids I liked plenty , they might as well have been my own . It 's a mess . See ? " " Yes , " I said . " So I left , " he said , " after it was over . Pulled out . Sold what I had  --  she did n't have a nickel . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . No , sir . And I ca n't see those kids . " " No , " I said . " It happened in the willows , " he said . " There was a small dam there , a good place . We took it both sides . He had farther to go than me , so I took it slow . What does he do but get ideas ? maybe they was quotations  --  into his head , and he run , must have , and he made a circle back of the willows and got out onto a piece that run plumb out into the pond the dam made . Jesus ! he was standing right in willows , nobody could have got a shot there . So when I spooked up this snipe it flew at him , but I did n't think he was a hundred yards of that place , and so I shot and it got him , fair in the chest , at fifteen yards . He had on a brown coat , in them brown willows . " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jimmy , in the darkness now , being just a black silhouette . " Yes , by God ! We 'd argued all the way there , forty-five miles by car : him quoting , me kidding him . He liked to talk big . He was telling me all about how a guy should die ; he was telling me ! And why people died well or badly and why people always got off fine cracks before they passed . He was too educated . I 'd just say , ' Nuts ! ' from time to time and laugh at him . I could afford to . He was thin and weak and he did n't shoot so good , and his wife liked me better than him , in spite of his education ? which is just one of those things . I had n't have ought to gone out with him . But I got a funny memory , I never forget things . I remember just what he said going over , one thing in especial . He said , ' The tongues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . Sounds nice . Means nothing . " I did n't dare to speak . " So what does he say when he dies ? I tried to bind him up , but hell , it was a mess ; he 'd bled too much . We was a mile and a half from the next ranch . made a bandage sort of , of a shirt , but he bled . He said just exactly nothing till he was pretty close to the end . Then he says just this and he was sort of breathless : ' The hazards of the chase . ' I suppose that was a quotation too . I went to get help , but he was dead when we got back to him . I had n't dared to try to carry him , he was light , but he 'd a bled worse . Hazards of the chase ! Jesus Christ ! Now you know . " " Yes , " I said . " Thank you for telling me . " " Oh , " he said , and I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to . Boy Scouts and references . " " That was fine , what he said . " " How do you mean , fine ? " he cried out . " How do you mean ? " " Just that , " I said . " What he said before he died . " " I suppose it was a quotation , " he said . " Even at the end he had to use somebody else 's words . " " I do n't think it 's a quotation , " I said . " A saying . " " What the hell difference does it make ? It was somebody else 's words , was n't it ? " I got up then and I faced him in the dusk , and I felt the beginnings of anger . He was too big a person to have let something like this sour inside himself with private keeping . " Listen to me , " I said . " Listen to me , Jimmy Massa ' . To-day is the fourteenth of November . Is that right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the nearest to absolute rudeness I ever had from him . " I give you till the fourteenth of December , " I said . " Oh , hell , what 's the use of a time limit ? Time is made for slaves . That 's probably a quotation . You can have till hell freezes over , if you 're so stubborn you need it . But one day you come to me and tell me in your own words in your own fine , personal words , a better way of saying what that man said . You tell me in . . . " I counted on my fingers , " five words , something pluckier , something better calculated to comfort a man who killed you , by accident , oh , yes , by accident . ' Never mind , dear old pal , ' or It was only just an accident , ' or ' It was my fault , old man , ' or something fine like those ? Five words . Let 's see you do it . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " I said . " I 'm chilly . I 'm going up to the house . You better come along . Fred 's wife 'll be waiting supper for you . " I turned then , aware suddenly that I was still holding the big snipe , and I put it hastily in my pocket , and he walked up the hill behind me in the darkness . Neither of us said a word . He turned off at the barn , and I went home . But I did n't tell Missy about it then ; it was n't my story . In the latter part of February of that winter I motored down to the farm from New York . I 'd had the two pointers shipped to Rhode Island from Georgia , and I wanted to see what sort of shapethey were in , and talk to Fred about them and about the spring planting . I spent a useful afternoon with Fred , but it was raw and cold and misty and thoroughly disagreeable weather . I got Fred 's wife to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Fred . I was going to motor up to Providence for the night . But I had a bone to pick before I left . " Look here , Fred , " I said . " I hear from Henry Kelley that Jimmy has taken on the Boy Scouts . " " Oh , yes , " said Fred . " Seems he has . He wants to see you . " " Oh , does he ? " I said . " When did he begin the work ? " " Must be near a month now . He does it evenings . " " Why in hell did n't someone write me of it ? " " Dunn , " said Fred , and grinned at me . It was typical of him that in all his competent letters about the farm he 'd not said a word about this . " Going well , is it ? " I asked . " They say so , " said Fred . " Folks hereabouts are real pleased . Henry Kelley 's boy 's joined up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let a man know about such news next time . " " Well , " said Fred . " Maybe he wanted to tell you . " I 'd have pursued the subject farther except that Fred 's brother Willie came in just then , with an old pump-gun over his arm . He looked cold . He said , " Good evening , Jonathan , " and went straight to the stove after he 'd set the gun in the corner . " Good evening , Willie , " I said . " How are you ? " " Fine , " he said . " You look cold , " I said . " Shootin ' crows , " he said . " Any luck ? " " We got eleven , " lie said . " He 's rigged a fine owl on a pole like . Plenty crows around . " " Who rigged the owl ? " " Jimmy done it , " said Willie . " Was he shooting too ? " I asked . " Him and Arthur Fletcher , " said Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anything else now you have n't told me ? " Fred laughed . " Guess not , " he said . " I do n't call anything to mind . " " Where 's Jimmy now ? " I asked . " Gone to the Old Room , " said Willie , " last I saw . He said he was real anxious to see you before you left . We stopped early . " " Well ! " I said . " Good-night , you uncommunicative Rhode Island clams . " " Good-night , " they said , smiling at me . " I 'll be down again in a week or so , " I said and left them . I went downstairs and out of the wing of the barn and round to the Old Room at the west end . There was a light in the room and I knocked at the door . I heard Jimmy 's voice call out , " Come on in . " I went in . " Hello , Jimmy , " I said . " How are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , Jonathan . I got a cold too . You have a terrible breed of weather in these parts . " " That 's too bad , " I said . " Fred said you wanted to see me . So did Willie . " " You seen Willie ? " he asked . " Yes , " I said . " And Fred . And Fred 's wife . And Henry Kelley . " " Yes , " he said . " I suppose if I could talk to Henry 's boy , and to Arthur Fletcher , and had time to visit all the rest of the rural free delivery box-holders of Chog 's Cove , Rhode Island , I 'd begin to find out the news about you . " " You might , at that , " he said . " I meant to of written you . " He took off his leather wind-breaker , hung it up on a nail , poured water into the basin , and began to wash his hands . " Why did n't you , Jimmy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And too hard . " I knew what he meant , but I was still piqued because I had heard of the MAGAZINE Scouts from Henry Kelley and the shooting from Willie . It was small of me , but I 'd thought of the whole pattern of it as something personal to Jimmy and to mc . " And the crow shooting ? " I said . " That too , " he said . " So the farewell to arms is off ? " He lathered his hands and rubbed them over his face and neck . I waited till he was through , but he said nothing . I waited for what seemed a Iong time . It 's funny how fond you can be of someone and how angry you can be at him all at the same time , wanting to hurt him . " Did you get your cold going shooting for crows ? " He took his towel and dried his face . When he had lowered the towel he looked at me . " May be , " he said . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase . " It was an inexcusable remark . I wished immediately I had n't made it . He looked hard at me and he said , " That could be too . " Then he finished drying his hands in silence , hung up his towel on its rack , and started to comb his hair . He finished that , still in silence , and put on his wind-breaker again . " They go together , " he said . " Not doing them , shooting and the Scout job , or doing them . I meant to tell you . " I had nothing I could say . " If I go on with the Scouts next summer , " he said , " is it still good about the day a week ? " It was an unexpected question . I said , " Why , yes of course . " " You do n't have to pay me for it , " he said . " That 's all right , " I said . " You know I want to pay . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on my own time . / recollected you said you wanted to contribute . They wrote to Idaho . " " Oh , " I said , " well done ! " " I was going to let you know , " he said . " But I waited to see you . You were right about what you said . " " About what , Jimmy ? " " What you said about me putting it in other words . I could n't do it . " " Oh , " I said . " I see what you meant . You were right . I 've thought about it plenty . I see what he meant . He was right too  --  in five words . " " That 's good , " I said . " That 's damn good . I did n't mean to be so small about it just now . " " You bet , " he said . " Thanks for telling me and thank you for doing the Scouts . " " I should do the thanking , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the doing of it that counts . There 's even a quotation for that , Jimmy . " " Is there ? " " Yes . ' Words are but empty thanks . " ' He looked at me , shaking his head . There was the shadow of a smile on his lips . " I could comment on that several short ways , " he said . " Short words too . " " But not original ? " I asked . " No , " he said . " Not original . Only the arrangement . But that 's life , pal . " I felt warm and comfortable inside myself , though it was his doing , and I smiled at him . " Yes , " I said . " That 's life . But we can wash the whole thing up now I guess . " " Yes , " he said . " We can wash it up now . " " So long , " I said . " I 've got to go . " " So long , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad I got to see you . I 'm glad I happened in here , first off . " " So am I , " I said . " You might have missed this farm too . It 's so off the road . " " It 's off the road , " he said . " But so was I. " " Yes , but not now . And not again , " I said . " So long . Will you go hunting with me next fall ? " " Sure will , " he said . " Even for quotations . " But he never did . He had the school job at Cottrellton then .
