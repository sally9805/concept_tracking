Up at the microphone the chairman was preparing the ovation for Senator Pepper 's radio address . " Clap fast , " he ordered , " not slow . Scream &; whistle . Pretend I 'm Orson Welles . " Perfunctorily and apathetically , the 300 delegates in the ornate Boulevard Room of Chicago 's Hotel Continental responded . " Pretend I 'm Joan Crawford , " cried the chairman . The applause was better , but still not good enough . " Pretend I 'm Henry Wallace . " The delegates to the " Conference of Progressives " tore the roof off . <P> It had been that way all day long . The meeting had been called by the National Citizen 's P.A.C. , the C.I.O. 's P.A.C , and the Independent Citizens ' Committee of the Arts , Sciences and Professions to draft a plan of political action . Though Henry Wallace did not appear , it was his show . <P> The words of the Wallace foreign policy argument echoed and re-echoed . Onetime Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau went down the line : outlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Freedoms of F.D.R. Said Harold Ickes : " We must spare no effort to get along with Russia . " <P> By the time the conference met in secret session to hammer out its program there was little doubt what it would be . The main points , as expected : 1 ) a Wallace-inspired foreign policy ( withdraw U.S. troops from China ; combat " imperialism " wherever found ; extend economic aid to war-devastated countries ; eliminate the step-by-step proposal of the Baruch atom control plan ) ; a New Dealing domestic policy ( price &; rent controls ; a federal civil rights bill ; extended social security ; minimum wages ; soak-the-rich taxation ) ; 3 ) a resolution applauding Henry Wallace . A permanent committee of 50 would be appointed after the November elections to keep the ball rolling . <P> Thus the conference ducked its most immediate problem : what to do in the 1946 elections . It vetoed a third party , for the time being , at least ; it refused to endorse the Democrats specifically . But whether they liked it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party of the convention heroes : Henry Wallace and Franklin Roosevelt .
