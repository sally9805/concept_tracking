The $80 million U.S. dentifrice industry was as fidgety last week as a colony of Lactobacillus acidophilus milling around in a test tube . Its chemists , prodded by sales executives , were feverishly mixing new powders and pastes in their labs . <P> What made the industry jumpy was the sudden growth of the ammoniated tooth cleansers-and the skyrocketing sales of a newcomer in the big dental field . Amm-i-Dent , the first widely distributed tooth powder to include carbamide ( urea ) and dibasic ammonium phosphate ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) , had climbed , so its makers claimed , to fourth place in sales among all U.S. dentifrices , surpassed only by Colgate , Ipana and Pepsodent . Amm-i-Dent , a dentifrice supposed to head off tooth decay , had indisputably set the trade 's teeth on edge . <P> Father &; Son . Amm-i-Dent is made by Jersey City 's little-known Block Drug Co. , founded 42 years ago and still very much bossed by taciturn Pharmacist Alexander Block , now 67 . As chairman , Block cracks the whip over a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 37 , who handles the money , and daughter Betty 's husband Albert Roberts , production boss . Together they boomed Block Drug to a gross of more than $10 million last year on 25 dental products ( Poloris dental poultices , Polident denture cleaners , etc . ) . <P> Last fall , a field man reported to President Melvin that several dentists in his territory were excited over ammoniated dentifrices . Researchers at the University of Illinois and at Manhattan 's Sydenham Hospital , testing the use of urea and dibasic ammonium phosphate to kill bacteria associated with tooth decay , had reported promising results . <P> Sound &; Fury . The Blocks rushed their Amm-i-Dent powder on the market in November , spent $400,000 on newspaper ads in 60 days , this year will spend $2,000,000 more on advertising . Because paste dentifrices get 85% of the market , the Blocks will spend $150,000 this year researching ammoniated pastes , expect to gross $3,000,000 on Amm-i-Dent powder but to lose money on it-because of the high promotion and research costs-until 1951 . By last week the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammoniated version of Dr. Lyon 's powder ; Rexall took full-page ads to announce its AmoRex ( a paste ) . Tide Magazine counted up 29 companies that were either in the field or about to jump in . Soon , it appeared any paste or powder without the new ingredient would be tagged as oldfashioned.
