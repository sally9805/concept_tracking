txt Indian Office Cuts Opposed HAVEN EMERSON , President . pg . 20 Letters to The Times Indian Office Cuts Opposed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Association on American Indian Affairs by action of its executive committee today warns Congress of the intolerable results that will follow any such cuts in Indian Office appropriations as have been announced . The cuts proposed will compel the United States to repudiate its treaty obligations , will violate the most elementary principles of education in a democracy and can not help but create a generation of permanent dependents incapable of self-support . A treaty in point is that of 1868 by which the United States agreed to provide a school or schoolroom and teacher for each thirty Navajo children of school age . There are 13,000 of such children now entirely lacking the education promised seventy-nine years ago . The Navajos in military service were taught how to become superior fighters about the world . The Navajos in peacetime need and demand education for self-support even before relief or other assistance . The integrity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in this calculated attack upon those of our people to whom we have owed most in proportion to their members as volunteers each time war has challenged our national safety . HAVEN EMERSON , President . New York , April 29 , 1947.
