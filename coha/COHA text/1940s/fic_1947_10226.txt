They formed the Executive Committee of the Women 's Division , with Mrs. Barnard in her classic place as chairman , of the annual drive to raise funds for the amalgamation of warreliefand social service agencies that had been formed at the beginning of the war . This was to be their final campaign , and they were committed to raise an enormous part of the seventeen millions of dollars which was the quota of New York City alone . Such an effort was never planned without women like Marguerite Barnard and the group who were coming to her house today . She greeted Jessie Bourne warmly and Jessie moved on into the beautiful room panelled with magnificent boiserie brought long ago from France , when the double-width limestone house had been built in a quiet tree-lined block east of Madison Avenue . The women were entering in groups of two and three ; they were all prompt because most of them had come from their offices and had allotted a precise amount of time to this meeting . Jessie saw Serena Lowden sitting on a divan across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Lowden smiled and patted the empty place beside her . She was a very old friend , a friend of Jessie 's mother , like Marguerite Barnard ; both women had carried over to Jessie their gentle and gracious affection for Rosa Landau . Serena Forbes Lowden was some twelve years older than Jessie ; Mrs. Barnard was old enough to be her mother . Mrs. Lowden asked , " How are you , dear ? " as they took small glasses of sherry ; and then , " Have you seen Horace lately ? " " Just yesterday , " said Jessie . " I was down at his office becauseMother 's trust is about to terminate . He was so sweet . He actually thought I would ask him what he had done with things these past ten years . " " Can it be ten years ! " exclaimed Serena Lowden . " I can not believe it . I have never got used to it . " " Nor I , " sighed Jessie . " And  --  " it seemed to Serena Lowden particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace misses her the very most of all . " " It is quite wonderful , " said Mrs. Lowden , " to have had a person like Horace Howland a part of one 's life ever since one can remember . " Jessie nodded , for she had had exactly the same experience . Horace Howland , who had been a close friend of old Nathaniel P. Forbes , was the trustee and adviser for Forbes ' only child , Serena Lowden . Old Forbes had tied up his estate , including control of The Press , in such a way that Alexander Lowden could have no share of it . Beyond his title and his salary , he was kept by thep101dead hand of his father-in-law perpetually a hireling . Those who knew him best believed that it was just as well . An enormous woman loomed before Jessie and Serena on the divan , greeting them in a bass voice . She was grotesque in every way , her plain black dress a tent well-made of the best possible material , her lank grey hair cropped off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy bas-relief of undulating flesh , with a small nose lost somewhere in the middle , her eyes devastatinglysharp , intelligent , and shrewd . She was nearly six feet tall and she weighed all of two hundred and fifty pounds . " Jessie , " she said , as if she were checking up on a culpable schoolgirl , " you did n't come to my cocktail party last week ! " " I was so disappointed , Althea , really I was . But I did telephoneand tell your secretary . " " No fool you , " boomed Miss Althea Crowe . " It was a horror . " " Then why , " asked Serena Lowden mildly , " give such a party ? " " My dear Mrs. Lowden , there are dozens of reasons for participating in polite rackets but you are evidently fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose . Or stay aloof . I am a wage slave . " " Poor thing , " said Jessie , laughing , as they joined the group that was following Mrs. Barnard downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women 's magazine which had the largest circulation of any periodical in the United States . The possessor of a mind like carbon steel , a woman who read for relaxation Plato , Dante , Chaucer , Marx , and Hegel all in the original , a terrific gormandizer and drinker , a wicked pokerplayer , she was responsible for purveying to millions of American women the marshmallow-flavored fiction that they loved , the cooing advice about their babies , their marriages , their menus , their dressmaking , their pineapple and peanut-butter salads . And when she thought it timely she also slammed into the front of her magazine a cold , cruel article about juvenile delinquency , world economics , adultery , illegitimacy , venereal disease , or the world trend toward state socialism . She was one of Jessie 's oldest friends . The luncheon went off quickly ; there were only three courses , light , delicious , and swiftly served , and all the women kept the talk upon the job that had brought them here . Jessie was seated between Oliver Whitelaw 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of as pathetic ; and Mrs. Thomas Renshaw , a vivid , smiling , pink-cheeked woman of about thirtyfive , who was considered the ablest organizer of civic and communityactivities in New York . She exuded good will , energy , and intelligence ; she was a woman of little imagination , but she bubbled with frank , healthy charm . " Mrs. Renshaw , " said Marguerite Barnard , who was now standing at one end of the cleared luncheon table , upon which nothing remained but the flowers , the water goblets , the ash trays , and the coffee cups , " will head the general coordinating committee to which the chairmen of all the subcommittees will report . The other members of Mrs. Renshaw 's committee are Mrs. Prentiss Wall , Mrs. Everett Duncan , Mrs. Walter Bernheim , Mrs. ClarksonSatterlee , Mrs. Francis McCosker , Miss Genevieve Debevoise , Miss Rita Wyeth , and Mrs. Sidney Weinberg , with Mrs. Brandon Bourne as secretary . " There was some general discussion of procedure ; particularlyclose attention to the work of the Labor Division about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there remained less than three weeks in which to complete final arrangements before the opening date of the fund drive ; and the luncheon broke up precisely on the stroke of two fifteen , with most of the women making their way at once to the entrance hall , where maids stood waiting with their furs and coats . Marguerite Barnard had indicated to a few women that she wanted a moment more with them , and presently Jessie found herself in the small ground-floor sitting-room with Mrs. Barnard , Serena Lowden , Althea Crowe , and Dorothy Renshaw . " I thought , " said Mrs. Barnard , " that we had better just take this up while we have the chance . . . it is not really importantbut we ought to be quite clear about it . " Her kindly wellbredface appeared peculiarly cold as it became plain that she was about to mention something distasteful ; she bit her lips which were as usual without artificial color . " I presume , " she said , her voice pitched low , " that some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The four women looking at Marguerite Barnard now glanced variously at one another , then carefully at nobody in particular . It was evident at once that each of them knew the person whose name Mrs. Barnard had mentioned , but it remained for Althea Crowe , who had no reticence about anything , and no diffidence in the presence of anyone , to volley out , " Know her ? Enough to know she 's a crook and a phony ! " Jessie could scarcely restrain a smile , though this was cer/tainly no time to show amusement . She knew Mrs. Emily Sanders , itfor the same dreary reason that she had occasion to knowby sight or by name many other women , some more , some less questionable in reputation . On Serena Lowden 's sensitive face there was an unconscious expression of something like disgust or disdain ; and Dorothy Renshaw 's visible reaction was one of vigorous dislike . Mrs. Barnard hesitated . Having asked for information , she had it now from the expressions on four silent faces , but she appeared reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dorothy Renshaw helped her by saying , " After the snarl in the books at the Allied Aid , I think we all --  " " Well , " said Marguerite Barnard rather hurriedly , " it is that sort of thing that I  --  where I have had reason in the past for feeling as I do . Of course I am sure that Mrs. Sanders is a very hard-working person , " she added . " For one reason particularly , " said Althea Crowe in a tough , matter-of-fact tone . " I know her game , Marguerite  --  you 've said enough . " " You see , she is on a newspaper now , " said Mrs. Barnard , not looking at Serena Lowden whose expression made it clear to Jessie , even had she not known it before , that Mrs. Emily Sanders could quite as probably have been on the The Press ; and that she had not got her present job without trying first , by familiar tactics through Alexander Lowden , to land herself on his newspaper , a manouvre that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been giving it out , " Mrs. Barnard continued , " that she is to be my executive assistant in this Fund campaign . She has been  --  " Mrs. Barnard coughed and bit her lips  --  " going about to the offices of many people whom we all know , or calling them up on the telephone and  --  you understand . I am simply trying to say that we can not have this  --  it is unfair to the women who are really going to do the work . " " That 's the most charitable light you can put on it , " said Althea Crowe , sniffing . " The woman is a fraud . She has a mania for horning in on anything that has a lot of big names and publicityattached to it . You ca n't put three prominent names together anywhere without finding hers stuck on behind with horse-glue . " Jessie Bourne and Dorothy Renshaw both burst into a helplesslaugh . Serena Lowden 's lips twitched and even Mrs. Barnard smiled faintly . " Althea 's summed it up , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other women who do some part of the same thing . Sweet charity  --  give me a leg up . " " No , it would really be quite unimportant , " said Mrs. Barnard , " except that this woman is so noisy and so ubiquitous and so insistent upon getting at people . And it seems that her position on the newspaper makes it more annoying because  --  I can not imaginewhy  --  she is said to have some influence there . If we repudiateher as we should , she may try to induce her editors not to support the Fund vigorously  --  and of course we need all the newspaper cooperation that we can get . " " I will ask Alexander to speak to John Carhart about it , " said Serena Lowden quietly , though she had her misgivings as to whether the publisher of a rival newspaper would see much reason for tolerating such a suggestion from her husband . Still , she guessed quite accurately at Mr. Carhart 's personal situation in the matter , and in those circumstances he would surely find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to support the Fund . " I think that will be a great help , " said Mrs. Barnard . " And for the rest  --  we all understand that Mrs. Sanders has no connection with our committee . That will become clear to the public as time goes on . " They all moved out to the front hall , offering lifts to one another . The butler hailed a cab into which Althea Crowe heaved herself , with barks and grunts loud enough to drown out the shrieking of the ancient springs . She bellowed at Dorothy Renshawand Jessie that there was plenty of room ; they were all going down Madison Avenue anyway , so come along . The cab drove off and Serena Lowden raised her eyebrows in surprise that her motor was not there . Then she remembered that she had told her man to stop and pick up an order at the Vendome ; she was going straight out to the country . " Probably they did not have it ready , " she said . " He 's been delayed . " She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her car . " That 's a nice child , that girl of Rosa 's , " said Marguerite Barnard thoughtfully . " I am very fond of her , " agreed Serena . " Of course I see her through Horace 's eyes , just as we used to see Rosa when we first knew her . " " It goes to prove that there can be exceptions to everything , " EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE 105p105said Mrs. Barnard . " I remember the first time Horace Howland asked me if he might bring Rosa Landau here to tea  --  I told him I thought he had lost his mind . I was young and brittle then , and I drew the lines so tightly ! " She laughed softly . " I told him certainly not , I remember  --  but he would not take that for an answer . " " It was that quiet determination of his that overrode all sorts of things for her . " " I asked him if she had been divorced . Really , Serena , I am ashamed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so importantat the time . And when he said no , she was a widow -- - " " Ah , she was a darling , " said Serena . " I suppose none of us would ever have grown so fond of her if she had not been gentle and full of charm . But she was very different from us , of course . " " Of course . The difference was like a lovely warm glow  --  not just a blazing fire . What a pity that there are not more people like her . " Both women glanced through the window , but Serena Lowden'scar had not yet appeared . She took a cigarette from her case and lighted it , saying , " You were a wonderful friend to Rosa , Daisy . " " Oh , I loved her dearly . And I think her friendship gave me far more than anything I ever did for her . Once I knew her well I was even more ready than Horace to fight battles for her . Of course there were battles . " " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had such character  --  a combination of honesty and the most sensitive taste . She used to say to me , Daisy , I am a nobody and I will never pretend to be anything else . ' Of course that was just why I did not want her treated like a nobody . " The two women sat silent for a moment , Serena Lowden thinking of the extraordinary lengths to which Marguerite Barnardhad gone to lead Rosa Landau and her daughter past the small , powerful group of men and women who had always stood at the innermost social bars . She said , thinking aloud , " She really never did pretend . I am sure that was why we all had such wonderful times at her house . To tell you the truth , Daisy , none of us has ever created such an atmosphere of gaiety and warmth . " " I know . But she was unique , Serena . You might find other places where it could have happened  --  London , possibly , or Paris . But not here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower East Side all following in Rosa 's foot- steps . But she had a right to people 's respect . She earned it . " They were both thinking of the serious qualities of Rosa Landau which were not evident when they thought of her as the spirited and fascinating hostess of the most interesting house that they had ever known . Rosa giving a party , where the guests were , for those times , a daring blend of elements who might otherwise never have found themselves under the same roof , was a very different woman from the one whose quiet and often anonymous good deeds had gradually brought her the regard of the most substantial and responsible people . Such loyalty , once established , was not lightly put aside . " In fact , " said Marguerite Barnard , pursuing the thought , " she did more for us than we ever did for her . Horace 's judgment about her was sound . " " You do not forget , of course  --  you might almost say  --  he brought her up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy Barnard . " She may have been a lily in a mud puddle , but Horace had the good fortune to find it . " " And she never married him , " mused Serena Lowden . " Of course not . She had too much taste . " They rose , for they saw the motor drawing up before the house . " I wish the child had not married Brandon Bourne , " murmured Marguerite Barnard , as they walked out to the hall . Serena Lowden gave her friend , in parting , a poignant look which suggested that marriage in general held a great deal to be regretted . STANDING still in the middle of the fitting-room , Jessie reflected that she had often found this the place and the time for fantastic thoughts . She had never asked herself exactly why . She had a sense of stimulation in being shut up here with the skilful , painstaking , patient men and women who made fine clothes ; a sense not only of appreciation for their craftsmanship , but of intimate understanding of how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inborn art of cutting , of the instinct to pin and shape and rip and mark and pin again ; thisp107common understanding of the use of hands , this standard that no detail might be less than perfection ; all this Jessie felt to be ingrainedin herself no less than in the Italian fitter , the LithuanianJewishtailor , the now middle-aged sewing-girls upstairs at the machines and finishing-tables . And though the beautiful things that they made by hand were seeming anachronisms in a world of department-store racks crammed full of slick , smart , massproduction , the whole gigantic industry would be quite helpless but for this tiny . fertile seed . " Do n't you think a little more there below the shoulder , Mr. Max ? " Jessie was watching the fitting in the broad triple mirrors , but at the same time she was thinking of many other things too . " You see ? " She bent her arm forward and the greyhairedtailor nodded quickly . Snip  --  click  --  and the basted sleeve was out of the jacket entirely . There , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's setting that sleeve over again . He turns it an eighth of an inch in the armhole and the whole jacket hangs differently . The door opened and a model from the negligee salon swept in . She took three long steps one way , two the other , whirled round and disappeared . Jessie had not even noticed the color of the gown that the girl was showing ; she had no interest in negligees at the moment and she did not want her attention distracted . Mr. Max was working now upon the soft , standing collar of the jacket , which was one of the most difficult things to drape perfectly . He ripped the seam at the edge , snipped at the muslin interlining , and pinned to it once more the fine dark grey cloth which now flowed into place in a smooth sweep . " You are wonderful , " said Jessie . " Really you are . " He smiled and shrugged , but whether his silence was of habit or because he had pins in his mouth , he found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after asking for one more fitting two weeks hence , he left the room carrying the pinned costume over his arm . Jessie stood in her chemise , waiting for Miss Flora , who always fitted her dresses . Miss Elsie , her vendeuse , bustled in , carrying some blouses , and apologizing for Flora 's lateness . " You have no idea what it 's like around here now , Mrs. Bourne , " she said . She had the drawn look , tense about the eyes and the corners of the mouth , which was the pathetic mark of her trade ; it came of never being free of the agony of aching feet , and never feeling really rested . " I have an idea , " said Jessie , shaking her head . " I saw themp108all out there in the big room when I came in . The place looks like a railroad station . " " It 's worse , " said Miss Elsie . " Honestly , I 'm glad if a lot of people have been striking it rich , Mrs. Bourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long --  " Jessie was examining the blouses . She moved them one by one along the rack where Miss Elsie had put them , shaking her head as she inspected the materials , the sewing , and finally the price tags . " Sixty-nine fifty for that , " she murmured . " Look . " She held up the shoddy synthetic stuff to the light , fingering with distaste the coarse machine stitching and the careless seams inside . The two women exchanged a look of comic disgust . Miss Elsie was as hard-boiled , as sleekly black-dressed , as carefully dyed and waved of hair , as heavily corseted as all the rest of her hard-working kind . But she had known and served Jessie Bourne for a great many years and she had known from the first better than to try to sell her anything . Jessie was a woman who chose what she wanted . Her taste was crisp and sure ; she had no concern whatever for " what they are wearing , " only for what she liked . She bought fewer clothes than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now that real silks and other fine materials were almost unobtainable , she bought very little at all . " This one really takes the cake , " she said , pushing the last blouse aside . " Well , you know , " murmured Miss Elsie . " Ready-to-wear  --  " " Ready for somebody else , " said Jessie . " I 'll see how long Flora will be , " said Miss Elsie , scooping the blouses together . " I 'm so sorry to keep you waiting , Mrs. Bourne . " She left the room . Jessie went and stood at the window , looking down over the lovely familiar view of the Plaza , the Girl with the Bathtowelfacing the Sherman Statue , and the long , smiling panorama of the Park , with sparkling towers rimmed along its sides like candles round a birthday cake . " How sweet it is , " she thought . " My God , I do love it so . " If she stood there letting her memory play , it would findnooks and corners , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation of childhood for a party , the agonies of girlhood when the mysterious alchemy of " popularity " might suddenly curdle and throw a helpless young thinginto the torments of the damned . . . " getting stuck . . . beinga flop . . . a flat tire , " that was what they had called it in herp109day , the cruel shining sure ones to whom that never happened . Dancing-school , there in the Plaza across the way , and later the big , crucifying parties to which many a girl would hysterically plead not to have to go . . . tea-dancing downstairs in the Grill , which years ago had vanished in the strange way that hotel places do . . . Mademoiselle or Miss Somebody or Fraulein . . . nobodyelse always has a chaperone , Mother ! . . . And presently because nothing could have surprised her more , there cut across her mind , wandering in this tiny and least important fragment of long ago , the echo of the words : " I ought to know . I am one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's real people , the plain ones , the ones without Names . The ones who work here , in these rooms behind me . . . not the ones I played with down there . She stood very still , trying now to hold impossibly within the single fragile shell of her mind the bewildering parts of her own self which , one against the next , were fantastically unrelated . It is n't possible , she thought , puckering her brows and shading her eyes with her hand as if the afternoon sun , moving over the westward edge of the Park , could be blinding her . How can it be , how can I know where I belong , or to whom ? But she did know . The instinct now to recognize , to admit at last what she knew , was overpowering . And now it has a name , she breathed , not quite aloud . A name . A face . A voice . I know where there is earth beneath my feet , flesh if I reach out my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long breath and , closing her lips tightly , heard the wisest , calmest counsel which her own good sense , forged in the fires of misery , could give her . To wait , to be still , to learn , to be wise , even old , as she could pitifully not have been in those years of the heartbreaking parties and the life to which they had led . Miss Flora was fitting the last of the three dresses which Jessie was having made . It was a dinner dress of dark bottlegreenLyon velvet , with a crushed drapery of brilliant scarlet silk jersey crossed over the breasts . A twist of the scarlet jersey was drawn down through slashes in the skirt , and the decolletage could be covered when one chose with a long-sleeved jacket of the green velvet . It was a striking , dramatic dress , and both the vendeuse and the fitter were sincere in their enthusiasm about it . Jessie knew very well that compliments were their stock in trade ; but they had too much intelligence , and they knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a long time since Jessie herself had felt the sharpp110thrill of feminine excitement which a really wonderful dress can give . It had been , in fact , years , now that she thought of it . She stood very still , critically examining the dress and her own reflection in the mirrors . She had a good figure , good shoulders , a high , girlish breast , neat lean ribs narrowing to a small waist , hips perhaps a little too flat . Above all she carried herself with the light , stretched , flatbackedposture , her head high and her arms quiet , which her mother had drilled into her with remorseless severity , in the years when other girls of her age were obsessed with acquiring the debutante slouch . " Is that tight enough , Mrs. Bourne ? " Miss Flora had been fitting the sleeve of the jacket . She knew that Jessie wore her sleeves long and very tight through the forearm . Perhaps the habit was a bit of vanity , for it flattered Jessie 's dainty wrists . Jessie flexed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , Miss Flora . Especially here . " She laughed and patted the velvet which had been fitted like skin itself across her flat diaphragm . " My word , " said Miss Elsie admiringly . " Imagine being able to wear that and eat dinner in it ! " They all laughed ; but it struck Jessie then , with an inner thud which diminished her pleasure , that her first faint thrill at seeing herself in the dress had been a vibration of the primeval instinct that she wanted to please a man by wearing it . Now she realized that the gown would not be finished for a fortnight at least  --  a week , possibly two weeks , from next Monday . For a moment she felt disappointed in the most infantile way ; she could have cried . And then she caught herself , suddenly serious and almost appalled . She was no flirt , she did not mean ever to flirt , this had been the most trifling of notions . . . No , said some other part of her reason , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand to her eyes , as if to clear her brain for saner and more prudent thoughts ; and just then she heard someone come into the room and she opened her eyes . It was her old friend Bertha Meyer , who had run the dressmaking part , and many other parts , of this establishment ever since Jessie could remember , and before . The connections went back , indeed , farther than Jessie herselfcould know , for Bertha Meyer had known Rosa Landau and her family long before Jessie was born . " Hello , Bertha dear ! " said Jessie . Miss Meyer , who was one of the most impassive women in New York , made a comfortable sound which could mean a greeting , and stood looking at the green dress with a calm surgical eye.  | " It 's lovely , is n't it ? " asked Jessie . One would almost think that she had designed the dress and wished Miss Meyer to approve of it . The neat grey head wagged slowly and Miss Meyer said , " It 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , " said Jessie . " Well , I gave you some , did n't I ? " " I 'm trying to thank you . But I may have been a little fresh about it . " " I 'm used to it . " Bertha Meyer sat down in the corner while Flora was extricating Jessie from the pinned dress , and sighed wearily . " My God , " she said , " if I 'd ever known the business would come to this . " " What ? The zoo outside there ? " Bertha Meyer nodded again . " You never saw anything like it . They 'll buy everything in sight . Anything . The carpets , maybe . They want to walk out with it . Pay cash off a wad to choke a horse and take it home off the model 's back . " The fittings were finished . Elsie and Flora gathered up their things and left the room . Jessie put her hair in order , fixed her face , and began to put on her clothes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , her expression a combination of exasperation and panic . " I 'm not on the floor , " said Bertha Meyer . " But --  " Miss Meyer only shook her head . The woman went away . Bertha Meyer looked past Jessie 's shoulder into the mirrors and said , " You look a lot like your mother , Jessie . " " Really ? " Jessie smiled warmly . " Different . But you remind me of her . When we were girls . " " It 's so queer , " said Jessie . " When I think of the things you know that I wish I knew . . . " " Nothing so special . " She shrugged . " We all lived in the same block . Did the same things . Had the same kind of jobs . Only Rosie was different . " " That was Auntie Esther , " said Jessie slowly . " Sure . " " Bertha , " asked Jessie , slowly fastening the snaps which held her yellow gilet in place . " Bertha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My God . Thirty  --  let 's see  --  two  --  three  --  oh , about thirty-five years . We were down at Thirty-Seventh Street then . Your Auntie Esther 's place was just around the corner . Do you remember it ? " Jessie nodded slowly , staring into the mirror , seeing not only the soft grey elegance around her here , and the quiet ageing woman in the French armchair , but many other things of this same special world , things of long ago . " The Place " was what Auntie Esther and her sisters called it . It was one of the very best small dressmaking establishments in the city , occupying the second floor of a business building in the block west of Fifth Avenue . " Madame Esther , Modes " was painted in flowing gilded script across the plate glass front windows . The Place was a citadel , a world , a matriarchy , a vivid intensity of sounds , smells , colors , heat ; a core of such magic that a little girl of six thought it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Auntie Esther was the queen . Just as she had always ruled her family with calm and justice and an inflexible but kindly will , so she ran The Place and the forty-odd women who worked in it . Auntie Esther had carried the responsibilities of a man and a breadwinner since her early girlhood , but she was the most feminineof women in appearance and in her ways . There she stood , handsome , tall , firmly corseted , elegantly dressed , wielding with her heavy brown hand the ponderous cutter 's shears that were the foundation of her reputation . Her cutting-table was an artist 's easel , though the little girl watching round-eyed as the shears closed on some piece of rich velvet or brocade could not understand why a spectator might gasp at Madame 's daring . A child , waiting eagerly for permission to pick up a snippet of shining lame or pussycat velvet for her dolls , would not know that Auntie Esther was risking a great deal of money invested in magnificent French materials , should she ever make a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a length . But Madame Esther did not make mistakes . " Oh , " the child would cry , dancing up and down upon arrivingat The Place , while somebody took off her coat and bonnet , " I love it here ! " She was allowed to trot about wherever she liked . In the " front room " there were small tables loaded with books of fashion-plates from which the customers selected their models , though Madame Esther never failed to improvise her original ideas upon them . Jessie could spend hours poring over the pictures . If the little girl popped into a fitting-room while a fitting was going on , everybody stopped work to make a fuss over her , for many of the customers were well-to-do Jewish wives andp113mothers who adored children , and especially the child of Rosie whom some of them had known since Orchard Street . They all held an intense personal pride in her . " Na ! Goldele ! " The kindly , well-fed faces would beam , the puffed and ratted heads would wag , the big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the women bent down to hug the child . Little Jessie would sometimes be lifted up and set upon a stool or a chair in the corner , and often she was asked to " sing a song , " while the fitting went on . Cheerful and shrill , the child 's voice piped : " H-A-double R-I-G-A-N Spells ' Harrigan ' ! " Then there was Auntie Esther 's cutting-room , with the glaring drop-light hanging above the cutting-table . And then beyondthat the most exciting place of all , the big , steamy , smelly , crowded workroom where the " girls " sat at long tables , their dark heads bent over their work in a continual shrill babble of Yiddish , Italian , and broken English . Jessie could not imagine another place where there could be so much to see , to hear , to watch , to smell , to ask questions about . Over by the big dirty wired windows were the sewing machines , where dark-skinned , round-shouldered , intent women kept the treadles flying so fast that you could scarcely see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flat , fine seams flowed out under the women 's hands . Up and down the length of the room sat the hand-workers at the finishing-tables , making before the eyes of the fascinated child the most wonderful things . One girl would be working in bugles , embroidering them upon the frailest chiffon , peering through her thick eyeglasses into the box where the glittering little tubes of glass were kept , picking them up one by one on the point of her needle . Another would be pinking lining , which Jessie thought the prettiest of sights . Another would be covering tiny muslin buttons with smooth grey satin , making ready to sew dozens of them down the front of a handsome afternoon dress . Others would be boning collars , setting hems , making tiny fine silk button-loops , l ( inding , whipping , beading , working with lace and ruching and velvet piping and soutache braid and other things whose names the little girl did not know . The smell of The Place was one to remain in the nostrils for a lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hot ; the heavy smell of steam rose from the pressing-boards over in one corner beside the gas rings , where the flatirons stood ready all day long . The smell was human too ; the smell of too many not very clean women crowded into too little space . There was too the dry strange smell of fabrics , not so literally an odor as a texture for the nostrils , just as velvet or satin or broadcloth had each its own texture for the fingers . The gas smelled , often so strongly as to make some girl ill . There was always the smell of coffee in a tall grey agate pot standing on one of the gas rings . And finally there was the pungent smell of food , for the girls brought their lunch to The Place , and laid aside their work to eat there at the long littered tables . The child was goggle-eyed over the things that they ate , and though Auntie Esther always took her round the corner to Fifth Avenue to lunch at Maillard 's , Jessie hoped not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ate the strangest , greasiest , spiciest food that it was possible to imagine , reeking with garlic , and the fascinated child loved to watch them doing it . Each girl brought her sandwiches in a greasy brown-paper bag . The Italian girls ate great hunks of crusty bread with salami or cheese or pickled olives and peppers . The Jewish girls ate rye bread or enormous crusty semmels , split and filled with dark red meat which , Jessie learned , was called pastrami . Or they ate bologna or corned beef or sometimes slices of pungent bright pink fish which they called lox , a far cry from the delicate Nova Scotia salmon which would one day be the piece de resistance of Jessie 's buffet table . And having eaten with their fingers these reeking , greasy foods , of which , Jessie would think in later years , they could never have washed away the traces , they would go back to work upon the most fragile silks and chiffons , the palest colors , the most expensive trimmings . And nothing ever seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out , and the business flourished , and Madame Esther 's reputation , built partly upon her superb work , partly upon her rich personality , endured years past the day when Rosa Landau finally induced her to close The Place and retire . To this day , when she moved in certain concentric circles which embraced business , Broadway , the arts , the oldtime life of downtown which spread its tentacles from Tammany Hall to Tin Pan Alley , Jessie could meet kindly , grey-haired women , heavily jewelled and basking in the luxury of a husband 's or a child 's success , who would wag their headsp115and sigh , " You know ? Your Auntie Esther made my weddingdress ! " " Bertha , " she said , turning from the mirrors , crisp , chic , poised , a portrait of this day and this moment if one did not see in her face the old memories and old resemblances which Bertha Meyer saw there . " Bertha , do you ever feel as if we were ghosts ? Spooks ? From a shadow world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here now ? " Her voice was low and muffled , her eyes distrait . Bertha Meyer pulled her weary body from the chair and said , " My God , I have n't got the time . " Jessie saw a pin sticking upright in the nap of the dovecoloredcarpet . She bent down slowly and picked it up , thinking of the little girl who used to run about with a magnet , collecting spilled pins from the floor of The Place and putting them away in their boxes . SARAH met her at the front door as she came in , saying " Miss Iris is here , Mum . I put her in the library . " " Miss Iris ? " said Jessie , handing Sarah her furs . " I was not expecting her . " " I know , Mum . She telephoned and whin I said ye 'd be in about five , she said she was comin ' . She said it was important . " Jessie sighed , " Bring the tea there , please , Sarah . " She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , reading The New Yorker . The room was blue with smoke and the ashtraybeside Iris was full already . " Hi , " she drawled . She dropped the magazine on the floor , and did not rise or change her position . Jessie could have barked at her . There was something about this child which rasped Jessie 's nerves to needles . Her long , hatless , blonde hair , hanging below her shoulders , which Iris combed in public wherever she might be ; her insolent , empty , staring face ; her clawed fingernails painted blackish blood-color ; her abominable manners ; her incessant , dirty smoking . The abrupt " Hi " which was a crude , if cheerful commonplace from anybody else became an impudence from Iris . Jessie felt so irritated that she could scarcely answer ; she gave vent to her twitching annoyanceby seizing the brass shovel and hearth-brush from the fireplace and sweeping up the cigarette ashes which Iris had piggishlydropped on the rug , too lazy to aim at the ashtray . If Iris had burned the rug , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had difficulty restraining the desire to slap her . Such things had happened in the past . Sarah came in , her face a caricature of Jessie 's thoughts . She placed the tilt-top table before Jessie 's chair , took away the ashtrayfrom beside Iris as if it were something putrid , put a clean one there , and went to get the tea-tray . It was not , thought Jessie , watching the black-and-white back leave the room , that Sarah was a snob ; it was that Iris was a mess . Sarah could take people as she found them , but her mind slammed the door on degeneracy . If Iris was not the complete degeneration of her heredity , Jessie knew nothing . " How will you have your tea ? " she asked . " Sugar  --  lemon  --  ? " Iris looked pained . " I --  " " I did n't order drinks , " said Jessie tartly . " I 'm tired and I want my tea . " ( Must you , her mind asked itself , be such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt ? You know perfectly well that you are only acting like this because the girl annoys you . ) She held out a cup of tea to Iris , coldly waiting for her to heave herself off the couch and come across the room to get it . Iris finally did so , snippy and sullen . Jessie managed to master her temper and give Iris a reasonably human smile . " Sit down here , " she said , indicating a small bench before the fire , " and tell me what 's up . " " Oh , " said Iris , " I do n't know what to do . It 's Mother again with her song and dance about coming out and all the rest of that bunk . " Iris scowled . " I 'm not going to do it ! " " Then  --  " said Jessie . " Oh , you ca n't tell Mother off like that . You know . She 's like a drawing of Mary Petty 's there . " Iris motioned at the magazine that she had flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , she just simply does n't understand ' . " Iris 's words ended in a mocking falsetto , with her blonde eyebrows lifted in sarcastic arches . Jessie was silent . She knew that Millicent 's putting Iris through the paces of an elaborate and anachronistic debut wouldp117be an ill-savored farce , but she could scarcely mention to Iris the real reason why Millicent Fielding was immovable in her determination to do the thing . So it became the extreme of cynicaldebasement for Iris to say , " That 's Mother 's idea of the way to bottle up the stink about Father and Isabel . " " You call her Isabel ? " asked Jessie faintly . Iris shrugged . " Who does n't ? " Jessie thought for a time . Iris sat smoking , humped upon the bench , her long legs wound about each other , her feet and ankles coarsened by the flat , spread , shapeless black sandals which Jessie thought so ugly . Evidently it did not make Iris in the least uncomfortable that Jessie should stare at her , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring of Iris against standards which the girl herself would not understand . Jessie was deliberating whether or not it might be constructive in the end to give Iris a good stiff scare right now . At last she said , " Iris , what makes you think that your mother is only worrying about your father and  --  and  --  Mrs. Allen ? " Iris blew a long stream of smoke and asked truculently , " What do you mean ? " Jessie picked up a biscuit from the tray and slowly bit into it . Her eyes were lowered . " I have done my best , " she said , " though you may as well know it was against my judgment , to keep any knowledge of your doings and whereabouts from your mother . But you are far too shrewd , you know too much about what goes on , to think that nobody else would ever tell her . " " There 's not much to tell ! " said Iris defiantly . " After all , if Mother 's going to go on living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there too . She probably does know I go out once in a while  --  so what ? If she ever let on that she knew , and started to raise hell about it , I 'd only do it anyway . Then where would she be ? " Jessie realized with an uncharacteristic sense of shock that Iris was undoubtedly right . And in that realization she saw too , the full possibilities of Millicent Fielding 's real knowledge and real fears , which had driven her to the despair in which Jessie had seen her yesterday . But Millicent had managed then to conceal from her the truth upon which Jessie had chanced merely as a device just now . Millicent Fielding was not in any way , poor soul , as ingenuous as she seemed . Rather she wore her seeming ignoranceof the life led by her daughter and her husband as her only protection from utter ruin.  | This threw a very different light on everything , as Jessie thought about it now . She decided to be as bold as possible , bolder than anything Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ought to stop being seen with that man Spanier . " She watched the child closely , and as she had expected , the flat defiance which came down over the curiously blank face did not come quickly enough to hide a flicker of panic in the blue eyes . So it was even worse than Jessie had thought . She was appalled . Iris said exactly what Jessie had anticipated : " Leave my friends out of this . " " I was not speaking about your friends ' , " said Jessie . " I spoke about a man who has as horrible a reputation as any gangster . A man older than your father . I spoke about a man "  --  Jessie leaned forward and forced Iris to look into her eyes  --  " whom I ought not to mention for any reason to a girl of your age . Much less for this reason . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " said Iris . Her lids were narrowed , her eyes glittering blue  --  like Brandon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home , " said Jessie . " I did not ask you to come here this afternoon . " She got up and walked to the bell across the room and rang for Sarah to take away the tea . Then she went to her desk and began looking through the letters that had come in the afternoon mail . She opened one or two , ignoring Iris who had not risen from her place . Sarah went away , Jessie made a telephone call , and still Iris did not move . At last , as Jessie had known that she would , Iris said , " Jessie . " " Yes ? " Jessie looked up from the letter that she was reading and waited for Iris to go on . The girl made time for herself by taking as long as possible to light a cigarette . Quite aside from her deep disinclination to be involved in this mess which was proving to be a very cancer of spreading and interlocking cells , Jessie was really resentful that Iris should be here in this way now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dress slowly before dinner tonight . It was almost six o'clock and Mark Dwyer would be here in two hours or less . The thought of him , as Jessie sat at the desk looking at Iris Fielding , was like a great fresh breeze . Jessie might have to go without her rest , but she knew too that the hours she would spend with Mark Dwyer would be more refreshing and more calming than any interval of sleep . Sop119she felt more patient and kindly toward Iris as she said , " I know it 's all very unpleasant for you , Iris . But what I said is true . I assure you that Spanier is not a man with whom one 's name can be connected without the worst possible implications  --  and the most possible talk . So --  " " So you think Mother is in a feaz about that ? " " Certainly . And I will tell you that if you were my daughter , I would be in a greater feaz , as you call it , than your mother . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably does not . I 'll say that for the sheltered life anyway , " she added , forgetting for the moment to whom she was talking . " There 's nothing the matter with Jack Spanier , " said Iris , with stubborn resentment . " If you had the same attitude about some entirely different man with Jack Spanier 's background I 'd think you were grand , " said Jessie . " I want you to get it perfectly clear what my objectionsabout him are . They have nothing to do with his  --  his origin . They are because he is a cruel , crooked scoundrel , and extremely dangerous besides . " " Oh , Jessie . You sound like a soap opera . " " Iris , it was you who came here to see me . There are things I would far rather be doing than talking to you right now . " Jessie rose from the desk and came back to her chair opposite Iris and sat down . " But , " she said , " since you came here on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother , to ask me to persuade her not to make you come out this winter , I can only tell you that your mother in this instance is absolutely right . Even though I think coming out as much hooey as you do . You had better grab this chance while you can , because at the rate you 've been going , it 's the last one you will have . " " What chance ? " " The chance to extricate yourself from the slime into which Jack Spanier is dragging you and get back among the people where you belong  --  if they will have you . " " Suppose I do n't want to be extricated , as you put it ? " Iris 's pale face was very sullen . " Then you are a bigger fool than you 've proved yourself already , which is prodigious , " said Jessie . " I suppose , " she added as a seeming afterthought , very casual , " Spanier has told you you have talent and he will put you in a play he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " Jessie thought it would be too obvious to tell Iris the truth , a truth so brutal that it would only make Iris protest the more vehemently . Jessie said , " Instead of believing me , or for that matter , Jack Spanier either , just make a few quietly coldblooded inquiries on your own . You certainly know where to make them , I 'm sorry to say . Just ask about  --  oh  --  " Jessie looked away vaguely as if she were making an effort to remember . Then she said , " Oh , about Myra Cornhill . And Winnie Blake among others . Leda Thorne . " " Leda Thorne ? Did n't she  --  ? " Iris 's eyes were opened wide now ; they were stretched with doubt and fear . " She killed herself while she was living with Jack Spanier , " said Jessie , making her voice as hard and cold as possible . Iris sat silent and for a moment Jessie wondered if she had been wise . But she could think of no subtler way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hardness and extreme youth . She was barely eighteen ; and though she bore the superficialmarks of the life that she had been leading , its habits and mannerisms peppered all through her speech and her bearing , she was helplessly ignorant underneath . She would react only to drastic facts . Presently she said something which Jessie thought shrewd , for her . She said , " If the things you 've been saying about Jack are true , why would n't Father have flagged me ? He sees me around with Jack . " " Probably , " replied Jessie slowly , " because your father belongs to that select group who think that nothing disgusting or scandalous could ever spill out of the sewer where it runs and actually touch them . A sort of honi soit ' arrangement in terms of people . Or else he may think of you as just a little girl ' who is so young and pure that no man could possibly have wicked designs on her , to put it as ridiculously as possible . " " Lots of girls I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They --  " " Oh , yes , " said Jessie . " I take that for granted . You would not have gone so far as you have if it had n't been for the excitement of competition . I suppose it would be too much to expect that you had ever wondered just where all this was going to land you ? " " Why  --  I --  " " I told you , Iris , that for one play that Jack Spanier actually produces , there will be a dozen that he only talks about . Those are the sucker-bait . Sometimes for the money that he gets from one kind of fool  --  and sometimes for what he gets out of your kind of fool . You may notice , though , that when he actually puts a play into rehearsal the cast is made up of strictly professionals.  |p121Do  you know of any beginner or amateur who ever got a part through him ?  --  or a foothold in the theatre ? " Iris shook her head reluctantly . " Well , " said Jessie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to be an actress  --  which I doubt  --  you may as well get ready for a few years of hard labor , school , and heartbreak . But that is n't what you really want , Iris . You go home and think it over and you 'll see what I mean . " Sarah appeared in the doorway and said , " Mrs. Lee on the telephone , Mum . " Jessie rose and went over to the desk , saying , " Run along , now , Iris , I 'm going to be late if we talk any more . " In her bath , lying still in the sweet-smelling softened water , Jessie closed her eyes , folding her hands upon her breast and as consciously as possible relaxing , so that her legs and feet turned very light , floating in the water . She wanted to blot Iris and her dreadful little mess from mind , for while it was not difficult to shunt aside the disagreeable facts that had been forced upon her attention , it was quite another thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris 's cold , strange , blueeyedpersonality . For Iris resembled her uncle Brandon Bourne not only with disturbing physical similarity , but in many of the facets of her character . Brandon was not a fool like Iris , since he was first of all spared the ignominy of being a female fool , but he was capable of the same unbelievably wilful mistakes , impelled by the same improbable combination of naivete and hardness . The quiet of the warm bathroom was punctured by a long , hideous shriek from the river outside , and Jessie laughed suddenly , thinking how she would hate such a noise if it were not part of something she loved . It was only the whistle of a tugboat , one of the fleet which moved flats of freight cars through the East River ; and it must whistle in this shattering way because its tug , hopelessly unwieldy in the treacherous currents , would be deadly in a possible collision . At this time of day , with dusk closing in and night ahead , the unearthly noise was part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky and the river , which came only in certain sorts of clear weather , and lasted only for a fleeting portion of an hour , before the real dark of night should settle , and the curtains be drawn to shut it out . Jessie thought now , with a small wrench of regret , how many years it had been that she had struggled to make the most of her home and her life with Brandon , within the frame of this loveliest hour of the day . She looked up , from the relaxing depth of the tub , at the beautiful centre window of her bedroom which she could see through the open door , where that rare , vivid dark blue of the early evening sky was framed by the thick rosy curtains ; and she remembered , without at all intending to , a small but infinitely familiar disappointment of long ago , which now had no power to disturb her . But in those early years her desire to have Brandon come home from his office at this hour of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , be most attractive to him , had been repeatedly and doggedly frustrated . That was the hour when he was the most sure to be off about his own concerns , roughly shutting her out of his pursuits and his friendships with the irritable explanation that she did not fit . Now she was delighted not to have to be bored by the people whom Brandon found congenial , but in the early stages of a marriage entered into from the real but unsound motive of intense romantic love , she had suffered piteously . There had been times when his rebuffs and his abrupt dismissals of her as a factor in his plans had stunned her , leaving her almost insensible with wretchedness , only to find that clearer thinking about it later crushed her with humiliation . She put her fingertips over her eyes , slowly stroking her lids and her temples , and though she wanted it not to happen , she could somehow not prevent herself from remembering an evening much like this one , when Brandon had said he would be at home early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to talk to him ; of asking whether he found her an intolerable burden , whether his scowling sullenness , his bursts of savage temper , and his dark secretiveness over a long stretch of months past meant that he was sick of her and wanted to get rid of her . " Not at all , " he had answered coldly , with a condescending touch of surprise . " But  --  " she had tried so long , so uselessly , to talk to him , and talk had proved always to be the worst stupidity  --  " but --  " " But what ? " he had snapped . She was standing in the doorwaybetween her room and his , wishing with all her soul that she could find the cold sense to go into her own room and shut and even lock the door . Instead , she stood there watching him put into a shirt the black pearl studs that she had given him for Christmas , and to her shame , stooping to the disgusting emotion of feeling sorry for herself . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most undignified , most unlovelyof creatures ; in these circumstances the last thing that she wanted of Brandon was sympathy for her intolerably ignominious situation . She understood also that she was too far gone in selfabasementto evoke anything but irritation from him . " You  --  you make me feel so unwanted , " she murmured , with stiff lips . " Well , " he said abruptly , " you are . " " Then I had better leave you , " she said . " That is what you want , is n't it ? " " No . " He was concentrating upon his necktie . " But you do n't make sense , Brandon . In the same breath you say you do n't want me , but you do n't want me to leave you . How am I supposed to know ? " " Oh ,  --  ! " With the foulest of oaths he flung his silver handmirroracross the room and heard it crash on the marble sill of the bathroom floor . Jessie turned weakly aside into her own room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inner trembling and plunged in fear . She moved away when she felt her legs steady enough , and with no plan or purpose went out to the hallway and stood near the top of the stairs . She should not have been there ; her own judgment , overcome by paralysis , but still remotely aware , was straining to tell her to go to her own room and shut herself up there . Yet she stood , doing the one thing that would invite another savage blow , and knowing that this would come . He came out of his room , dressed , and hurrying towards the stairs . " What the hell do you want ? " he asked , on the top step . " Oh , " she said , in a shaking voice which made her wish that she could choke to death then and there , " I suppose  --  I was just  --  saying good night . " He looked at her with pure hatred . And suddenly , even though she was too shattered to realize now what she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real hatred was not for her at all , but for himself . At his best he would hate a man who could act in this way , who could so horribly assault the feelings of a woman who loved him , who could so ruthlessly jostle her out of his life , leaving her alone night after night , forcing her to be tragic or pathetic or abject when her real capacity was for charm and gaiety and animation . " God damn it ! " he snarled , brushing past her , " do n't you ever have anything to do yourself ? "  | He was down the stairs and into his topcoat before she realized it ; she stood there bracing herself for the wild slam of the front door which invariably proclaimed his comings and goings . Ah , she thought now , opening her eyes and moving her head against the tub to notice that the blue hour was past and that Josephine was drawing the curtains in her bedroom , ah , it is the hideous unimportance , the tininess , the triviality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have the hateful capacity to return and to offend one 's dignity years and decades later . There is only one reason why these isolated memories of rudeness , cruelty , and selfishness matter at all , and that is the lasting damage wrought by them cumulatively upon the people who perpetrate and who endure them . Perhaps the victims can recover , I am not sure ; but the doers surely never . And yet for those who have been through these debasements in any way , there will be scars always . Some part of one 's capacity to share life with one 's fellow man will remain twisted , crippled , a thing of which to be ashamed , a deformity that one can never completely hide . And now , she reflected , why should she , anticipating a happierevening than she had known in years , lie here in this bath and find these images and episodes materializing , when she would have believed that she had forgotten them ? Why  --  she exclaimed aloud , flipping one foot in the water and watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I allowing this to take place ? Ah , well  --  can I suppose that the substance of the years will dissolve like the salt in this bath , leaving a fresh , empty vessel ready for new experience , ready as if it did not still contain the unriddable residue of all the past ? She moved her head slowly from side to side , a tenuous denial , and again closed her eyes . WHEN Mark Dwyer entered the drawing-room Jessie was seated near the fire in her favorite chair , an old bergere of fruitwoodupholstered in faded apricot-colored silk . She put out her hand and he took it and kissed it lightly ; not the back of her hand , the most formal of salutations , but her fingers , near the tips . EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE 125p125He sat down in the chair opposite her , and she saw in his face the same appreciation , mingled with something like puzzled disbelief , that she had seen when he looked at her and her house last night . He was wearing a dinner jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , " said Jessie . " I thought that was n't allowed . " He shrugged , smiling . " Let 's confine the admiration to you . You look edible  --  at the least . " She was wearing a gown which she had always particularly liked , of pale blue crepe embroidered with fantasies in charming , unexpected forms and colors ; butterflies and small silly beetles and even a lady-bird perched on the draped cowl collar . She loved this sort of gown , which one wore only at dinner in one 's own house , because she loved the mood and the occasion for which it was designed . Sarah gave them cocktails and small piping hot mushrooms with some sort of spicy surprise hidden inside . Mark was especiallyquiet ; for a time he said nothing at all , and the relaxed atmosphere was more welcome to Jessie than any conversation that she could possibly imagine . But presently he said , " How do you make your hair go into that nice shape ? It looks so organ-ized . " " It 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her grey eyes looked up at him and went mischievous at the corners . " Just like your own , only you had n't noticed . Grey too . " " I had n't noticed that either . " He winked . If she had ever seen eyes more minutely observant than these brown ones of Mark Dwyer 's , she did not know when . He was leaning back in his chair , his gaze moving along the cove of the ceiling where the pale pine panelling ended in a dentellated moulding . There was evidently far more in his mind than he would ever put into speech , and Jessie knew too that whatever he did say would always be cleanly economical of words . It must be a combination of nature , long habit at his work , and the recent years when terseness , if not silence , had often been the measure between life and death . " What did you do all day ? " he asked . " Just about what you would expect an idle woman to do , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems out of character . " " Well , of course , it is . But how queer for you to say so . You do n't know me at all . " " No . Not at all . But I know a situation when I see one . " 126 EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE " Situation ? " He let Sarah pour another cocktail for him . When she had gone he said , " Not that you do n't fit the framework of your life charmingly . You do . Only it 's a framework . Two dimensions  --  " By a gesture he indicated the absence of a third . " Are n't you bored ? " " Most horribly . " She stared at the coals glowing quietly in the grate . " Not in the sense of being jaded , you understand . Not with wanting excitement or pleasure . " She made a small rueful face . " But with being useless . " " That 's going too far . " " No it 's not . I am useless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being useful to somebody or something else . But it does n't matter what you call it  --  I do n't like it . " She sighed . " But why did you ever stop working ? " Jessie raised her head and let her eyes move slowly about the broad , beautiful room , and then rest upon the great bay window , as if by consulting her friend the river outside , she could find just the right answer . She did not speak at once . Dwyer also swept the room with his eyes , both a scrutiny and a tribute to what she had made of it . " You wanted to  --  to --  " She nodded . " It seemed so important at the time , " she murmured , quietly enough so that Dwyer leaned forward to catch her words . He caught too the submerged meaning of what she had said , but he contrived not to let her notice . " And , " she said , in a more matter-of-fact tone , " since The World was sold just about that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person at work of itself , it seemed wrong just then to keep a job from somebody who really had to have it . " She smiled . " But there was something you wanted much more anyway . " They both laughed a little , because the meaninglessness of a laugh was an agreeable device just now , and Sarah announced dinner . Mark held Jessie 's chair and then took his place , with an expression of thoughtful curiosity as he looked about the diningroom . It was as much the exquisite order in which the place was kept as its beauty which seemed unreal to him . Heavy gleaming silver , old Derby porcelain , Irish crystal , lace , soft candlelight , the velvety patina of fine mahogany superbly polished  --  this made no sense . " Were you here all during the war ? " he asked , as they began to eat the soup.  |p127She  nodded . " I wanted frightfully to go over and do a job  --  it was the same feeling that I had had here for years anyway , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could work and be necessary . Of course the war simply intensified that . " " But  --  ? " " But when I looked to see what I might do in London or anywhere abroad , there was nothing that I could do well enough to justify my cluttering up the place . And they sold me a bill of goods about how important I was to a lot of war things here  --  oh , well , it does n't matter . Someone had to do it . " " Bourne ? " asked Mark . He put a dozen meanings into the quiet monosyllable . Jessie shrugged . " Nothing , " she said . He let the whole burden of her answer go unnoticed as he had a few minutes before , and presently she asked , " Where are you going back to when you leave ? " " Central Europe . Points East . Pretty much the old stand . Perhaps I 'll hardly know from week to week . Prague , mostly . There 's not much that I can say about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ate some celery and some more soup . Then he looked up and said , " But I have to try , that 's all I know . " His face was extremely serious . " Somebody must , " said Jessie . " God knows . " " Well , you see . There is n't anything I can say about it . The minute you start talking , it begins to sound like all the other highsoundingstuff that turned sour and stunk up our so-called victory . " They helped themselves to a truite au bleu , curved round on itself in the classic manner , accompanied by a beautiful Hollandaise . " I hope I never talk about it , " he continued , eating . " Any words you can find for thinking you might help the thing only make you sound like a braying ass . At the worst , it 's like some chaps I know who never were alive until the war , they had never had a chance to know there was a world , much less the kind of one they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to the stock-brokering business or whatever it was . They do n't want to stop being heroes . My God , for all I know , I look like that . " " Do n't be silly . " " Well , that 's what George Stillman thinks . He keeps jawing at me that the war is over , and then every day he prints an editorialreminding the folks that it 's not . So you see  --  everybody else is crazy too . "  |p128Sarah  brought in a casserole whose fragrance caused Mark Dwyer to stare , his mouth open . " I do n't believe it , " he said , watching Jessie help herself . She laughed . " I hope you like it . " " Like it ! " The casserole held partridges cooked in sauerkraut . The dish was rich and delicate with sour cream , and presently there followed small potato dumplings , brown-crusted . " The fantastic thing is , " said Mark , " that I 've just come from the part of the world where all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever existed . " " Do n't they even have sauerkraut ? " asked Jessie . The commonest , the lowliest form of food , she thought . He shook his head . " Nor anything else that grows , except potatoes . Oh , it will get better . I 'm not given to breast-beating anyway . If you 're going to get wrought up about it , do n't begin with their bellies . Other things matter much more . " The wine was a Burgundy that Mark did not know , a Clos de la Roche of 1929 , grown by a certain Armand Rousseau . It was heavy and full , with a big bouquet , wonderful with the highly flavored birds and their garniture . Jessie smiled wryly when he said so . " I know , " she said . " You just told me that it 's useless to think this way , but I still feel utterly miserable in some part of me even when I am enjoying my dinner as much as you are . " " My dear little fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality . It does n't matter what you do eat and what those others do n't  --  so long as you know that they are there , and what 's happening to them , and what you are going to do about it . I mean  --  " he gestured impatiently as if at his own clumsiness . " I 'm not talking about you  --  as such , " he said . " I understand . " He took a second helping , raising his eyebrows at his own greediness , and said after Sarah had left the room , " Do you mean to tell me that that chap lives here and does n't enjoy it ? My God , between you and that cook --  ! " Jessie laughed . " He never knows what he 's eating . And I 'm no mean cook myself , by the way . " He shook his head , looking at her , and his expression changed suddenly from raillery to entire seriousness . " Why , " he asked , " in the name of God did you do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted quietly . " Yes . " She started with surprise ; she had not expected top129hear that at all . " She was beheaded in the Pankrac Prison , " said Mark , his voice flat . " Oh  --  Mark ! " Her exclamation was almost a wail . " Oh  --  I  --  forgive me . " He shook his head . " No , I do n't mind . You might not understand . It was not really a marriage . I mean , they were friends of mine , all her people . I was trying to help them through a bad thing and we thought  --  oh , I 'll tell you some other time . It 's a long story . " Jessie was puzzled , but there was nothing that she could say now when she saw that he did not want to talk about it . When they went back to the drawing-room for their coffee , they both paused as they had last night to enjoy the dramatic beauty of the view . The moon was not yet high , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shade smaller on the wane than yesterday . It was a fresh and delicious autumn night , the kind of weather , Jessie said , when it is pleasant to have windows open and a small fire too . " But , " she sighed , as she motioned to Sarah to put the coffee on a table near her in the bay window where she had sat down , " there you are . The same thing , I can not go on about everything as if I did n't even know it ! Imagine  --  burning coal on a night when it 's warm enough to have a window open ! " " Well , " said Mark , " I suppose if somebody is going to say it , it makes more sense for you to do so than me . It 's second nature for me to think those things , and a bore to harp on them . . , but it 's an achievement for you . " " Sugar ? " asked Jessie . He shook his head . He was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosa Landau , taken perhaps twenty years ago . It was a picture in the grand manner , in evening dress , the broad beautiful breast and shoulders bare , the face a mask of dignity and serenity which even in this artificialmedium , did not conceal the warmth and deep humanity of the great wide eyes . " She was much more beautiful than you , " said Mark slowly , coming to sit near Jessie and take his coffee . " Of course . And oh , Mark , so much wiser ! " There was a silence . " Is it as bad as all that ? " he asked . She could interpret the question in any way she chose . She wanted to smile , or laugh aloud , or make some bantering reply.  | Instead she was astonished to feel the sting of tears in her eyes , and she turned her head , swallowing , to look through the window and let the moment pass in silence . This was the first time in her life that she had ever known a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no words at all than the utmost that any other person had ever managed to say . Only Helen Lee , of all the people she knew , had become a part of her inner life in this same way . It was almost devastating to come to this knowledge about a man who , as she had said to herself yesterdayand was silently saying again now , was a stranger . A stranger  --  no stranger at all , ever . " You know , " he said , holding out his cup for more coffee , " there is something I 'd like to ask you . " Jessie almost blurted , " Why bother ?  --  you 'd know anyway , " because that would have been so accurate a reflection of her thoughts . But looking at him , she was not so sure , and her moment of unreality faded away . Then , just as disturbingly , her throat contracted in the sharp grip of anxiety , almost like an instant of faintness , by which the nerves anticipate something distressing . She was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would lay open the whole quagmire of her wretched relationship with her husband , that she started with amazement as he said , " Will you tell me what you were doing on The World twenty years ago ? You certainly did n't have to earn your living . " She burst into peals of laughter , as much from relief as from amusement , for the trend of her thoughts a moment ago had been in a very disquieting direction . Her instinct was right ; she would not know Mark Dwyer much longer before he would enter upon the gloomy forbidden ground upon which she had managed to keep the gates locked . She answered him , " That was my mother 's doing . She was quite fantastic , you know . She had , as I just said , a great deal more sense than I , but she did things very differently . " Jessie swept a circle in the air with her arm , indicating the full and dramatic sweep of Rosa Landau 's approach to life . " She was the warmest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I feel like a cold , prickly thing  --  like a seaanemone  --  compared to her . I wish I were like her , but  --  " she sighed . " But all that warmth and sweetness did not keep her from riding down on something when she was serious about it . She had quite a few perfectly amazing obsessions and one of them was that nobody had a right to exist who could not earnp131his own living . She had a good deal of money , you know --  " " That was what I could n't understand . " " She had earned a lot of it herself , but my father left her the rest . So it was quite difficult to bring me up to the idea that I would have to go out and get to work . She tried , terribly hard , but you ca n't fool a youngster about a thing like that . And then , among her other fascinating qualities , she was inconsistent . She meant every word that she said , but you know --  " " When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never minded after I was old enough to appreciate her . She was marvellous . She would give me the most frightful scoldings and punishments when I made a mess of my finances , and I always did because I was extravagant . And that made her furious . But then I would come home from school for the Christmas holidays and find my closet full of new dresses from Tappe and Kurzman 's  --  all young girls ' clothes used to come from them , you know . And so of course Mother 's uproars did n't teach me much . " " Damned confusing , if you ask me , " said Mark . He was listening with close attention , watching Jessie 's face as she spoke . " Oh  --  in a way . But also , you see , she used to say that I was supposed to understand her without becoming confused , I must learn to understand that she would never bother to be consistent just for its own sake . She was always quoting the thing about the hobgoblin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was  --  let me think  --  eighteen . And Mother decided that the way to teach me about money was to put me on an allowance . But of course she was afraid to make the allowance commensuratewith the money that she had spent for me up to then , because it would have looked like millions to me and I would have behaved like a drunken sailor with it . So she made the allowance too small , and of course I went ahead and made the most frightful mess anyway . Really , it was bad . You know  --  big bills that I could n't pay , and that sort of thing . Of course Mother found out and she was beside herself . She had a terribletemper , but she had really never lost it with me that I could remember . She lost it then , though . Unforgettably , I assure you . " " What did she do ? " " Now that I look back on it , " said Jessie slowly , " it occurs to me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the result was that she became completely dramatic and put on the mostp132magnificent scene  --  I 'm sure that if Uncle Dan had seen it he would have had somebody write a play around it and tease her into going back to the theatre . The climax was Mother standing at the top of the stairs pointing her hand down at the front door and telling me to get out . I had disgraced her and could go and shift for myself  --  or a speech to that effect , anyway . " " I think she was dead wrong , " said Mark . His face was stern . " No she was n't ! " said Jessie quickly . " Her methods with me were drastic , and I do n't care what your modern child behavioristswould say about them , either . I loved her then , and I love her memory now , in a way that nobody could even begin to imagine . I tell you , I know nobody was ever loved the way I loved her  --  and I never resented anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was intense and suffused ; her color was high , her eyes wet . Mark , looking at her , crushed down a sudden overpowering instinct to walk over and take her in his arms . But he kept his face impassive , except for the profound expression of his eyes . Jessie was avoiding them from the knowledge that they would hold if she looked into them more understanding and tenderness than she could bear , having been conditioned for so long to doing with little or none . She stayed silent until she could trust her voice to sound steady and clear again , and then she said , " So that was why I went to work . I went down to see Emmett Connor at The World and told him I had to have a job and he told Clyde Pritchard to give me one . Of course I realized soon after that Emmett was such a good friend of Mother 's that he would have invented some job if there had n't really been one . But at the time all he did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making damned sure I earned my sixteen dollars a week . Then Clyde started me out running copy and being a kind of female office-boy ; I remember he was very crabby about it and said nobody had ever heard of a girl in such a job . But I had the most wonderful time I ever had in all my life , those three years , " she said wistfully . " You got along all right . " " Oh , yes . They began giving me something to do , little by little , as soon as they saw that I really wanted to work and was n't just doing a stunt . Finally I fetched up in the dramatic department , I was a kind of third-string assistant to Rex Campion . " " I was almost never in the office then , " said Mark , as if to note the fact regretfully , twenty years late.  | " I realize it  --  now , " Jessie laughed . " I ca n't say I noticed it then . " " And what did your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she saw that I was serious about the job of course she said , come home , all is forgiven , or something to that effect . At first I was pretty independent and I refused , but after a time I got sick of living in a hole with three other girls , so I went back home to live . Only , Mother had thought that I would give up my job , and I would n't . I remember I offered to pay her for my board . " " Did she accept it ? " " Mother ? Do n't be silly ! Of course she did . But that Christmasshe gave me a beautiful beaver coat , and when I said I could n't take it , I would not wear anything that I had n't bought for myself , she cried and made the most awful fuss . " " So of course you sent the coat back , " Mark chuckled . " Of course  --  not . I wore it for years . " " And so it was only your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist , " said Jessie dryly . " And you were merely female . " Jessie smiled and motioned toward the silver tray with decantersand ice which Sarah had left in a corner of the room . " No thanks , " said Mark . " Not just now . Do you want a drink ? " " Water , please . " When he brought the glass he stood for a moment looking at her , his eyes intent and at the same time puzzled . " What a strange small party you are , " he said . " If anybody had told me a week ago  --  " He shut his lips abruptly . Jessie said nothing . It was so easy to understand his unspokenthoughts that she could complete the cycle of silence by a light sigh . They both smiled and presently he said , " You were very charming last night when you drew all that silly family history out of me . " " It did n't seem silly to me , " said Jessie . " It seemed more real and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " she made a gesture which managed to comprise all of her life with Brandon Bourne and a good deal that had gone before . " But , " said Mark , " I reminded you that your own story is probably twice as fantastic as mine . In fact , I knew then that it is  --  you are not altogether a nonentity , you know . " He looked again at the picture of her mother . " She did n't materialize from the ether , after all . She had a perfectly tangible dossier that anybody knows whose business it is to know things . " " I have a cousin , " said Jessie abruptly , " who is a detective at Headquarters . " " There . You see ? The son of one of your mother 's sis-ters --  " Jessie nodded . " The one who was killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire . Hannah . " " My God , " said Mark . " And you gaped at my story ! But you see what we are , both of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teheran with the President and you  --  " he motioned about the beautiful , serene room , a symbol of Jessie 's whole life and identity . " And we like what we have become , you know  --  it would be the phoniest kind of posing to pretend that we did n't . But we do n't want the sensation of being chopped off from our roots , either . There is nothing else left in this world that has any permanence , my dear . That 's why I 'm going back to Europe , if I have to come to terms with a single reason . " " But  --  " said Jessie , wincing , yet strangely bold , " but what -- - " Her face appeared stricken ; she looked straight at him . He bent down and took her face between his hands and kissed her lips gently ; not with passion but with the utmost tenderness . She sat perfectly still , her hands in her lap ; and if she could ever have thought that this would be his first kiss , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said softly , shaking his head , " You can not tell much in twenty-four hours . " " But it was you , " Jessie reminded him , still bold with a sense of panic , " it was you who said , there 's never any time . " " I was speaking only of pleasure , " he said , and his voice was strained . He turned away and she knew that he did not want her to see his face . " Do you play well ? " he asked , standing near the piano . " Presentably . " " I wish you would . " How strange , she thought , rising . What a queer irrelevancy . And moving across the room she knew that she would not have interrupted the mood and the content of this moment as he had done . But he was feeling for time , and also she realized , as she saw his face when she reached the piano , for peace . " What do you like ? " she asked him . " Haydn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an/swered , " Oh  --  anything ,  --  " but his taste was surprising . Without comment she began to play the G minor Sonata , B &; H number thirty-four . He walked away and stood by the mantel , listening with a calm , critical expression which revealed to her when she looked up that his approach to music was like her own , disciplinedand literate . He turned while she was playing the last movement , and sat down on the couch facing the high bank of windows . Jessie had not felt like playing at first , chiefly because it had seemed such an intrusion upon so fragile a moment , one that she would have wished to guard . But it was satisfying to be able to please him . " You play better than I expected , " he said , when she finished . She rose and crossed the room toward him , smiling . " My mother again , " she said . " It was whaled into me . But I never practise . " He put up his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch . It occurred to her that any other man whom she could imagine would move to take her in his arms now , and with any other man she would have turned to stone . But Mark Dwyer was not going to do that , and she knew it , and understood . He sat looking at her fingers in his as if they had some quite unique quality not to be found in all other fingers ; and because she knew better than to look , as if she were seeking for answers , at his face , she kept her eyes on his hands too . He had so greatly interested her in other ways that only now did she realize the unusual beauty of his hands . They were of fine size and strength , square , smooth , and very strongly muscled , with qualities revealing a warm and sensitive nature . The fingers were not too slender , perfectly straight and untapered , the joints even and flexible . The skin of his right hand as it held hers felt fresh and silky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair on the backs of his hands , though his wrists were very masculine . Jessie looked at some fine , threadlike white scars on the outer edge of his right hand , and said softly , " Barbed wire ? " " Not stupid at all , are you ? " " The only thing , " she said , " that keeps me from asking you questions about the war is that I know you do n't want to talk about it . " " That is probably , " said Mark , " the result of twenty-five years of newspapering . Once a thing is past it 's past . I have a horror of yesterday 's spot news . "  | " But , " said Jessie , " you really can not imagine how I want to know . It was bad enough all those years to sit here praying that such things must be going on , and never knowing whether they were or not . But now to have the chance to know and not to be told seems tantalizing . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , " she added , smiling , " my interest is purely academic . Impersonal . Historical . " " I see , " he said , and then , " Where was Bourne in the war ? " Jessie was startled ; she did not understand exactly why Mark had asked that question , but she answered , " In the Navy . He had quite a lot of rank and he never stopped hoping he would get sea duty , but they kept him doing about what he does any-way . " " Somebody had to , " said Mark with a shrug . He knew little about Brandon Bourne , beyond that he was a member of a firm of wholesale dealers and brokers in paper . " Naturally you would expect them to put a fellow like him in their procurement division . Forty-odd , and knowing his business . It 's quite a wonder that they had the sense , instead of having some former candy salesman buy their paper for them . Was he here all the time ? " Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pearl Harbor . He was ill out there and was sent home and discharged last March . " And from the flat indifference of her voice , which she had not thought quickly enough to hide , Mark Dwyer knew that in the absence of her husband during the war she had learned how profoundly bad her bad marriage was . She must have found in those years alone the first peace that she had ever known , and he could feel now as if she had described it , the dread with which she had anticipated Brandon Bourne 's return , and the strain of the effort that she had made in the past months to adjust herself again to life with him . Even if that life had become attenuated to the degree of sharing little more than the same roof , Mark Dwyer knew that it had become insupportable to her , a thing of progressive torment and appalling hopelessness . Suddenly she realized what she had silently told him , and in mortification that she could so completely have abandoned her own intense reticence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her mouth . Above it her grey eyes were wide and strained with alarm . But Mark Dwyer almost at once looked away , with the instinct of wisdom and tact that had already become to her a gentleness symbolic of qualities for which she had for years been starved . EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE 137p137She drew a breath and said , " But when Brandon came home , he might almost have been away on a business trip somewhere . It had n't been very comfortable , and although he had had a great deal of fun , he had had to work very hard . So his one idea seemed to be to forget it all as quickly as possible and  --  you know . " It seemed too absurd to use a phrase like " get back to normal . " Dwyer nodded , saying nothing . " And because I could not feel as he did , because my war had been a completely different war , because I was still fighting it , he was very irritable . There were always two wars anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fighting your war in our emotions and some fought Brandon 's . You know  --  those peoplescarcely thought of Europe . The Germans were not their enemy  --  only the yellow-bellies . " " The Chicago Tribune 's war , " said Mark coldly . " I know , " said Jessie slowly , " that there was just as much sheer heroism , and far more hell in the Pacific than in Europe . But you feel , I suppose , as you are . " " Unless you are so privileged as to be spared the bother of feeling at all . " " For years , " said Jessie , " Brandon was annoyed and impatientand bored because of the way I felt about Hitler  --  the Nazis , the Austrians , the Czechs , the Jews , the Poles , the whole thing . After the very early part of it he used to get so angry when I had people here who had come from there , who talked about it and who cared and wanted somebody to do something . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There was a silence ; she had said nothing that Mark Dwyer had not already realized . At last she added , " The strange thing is that Brandon is a perfectly good human being if he is actually presented with something concrete that has to be done about a mess . But until it comes to that , he is furious at being asked to think about it . " Mark said , with weary bitterness , " Boys will be boys . " Presently she found her hand again in his , and once more she marvelled at a calm so real and so natural that simply to be quiet in this way , to share this small , almost child-like contact , seemed as much as she needed for the moment to content her ; she knew all this to be derived from him . For this was good and welcome now ; and so too would be other and greater moods with all their accompanying impulses , when he should summon them . -  She looked at him and after a silence she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that happened to you , would seem like considerably more than yesterday 's spot news ' to me . " " I suppose so . It was just chance in the beginning that I had so many reasons for being more deeply involved in it than most Americans . You have to make allowances for that . With my people and all that happened to them --  " " Do you know your relatives over there , Mark ? Had you known them before the war ? " " Of course . I had n't been particularly intimate with them  --  but if you had been over there in the midst of that thing , watchingit happen , year by year , creep up on those people  --  pounce on them  --  if your aunts and cousins and nephews had been torturedand hounded , or were all in the Underground , naturally it would have felt pretty much like your own private war to you too . " " And then your wife . " " That was different . That was part of the fight we all put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already in it , up to the eyes . Her brother was one of my closest friends . He was in their Air Force . He got away in his plane in ' 39 , in March  --  when the swine invaded Prague . It was Nazi policy to make the most savage reprisals against the families of those fliers who had escaped . Most of them were exterminated . Vlasta was his sister and the last survivor of the lot of them , she was a magnificent woman . And we thought we might get her protected on my passport if I married her . " " So that she could get out ? " " Out ! Good God , no ! She was one of the keys of the whole Underground . She would never have left . Well  --  it was too late . They got her anyway . " He sighed , and then shook his head as if somehow to convey that all this talk was not what he wanted , that in some way he disapproved of it . Presently he said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of the whole story , and feel its relation to the past and the future , then it does n't seem so  --  oh , I do n't know a more descriptive word than corny  --  to talk about it . But  --  " he looked up , about the exquisite , untouched , unreal room , through the windows at a riverfront which had never been a prime bombing target , across at the thick-huddled roofs of Queens where the factories had worked in unbelievable , uninterruptedsafety , and then back at Jessie , sitting close to him and listening with her eyes fixed intently on his face . She said noth-  |p139ing  ; but he saw how wholly she was bridging the gap that he could not bridge , how she had indeed lived these years in a physical isolation of safety and ease which had no relation at all to the passion of heart and conviction of mind which would have swept her to any extreme of action had the circumstances been different . He was struck by her quietness ; she sat so still that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully told . Her grey eyes were open wide , the thick lashes framing their glowing intensity instead of veiling their expression as was almost always the case . Mark looked into them , slowly taking her in his arms . Like every other expression of his , like every word that he had spoken , like the deep tones of his voice , the touch of his hands , the calm sad tenderness in his eyes , his kiss too seemed for Jessie something that she had known always . Presently he moved his lips from her mouth to her eyelids , to the clear delicate skin where her hair sprang from her temples , to her throat , her cheek , her mouth again . The pressure of his hands about her was deep , warm , calm ; again that calm which was more wonderful to her in its depth and firmness than any other resource that his warmth could hold . She looked at him with eyes that told him eloquently that this was so ; and an infinitybesides . He turned his head presently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to be a way of retreatingto the habit of solitude which must be woven through every instinct of his nature . Whether it had evolved from choice or from chance , it was there ; and she understood it , because it was the texture of her own inner life too , forced upon her at first , but long since her only shelter . When he spoke , his voice sounded shaken and hoarse ; he only said , " My God , how I need to think . " She smiled , holding her handkerchief near her eyes , and groping inwardly for the quiet which she wanted to show . There was nothing that she could say ; she had never in this way experienced this sensation of needing to be silent , of knowing that silence was the only possible medium for anything that she felt . She knew exactly what Mark Dwyer was going to do , and presently he did it . He rose to his feet , drew her up by her hands , and kissed her again , holding her against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and lightness . Then he let her go , she felt his lips on her eyes and her forehead and the tip of her nose ; she heard him say , " Good night  --  darling " ; shep140heard him stride across the room , and presently she heard the outer door close . She went and stood at the windows over the river , staring out at the moving , glittering , strange live thing which held , she thought , as much knowledge of her inmost self as any extreme intimate with whom she might have lived these thousands of days , thousands of nights . Once more she watched upon its surfacethe motions of incomprehensible forces , the farther side of the queer eddying stream flowing up , the nearer down , the centre a swirl of stubborn , confusing currents . " Ah , " she sighed softly , and she watched the small puffing ferryboat which plied the river from this shore to Welfare Island . As it always must , it moved carefully upstream , off its course , crabwise , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful currents reversing their direction where the little boat reached midstream . She sighed again , turning from the window . IlI ' I ' , , , 4 444WEDNESDAY " WILL you lunch with me today ? " asked Mark when he telephoned . " I should love to , except for certain misgivings . " " What are they ? My intentions ? " Jessie laughed . " No , " she said . " I hope I am quite clear about them . " She tried to make her voice seem teasing , but she thought that probably it sounded only idiotically happy . " Are you ? " asked Mark , and his voice went very low . " I think that women are possibly much bolder than men , " she said . " Especially at my age . " " I think you are a trollop . " " And I think --  " " Stop thinking . What are these reservations of yours about lunch ? " " The first is that you may get tired of me before this week is out and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly capable judge of how much I want of what . " " What a charming , subtle compliment ! " " And if that is as intelligent as the rest of your misgivings , we will skip the lot of them . I will call for you at one . " " But , " she said , for no reason at all except a curious flurry of shyness , which caused her to seek silly excuses for appearing less accessible to him than she really felt , " but I will not be here . " " Where will you be ? " " My goodness , one has things to do , you know . " " Oh . I suppose you are going to John-Frederics with some hen and sit there and cackle over the hats . " " How attractive you make us all . And you have never seen me wearing a hat , you know , many women do n't , " she said , deciding to wear for lunch the most beautiful John-Frederics hat in New York . " Well , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said meekly . " Do n't be a fool . Does n't that Empress of Koh-i-noor in your kitchen do her own marketing ? " " Not if I feel like doing it . "  |p144There  was a silence . Then Mark said , " Well , I 'll go along . " Jessie was amazed . But she only said , " What a way to spend a leave . " " I am not on leave , Mrs. B. I am on special orders issued to myself by myself . But since we appear to be snarled up with a passel of celebrities tonight , why pick this morning to go marketingwhen you wo n't be home for dinner ? " " Because I have people coming for dinner tomorrow . And they like their orders ahead of time , the butcher and everybody . . . " " But you 're dining with me tomorrow ! " " Oh , Mark . What can I do ? I asked these people a week ago  --  or more . Before  --  " she swallowed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " unless you do n't want to . " " I want to be with you , " said Mark . " Alone , preferably . " " I  --  oh ! " she breathed . " So do I. " " Darling . " " Mark , " she murmured . " What ? " " N-n-nothing . . . " " Please , " he said , " ca n't you get rid of them ? " " I would like to , but it would not be wise , " she said quietly . " Very well . But the rest of the week --  " " We could take that up at lunch . " " What about the rest of the week ? " " I had told Helen I would go up to the farm with her and Sam on Friday . " " But you 're not going . " " No , " she said , trying to keep her voice level , and thanking God for Helen Lee , " No , I am not going . " " When do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too silly . Why do n't I just meet you for lunch wherever you say ? " " Where will you be at twelve-thirty ? " asked Mark . " At the greengrocer 's . " Mark repeated the address of the place , said something that sounded like " Sweet  --  " and hung up in the middle of his own words . Josephine came into the room , carrying a small white envelope . Jessie took it and drew out the visiting-card of her sisterin-law , on which Millicent Fielding had written , " Thank you and love . " Every line of the thin , slanting handwriting bespokep145the painful effort of its author to override her stifling shyness and her helpless aversion to the expression of any emotion , ever . Jessie was touched , because she realized that Millicent was more grateful that Iris had gone home and consented abruptly to her mother 's wishes about the debut , the truth of which Millicent would never know , than because of the check which she had received in yesterday 's mail . " Josephine , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Mrs. Bourne , they are . How did you know ? " " I knew . " It was inevitable that Millicent Fielding would choose the stiffest and coldest flowers in the world and the only ones which Jessie really disliked . Josephine knew that . If the flowers had been something gracious and warm and fragrant , Josephine would have brought them here . " You arrange them , or Sarah , " said Jessie . " Put them on the tables in the hall . And I will wear my purple wool dress today . " " And the new red hat ? " asked Josephine , with a gleam of enthusiasm in her eye . " Why  --  yes , " said Jessie , as if she had not thought of it before . She lay back upon her pillows , indulging a short moment of intense laziness . Though she had the best of all reasons for getting up , the prospect of a day full of happiness , she was overcomefor an instant by a sense of deep sadness , which expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From her bed she could see a span of drab grey sky ; this was the first day in more than a week when the sun had not been brilliant . The greyness outside was not that which presages rain , but that which seems simply to set a mood . The sky was giving off a queer glow ; Jessie felt as if it veiled something menacing in its light . When she knew these unusual moments of fleeting dejection she felt a sense of obligation to conquer them at once , and she knew too why she had formed this habit . It was because in her life there was only one real reason for feeling oppressed and that was Brandon and the heavy failure of her relationship with him . In honesty she knew that she blamed him for that failure more than she did herself , but her mind rejected the shabby refuge of blaming him entirely . She too had failed . She seldom thought about him specifically any more , she was far more accustomed to his absence than to his presence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was almost entirely a stranger . Yet she had decided long ago to hold to the outlines of her original responsibility , now that there was nothing else left to which to hold ; that gave Brandon the right to assert himself just enough to keep her sense of distress about him alive , just enough to rouse in her the throbbing bubble of fear which had become inseparablefrom his physical presence . But why all this should suddenly have risen up this morning from the vault where she kept it locked and largely ignored , she did not know . Lying there staring at the drab sky blocked against the windows , she heard a sudden crisp , ripping noise , and she sat up in a jump crying , " Putzl ! You devil ! " She leaned over the side of the bed and looked down towards the foot of it , where she saw the huge black cat calmly sharpeninghis claws on the silk-serge upholstery . " Putzl ! " she cried again , and then she could not help laughing , for the cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was braced in a smooth concave arc , and his powerful claws were delicately , precisely hooked into the fabric while he fixed his green eyes insolently on Jessie , looking at her over his left shoulder . She clapped her hands sharply , which was supposed to be the way to make Putzl desist from crime ; and with the least possible surrender of his dignity , he began reluctantly to unhook his claws from the foot of the bed . Jessie heard voices in the hall outside , and as Josephine opened the door , Anna waddled in behind her , gasping from her rush up the stairs and bellowing , " Putzl ! Du ! I kill it that  --  " She made a dive for the cat . " He must have slipped up here behind Josephine when she brought the card from the flowers , " said Jessie . She hung over the side of the bed , shaking with laughter as Anna , a bulky bundle of outrage , scuttled underneath to catch Putzl who had , of course , escaped there . Anna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the low box spring . Putzl , no fool , leaped up with a mild priaow behind Jessie , and sitting down slowly on the embroidered sheet , began to purr . " Look , " said Jessie to Josephine . " He 'll fix those white gladiolus too . " Putzl had a shred of chewed gladiolus leaf hanging from his neat white bib . " This is his big day , " said Josephine , handing him to Anna who had struggled to her feet , puffing and scarlet . " Shame ! " she scolded , shaking the cat . He ignored her , with a yearning green gaze at Jessie . " Ach , " said Anna , " you excuse him , no ? He would n't done it again . "  |p147She  bobbled away , with Putzl riding resentfully on her shoulder , and Jessie lay back again on her pillows , laughing . Helen Lee was coming by in a few minutes , that was why she had telephoned yesterday when Jessie had been glad of the excuse to get rid of Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vicinity anyway , and as they would scarcely have a chance to speak to one another tonight , with all the goings-on , Helen wanted just to run in , knowing that Jessie would still be in bed . Indeed , Jessie 's sense of time was so acute that she was not surprisednow to hear Helen 's voice outside in the hall , coming up the stairs and speaking to Josephine . It was exactly half past ten , the hour when Helen had said that she would be here . Jessie sat up quickly as the door opened , smiling with delightat the sight of Helen Lee . " Hello , darling , " they said in unison , and Helen bent over to squeeze Jessie in a quick hug . She went then and sat down in the soft chair by the windows , dropping her gloves and purse on the rosy carpet beside her . She had , Jessie thought , the most beautiful face in the world , not because of its exquisite features and lovely warm coloring , but because of her inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her tender mouth , the planes of her forehead and her cheeks ; above all because of her quick , sensitive expressiveness . Whatever lines nature and time and wisdom would mark upon her face , to reflect her character and all that she had done with it , she was one of those few extraordinary people who are without any tinge of sullenness or moodiness ; so she would always be free of the cruel signs which these marks of self-obsession leave upon the face . " I 'm so glad to see you , I could eat you up , " said Jessie , for the Lees had spent the past two weeks at their farm without coming in to town . " How is Sam ? " " Fine . They 're ready to go into rehearsal next week  --  so I suppose we 'll close up the house after this week end . You 're coming , are n't you ? " Jessie shook her head slowly , allowing a smile to come over her face the meaning of which she knew Helen Lee would understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I would like to stay in town . " Helen looked at her , reading Jessie 's unstated reasons as clearly as she would have understood something in one of her own sons . " I am really very curious , " she said . " But not  --  you know . " " You could n't do anything that I would hate , " said Jessie.  | " Do n't worry . I may seem to you to be acting like a schoolgirl , but really I am not . " " I ca n't wait for this evening , " said Helen . " Why ? " asked Jessie , with mock innocence . " What has this evening to do with it ? " They both laughed and Helen Lee said , " Sam knows General Dwyer . He says he 's pure wool . " " Oh , Sam knows everybody , " said Jessie . Sam Lee had been a newspaper man years ago , before he had stumbled upon the career which had given him the completest success that anybody in the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never-failing hits , millions , an eminence so great that he was able by now to state his own terms not only on Broadway but in Hollywood and throughout the world . His surnamewas not Lee at all , but Levy . He was the most honest of Jews , precisely careful to state his real name in Who 's Who and all other compendia of information , so that one wondered why he had ever bothered to drop the syllable from his patronymic . He said he had had nothing to do with it ; it had been done by the manager who produced his first play . By the time Sam had caught up with his sudden burst into fame , the name of Lee had become too valuable to drop . Jessie reflected as she spoke that Sam Lee 's opinion of Mark Dwyer was probably as fine a compliment as she could ask . Sam was a rare man , loyal and sensitive and full of gentle humor , but he could scarcely be otherwise after nearly twenty years of marriage to Helen Penfield . Their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had long ago enveloped Jessie in its warmth and richness . For years their home had been her great refuge from the cold , the bitter , and the barren , in which so much of her own fate seemed to lie . But her intimacy with Helen Lee was still a different thing , quite separate ; the two elements complemented and enhanced each other . Jessie looked at Helen now , admiring her with a delightful sense of fresh appreciation . Her hair was a rich and odd shade of dark blonde , in which the muted light from the windows picked up the subtle variations of color . She had spent much of the summer in the sun , having the smooth , youthful sort of skin which tans to a pale bronze and never becomes leathery or dry . The striking quality of her beauty lay in this rich monotone of color in her skin and her hair , as dramatic in its way as the contrast between white skin and black hair which made otherp149beautiful women spectacular . But without the deep warmth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could have had twice as much physical beauty and still not have possessed the quality that made her so appealing . Jessie said , looking at her , " Darling , I think you 've gained some weight . " " I have , " said Helen , with a nod and a pleased smile which struck Jessie as a little odd , since neither she nor Helen would ordinarily allow her weight to increase by a fraction of a pound . " But  --  why ? " " I wondered if you 'd notice , " said Helen , " but it never occurred to me that if you did , you would n't know the reason . " " But  --  " Jessie 's face began to go blank with a mixture of bewilderment and incredulity . Helen Lee watched it and suddenlythrew back her head and laughed . " No ! " exclaimed Jessie , in a long , hollow breath . " I told you I would ! I 've had it on my mind for a long time . " " But Helen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jessie 's face was set in the expression of dumb astonishment with which she would have reacted to the most grotesque imaginablestatement . Her mouth stood open in a small incredulous " 0 , " and her forehead was ruffled with horizontal puckers . Helen was laughing with a mischievous pleasure which seemed to Jessie even more unbelievable than the fact that her dearest friend , only a year younger than herself , with two sons nearly grown , should be so happy over something which appeared to Jessie 's instincts an incredible , disastrous blunder . " I "  --  she drew a breath and opened her mouth and shut it again . " I can not believe you really mean it  --  meant to do it . " " But of course I did . Darling  --  " Helen 's face turned suddenlyserious , and she rose quickly from her chair and went over and sat on the edge of the bed , putting her hands over Jessie 's and looking into her eyes . " I know why the whole idea seems so appalling to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I 'm not even asking you to make believe that you are pleased for my sake . " " But I am , " Jessie assured her . " Sometimes  --  actually a lot of the time  --  the nearest I come to being happy is by a kind of reflection from you and Sam . Of course I think you 're an idiot to start in on a whole new cycle of responsibility and all that sort of thing . But  --  " she paused , sighing . For some reason Helen was staring at Jessie with an expres- sion of great concern , and there were tears standing unshed in her eyes . She knew Jessie Bourne so well that she had anticipated her feeling precisely . She knew that the news of a friend 's pregnancycould evoke in Jessie a troubled , indeed an abnormal reactionwhich Jessie went to great effort to conceal , since she herself realized that it might appear monstrous to other women . But it was the truth that the statement that a woman was expecting a child fell upon Jessie Bourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of dead space . Jessie did not possess the faculty of sharing vicariously the peculiar intense joy with which women who wanted children were able to say that they were producing them , though she was ordinarily very sensitive to important emotionsfelt by people whom she loved , and above all , to anything that concerned Helen Lee . In this instance , which was of course momentous , she was already beginning to be miserable because she could not feel anything except dull amazement . Once again she faced squarely the knowledge that something within herself was not only atrophied , but dead , stone dead . And this was what Helen Lee knew now ; this was the reason for the intense concern in her lovely face , the tears that glistened in her eyes . She bent over and kissed Jessie on her cheek and said , " I know . Do n't try to pretend with me . But somehow I have an idea you may become far more reconciled to this than you can possibly believe . " " It is not , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't got Philip and Peter already . They 're so wonderful . . . " " That 's just it , " said Helen quietly . " I 've had a feeling for quite a time that in a year or two or three when they 're really men , with lives of their own , the best thing I can do for them is  --  " she made a gesture with her hands almost as if of dismissal . " You know  --  let them go . Humanly , I mean , or emotionally , I do n't like to use such words anyway . But they will never , " she said , with a firmness that was almost stern , and not very characteristic of her , " never find me clinging to their shirttailswith any of that wretched passion wrapped up in the word Mom ' . " " But you still want something to  --  to --  " Helen nodded . " And why not ? Really , darling , I 'm not so old . We think we are , but --  " They both laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing too formidable in the idea that a woman should have a child at the age of thirty-eight . It was far more extraordinary , in the circles in which they moved , that she should have made such a magnificent thing of her nineteen years ofp151marriage to Sam Lee , and her two sons now seventeen and eighteen years old . " What do Sam and the boys think ? " asked Jessie , smiling quizzically . " Oh , they love it . They 're all amused and pleased  --  they remind me of the way they used to act when we promised them a puppy or a kitten . If it 's a girl , she 'll be the worst-spoiled brat in the world . " Jessie sighed . " No , she wo n't , not with you there . No wonder you said you wanted to see me this morning . Good God , " she added , " suppose I 'd had to sit there and guess it suddenly to-night . " " You 'll have your mind on other things tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . I want all your attention when I want it . " She rose and went to a mirror and began to powder her nose . " I 've got to go along and let you get dressed . If I hang around here we 'll get nothing done all day , either of us . How long will Brandon be down there among the horses and asses ? " she asked . Jessie moved her shoulders in a slow shrug , at the same time raising her eyebrows with comical indifference . " Just as well , " said Helen sourly . " I wish he 'd go native altogether and find some drawling paleface and tell you he wants to marry her . " " Of course , " said Jessie , " you are no paleface yourself . " " After twenty years of Sam ? " exclaimed Helen . She was the daughter of a Methodist minister in Hornell , New York , and in the most typical , wide-eyed way had come to the city at the age of seventeen , armed with a four-hundred-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The way had led to a typist 's desk in the office of a magazine publisher where Sam Lee had found her . So Helen considered that her own plain background , merged with the tough and lusty strain of Sam , was the utmost possible extreme from the world of what she called " palefaces , " the arid , dwindling world of Brandon 's family and their kind . She thought , with far greater detachment than Jessie could possess , of the time when Brandon Bourne had been one of many young men who had embarked on their lives with the intention of stepping over the boundaries of patrician sequestrationand of making places for themselves in the fluid , fascinating world of the talented and the famous . They could not have entered this world without making some contribution to it ; since it excluded the dead weights of nonentity and dullness , these young men had offered their only possible contribution , names or money , usually both . Some had also brains and charm , but these were outshone by the native gifts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acted and sang and danced in the theatres and cinemas , composed and performed the music , painted the pictures , wrote and edited the journals and newspapers , and filled in the details of the realm of art and entertainmentand opinion and laughter . It had been pleasant and it had added a type of roundness and balance , known to the great metropolitan cultures of older worlds , for this bridge between talent and privilege to be formed ; naturallya number of marriages had resulted , like that of Jessie Kernan and Brandon Bourne . Jessie herself had never accomplishedanything to make her a figure in the creative world , but she was an initiate , she had grown up in the orbit of Rosa Landau whose house had been a hub of its activities ; and BrandonBourne , without the money to give him importance , had nevertheless possessed sufficient charm and , in those days , flexibilityand grace of mind . Also he had been one of the handsomestmen it could be possible to imagine , indeed he was still spectacular in his good looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident of his own attractiveness to a degree which Jessie had at last come to find intolerable . But as , with years , all men and women tend to crystallize in the patterns and associations most intrinsic to them , so BrandonBourne for a long time had been moving back into his originalsphere , or into its residue , since it was rapidly dissolving ; and it was among the paraphernalia of that society , the country houses and the horses and dogs and the complacent stricture of mind , that he now felt most at ease . For he had never matured ; he was like a fruit which , grafted upon a highly cultivated tree , fails to ripen and to achieve color and juice and substance , but remains small and hard and green and one day drops unnoticed into the orchard grass , while the tree is being harvested of a good normal yield . So while Jessie expressed mere indifference as to when Brandon might return from Virginia , it was Helen Lee with her complete grasp of life and her much broader perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned from the mirror , kissed Jessie again , and said , " Be at Twenty-One early , darling , seven at the latest . " " So you can have plenty of time to form your opinions , "  |p153said  Jessie laughing . " By the way , who did you get for poor Preston ? " " Hall Peters , " said Helen . " Preston will be all right . Poor chap , he does n't notice where he is , or with whom . The rest of us will have a good time . " " We certainly will , " said Jessie . " Really , darling  --  whatever you think , I 'm awfully happy for you . In fact I 've been so carried away that I have n't asked you yet how you feel . " She looked at Helen closely . " Are you all right ? " " Perfectly wonderful , " replied Helen . " After all , I would n't have done this if the doctor had n't said I would breeze through it . Now do n't fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved her hand and left the room . Jessie lay looking after her and thinking , as if she had not done so innumerable times before , what beautiful and embracing warmth and tendernessglowed in Helen Lee , how it illumined Jessie 's own life , as well as the very rare relationships that Helen had wrought with her husband and her sons . Jessie did not envy Helen Lee her family and its intense life , she had few tastes that would have fitted her for anything like it . But , she thought , if one were going to have children and all that went with them , Helen had created something far beyond a work of art . Then Jessie 's memory remindedher sharply that Helen could never have done it if she had not had a man like Sam . And , though it was quite against her will , that same prodded memory rose from the deep , sealed shaft where Jessie had learned to jail it ; and roused by the bitter clang of that little lead plumb it rolled back the curtain which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHE had been lying quite still in the few moments since Helen Lee had left the room , her hands clasped beneath her head , eyes closed , inviting deliberate physical inertia as a counterpoise to the deep spiritual disquiet which her thoughts had stirred . Now she opened her eyes and looked at the clock with a sense of discouragement ; she should probably be up and dressing . But to her surprise it was earlier than she had thought , not yet eleven.  | She was relieved in a remote way ; she had been overcome by a heaviness of mood which made the contemplation of any activity momentarily unbearable . She closed her eyes again , sighing softly ; and the happenings of that year long ago , ten years ago , the very worst year of her life , surged forward in a fresh effort to claim her memory . It had seemed to her ever since , she thought now , that if she allowed herself to recall any single event of that calamitous year , all the other equally dreadful events fell readily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner of a separate grief and all forming together a haunted , grotesque parade . She had come in this way to believe that the fundamental forces of life have irresistible attraction for one another , like certain physicalelements ; and that to set one of them in motion or to be moved by it is also to rouse its affinities which grip , or shape , or drive , or ultimately make or break the capacity of the heart to live and to be part of the life of others . Like the parade of fate which it actually was , that year had opened with the small holiday ceremonies traditional in Brandon'sfamily , following Christmas which for Jessie had always been her mother 's special day . But only later , when she had lived the year through , would Jessie have the retrospective vantageto see it within the great tragic frame of her mother 's death . It was that last Christmas of Rosa Landau 's life , when she had given the beautiful watch to Horace Howland and some of her own most splendid jewels to Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any occasion where she would wear them . " I feel so tired , " she sighed , with lightness and a gentle mingling of surprise and resignation which Jessie knew her mother did not wish her to remark . But Rosa was already very ill , and it was more terrible for her to hint in this way that she realized it , than it would have been to hear the most dramatic announcement of illness that anybody else could have made . Rosa was not expecting a great crowd of people that Christmasday , only her closest friends who all understood how very little resistance she had . And Jessie had promised that she and Brandon would come to Sixty-sixth Street by five o'clock in the afternoon at the latest , to take from Rosa all the effort of the party ; Rosa would stay on her couch in the drawing-room and a few friends at a time would visit with her there , while Jessie and Brandon kept things going in the other rooms and acted as host and hostess at dinner in case Rosa did not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandon the plan , some days before , he scowled and said , " I ca n't do that . " " But , " said Jessie , astonished to the point of using a word that she had long since dropped in talking to Brandon , " but  --  why ? " " I ca n't tie up the whole afternoon and the evening too , " he said . " But it 's Christmas , " said Jessie . " And we 've always been at Mother 's anyway  --  only this year she really needs us . Surely you have n't made some engagement of your own  --  on Christmas ? " " Why not ? " he asked . " Do I have to keep nursery Christmasall my life ? " His voice had the snap to it that she hated and , hating it , feared . " Oh , Brandon . " Jessie had long thought that he could hardly find a new way to hurt her , but this , striking at her through her concern for her mother , was altogether unbelievable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , what is the matter with you ? Sometimes I  --  " she closed her lips and decided to go away out of the room without waiting for his answer . She did not really want an answer anyway ; she had so carefully built up a wall of indifference to his doings , out of the raw instinct for self-preservation , that she knew this to be the poorest of times to start tearing it down . She did leave the room , and on her way upstairs the busy little masons whom she had thought safely and silently employed inside her brain , all began to talk at once and to remind her exactly how many times in the past six months she had been alone with Brandon at home . Not more than four that she could recall . The rest of the time that they were together was either when she had invited friends of his whom he wanted to see , or had accepted invitations from those to whose houses he was willingto go . But more often than not , when she had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up . " Where is Brandon ? " people asked , when she found herself forced to appear without him . They asked , she knew , neither because they really cared nor were really curious , but from habit ; it was habit to expect a man and his wife to appear together unless they had made it extremely plain that they led frankly separate lives . But against this Jessie had battled with all the strength of her pride and all the stubborn force which insisted upon animating her blind optimism that some day , by some miracle , everything would be different and Brandon would have come to the end of all his convolutions and would be ready really to share a married life with her . She knew too that a woman would have had to be the world 's supreme fool not to sense what people felt when she telephoned them at the last moment before dinner to tell them that Brandon could not come . None of her excuses about his having to work or being called to Glens Falls or Canada on business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled , it would not have mitigated the momentary irritation which peoplefelt at having their plans upset , and which left Jessie wretched with fear of being de trop by herself . If she was urged to come anyway without Brandon she suffered from the knowledge that some kindly friend pitied her ; and if she was allowed to withdrawbecause the party could not use an extra woman , she had at times felt as if she could murder Brandon with her own hands , for the depth of humiliation into which he flung her . She had given up trying to plead with him , or to explain how she felt when she said to him , " They wo n't want me without you . " All he ever answered was , " Oh , sure they will , " because  it was the easiest thing to say without thinking . And he did not want to think , and to be taught by his thoughts the agony of doubt , of shyness , of fear , to which he condemned her . The fear of being ridiculous , or pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of feeling unwanted , of being left out . The single clearest mark left upon her by these years was fear , all the other fears , but mostly the fear of Brandon 's temper and the physical and emotional disorder into which it plunged her . And yet  --  and this she knew to be the deepest humiliation of all  --  she stayed with him . She not only stayed , but up to now she had stayed on a basis which laid her open to these repeated mortification , because at brief times in the past she had had snatches of deceptive happiness with him , and she refused to believe that she could never recapture such moods and moments again . She knew that one day she would indeed have to shape some sort of existence for herself that was not socially and humanly dependent upon him , but she was not thinking of that when she went upstairs to telephone her mother that she could not be sure of Brandon for all of the afternoon and evening of Christmas day . " Never mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here and it wo n't matter about Brandon at all . " Except that Horace would far prefer staying in the drawingroomwith Rosa to taking Brandon 's place as host elsewhere.  |p157Actually  it was past ten o'clock on Christmas night when Brandon strode into his mother-in-law 's dining-room , in one of his angriest moods . It was an old habit of his , formed early in his boyhood , to appear before those who had good reason to be annoyed with him , in such an evil temper himself that he froze or flayed or silenced whoever might be near him . Jessie was so bitter that she did not look at him , but Rosa reached up from her place at the head of the table , drew down his scowlingface so that he had to kiss her cheek , and said , " Better late than never . " She motioned to him to draw up a chair between her and Addison Barnard on her left , for Jessie had told Sarah before dinner to leave Brandon 's place off . As he sat down the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been warmly and gaily enjoying the loveliest of sentimental occasionstogether . Now the room turned cold and each person in it could be seen rallying to save something of Rosa 's evening . They began to talk again , but the spark was dead . Brandon was served with the courses which the guests had already finished , but he only snapped a few bits of food from the end of his fork and kept a lighted cigarette in the ashtray close to Rosa , where the smoke drifted straight at her . All her friends knew that tobacco smoke distressed her , and Jessie clenched her fists in her lap , stiff with rage , when she saw her mother 's face become very pale , and saw her breathing nervously with her lips tightly closed . Ordinarily Rosa Landau would have thought nothing of asking Brandon to put out his cigarette . The fact that she did not told Jessie of an anger even deeper than her own ; her mother would sit there until she fainted before she would say a word to Brandon Bourne that would presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at him with the strange , cynical wit which always left him baffled , and even to talk to him in bursts of teasing , but she was too ill to let herself go . Jessie knew that Horace Howland from his place must be watching Rosa with the same anxiety as she . So she caught Howland 's eye and with a flicker of her eyebrow telegraphed him to tell Addison Barnard opposite him to put out Brandon 's cigarette . Barnard did so . Brandon turned round and glared at Mr. Barnard , his blue eyes flashing . " Why did you do that ! " he snapped . His voice rang , metallic . Barnard for the briefest moment met the eye of his wife and then looked calmly at Brandon as if he were not there . Immediately the talk rose , a quickening of gay and well-bred voices each determined to help as smoothly as possible . Jessie was so upset that she could not hear a word that was said to her . She fixed her eyes and her mouth in a glazed smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris and who had painted fifteen years ago the superb portrait of Rosa at her most beautiful , which hung in the drawing-room upstairs . He had known Jessie since her childhood , he was a really old friend , and when he saw that she had no idea what his last remark had been , he leaned a little closer to her and said , " Meme chez nous , nobody could expect you to endure that bete , that savage . Even we concede that marriage has its limits . " Jessie was close to tears and this was no time for a wise old friend to display sympathy . She drank some champagne , sighed , and said , " You are very kind , Philippe . I am really distressed for Mother , that is why I am upset . " " You are upset because you are married to an impossible , foul-mannered ordure and are too serious to have thought of leaving him . " Jessie made a small pleading moue to beg Maurel to drop the subject now . They rose , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been served , and Rosa was very pale and tired . She stood at the foot of the stairs with Jessie , letting all the women go up ahead of her . Then she began , holding the stairrailwith both hands , with Jessie 's arm about her waist , very slowly to climb the stairs . She had never been so visibly ill and feeble as this and Jessie was chilled with grief and despair . Rosa felt her daughter 's arm trembling while it supported her ; she turned her head and whispered , " Darling , you feel much worse than I do . Buck up . " She managed a radiant smile and one of her most mischievous glances , that lovely warm brown light from her wonderful eyes . " I am not going home with him tonight , " said Jessie . " I shall stay here with you . " " Good . " They were near the top of the stairs now and Rosa was too exhausted to say another word . Jessie walked into the drawing-room with her and settled her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her for a moment and said , " We are all leaving in a few minutes , Rosa dear . You must be longing to get to bed . " " Not while I can enjoy being with you . "  |p159Daisy  Barnard smiled and as the other women grouped themselves around Rosa she turned to Jessie and asked if she were staying here with her mother tonight . " She does n't look well at all , " said Mrs. Barnard anxiously . There was a heavy , unpleasant thud downstairs and Jessie knew what it was . When the men came into the room a few minutes later Brandon was not with them . Horace Howland exchanged a glance with Jessie ; as if she had been down there in the front hall beside Howland , she could see Brandon stalking out of the dining-room , taking his hat and overcoat from the hall closet , and slamming the door behind him as he left the house without a word to anybody . And , she thought late that night , after her mother was asleep and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should ever ask him why he behaved so outrageously tonight he would pretend not to know what I was talking about  --  unless he lost his temper with me for mentioning the matter at all . Jessie opened her eyes with a slight start , to find Josephine standing by her bed saying , " Miss Crowe is on the telephone , Mrs. Bourne . " She picked it up to hear the great bass voice booming , " Hello , you lazy slut . Still in bed , I take it ? " " Why not ? " " You 've got me there . Want to lunch Thursday ? " " Love to . " But even as she said that , there flashed through Jessie 's mind a thought of Mark Dwyer , and she knew that she would have put off almost anybody else , to keep the day clear if he should want to be with her . Yet Althea Crowe was different and special . " Have you anything much on your mind ? " Jessie asked her . " Just a rag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? " " The usual . Daniele 's all right ? " " Fine . " Daniele 's was a rough and wonderful Italian restaurant in a rackety midtown cross-street not far from Althea Crowe 's office . For years Jessie had been eating amazing meals there at Althea 's own corner table ; and now she realized again , sharply , how often that strong , brusque companionship had been her soundest recoursefrom just such desolation as that recalled by her present train of thought . It was curious that Althea Crowe had called just now , for she had her place in the pattern of intricate memory which each small happening of this morning seemed determined to force into review . Jessie stirred once more with concern that she really should get up now , and yet it was odd that the clock had turned contrary , there was still plenty of time until eleven-thirty which was the latest that she could rise and be about her dressing in time to meet Mark Dwyer as she had promised . Get up now , she said to herself silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed her eyes again and surrendered to the distressing sensation of unfinished business which her wilful memory appeared insistent upon completing . She went back to that dreadful Christmas day , and to that night when she had felt as if she could never be in the same house with Brandon Bourne again . She had stayed on with her mother in Sixty-sixth Street , drawing consolation from Rosa Landau 's extraordinary faculty for eloquent silence . Any other woman , surely any other mother , would have had something to say about Brandon , or about Jessie 's troubles or her marriage or her future or , at worst , would have probed and questioned her intolerably . Rosa Landau did none of that because it was all unnecessary ; she knew everything , not only about Jessie 's life but about life . She also knew that in the past Brandon Bourne had had the power to keep Jessie in love with him , or to renew Jessie 's capacity to be in love with him , and she doubted that he had lost the last of that power even yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jessie was growing resigned and mature , would be the evolution of the tortured relationshipinto some of the outer forms , all compromises of course , of permanent marriage . Toward the end of Christmas week , Brandon telephoned and spoke to Jessie as if nothing had ever happened to interrupt the ordinary course of their existence . His voice was its quietest , it had none of the hard staccato twang which roused the sick , throbbing fear in her . A different sort of woman might have refused to speak to him , but Jessie saw no use in that . Either she would continue with the effort or she would give it up , and since she still intended to continue there was no use in being sullen . Indeed she was incapable of it . Brandon spoke of luncheon on New Year 's Day with his family as if he were the last man on earth who would violate a holiday tradition or anybody 's sentimental feelings . Even while she was assuring him that she would be at home that morning , and would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bep161like if she should say , " I detest your relatives and after your treatment of my mother I shall certainly do nothing to be polite to yours . " But she only asked , quietly , " I suppose you are full of plans for Monday night ? " That would be New Year 's Eve . " Well , " said Brandon . His voice had the artificial lazy calm which he assumed whenever he wanted to appear particularly conciliatory in the face of something which he knew Jessie would loathe . " Well , " he said , " nothing very special . I thought you would probably want to be with your mother ... " " Naturally , " said Jessie . " How is she , by the way ? " asked Brandon . Jessie stiffened with rage . " She is better , " she said . " But not well at all . " " That 's too bad , " he said . He was still speaking in that voice which was supposed to keep Jessie off her guard . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs and wept , so wretched that she could not distinguish whether from distress about her mother or despair about Brandon . Then they were beginning luncheon on New Year 's Day . Mrs. Bourne sat at the head of the table , Evander Fielding at the foot . Millicent , and Iris , an ugly little girl of eight , and Jessie and Brandon and Cousin Sophie Daingerfield and the Blaine Illingworths and Aunt Louisa Brandon were all in their usual places , where they had sat at these ceremonial occasions ever since Jessie had known the Bourne family , and long before . Millicent looked nervous and uncomfortable . The household was put to the greatest possible strain by the mere formality of placing Mama at the head of the table on these holidays . The rest of the time she conceded the position of hostess and head of the house to her daughter since it mitigated to some degree the ignominy which they both felt because neither Mrs. Bourne nor Evander Fielding could have afforded to maintain this menage alone . By combining households they were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been accustomed for generations . They lived now in a large , dark , depressing apartment , with most of the windows facing a drab vista of dun-colored brick court and the bleak back yards of neighboring brownstone houses like the one from which Mrs. Bourne had had to migrate when she grew too enormously fat and clumsy to climb the stairs any longer . The apartment house had a good address in East Eighty/fourth Street , and was conveniently near to Iris 's fashionable school , but the dark inside rooms told the story of tight-lipped and disgruntled economizing . Jessie had once said to Brandon upon leaving the place , " Do you know , your mother could have the most heavenly apartment on the West Side for much less rent than she pays for that horrible hole . With sunshine and a view of the Park --  " " The West Side ? " Brandon had repeated , as if Jessie had spoken of Canarsie . His nose looked pinched . " Nobody but you would have such an idea . " " You 'd be surprised what beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , " said Jessie . " I 'm not at all surprised at your taste for them , " said Brandon sourly . Jessie had burst into a peal of laughter which appeared to irritate him . " I do n't see what 's so funny in that , " he said . " Oh , " she said . " I was n't thinking of anything you said . I was remembering the house on West Eighty-fourth Street where I was born . My father built a whole row of them , perfect horrors , but the people who lived in them  --  " she broke off and closed her lips tightly . She had thought better of what she was about to say . But Brandon , waiting for the traffic light to change , looked at her and said , " Frights , were n't they ? " " Good God , no , " said Jessie . She decided to say what was on her mind , after all . " On the contrary . I was just thinking how much more fun they all got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment across town on the same street . " Brandon 's family always put such thoughts into her mind , and she pursued more of them that New Year 's Day , sitting betweenEvander Fielding and Cousin Blaine Illingworth and spooning at the white library paste with ominous grey blobs in it which went in this house by the name of Oyster Soup . " Oyster Soup , " Mrs. Bourne had bumbled as they sat down . She spoke in a queer hooting voice which , though low-pitched as every lady 's should be , had a strange resonance that rang authoritativelythrough all other sounds . She also ran her words together as if she could not be troubled to make herself intelligibleby vocal punctuation , like anybody else . She never conversedanyway , but only remarked and pronounced , all her phrases mortared in rigid complacency . " Oyster Soup . We always have oyster soup for holidays . " " Yes indeed , " echoed Cousin Sophie Daingerfield . " I havep163dear Grandmama 's receipt for it written in her household account book . " " It is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose mother had been a sister of Cousin Sophie 's dear Grandmama , " except for a pinch of sage . We always used to have Nora put a pinch of sage in it . " " Impossible , " said Mrs. Bourne . " Nobody ever heard of sage in oyster soup . " Nobody ever heard of any seasoning in your kitchen , thought Jessie . Every word of the talk about the soup had been preciselyrepeated at every holiday dinner since Jessie had known the Bournes . " Mother , may I be excused ? " shrilled Iris suddenly . Millicent Fielding turned to stare at her daughter , angry and shocked . " Certainly not , " she said . " Sit up straight and --  " " You 'll be sorry , " said Iris , wriggling . Millicent turned scarlet and rose from her chair . She escortedIris from the room , leaning down over her pale , skinny child and sibilantly saying that which Jessie could have quoted : " Why did n't you attend to that before Mademoiselle went out ? You naughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed and the large , sad , over-roasted turkey had been placed before Evander Fielding to be carved . He was a messy carver and thoroughly bored by the entire occasion , besides which he had the most vicious visible hangover that Jessie had ever seen . Brandon was not in much better shape . Jessie was always conscious of being careful not to watch Mrs. Bourne eat , because the sight was one of those grotesqueries which become insidiously fascinating . Mrs. Bourne was so fat that her arms were like great swollen elongated balloons , so heavy that she could scarcely move them ; and from the slight indentations that were her wrists depended two tiny , puffy hands with short , twiddling fingers crusted with old-fashioned rings . These hands manipulated a knife and fork , and carried food to the small , hard , greedy mouth with a flipping kind of busy agility that contrasted utterly with all the rest of the woman 's torpid immobility . Mrs. Bourne , in fact , was habituated to two and only two physical actions , eating and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth eating and she never said anything worth saying . " Until we gave up the house , " she said with a resentful glance at the pantry door , " I always had them stay on duty until I went to bed . Absolutely outrageous . " "  --  traitor to his class , " said Cousin Blaine Illingworth . " Ca n't understand it , unless it 's her influence . He was perfectly normal when we were at Groton . " One of the two stony , rawboned maids was pouring wine . Jessie placed her finger over her glass to refuse it . " Oh , come , come , " said Cousin Blaine Illingworth in his special , convivial voice . " You do n't mean that . Evander --  " But Jessie smiled and said quietly , " No thank you . " " You must have some , Jess , " said Van Fielding . " I opened it especially for you and Bran . Forster Traminer . . . you 'll love it . " Jessie tried to turn their attention , but Evander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the thought of the moment has any urgency , and where repetition becomes important of itself . He insisted again that she drink the wine . Everybody was noticing the matter now and Jessie had decided to let the maid pour the wine and to leave it untouched , when Fielding said , suddenly , " Why ? Bran , what 's the matter with her ? " Jessie 's lips closed tightly . She had become frightened , the matter had got out of hand and she was afraid of what Brandon might say . To her vast relief he only murmured , " Skip it , Van . Jess does n't want any , that 's all . " " Well , why not ? " asked Fielding truculently . He was still more drunk than sober and his mood was growing ugly . " Damned rude of her when I was trying to . . . " " Let it ride , Van , " said Brandon . Jessie gave him a look of such appreciation that his cold blue eyes softened in the rarest of kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has won unusual praise . The others at the table were now murmuring along in their customary way , putting the most serious emphasis on the utmost trivialities , but Van Fielding was unable to let go the obsession upon which his wavering attention had fixed itself . " Damned rude of her , " he repeated . " Look here , " he insisted at Brandon , " she makes enough fuss about wine in your house , why does she turn up her nose at mine ? " Jessie 's heart began to beat harder , for she saw Brandon 's eyes going flat and cold and she knew that he had been pushed to the danger line . And experience had taught her that if Brandon were going to seek an object for his temper , her presence almost infallibly provided what he sought . So it was with emotion muchp165keener than ordinary relief that she watched Brandon stare at his brother-in-law and say with the snap in his voice which was , for once , not directed at her , " Jessie does n't drink German wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No ! " retorted Fielding . He turned his bloodshot eyes on Jessie and said , " What 's the idea ? Looks darn fishy to me , drunk lots of Rhine wine in your house , what do you mean anyhow ? Why wo n't you drink my wine ? " His voice had the meaningless , nagging rasp of a spoiled child 's . Jessie gave Brandon another eloquent look . On the rare occasionswhen there was a real current of sympathy running be- ' tween them , she could communicate a great deal to Brandon without speaking at all . He saw now that she wanted to know whether she must answer ; or would he . He flung his napkin on the table with one of the abrupt gestures that she knew , to her sorrow , so well , and turned roughly towards Van Fielding . " If you had any tact , " he said , while the women about the table drew themselves up and clipped their lips together in stiff discomfiture , " you 'd have shut up when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise not to drink any German wine until Hitler and the Nazis are cleaned out of Germany and I do n't blame her one God-damn bit ! " " Brandon ! " boomed Mrs. Bourne . Her voice was thick with rage . " Balderdash ! " said Blaine Illingworth. "  --  might have expected that ! " " After all , you would think --  " Jessie sat with tears scalding her eyeballs , tense lest they spill over and make a sight of her . She had an impulse to bend her head and look down at her plate , but instead she drew herself up and gave Brandon a grave , proud look of intense appreciation . His family were all manifesting various degrees of distaste , disapproval , and icy snobbery . Brandon had flung down in the middle of their holiday table the horrible , inexplicable mortificationaround which they had all had to pick their way in pursuing the main course of their otherwise serene complacency about themselves . It had never become less of a disgrace and an irritant to them that Brandon had made this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this shocking way was nearly intolerable . But when Jessie tried to thank Brandon in the car while they were driving home , he only patted her knee and said , " What else would a fella do ? And  --  look here , Jess . " He was manceuvre- ing to pass a crosstown bus and he kept his eyes on the street ahead of him . " I 'm sorry I was such a bastard on Christmas . " Ah , God , she thought , as she turned over to try to sleep late that night . Ah , God , if I only knew how to keep the best side of him the real one , the one whom I want when I put out my hand , who walks in when he opens a door , who speaks when he says a kind or loyal or honest thing . Why can I not have that instead of never knowing , never being sure ? Will he be there , or the devil incarnate ? Brandon whom I want or the brute whom I hate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . . . please . . . JOSEPHINE appeared again ; Doctor Sheldon was calling on the telephone . Jessie smiled , delighted to hear from him . " Hello , Reath dear ! " she said . " How nice . " " How are you ? " asked the low , gentle voice . This was not her physician 's question , but her old friend 's . " Good  --  I hope ! " she laughed . " What 's new ? " " I wondered if you would like to go to the Philharmonic with me next Thursday ? " " Oh , of course , the first concert . I 'd love to . " Nobody she knew loved music so much as Reath Sheldon , and therefore brought so much to it . " Fine , " he said . " I 'll stop for you early  --  about seven . We 'll dine somewhere . " " Why do n't you let me meet you ? You always work so late , why dash way up here to collect me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? At seven-thirty ? " " Good . Oh , and Reath  --  " Jessie thought now on impulse , wondering why it had not occurred to her before . " Would you like to dine here tomorrow  --  just quietly ? I have a few people coming , you know them all . And the Blocks . Hulda will play for you , I 'm sure . " " Why  --  that might be fine . " Jessie understood perfectly the tentativeness in his voice . He had found almost unbearable thep167company of strangers or casual acquaintances since the death of his wife last year , and yet he was pathetically lonely . Jessie thought how years ago it had been he in a dreadful passage of her life who had borne the weight of concern for her ; now she was aware how much the situation was reversed . " I take it Brandon will be out , " Sheldon was saying . " He 's away , " said Jessie . " For long ? " " I have n't the least idea , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him would be the equivalent of a shrug . He laughed . How good it is , she thought , to have this comfortable ease as the consequence of all that troubled past , without it one would never have any peace at all . " Tomorrow , then , " said the doctor . " Good , I 'll be so glad to see you , Reath . Eight o'clock . " " Black tie ? " " Yes  --  or not , if you 're tied up late at the hospital . " She really must get up now , she saw , as she put the telephone down , and crossing the room to her dressing-room and bath she paused to let her eye caress a small French armchair upholstered with needlepoint so fine that her friends were almost incredulous when they were told that it had been worked by Jessie 's mother . The petit-point centres of the seat and back must surely , they said , have been done in Paris or Vienna , by some poorly-paid artist drudge , working under a glass . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , the poignant sight of her mother in the last year of her life , hurrying to finish this beautiful thing , her thick brown fingers plying the needle with astonishing delicacy . Jessie had always loved to watch the charmingly inconsistent sight , even when it wrung her heart intolerably . She put her hand for a moment on the silky surface of the embroidery , and found herself thinking how strange it was that Reath Sheldon had happened to telephone just at that moment on this particular morning , when other flickerings of chance had put in motion that long , ghostly pageant of tragic memories . She would have said that it had done with her for the moment ; yet the accident of two or three brief encounters had forced the whole sequence into focus , all dovetailed together in a diabolical master design . She sighed , turning away from the chair and thinking vividly of her mother on a January day in 1935 , just after that dreadful poisoned Christmas . Slowly Jessie dropped her bedjacket and nightdress on a stool , about to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one did not find in water elsewhere ;  | how silly I am , she laughed , to feel pleased with the water in this city as if I could take some kind of credit for it ! But it was true , and though she had no idea why , the water in New York really was different ; it tasted brisk and fresh , it left one 's skin soft , it had none of the unpleasant features of water in other great cities , such as the revolting malodor of the water in Philadelphia , or the exasperating alkilinity of water in European cities , which turned one 's skin to sandpaper if one did nothing to prevent it . Why had her mind wandered from ten-year old memories , needlepoint , her mother , Reath Sheldon , to a fantastic irrelevancy like the water in Europe ? Ah yes , she thought , of course ; Paris and all that had happened that year . She shook her head sharply , as if to dismiss the persistent fingers of memory which were pushing and sliding all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping from her bath , briskly drying her skin with a big Turkish towel , she glanced through the dressing-room window where the sky had suddenly and sharply lightened , and she could look down if she craned her neck , at the river beginning to come out of its earlier sulk , and to reveal itself as very busy indeed of a Wednesdaymorning . Two small boats shrieked fussily at one another as they passed . Sitting down at her dressing-table , her mind swung back again to her mother in Paris that year . Reath Sheldon and all the consultants whom he had brought in had come to the end of their resources in Rosa Landau 's case ; there remained , they said , only the greatest research scientist of them all , now working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , a refugee from Hitler and Berlin . Rosa Landau , threading a fresh needle , had looked at Jessie and said , " So this gave me a little idea , darling . " She had that look of grave tenderness in her face which carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miseries , to which she never referred ; and now she only said , " I thought you might like to go to Paris with me . " Jessie jumped up , as quick as her mother to play this part , and said eagerly as if no other purpose than pleasure were involved , " Wonderful ! " Her mother 's life was not hanging in the balance ; she herself was not groping her way through the most desolate wasteland of the heart . She thought briefly of Brandon , who since his Christmas outburst had been treating her with more kindness than for a long time past . It might be a mistake to go away now , but no other consideration was even to be weighed if she could go to Paris with her mother.  | " When do we sail ? " she asked . " I 'm thrilled to my shoes . We have n't been in Europe together for ages . " " I 'm afraid this wo n't be much fun for you , " said Rosa doubtfully . " Fun ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh will be heaven . Do you remember the pink pig ? And Monsieur Dubouchet ? And the hats we had one year , with those rolls of ribbon that you called --  ? " They began to laugh , with the wonderful capacity for mirth in spite of tragedy that was perhaps Rosa Landau 's single most priceless gift to her daughter . They laughed while tliey telephoned Sheldon and said that they would go to see Otto Wasservogel , and while they telephoned the travel agency to book their cabins , and while Rosa told her maid when to start packing , and even when Reath Sheldon called back to say that he was sending one of his best nurses with them . But when Jessie left the house to go home at the end of the day , the laughter dropped from her face like a mask unpinned . She knew that the entire undertaking was hopeless and futile . But to give her mother the illusion of relief , the breath of hope , was more worthwhile than anything else in the whole world . That was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about it before dinner . He had been so uncharacteristically gentle recently , not tender , not affectionate  --  he had never shown the least capacity for that  --  but kindly to a remarkable degree . He must have been moved by the keenest remorse for his behavior on Christmas night . He listened while Jessie told him about the plan to go to Paris , and then he looked at her with an expression which astonished her by reflecting regret and disappointment . " Of course , " he said , " if your mother really needs you --  " Jessie put down her cocktail and stared at Brandon with the utmost surprise . It had not occurred to her that he , for his part , could feel the slightest reluctance for her to go to Europe . He had certainly never shown it before , but had welcomed her annual summer departure with an alacrity which dramatized his chafing at marriage . She said , " I  --  it never occurred to me --  " " Oh , " he said , " if your mother is depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all in his voice and Jessie was completely bewildered . Her forehead ruffled and she leaned forward and asked , " Brandon , do you mean you wish I would not go ? "  |p170He  rose from his chair and put his hands in his pockets and began to pace up and down the room . That compelling physical restlessness could presage almost anything , and had long ago become deeply distressing to Jessie ; it was the symbol to her that he was never there , placed , put , solid , when one wanted or needed him . He took one or two turns up and down the room , jingling some coins in his pocket , and visibly feeling for a way to put into words something that was on his mind . " I was going to tell you anyway , " he said . " I 've been thinking about something and  --  " he stopped speaking to light a cigarette . Jessie sat back in her chair and her eyes followed him in his pacing , up and down , up and down . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , did not notice it ; he was entirely preoccupied with his own concern . " You see , " he said , swinging about abruptly and stopping his pacing to stand by the fire , with his elbow on the mantel , " you see , I 've been thinking a good deal about  --  us . " Jessie kept her lips shut tightly ; she was aware of drawing very slow , hollow breaths behind them . She had no idea what he was about to say ; being Brandon , he could be on the verge of saying anything . He was groping for words and looking at her as if to invite her to help him ; there was nothing for her to do except murmur , " Yes . . . go on . " " Well , " he said . " I got to thinking a good deal about all this after  --  " he hesitated and then blurted like a flustered , defiant schoolboy , " after Christmas . I did n't mean to act like that , Jess  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You 've always been a lot nicer inside than the things you did . I told you  --  I 've forgiven you . I do n't even want you to wear a hair shirt about it . " She felt an unaccustomedcourage and added , suddenly , " I just hope you wo n't act that way any more . " " I hope so too , " he said , widening his strange , oversized eyes and bringing into them a glow which she knew to be reflective of sincerity . She knew too that such a statement from him was almost epochal ; it was very far indeed for him to go . " The thing is , " he said , fumbling his way , and keeping his eyes on the rug at his feet , " I  --  well , this may sound crazy , Jess . " " No it wo n't , " she said quietly . " Please do n't be afraid to say it . " " Well , " he muttered , " it 's not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt like hell about that thing at Christmas . And then when Van --  "  | " Oh , that was nothing , " said Jessie . " You know Van . " " Oh , sure . He 's only a birdbrain anyway . But he made me  --  well , all I can say is , when he squared off at you like that do you know  --  it made me feel some way I almost never feel . " " How ? " asked Jessie , in a whisper . " Married , " said Brandon . " That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . " Except for the knowledge that she must not show any emotion , Jessie might have melted then into tears and into every other evidence of profound relief and joy . She was not religious , but if she had ever prayed in her own subconscious way , it had been to hear Brandon say what he had just said . She only looked at him and managed as calm a smile as she could , in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she saw that that pleased him . There was a long silence , and Jessie almost thought that Brandon had come to the end of what he wanted to say . But a moment later he spoke again . " I wish I had felt like that a lot more than I ever have , " he said , " and a long time ago . " She put out her hand over the arm of her chair and said , " But it is not too late now , Brandon . " He touched her fingers and then moved farther away and asked , " Is n't it ? " She shook her head . " I wanted to find out , " he said . " Wanted to make sure . Because --  " " Why ? " ? " Well  --  if you 're willing to give me the benefit of it  --  then  --  " he made a rather comical face , a combination of awkwardness and earnestness . " Then , well , I guess we 'd better be more married than we were before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears were pulsating as if she had already heard what she knew with amazementhe was about to say  --  " I guess we 'd better have a child . " This was astounding . It was incredible . It was directly contrary to everything for which she had thought she must finally settle . She stared at Brandon and spoke without knowing what she was going to say . " Have you really been thinking about it ? " she asked . He nodded slowly . " I got to wondering what the hell was the matter with me anyway . I began trying to figure out what made me  --  well , you know . Anyway , I began to think that maybe if we had a child I would n't be so  --  I would n't always be in a kind ofp172war with  --  well , with you . With the idea of being married . " " But , " murmured Jessie , " you were always so positive that you did n't want us to have any children . You made me promise finally never to mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself go , " he said , in a strange , spreading , helpless way . " I did n't want to get trapped . I wanted to f eelfree  --  oh , we 've been all over it before . You know it all . " She nodded slowly . She knew it all . " But these last couple of weeks somehow I 've seen it differently . Maybe we ought to fish or cut bait . Maybe it makes no sense for us to stay together unless we  --  well , are tied together . That way . " She looked at him , still too astonished and too full of emotion to trust herself to speak . He moved from the fire to stand directly before her chair , and looking down at her asked , " Will you do it , Jess ? " There was only one answer and she wanted overwhelmingly to give it at once . She wanted Brandon , she had struggled to win in this battle of their marriage , and now she had evidently got her victory . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know that I will , " she said , looking up at him . " You did not need to ask me . But  --  when ? " " Oh , " he exclaimed , with an almost wild note of impatience which frightened her , " oh , right away . The sooner the better . " I wonder why , she thought , sinking back in her chair again . I wonder why . But she did not need to wonder . It was because he did not trust himself . If he could have the result of his new decisiondramatically fast he would feel satisfied . If he must wait , he would begin to lose interest and things would drift backwards to what they had always been . She looked up at him , her feelings so torn and confused that she did not dare to speak at all . She wanted to ask him if he would be good to her . She wanted to ask him if she could depend upon him . She wanted with a sudden rough slash of clarity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child because she did not feel safe in taking his part in the new state of things for granted . At the same time she felt , looking at him , the irresistible force of his physical hold over her , which had been weakened from time to time , but which he still possessed and , more distressingly for her , knew that he possessed . She could not find words to ask him any question reflective of all these anxious and troubled feelings , but she did say , " The only thing I am worrying about is Mother . She --  "  |p173Brandon  's face presented a quick succession of reactions ; he was first annoyed , and Jessie had to suppress the instinct to hate him for that . He had completely forgotten the plan that Jessie should take her mother to Paris . He did his best to conceal his thought , and he spoke slowly and seemingly with careful kindness . " I know , " he said . " I know that makes it all pretty hard . But Jess  --  " he sighed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessness in his blue eyes that she felt tied hand and foot . My God , she thought , my God , why must he always find ways to torture me ? Why must he choose now , when Mother is dying , to force me to make a choice between him and her ? She was unconsciously twisting her hands in her lap , she thought that she was sitting perfectly still and maintaining the quiet facade of acquiescence which was the surest way to keep him on an even keel . But she found suddenly that he was down on one knee before her chair , grasping her tormented hands in his and pressing them hard together , and saying , " Oh , Jess , try and do this for me now . I ca n't tell you why I think it will make such a difference , but I feel it . Honestly , I do . " He looked at her with pleading intensity . " Believe me , " he said . " And besides --  " " What ? " asked Jessie faintly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it she would tell you this is the thing you should do . Even for her sake . . . let alone ours . " He remained silent for a time and finally he said , " Do n't you think that ? Is n't that how she would feel ? " Jessie was so distressed , so uncertain , so torn , yet so clear in knowledge far sounder than Brandon 's , that she could only nod her head in slow resignation . I am afraid , she felt rather than thought , far , deep inside herself . I am afraid , afraid . . . and yet she knew that she would have even more to fear if she should refuse Brandon 's wish now . This should have been the happiest and most wonderful hour of my life , she reflected , and instead like everything else it is bitter with sorrow and fear . Now , if she should say that she insisted upon going to Paris with her mother , Rosa would not allow it . Rosa would say that Jessie must stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in letting the matter move to that extreme . Jessie bowed her head , and Brandon leaned down over her and kissed her . She had finished now with her face and her hair , had put on her stockings and her shoes and her underclothes ; and she went into her bedroom where Josephine held up the purple wool dress while Jessie slipped into it . " Oh , Josephine , " she said , fastening the small silk strips inside the shoulders of her dress , " go down and ask Anna and Sarah for their lists for tomorrow . I do n't know where the morning has gone , but I 'm going to market and now I 'm late . Find out if Binger 's ever sent those crackers I ordered last week . . . such a silly thing not to be able to get . " When she was alone , putting on her earrings and then , carefully , the wonderful red hat , her eye fell on a small framed photograph of Brandon which had stood on a table near the window ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed into the room that she realized now she had not distinctly noticed it for years . And then she made a grimace . Do I have to remember all that too ? she asked herself . If I hurry out right now , I will break this maddening chain of unwanted thoughts . Instead and quite involuntarily she walked quickly across the floor and flung open the door between her own room and Brandon 's . She stood in the doorway staring at the handsome , comfortable room , unnaturally neat because of Brandon 's absence , a room designed to please him and full of possessions reflective of his tastes ; and as she looked at them , pictures of his crew and his hockey team , of polo , of some of his relatives , at mementos of ski trips and tennis tournaments and the Navy , she thought with a kind of surprise which denied her ever having thought it before , how total a stranger was the occupant of this room . Perversely and resentfully , she stood there in the doorway and saw herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near his desk where he was sitting ; she heard his voice and remembered his face , and the whole detestable wreckage came clattering down about her ; and she gave a bitter , cynical shrug and folded her arms and stood there , staring , waiting for Josephine to come back with the marketing list . By February , ten years ago , her mother had been gone some weeks , accompanied by Reath Sheldon 's nurse and her maid , and with Horace Howland 's promise to join her in Paris before the end of March . Jessie was already pregnant . And a new kind of balance had been struck , between her extreme physical wretchednessand the amazing change in Brandon . She was horribly ill , tortured by constant nausea and faintness , but this different Brandon made it bearable . He came home straight from the office at the end of the day , bringing her flowers , content to have dinnerp175alone with her or with one or two friends ; kindly , genial , and manifestly delighted with himself . It was all perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust herself not to flee from the room or reach in panic for the aromatic spirits , life would be on the way to what she had always longed to make it . She remembered their disappointment at finding after some six weeks that her stubborn illness did not lessen ; she began to worry that Brandon would grow restless and bored ; and through the doctor to whom Reath Sheldon had turned her over , there evolved a plan for Brandon to take her to Pinehurst , where the climate was ideal in March . Brandon would get a good golf game every day while Jessie rested . He was enthusiastic , he arranged a week 's absence from his office , and they planned to go down on a Friday night train . Not in years had they spent a ten-day holiday together , and Jessie felt as if her cup of fantastic happiness were running over . The one ominous cloud was her intense and deepeninganxiety about her mother . Horace Howland had cabled upon reaching Paris the truth which he had promised Jessie before sailing ; Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing hopeful to report from Otto Wasservogel 's observations . Jessie was sitting up in bed , holding that cable in her hand , when Brandon telephoned her from his office about eleven o'clock on Thursday morning , the day before they were to leave . " How sweet of you to call , " she said , making her voice as bright as she could contrive between her grief about her mother and her suspense about her own heaving stomach . " Well , " said Brandon , his voice lazy and low . " I wanted to know how you are . " " Pretty good , " she said , trying to laugh . " Three strikes thismorning but I 'm not out . I refuse to play by the rules . " " That 's good , " he said . And then , " Say , Jess --  " " Yes ? " " Well  --  something 's come up here . I kind of wondered  --  " already she knew that he had some disappointment for her . Nothingelse would account for the exaggerated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she exclaimed . " Do n't tell me we ca n't go to Pinehurst ! " " Uh  --  no , " he said slowly . " It 's not that . I just thought maybe you would n't mind if I shifted things around a little . " " But how ? " she asked . " Ca n't you take next week off after all ? "  | " Oh , sure , " he said , with easy warmth which did not reassureher at all . She knew by now that he was feeling for a way to tell her something unpleasant . " I 'll tell you . How would it be if you went down on the train tomorrow night and I joined you there Monday ? " " But  --  but  --  " whatever she did , Jessie did not want to sound childish and complaining now . She was tense with distress and bewilderment and the sense of an old , familiar misery coming back to roost . She was silent . Brandon had to say something . " I kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " A date ? " gasped Jessie . Was her rosy cloud evaporating so soon ? My God , she thought , reaching for the aromatic spirits and trying to breathe calmly , oh my God , what shall I do ? " You could , " she said , trying to sound reasonable and worldly and casual , " put it off , could n't you ? After all --  " " Well , " said Brandon uneasily . " You see I told this  --  " Jessie 's tongue was a sour , rigid ball , and the cold sweat was starting from her skin  --  " these people that I 'd go up to Franconia skiing with them this week end , it 's the last good snow of the season and they 'd set it all up and --  " " What people ? " asked Jessie . Her voice was a blur now . " Oh  --  you do n't know them . Tex Wilder and his wife and  --  " " And  --  ? " said Jessie , forcing out the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she was more ill or more angry . " And her sister , " said Brandon , very casual . " Just a kid , I do n't think she 's out of school yet . " Forced into the open , thought Jessie . How long has this been going on . Oh , Christ , her inner self shrieked , stop it , stop it , stop him ! She said aloud to Brandon , " I 'd hate that . I do n't want to be a wet blanket but it seems to me there 's a real reason for our trip to Pinehurst and none at all for you to  --  to --  " " Well I see it differently , " he said . His tone was becoming sharp ; Jessie knew what was about to happen as clearly as if it had taken place yesterday which , indeed , in innumerable variations , it had . But she felt helpless , utterly powerless to stop the thing , to hold it back , to change its course . Ruin had been put into motion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something that she would pray tonight never to have said , but she could not stop herself from saying it . Her brain in some way seemed to have been betrayed by thep177condition of her body , and she was so deathly ill that she felt crazily determined to assert herself before a shattering bout of nausea overcame her . " I think you 're unkind ! " she cried . " You know perfectly well I am too ill to go off on a sleeper alone overnight and --  " " Take a nurse with you , " said Brandon abruptly . " Thank you . While you go away on a  --  a  --  oh , I ca n't believe it ! " she wailed . " I thought you 'd changed . I thought you 'd changed . But you are just the same --  " " Only I , of course , " snapped Brandon . " Only I was supposed to do all the changing . Of course there 's never been anything the matter with you . Nobody had the right to expect you to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you had the imagination of a moron you 'd see why I wanted to do this . " " Would I ? " asked Jessie , holding the telephone in both her dripping , shaking hands , and swallowing the bitter gall that flooded her mouth . " Why , then ? " " Because I ca n't be expected to be a goddam lapdog all the time ! " he said , almost shouting . " I 've had enough of this itsybitsycollar and leash stuff for a while  --  anyway if that 's what the rest of my life is going to be , I want a break once in a while . I know I 'm never going to have any freedom , " he assured her , " but you 're a damn fool if you do n't give me the illusion of some ! " " Oh , " she said . " Oh , God . " There was a silence . She expected him to break the connectionbut he did not . She heard him striking a match . " Brandon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't mean that . You ca n't mean you are going with those people . " " You 're goddam right I mean I 'm going ! " he said . " And after this little exhibition from you I 'm not coming to Pinehurst at all . Good bye . " The telephone clacked and was dead . It must have been six o'clock that evening when Jessie raised her head from the rumpled pillows which had come to feel like the inside of a hot metal box , and forced open her swollen eyes . Whatever had happened in the black space that had passed , she knew only that she had swung between racking fits of vomiting and still more shattering bouts of retching and sobs . She had heard sounds outside her door but she was too ravaged even to identify them ; she had only groaned " Go away , " and had dragged the bed linen over her head . But in spite of the perfectly dark room she became aware at last that someone was standing beside her bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Sam Lee bane on telephone , Madam . She called already four times today . She say she got speak to you , or she bane coming anyway . " Jessie rolled over , the room or her own head rocking crazily , and felt the telephone being put into her hand . " Jessie , " she heard , in the quiet , warm voice of that nice Helen Lee whom she knew just well enough to be able in the midst of this nightmare to identify . " Hello , " said Jessie . A gasping croak was all that she could get out . " Your maid says you are very ill , " said Mrs. Lee . " Ugh , " said Jessie . " Do n't try to talk to me . But will you mind if I come over for a minute ? " " No . " The telephone fell from her hand and again she was not able to make sense of anything until she felt a cool , fresh , perfumed hand on her forehead , and heard the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jess . " Helen sat down lightly on the edge of the bed , keeping her hand quietly on Jessie 's forehead , and Jessie did not know how much time elapsed before she heard Helen Lee say , " Would you hate it if we try to make you a little more comfortable ? " She was so quiet , so calm , so natural that her presence made Jessie feel like a sick child , obedient and helpless . Jessie felt herself gently moved ; felt warm , fragrant water , eau de cologne , bath powder , the slow strokes of a hairbrush , the clean sting of mouthwash . Presently she found herself back in bed , the linen fresh , the pillows welcome and quiet beneath her head instead of fighting one another and her , as they seemed to have done all day . It was extraordinary how silent Helen Lee remained . She had not said a single word . When Jessie opened her heavy , burning eyes Helen smiled and again touched Jessie with her marvellously soothing hand ; still she said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her an evidence of inspirationin human instinct . Presently Helen Lee took something from Helga at the door , and without any remark Jessie found herself slowly nibbling a dry water-biscuit . It seemed the most delicious thing that she had ever put into her mouth . There began to grow about her the strange sense of suspension in place and time and association which often follows an interval of insensibility . She could look at Helen Lee now , in some way become the only person on earth who had any reality , and accept her presence and the reassurancep179of her authority in the midst of chaos , as if it had always been part of her life . " I want you to drink a little brandy , " said Helen . " You 'll be surprised how good it will make you feel . " Jessie took the small glass , still with the docility of a child , and began to sip the brandy in drops . She knew that she would surely feel better because Helen Lee had said so . From time to time Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or going to the door to say something quietly to Helga . Jessie had no concern at all in what went on ; this had become Helen Lee 's room , or house , or world ; Jessie felt like a rag doll suspended in the midst of it . The weeks dragged by in an evil cloud , of which she now remembered only fragments ; horrifying nausea , terrible , stranglingasphyxia , the tender , silent concern of Helen Lee , the bluff encouragement of Althea Crowe , the frigid punitive attitude of Brandon , implying that her condition was imaginary or hysterical , going about his own affairs almost as if she did not exist . Some days she saw him not at all ; some for a moment in the morning , or when he came home to dress for dinner , for which he was always out . Sometimes the only evidence of his presence was the savage slam of the front door , or , hours past midnight , she would wake from a heavy sick sleep because she had heard the click of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was extraordinary how she might sleep through other sounds , but if that switch clicked in the dead of night she would find herself sitting bolt upright in bed , trembling , her hands clammy , her heart pounding with a sensation for which she knew no other name than terror . The news about her mother in Paris was as terrible as it could be ; Rosa wrote short , joking , gallant notes , and Horace Howland wrote the truth . Early in April he wrote that it was now a matter of trying to conserve Rosa 's strength so that she could stand the voyage home . She was planning to come , she had reached the point of obsession about it . The unstated truth that she was determined to come home to die , and to see Jessie before she died , was implicit in every word . Jessie tried to tell this to Brandon , but it seemed to her that life had resolved into an ugly , rigid pattern the parts of which were herself lying in bed a helpless prisoner , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indifferent that he had so condemned her.  | " If I could only get there to Mother ! " Jessie lay holding Horace Howland 's latest note , her arm across her eyes . She was struggling not to weep , which she understood would only be an irritation to Brandon . She might have saved herself the trouble , for he only said , " You probably could if you wanted to badly enough . " She turned her head away and shivered . She might have reminded him why she was here at all ; she might have told him of the endless treatments and expedients which had failed to help her ; she might have screamed , " Do you think I do not want to be free of this unspeakable misery , which is all your doing ? " ; she might have told him of her useless and despairing prayer that she might die instead of her mother . But that would do no good . He would dismiss whatever she said , or go into a rage about it . If she should speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see ? I told you it was all hysteria . " She realized that in his mind there was no child involved in her situation at all . During the first few fantastic weeks , he had referred to the child with considerable excitement and pride , as if his child were to be spectacularly different from any other . But now when she tried to project her own imagination to the birth of the child and beyond , Jessie only became lost in a hopelessfog of troubled emotion about her mother . At her bitterest , alone hour after hour , day after day , and worst of all , during the interminable evenings and nights , she knew only that this crucifyingmess into which Brandon had got her was keeping her from her mother . It was not worth it . Nothing that was any shred or part of Brandon Bourne was worth one hour of her mother 's life . She became very frightened at the growing intensity of her hatred for him . Always before when he had slid off into one of these periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new affair , the air of cold excitement , the secretiveness , the false casualness about his comings and goings , the telephone conversations behind closed doors , the remote blank stare when she looked at his eyes , she had known first of all the agony of grinding jealousy . She had in the past been driven , helpless and desperate , to fighting her rivals with all the ignominious , ugly tale of weapons in the feminine arsenal . And now she was losing the desire to fight and the power to care . When Helen Lee , whose genius for understanding extended to the instinct of what to seem not to know , and what to treat with cynical realism , deliberatelymentioned a second-rate bit actress named Isabel Allenp181whom Sam had fired during a recent rehearsal , Jessie had only shrugged . " I know , " she said . " She probably ca n't be bothered working while she 's making hay with Brandon . " Helen said quietly , " It will hurt you a lot less if you take it this way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it is all over town . And I do n't even know exactly how I know that . " " I did n't think you could be so tough  --  even in self-defense , " said Helen . " Neither did I , " said Jessie . " But it 's that or go under . And that is n't even all he is up to --  " " Oh , do n't , " said Helen . " I do n't feel as if I could bear it . " Ili " That is the way I used to talk  --  to myself , " said Jessie dully . Late that afternoon she had gingerly tried the experiment ofgetting up and putting on some clothes and going downstairs to the library where she was going to have dinner  --  alone , as usual  --  11 on a tray beside the fire . She was sitting there reading a novel and sipping a glass of sherry when the telephone rang . Evidently there was nobody in the pantry at the moment , the telephone was not immediately answered . So Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , " said a hard , drawling young voice , a Foxcroft or a Farmington voice . " Is Bran there ? " " I beg your pardon , " said Jessie . " I said is Bran there . " " To whom do you wish to speak ? " asked Jessie . Her own 11voice was frigid , but she could not have changed her tone if she had wanted to . " Why  --  I 'm calling Bran Bourne , " said the girl . " He 's supposedto come out to Oyster Bay --  " " This is Mrs. Brandon Bourne , " said Jessie , her voice shot with a tremolo of rage . " I have made no engagement in Oyster Bay for Mr. Bourne and myself . " She dropped the telephone with no awareness of having said or done anything by volition . Thewalls were shimmering before her eyes . There was a large framed photograph of Brandon on the desk beside her hand . Suddenly her fingers closed on it ; she raised it high above her head with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ran across the room and lifting up the skirt of her tea gown , she stamped and stamped on the picture and the shattered glass , grinding them until she broke the heel of her slipper.  | Josephine had given her the marketing lists , she was dressed and ready to go out , she had answered a telephone call from the War Fund office , it was past noon , and she must go . But now her mind had come up squarely to face the deep strangeness which runs like a buried brook beneath the whole surface of one 's life , gathering to itself other submerged , smaller runnels , each an experience or a personality , to flow into the whole ; and all of it at great intervals forcing itself through the surface of intentionalforgetfulness , bubbling springs impossible to suppress . Good God , she thought now , why does this thing flow on and on this morning ; why do these particular people all happen to have prodded and prodded me in just this way ? For by now it appeared no coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Althea who since that day ten years ago had never indicated the remotest memory of it . For it was to Althea Crowe that Jessie , in a wild and desperate state , had turned , the morning after she had smashed the picture . Althea had sat right there , in that very chair near Jessie 's bed , a calm squatted idol , listening while Jessie said abruptly , " I want to get rid of this child . And I do n't know anybody who can help me except you , Althea . " And Althea , wise , cool , cynical , had said , " You ca n't , my dear . " " Why not ? Other women do . " " In the most utterly different circumstances . And not when  --  " the big square head had tilted from the chin in an encompassinggesture . Jessie made a hard face . " I would say I had had a miscarriage , " she said . " He is n't here enough to notice  --  or care . " " Your judgment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that does n't alter the facts . Ca n't you see what you would have done if he chose to get tough ? And he very probably might . " " No . " " You 're not a fool , child . Do n't make me use words like crime ' and that sort of thing . " " Oh , Althea . " " I 'm serious . Thank God you asked me about this , and not somebody different . You ca n't make sense in your present state and I 'd like to wring that bastard 's neck for it  --  but I wo n't let you stick out your own . " Jessie shook her head . " If you wo n't help me , " she said , " I 'm going to find somebody who will . I mean it . " " If you try that , I 'll tell Reath Sheldon. "  |p183Jessie  scowled , not understanding . " Reath Sheldon ? What do you mean , Reath ? Do you know him ? " " Since high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Besides , he 's my doctor . " " I did n't know you ever saw a doctor . I thought  --  " Althea Crowe shrugged . " Diabetes , the hell with it , " she said . " Althea  --  my God --  " " I said , the hell with it . Now look here , Jess . You are not going to do this , and on second thought I 'm going to ask Reath anyway to tell you why you ca n't . I 'm a ragged old bag , I ca n't mix too deep in it . " Jessie began to cry . " I ca n't go on with it , " she sobbed . " I ca n't . " " I wish to Christ you 'd never got into it . But I know what I 'm talking about . " The look on Althea 's face amounted to a statement of harsh past experience . " Reath will be up this after-noon . " " I do n't  --  " Jessie tried to insist that Althea had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end she only shrank down among her pillows whimpering , " I ca n't go on . I wo n't . " She tried again to say that to Sheldon when he came . And now , so many years later , it proved to be not what he had said on that afternoon , but what he had conveyed without remembered words , that had settled into the substructure of life , the masonry beneath all that was visible . One could , thought Jessie , going back into her dressing-room for a final inspection in the long mirrors , go along for years without examining that substructure , but how surely would one 's life fall to pieces if it were not there ! She set off on foot to market , walking briskly westward on the double-width crosstown street , noting with her usual satisfactionthat all the small personalities and happenings of the neighborhoodwere about their normal ways this morning . Mamas were airing bedding from the windows ; others with their string bags and queerly covered heads were shrewdly selecting , piece by piece , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pungent thick soup ; a bus driver and a hackie were having one of the arguments which consist chiefly of " Yeah ? " " Yeah ! " with outthrust chins and twisted mouths . Jessie believed that she knew the signs and shopfronts of every inch of this bit of Little Hungary ; in the window of a certain flat , her eye noted a card , as it had often done before , which conveyed a startling insight into the lives of her neighbors : Horvath Margit , Midwife . And she thought , my God ! am I never to stop meeting these pinpricks today , never manage once for all to shut that whole wretched cycle back into the forgotten where it belongs ? Instead , as she made her way those two very long blocks from York Avenue to Second , she gave up the effort to combat the strange insistence of her memory to follow through its will to a conclusion . Perhaps there is a purpose , she mused . . . I can not know . . . perhaps it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I think it had to be then that Mother was to die , if she must die so unnaturally soon . Jessie remembered the cable from Horace Howland , which came during that same tormented week , that he was sailing immediately with Rosa , that she would be taken from the ship on a stretcher . Jessie knew that the gallant battle of pretense was lost at last . Her own sufferings shrank now to their minimal proportion ; it became important only to be well enough herself to get to the ship when it arrived , and to have Brandon there with her for the sake of her mother 's peace of mind . He saw the point ; he agreed at once to meet the ship with Jessie . It was due at mid-afternoon , but the crossing had been delayedby fog and Jessie was told a day ahead of time that the ship would not dock before ten o'clock at night . On the morning of that day she waited in bed for Brandon to stop in before startingfor the office ; she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her room by eleven o'clock , and he had not yet left the house , so Jessie got out of bed , put on a dressing-gown and slippers and went into his room . He was talking on the telephone , tilted back on the rear legs of a chair with his feet on the desk in front of him . He was speaking in a carefully lowered voice so that he could not have been heard from outside the room. "  --  by eight anyway , " he was saying . " I 've reserved --  " Jessie shut the door with deliberate noise , so that he would hear her , and walked over to him , saying carefully , " Brandon  --  I beg your pardon . Could you --  ? " " Hold it , " he said into the telephone . He looked up at Jessie with a scowl . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I just wanted to tell you --  " " Well ca n't it wait ? " he asked , covering the mouthpiece of the telephone with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " It is delayed and not docking until ten tonight . " Brandon 's eyes went glassy with irritation . " I was afraid  --  I did n't know  --  " said Jessie awkwardly.  | " Surely , " she said with a rush of daring , " you are n't making an engagement for tonight ? " " I 've made it , " snapped Brandon . Jessie drew a deep breath to steady herself and said as gently as possible , " Yes , but  --  perhaps you could make it any other day , Brandon ? Would you mind terribly ? " " I certainly would , " he said . Jessie was so conscious of the woman waiting at the other end of the telephone in Brandon 's hand that she could not force herself to speak . Indeed she ought not to speak . But she heard her own voice , thin and unnatural , saying to her surprise , " Oh , Brandon . Do n't you remember what you promised me ? It is n't for my sake , truly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb fingers and breathed , " Please , Brandon . Please change your engagement . On account of Mother . " He sat scowling for a moment , running his hand through his hair , his face hardening in its most ominous mould . He said into the telephone , " Look , I 've been interrupted , I 'll call you back . " Then he flung the instrument into place and glared at Jessie . " I 'm sorry about your mother , " he said , " but I think you 've built up a thing about this . . . you 'll be perfectly all right . You said yourself they 've arranged to take her straight home . There wo n't be any waiting around or customs or anything . You do n't really need me . " " It was not for my sake , " Jessie repeated , struggling to keep the least note of strain or argument out of her voice . " I told you last week , I 'm willing to settle for anything if you will just help me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to repeat it all , Brandon , I know I would only annoy you . " He was hesitating and she thought that she had persuaded him . She tried to smile , she tried to be relaxed and gentle , she tried to avert her eyes from his face because she knew how it would anger him if she looked at him with pleading or anxiety . " I will be so grateful , " she said softly . " Well , I do n't see why it 's necessary , " he said in the barkingstaccato which hit her ears like hammers . " Ah , " she breathed , with weakness coming over her like a great salt wave , " you did see . You were perfectly sweet about it . " She bent her head suddenly , hard down over her breast , to force the blood into it and keep her from collapsing . " Jesus Christ , " she heard him say , rising from his chair and kicking it away , " I 'm so goddam fed up . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes ! " he said , making the syllable a whiplash . " No other man I ever heard of is always snarled up in a mess of  --  see here ! " he said . " I told you I 've got a date and I 've decided to keep it . " " You 're quite sure ? " she asked . Only the utmost extreme of distress and pain could have brought her voice to this strange , low , throb . She did not recognize the sound herself . " You 're quite sure it is worth it ? Sure you could n't go to this same place tomorrow ? " " No I could not , " he said . " I 'm going there tonight . It 's not my fault if the French Line brings their ship in late . " " I see , " she said . Walking with what she thought careful steadiness , she turned and went back to her own room . She was surprised at how calm she felt as the day wore on . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she said to Helen Lee who came in during the afternoon , " I think I 've reached the point now where literally nothing can hurt me . " She had not told Helen any part of what had taken place with Brandon . But Helen could judge for herself when she learned that Jessie was going to the pier alone . " Will you let me go with you ? " she asked . Jessie shook her head . " No thanks , darling . Doctor Sheldon will be there . And for Mother , you understand  --  " The presence of an outsider would only dramatize Brandon 's absence . It was Reath Sheldon who carried Jessie as well as her mother through that ordeal ; who managed through all the uproar of a docking ship and a turbulent pier to bring Rosa down a special gangway and into the waiting ambulance , with such quiet speed that the details would always be blurred in Jessie 's mind . It mattered only that she found herself inside the ambulance , holding her mother 's hand and looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again her mother 's extraordinary eyes , sunken and huge now and black with suffering , and touch again her soft brown hand , curiously light in spite of its heavy bones , everything else lost reality . They sped out of the pier , with the muffled siren whining , and were in Sixty-sixth Street in what seemed an instant . Reath Sheldon 's car with Horace Howland was close behind them . It was but a few minutes until Rosa was lying in her own bed , the nurse little in evidence , and Jessie sitting close to her mother , smiling with all the courage that she could muster . Rosa had of course asked , " How are you feeling , darling ? " and other natural questions , but she had not mentioned Brandon nor appeared to notice his absence . How wonderful she was !  |p187Jessie  thought , and perhaps Brandon is right when he says I am hysterical and making mountains out of molehills . After all , what difference would it have made if he had been with me tonight ? She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a benediction which held the power to heal every injury and hurt and sorrow of these past months . And yet her mother was so fearfully ill that Jessie dared not let her feel the burden of her need for her . Rosa must have lost twenty-five pounds ; she was a frail cage of bones beneath the covers of the bed ; her voice was never stronger than a whisper . And Jessie had been warned alreadynot to let her talk . She did not have the strength . For Jessie it was enough to lay her head down on the pillow near her mother 's , to hide her face in the pitiful bony angle of the neck and shoulder which had been so gloriously beautiful ; and when the faint pressure of her mother 's hand said that for which there were no words , pouring into Jessie 's heart the only love on earth of which she could be sure , Jessie locked her teeth together and felt the hot pressure of her pulse pounding with the determination not to give way now to what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was growing late now , Rosa should long ago have been settled for the night . The nurse stood for a moment in the doorwayto signal Jessie that she should leave . She whispered to her mother that she would be there in the morning ; she kissed her forehead , pressed her hands for a moment , and straightened up from the bed . Rosa Landau made then an effort so prodigious and so gallant that Jessie 's throat felt raw with the struggle to choke back sobs . Rosa opened her beautiful , now tragic eyes as wide as she could , smiled with her lovely warm mouth now pinched with agony and said , visibly straining to make her voice gay and radiant as it used to be , " We 'll have fun together still , darling . I even managed to get some lovely clothes for the baby in Paris . " Oh , thought Jessie , fighting not to weep . Oh , the baby , the poor baby that does n't make any sense , the poor baby . . . She bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shadows of hands and took Jessie 's face between them . " Are you all right , darling ? " she asked . Her voice was warm and clear and to her daughter it was and would remain forever the sound of human love . " Are you really all right ? " Jessie nodded , forcing a smile to her face , and the motions of her hands and head and shoulders to be quick and reassuring and gay . She nodded hard , putting her finger over her lips to tell herp188mother to be quiet and rest now . Then she turned and left the room . She started down the stairs , with the sound of her mother 's beloved voice still clear in her ears . Horace Howland was standing at the foot of the stairs , outside the drawing-room door , looking up at Jessie and waiting for her . There was safety in his presence , and calm and sureness and warmth . The fine clear eyes smiled encouragingly , and he came towards her holding out his hand . Jessie noticed with strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisp white cuff with the jewelled link sparkling in the light from the hall . Dear Horace , to love her mother so , to have loved her so for all these years . How did one earn such love , Jessie thought , how did one find it and hold it ? What a long , strange flight of stairs this was , and why had she so much time to think on the way down ? And how many times had her mother 's voice repeated those few precious words ? Jessie moved with one hand on her breast as if to hold the sound close inside there . " Are you all right , darling ? Are you really all right ? " She heard it even above the buzzing in her ears . " Horace ! " breathed Jessie as she fell . It was not a long fall , it did not seem anything but a slip almost at the bottom of the stairs , as he leaped forward not quite in time to catch her . But that was the night that Jessie lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock when Jessie was walking up Second Avenue with Mark Dwyer , both in the highest spirits . He had met her as she was standing by the sidewalk display of fruit and vegetables outside Tommy Pecoraro 's market . She picked up a blue plum and handed it to Mark , saying " Good morning . Just occupy yourself with this until I finish here . " " Thanks , " said Mark , putting the whole plum into his mouth and talking around it . " Only this is n't the way to eat this and I bet you do n't know what is . " " No ? " she said , " except that my friend Anna was making those things before you were born . With pot cheese and poppyseedstrewn all over them . " She looked into Mark 's eyes , laughing , but in such a way that the glitter of nonsense lay sparkling on the surface of herp189face . They stood among the celery and beans and beets and onions , with shabby , plodding neighborhood housewives gabbling all around them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decorated general ; and they held such a silent conversation of the eyes , serious behind the glints of playfulness , as only natures perfectly and spontaneously accordant can know . " You are not , " said Mark , " dressed quite suitably for the occasion . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I decided to leave my boudoir cap at home . " " We could buy you one , " said Mark , raising an eyebrow at the neighboring store , which had put out on its sidewalk stand a wonderful collection of local necessities : odd crockery , chipped grey agate saucepans , pink glass tumblers , boxes of buttons , darningeggs , spools of thread , toilet paper , scrubbing-brushes , dishmops , knitted hug-me-tights , and many other things in a casual bargain-jumble of hardware and drygoods . Jessie laughed and turned to Big Tommy in his dirty white apron , who was gazing at Mark Dwyer 's decorations with beamingeyes . A small boy ran out of the store and peered from behindTommy 's elbow . " Jeest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gwan , scram , " said Tommy .  --  Gim me a box iceboig outa da back . " A spotted kitten scuttled from under the fruit stand and batted excitedly at a dangling paper tag . Jessie bent down and swooped it up , scratching it gently under its chin . It was a pretty kitten , gay and not timid at all , which was one reason why Jessie liked the Pecoraros . All their cats were well-treated and friendly . This one was purring like a small machine . " Must you ? " asked Mark . " You know you will ruin your clothes . " " I ca n't help it , " she said . " I always have to play with cats . I can not leave them alone . " " Mis ' Bourne knows all da cats on da block , " said Tommy . " How are the pears today , Tommy ? " asked Jessie . " The last ones tasted like wallpaper . " " You 're tellin ' me . Green stuff . Do n't take none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be ! Ninety cents a pound . " " Moider , ai n't it ? Watcha gon na do ? " He shoved his cap to the back of his head and shrugged . Jessie put down the kitten ,  | brushed her gloves against each other , called good bye to Tommy 's wife inside the store , and started up the street with Mark Dwyer . He walked rather slowly , carefully eyeing each shop and sometimespausing to look thoughtfully through the windows at the people inside . " It 's changed a lot , " he said . " But then in other ways it has n't changed at all . Any of those women waiting at that counter there could be my Ma , or somebody she knew . " " They are good women , " said Jessie . " Or at least I think so . Probably I 'm a sentimental fool because I do n't know them and would have nothing in common with them if I did . But I like to be among them and feel the sense of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said she pensively , " sometimes I have a strange idea . I know people who love the country , who say that the sight of trees and meadows and growing things gives them strength , or contentment , or peace . . . you know . . . ? " Mark nodded , watching her. " . . . that is their contact with Nature and that is real to them . But mine seems to be people like those  --  " she nodded towards two heavy , swollen-legged , shapeless Mamas dressed in cotton print house-dresses , sagging coats , and worn , misshapen shoes . They were standing by the curbstone gossipping and Jessie said , as she and Mark passed them , " You see , I ca n't even understand the language they are talking . It could be Sanskrit . But it does n't matter , I do n't need to talk to them . In fact if I had to , there would be very little for us to say . " " They are talking Slovak , " said Mark , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be anything else , too . Hungarian most probably in this particular block . Or German a few blocks away . Or Italian . Or Yiddish . Or  --  you know . You know it all better than I do . I 'm only trying to say that I get some kind of joy out of being near people like that , out of having some reason for doing anything that they do . That must be why I go to market like this , for of course there is no other reason . " " Poor kid , " said Mark , looking down at her with tenderness . " What a long way off base you are . " " And not you ? " asked Jessie . " Certainly , sometimes . But I told you last night --  " " Yes , " she said . " I remember . " " And I am much nearer to these people than you , " he said . " To me they are just the normal human furniture of the bit of space into which I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a little enchanted . You ought to get a good look inside there . " He pointed to the doorway of a five-story coldwater walk-up , a small dark hole opening on a darker hallway with steep crooked stairs squeezed against a peeling wall . " I can stand out here in the street , " he said , " and describe one of those flats as if I lived in it . I can tell you about everything , all of it from the cracked kitchen oilcloth to the leak under the sink , the chromos on the walls , family groups and confirmationsand weddings , and souvenir calendars and a colored landscape of somewhere in the old country . And the embroidered sofa cushions and the dried-up palm from last Palm Sunday and the shabby furniture that 's too big for the rooms and the sagging beds and the dark hall toilet where the airshaft never lets any air in . And the way those hallways smell , that mean damp stink even when the tenants keep the house clean as such houses go , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cockroaches in the walls . Oh , I know all about it . " " Nevertheless , " said Jessie , " to me the people who live there are infinitely more interesting than most of the ones whom we are going to see tonight . And of course I am absolutely inconsistentand ridiculous . " " Absolutely , " said Mark . They came to the door of the butcher shop west of Third Avenue where Jessie and her mother before her and hundreds of old-fashioned , substantial people had dealt for nearly fifty years . There had been a time in the market world when all the best butchers , both wholesale and retail , had come from the solid German-Jewish stratum of the wonderful polyglot layer-cake of Manhattan ; names like Loewenstein and Buchsbaum and Schweitzerand Frankenthaler had meant good meat and sound business for generations , as had small , weazened Mr. Hoexter whose rule over this hustling establishment was effected through his two tough , strapping sons while he wandered about in a seeming state of vagueness which did not mean anything at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest . If he did not like your hat or want your trade , he said so . " Hullo , dolling ! " Jessie was greeted by a rough bass roar . She smiled and said , " Hello , Walter . Hello , Jack . " The girls in the cashier 's cage threw in their hellos , the meatcutters in the back of the shop grinned theirs . Jessie said , " This is General Dwyer , boys . He came along because he does n't believe anybody ever goes to market any more . "  | " General Mark Dwyer ? " Walter held out his slab of a hand and they shook . Cigarettes were offered and lighted . The Hoexters accepted the presence of the general , whose identity they appeared to know well , without the slightest empressement . " Have you anything to eat this week ? " asked Jessie . " Fa ' you , sweetheart , anything , " answered Walter . " You ca n't call me that yet , " said Jessie , winking . " And why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this place is known as the store where they call all the customers darling ' if they 're under forty , and sweetheart ' if they 're over . " " Fa ' that hat , " said Jack , leaning over from his block andgesturing with a cleaver , " you can choose your own name . " " But not my own steak , " said Jessie . " Last week --  " " Neveh mind last week . You wan na run this business , dolling ? It 's yours . " " Thanks . I only want a pot roast for tomorrow 's dinner . " " Is she gon na make pancakes with it ? " asked Walter . " I 'll be right over . " " She is n't going to make anything unless you come across . I 'm so sick of birds I could cackle . " " Ya hear , Pop ? " " I hear , " muttered Mr. Hoexter . " She 's eating still , no ? She should complain . " Jessie laughed . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know how they do it , but they always have something to eat . Well , Walter  --  about eight pounds and lots of suet , all the way around ? " " Didja hear about the fat collection ? " he asked , chopping off the feet of a chicken at the knee joints . " If you sent that chicken to my house you 'd catch hell for it , " said Jessie . " Sure . Thank God the other customers do n't put on so many airs . " " French style , nebbich , " muttered Mr. Hoexter . " Good bye , " said Jessie , starting towards the door . " So long , dolling . I 'll be up for them potato pancakes . " When they were on Lexington Avenue , looking for a cab , Mark said , " Do you always horse around with those people thatway ? " " Of course , that 's why I go there . Aside from the good meat . Oh Mark , look . "  | " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of her eyes . He saw nothing except everyday people going about their business . But Jessie was looking at a woman who had just passed them ; she was watching the woman 's back in its neat grey tailored suit , her conservatively dressed haircoloredhair , her modest brown felt hat , the small , correct neckpieceof brown fur , the low-heeled alligator pumps , the prim purposeful walk of a personality who believed in plenty of wholesomefresh air and vigorous family life . " What in the world is newsworthy about her ? " asked Mark . " Only that she and her kind give me the green crawling creeps . I tell you , I would react with less horror to meeting a python loose in Central Park . " " But why ? " An empty cab stopped and Mark helped Jessie into it . " What 's wrong with the woman ? She looks harmless and all too decent . Go to the Plaza , driver . " " That 's just what she is , " said Jessie . " Decent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouse-minded kind against the helpless young . I know her and dozens like her . You can always see them at this time of day on Madison and Lexington Avenues , doing their errands . Their name is always in my mind Robinson or Delano or Potter , whether it really happens to be that or something else . The mothers of the snippy little bitches in the good schools  --  you know , like Brearley and Chapin and Hewitt 's  --  who gang up on any wretched pariah who happens to be the least bit different , and make her life a broiling hell . I know . I know all about it . " " But you are so violent ! " said Mark , astonished . " That is what happens to me when I see one of those women . The whole thing slides through my mind like a train  --  the whole fixed , rigid pattern , with these terrible women sitting like a court of judgment that you sometimes dream about in a nightmare when you 've committed a crime  --  did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face intent and very sad . " There they sit , grimacing at the bars , one side of them that vomitous sick-sweet manner and tone of voice for their own kind , and the other the most slashing , brutal snobbery for everybody else , and particularly the children of anybody else . They run the dancing classes and the subscription dances and the whole gearedupmachinery that leads to the debut and the preservation of their own damned life-cycle , which appears to be breaking down at last ,  | thank God . I am sorry to see some of the lovelinesses of the old world go , but not what they are bent on preserving . " " I had no idea you could be so ferocious , " said Mark . " Anybody is who knows the workings of that machine , " she said . " My sister-in-law is one of them , or more exactly used to be  --  but her own husband and daughter have become such a cup of gall that she can not hold her head up in the line any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie shrugged . And sitting quietly in the cab with Mark Dwyer beside her , she began to wonder that she had let off steam in such a harsh and uncharacteristic way . " I did n't mean to , " she said aloud in the midst of her thought , and Mark , taking her gloved hand and holding it for a moment against his cheek said , " Of course you did n't mean to . That 's why I 'm glad you did . " And so there disappeared the need to say anything more at all , and they fell into one of the brief eloquent silences which served them so well in the intervals of eager and enchanted talk . Jessie sat back in the cab , her hand in Mark 's , and stared as they passed at the monument to the Fighting Sixty-ninth in The First World War . New York 's Own Regiment , she thought , with a quick sense of warm possessive affection , and then though she had been only a little girl at the time , she remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious Fighting Irish . She had seen that parade , and many another too , from the Fifth Avenue windows of her mother 's hairdresser ; and so deep runs the love of a parade in the born New Yorker 's heart that Jessie like the rest had gone through life remembering and cherishing the memories of distinct parades . . . indeed , she thought now , and suddenly said aloud to Mark , " That 's the only real memory I have of my father . I remember sitting with somebody in a grandstand when he was marching in the Saint Patrick 's Day Parade , and how excited and proud I was when he waved to me . I had a green coat and an ermine muff and bonnet . " " How old were you when he died ? " asked Mark . " Less than three . So of course I ca n't really remember him at all . What I have is not really a memory , just an impression of a big , red-faced , laughing , noisy man who gave off a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side with uproar and cigar smoke and parties and beer and people . Oddly enough , it was an absolutely different world from anything else that ever touched my mother , but I think she enjoyed it whilep195it was going on . After he died she must have begun to shape up the next phase of her life very quickly , for I ca n't remember much about the in-between period until we fetched up in SixtysixthStreet . " " Everybody knew Mat Kernan , " said Mark . " In some ways he was better known than your mother . You must have a lot of relatives on his side too . " " Yes , but I 've never seen them . I think they must have broken with him when he married Mother  --  of course it was a terrible thing that he did , in their eyes . " " You were never baptized , " said Mark thoughtfully . " No , that 's just the point . I suppose there must have been a dreadful session when my mother refused to have me brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never recognizingthat I had even been born . " " Did n't her own family carry on just as much ? " " Well , it was altogether different . If Mother had n't been herself , and all of them so concentrated on helping her  --  you know , Mark , such people can be quite extraordinary . One could n't generalize  --  but I know dozens of famous people whose backgrounds were just like my mother 's , and who have troops of those nice folksy relatives tucked away like that . " " Sure . And not only that special breed either . " He laughed . " I know . But here there are so many more of that kind  --  of us . And the relationship is quite remarkable . You 'd expect more of such tribes to try to hitch onto the successful one 's wagon , and some do . But more often they 're just nice easy-going people who take Max 's or Sadie 's success for granted . . . are n't too impressed . . . and never do anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sisters , of course --  " " They were like that . They really loved her , so they left her alone and left it to her to keep in touch with them . She did , too , until they died . " " Still , I should have thought her marrying Kernan --  " " But , you see , " said Jessie , smiling at the sight of a pinwheel and balloon vendor standing by the Park exactly where she could remember him or his counterpart from her childhood , " with them the religious thing was not so strong . They had the oldfashionedbackground and they brought the candlesticks and all that to the United States when they came here , but they were all women . And that made the difference . To those people a family is scarcely a family without a husband and father , thep196whole ritual and tradition revolves around him . That 's really all I know about the subject and I regret it very much . I would love to know more  --  but I 've never had an opportunity to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , with a sad shadow crossing her face , " who would draw a lot of strength out of their own roots  --  if they had never been cut off from them . " She sighed . " And you ca n't go back and do an artificial graft years later , either . " " No , I suppose you 're right , " said Mark . " But it 's really fantastic if you stop to think that you have cousins and nephews and relatives all over the place , whom you have never seen . " " Fantastic , " she said , " but you 'd be amazed to realize how many people are in the same situation . I do n't know if it 's true of the other great cities of the world , but it certainly is here . If I really begin wondering about it it makes me feel like the telephone company  --  with invisible connections in obscure little homes all over Brooklyn , the Bronx , and Queens  --  not to mention Manhattan itself . I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen him in my life . " " Then how do you know him ? " " Only by telephone . When my mother died he called me up . I remember how horrified I was when they told me that some detective from the Homicide Squad was calling , and he just said he was so sorry about her , and wanted to tell me so . I was terribly touched . " They were standing now on the steps of the Plaza , enjoying for a moment the almost foolishly bewitching charm of the sight before them . Only yesterday it had cast its spell over Jessie as she stood in her chemise waiting for Miss Flora to bring her fittings ; but now with Mark Dwyer beside her , the great ornate portico , the statues , the stiffly planted flower-beds , the victorias and hansoms with their scampish coachmen and pathetic horses , the glittering towers across the way , the Park smiling elegantly at their left , made Jessie feel even more bewildered , more disembodied , yet more certain of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt before . " We will lunch at one of those nice window tables in the Cafe , " said Mark , turning to escort her up the steps ; and walking beside him Jessie felt as if she were stepping back into that strangest , most frightening of all the strange and frightening passages of her youth . But this time , and she laughed aloud at the thought , she had the most attractive and desirable beau of any girl at the party . EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE 197 " I SUPPOSE , " said Mark that evening as they were bowlingdown the East River Drive on their way to join the Lees , " we are going to see everybody who is anybody and all that . " " Every pushing , shoving , scrabbling one of them , " replied Jessie . She looked out the window of the cab and said , gesturing with her head , " I 'd so much rather be doing that . Would n't you ? " Mark leaned over and looked past her at a sand barge tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bargemanwas sitting outside his little deck-house , his feet on a barrel , smoking his pipe . A woman sat nearby peeling potatoes into a pot in her lap . Smoke plumed from the crooked tin stovepipe behind them . A dirty white mongrel trotted up and down the deck . " I bet she 's got corned beef simmering on the stove inside there , " said Mark . " And presently she 'll go and put those potatoes and the cabbage in with it , and they 'll have beer and some --  " " Have a heart . I 'm drooling . And we 'll be exactly where it 's the thing to be . My God . " " I 've always wanted to live on a barge like that . " " Just your dish , darling . Who do you suppose we 'll see tonight ? " " Why do you care ? " Mark shrugged . " Faces , they have , " said Jessie . " All kinds of faces , and the different kinds of natures that go with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they get their names in tomorrow'sgossip columns they 'll be happy . " " Well , they need to get that question answered , " said Mark . The cheap , sad , jangling question of the up-and-up , he thought , quoting , " How 'm I doin ' ? ' " " And the odd thing , " said Jessie , " is that a great many of them are hard-working and very successful at what they do . Accomplished and important in their way , especially compared to a cipher like me . " " Oh , it 's the same everywhere , " said Mark.  | " I know . But I think it has a special , pitiful garishness here . " " Naturally . Between the way it always was on Broadway and the way the rest of the world is now . But somehow you feel cosier about it over a sawdust sausage in the Savoy Grill . " They were met at the restaurant as the door swung open by the flavor of extra festivity which permeated this place on occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwyer , admiring welcome surrounded Jessie . She thought , following her old friend Mac up the stairs , that no matterhow cynically one might grasp the motives by which an establishment like this must be run , it remained for its old habitues one of the pleasantest places in the world . Sam Lee rose from the table to welcome them and Helen , looking her loveliest , held up a superbly jewelled hand to Mark Dwyer . " Hall and Preston are going to be late , " she said , " but Sam is ordering for them and they 'll have to like it . " Jessie had not glanced at all about the room as she took her place , but she knew perfectly well who was there . She was seated with her back towards a party of four to whom she had nodded on her way in , friends of Brandon 's whom she scarcely ever saw . " I 'm so glad to see you ! " she said to Sam Lee , patting his hand . " You old philoprogenitor . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at his wife . " Pretty fine , no ? " " I was startled at first . But --  " " I 'm tickled pink . I hope to God it 's a girl . " " Oh , you 'll be just as happy with another boy . You 're such a darling , Sam . " Jessie spoke impulsively , with a rich sense of warmth and sincerity about Sam and Helen Lee , intensified for the moment by the contrast between them and the other personalitieswith whom the room was crowded . Henry Greenberg was holding forth at his Staynmtisch in his special corner , and though she could have wished to be dining elsewhere , it would have made no difference ; Greenberg would know already that she had spent most of her time with Mark Dwyer since Monday night . Speaking to Sam , she gave a sudden quick giggle . " What 's up ? " he asked . " Nothing . I was just thinking of the contrast between you and him . Between your farm and that high-class house of procurementhe runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and caught her eye and she bowed gaily to him and Marge and their party , George and Maureen Stillman and the Irving Laskins , on from Hollywood . As she greeted and dismissed them all in one quick motion , Jessie could not escape the certainty that some quarter of a milliondollars in platinum-colored mink and matched emeralds , black pearls , and grape-sized diamonds had come temporarily to roost on the much-profaned body of Dorette Laskin ; that the money would presently pass on to another , even more venal transient proprietrix ; and that as it moved its stench would intensify , like the stink picked up by a slow summer wind on its way through a particularly noisome slum . And to cap the impression as she turned away , she observed the dark , rat-sharp face of Jack Spanier entering the room and pausing to speak to the Greenberg party in corroboration of the common knowledge of his past involvements , all disreputable , with Laskin financially , with Dorette sexually , and with Henry Greenberg in the evil subtleties of mutual blackmail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jessie 's shoulder , directingaway a waiter with oysters , " non Pella Signora . " He placed before her a cup of her favorite Creme Senegale , a magnificent curry soup which Jessie liked hot instead of iced as it was usually served here ; and for each person at the table there appeared the precise small consideration for his personal taste which made him feel like a well-petted cat . Buttered hot gluten toast for Helen , English pepper sauce for Sam , another bourbon old-fashioned for Mark Dwyer , celery for Jessie , all effected with smooth , smiling speed and deference to the conversation , since nothing was offered or suggested which would distract a person 's attention . " This girl-friend of yours is a little crazy , " Mark was saying to Helen Lee . " Did you know she spent her mornings playing with alley-cats and scraping up acquaintances on Second Avenue ? " " Why of course , " said Helen , circling the room with her eye and passing on the collective impression to Mark . " Would n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Helen and Mark were talking about her , and warm with the knowledge that she would fare well between them , Jessie turned back to Sam Lee who was watching the progression of Jack Spanier across the room . " The only reason I can imagine for anyone 's speaking to him , " said Sam , " is what he must have on them . Thank God he has nothing on me . Look at that poor girl with Joe Kincaid  --  " and as Spanier turned then to look straight at Sam 's table and make what he could of its uncompleted party , Sam Lee stared back without recognition , and began to eat his oysters . " I 'm afraid I am going to have to do something about him and my niece , " said Jessie , almost whispering . " I tried to throw the fear of God into her the other day , but --  " Sam Lee shrugged , glanced swiftly at Mark Dwyer , and then again at Jessie . " Let ' em stew in their juice , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rewarding . " Jessie laughed , feeling a sense of childlike pleasure in the approval of Sam and Helen Lee for Mark Dwyer and for whateverMark and Jessie might make of the few days of possible happiness that had fallen their way . She felt as if Sam had deliberately marked out a small safe province for her , over which he would stand guard in any way that he might consider necessary . She gave him a look of poignant appreciation . She thought him the most lovable man she knew , particularly dear to her because of his intense devotion to Helen . Jessie loved his kind , blue-shaved , spectacled face , his wise and sentimental brown eyes , his intellectual head , his big generous ears , his deep voice which sometimes suggested the singsong echo of his early boyhood . Sam 's rise from the almost classic origin of the lower East Side had long since merged into the legend of American success , but he could and sometimes did , to this day , make tangibly vivid the cruel and bitter life of hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Poor Norman , " he said , thinking of Norman Feiner who was known to his colleagues as the worst and most pitiful firstnightsufferer of them all . " He must be about crazy by now . " " Renee slips luminal into him all day when this is going on , " said Jessie , " and naively supposes that Norman does n't know it . Ah , here are Hall and Preston . " " I 'm so sorry , Helen , " said Hall Peters as she dropped into the chair which Mark Dwyer had risen to draw out for her . " Hello , Sam . Jessie , that 's the most beautiful dress I ever saw . " " Six years old , " said Jessie , " but thank you . How are you , Preston ? " The newcomer turned his blank , shocked face from Mark Dwyer with whom he had been shaking hands , to give Jessie a meaningless , mechanical smile . " He 's probably as sick as a pup , " said Hall Peters , " afterp201listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I would n't blame him . " " Well , " said Sam Lee mildly , " if you will write the number one best-seller . . . " " Balls , " said Hall Peters . " In three months I 'll be back on my shelf and left there to rot until the next time something about me is news . I should tell you ! " They all laughed , shrugging at their mutual experience of fame and its ephemeral importunities . Shaw sat silent and almost immobile , already at his second drink and eating nothing . The plates were being changed and the remainder of the dinner served all at once as Sam Lee had orderedit ; thick cuts of prime roast beef , hashed brown potatoes , and coffee in large cups with cream and sugar . " It may not be elegant , " said Helen of the coffee served in this way , " but Sam --  " " Sam takes his coffee seriously , " said Jessie . " And why not ? " Sam shook his head at the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for me . " " Sam ! " exclaimed Hall Peters . " Why bother to order good beef if you 're going to treat it like pot roast ? " " I ca n't help it , " said Sam , with comical pathos . " It 's the way you 're brought up . We hardly ever had any meat but what we had was kosher --  " " I know , " said Hall . " Salted to death and all the life cooked out of it . " " It 's too bad you never had my Grandma 's boiled beef with farfel . My God , if I knew where to get the same thing now --  " " Darling , ca n't you learn ? " asked Jessie of Helen . " You 'd be so surprised , " said Helen . " It 's his memories that he keeps on tasting , not his Grandma 's cooking . " " Listen , " said Sam . " You do n't know what a plate of good soup or a cup of coffee really mean unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldog is on the street , one or two in the morning and ten below zero and you have n't had a meal since breakfast and little enough of that . " " It was the same when I was a kid , " said Mark Dwyer . " In lots of ways . " " Well , " asked Sam , " and was n't the coffee the most important thing in the whole damn world ? " Mark nodded solemnly . " I remember , " said Sam , lighting his cigar , " I remember that big grey agate coffee pot on the back of Grandma 's stove , down in the kitchen in Allen Street . I used to sleep in the kitchen when I finally got to bed , but most of the night some of us were in there sitting around the table and schmoozing and drinking coffee , we called it ' caw fee ' . That kitchen had the only stove in the flat , no wonder we all squeezed in there . " " Who were ' we ' ? " asked Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week to tell you , " said Sam . " A lot of mischpocheh , aunts and nieces and Grandma . And they 'd all come in from work late at night and sit there in that steamy little kitchen with rags and papers stuffed in the cracks of the windows . They 'd sit around waiting for the coffee to boil and quarrel their heads off . I can smell it and hear it still . Grandma 's coffee could n't have been as good as I think it was because she could never have afforded to make it as strong as it needs to be to be good . But it tasted grand to us . They 'd all sit there holleringat each other in Yiddish and all of a sudden we 'd hear a hissing noise on the stove and somebody 'd yell , Gevalt , the coffee ! ' and jump to the stove and grab the pot just before it was about to boil over . Then somebody 'd put the pot on the table and Grandma 'd pour a few drops of cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 'd jump for the milk  --  it was about to boil over too . We always had boiled milk and maybe that was why the coffee tasted that way . " Jessie was listening with her chin in her hands , intent and captivated . Looking at her Mark Dwyer saw in the solemn and almost awestruck tension of her eyes and her taut mouth that this talk of Sam Lee 's was no matter of idle fascination for her , but that it was striking a chord somewhere in her own deep , perhaps originally submerged memory , a chord whose echo was identical . Mark saw too that while Jessie 's attention was entirelypreempted by Sam Lee , she was also deliberately not allowingher eyes to move and her glance to meet Mark 's . If she did , something would be said silently which neither would wish to say in the presence of any other person . Mark Dwyer set his face in a conscious mask , uncommunicative yet interested , but the current running between himself and Jessie Bourne must , he felt , convey its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee . " The way you 're drinking that coffee , " said Sam to Hall Peters , responding to the warm interest of his guests who were enchanted with his reminiscences , " the way you 're drinking coffee , black and no sugar , nobody 'd have touched it down atp203Grandma 's . We used to drink ours in glasses , thick , chipped , squatty glasses , no two ever alike . I suppose Grandma bought them off a pushcart or out of a barrel outside some store . The idea was to keep enough glasses in the house so we 'd each have one , full of coffee and boiled milk , and we 'd have a lump of sugar on the side . A big square lump , not these fancy flat ones . " He flipped over an elegantly wrapped lump of sugar , with the iron-gate trademark of the restaurant smartly engraved upon the paper . " We 'd hold the lump of sugar in our teeth , " said Sam , " or bite off a corner of it and take a mouthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sugar . My God , what on earth made me remember all this . We always sat crowded around the oilcloth , wearing sweaters and shawls , hunched up with our elbows on the table and holding our glass in both hands to warm us , and the lump of sugar in our teeth . We drank tea the same way , " he said , " Russian tea made off a tea brick , with lemon and the spoon sticking in your eye . . . " " Somebody , " said Jessie , her voice curiously plangent , " somebodysomewhere has the samovar that my grandmother brought when she came here . " " Of course , " said Sam , shrugging and matter-of-fact . " Some niece or cousin or somebody . And the candlesticks and a couple of priceless copper pots and probably a Turkish coffee-mill . Everybodybrought ' em . " He motioned for the check . " It makes everybody else 's background so flat by comparison , " said Hall Peters to Mark . " People like Sam are so full of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska  --  " she sighed . " We put garlic in our cooking too , " said Mark , at which Jessie gave him a swift glance of secret delight and Hall Peters stared completely uncomprehending . Mark Dwyer laughed , placing Jessie 's furs across her shoulders , and observing the small quiet smile that she was exchanging with Helen Lee . He noted too the few words which Giglio addressed to Jessie as he bowed the party away from the table , very correctly meeting the conventions of the superior maitre d'hotel , and also conveying that deep simple Italian wisdom in which utter realism merges with sentimental warmth , to produce such a smile of pure affection as he was turning upon an old friend now . Making his way through the crowded room in the wake of the three women , Mark found himself involuntarily aware , as if from the tips of his nerves , of the astonishing , almost unbelievablediversity of obscure origins from which most of the couple of hundred persons about him had sprung , to merge here into a fluid sparkling mass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation of futility , yet nearly everybody in this room , with the passionate self-absorption of the arriviste , would consider his presence here tonight of pressing importance to himself and , he would probably say , to others also . Jessie bowed again to Brandon 's friends and murmured a greeting as she passed their table on her way out . They sat looking after her and her party , the women 's eyes resting appraisinglyon the tall , splendid form of Mark Dwyer in his uniform , the men bored . " Well , " said Nancy Rockwood , " there goes the sauce for Brandon . " " Would n't you ? " asked Denise Jones . She turned to her husband , a forty-four year old child named Willingdon C. P. F. Jones , and said , " Order me another cognac , Bill . " " You 've had three already , " said the gallant stroke of Brandon'swinning crew . " And I 'll have three more if I like , " said his wife . " She 's all right , " said Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy Rockwood nastily , but she and Denise both laughed . " Darling , " she said to Denise , " would n't it be a scream if that snooty bitch stubbed her toe on that hunk of brass ? " Willingdon C. P. F. Jones winced visibly . He had never grown used to such language as used by his own wife and all her friends . He said rather pompously , " I do n't think Jessie Bourne deserves to be called a name like that . Of course Bran should n't have married her , but --  " " He did , and I 've always been sorry for him , " said Rockwood . " Me too , " said his wife . " I ca n't stand that woman . " " Why ? " asked Denise Jones , as if she could not imagine why . " She 's so damn superior . " Nancy Rockwood blew a long chute of smoke from her narrow nostrils and her hard mouth and said , " Who the hell does she think she is ? If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'd have chucked it if I 'd been her , " said Denise , who knew something too much of Brandon Bourne . " I do n't like her either , though . I know what you mean , Nance . I was in school with her . Considering that she 's really a nobody that manner of hers is a hell of a nerve . "  | " Oh , she probably does it to hide something , " said Gerald Rockwood indifferently . " Well , you know how she runs that apartment of theirs . My God , it 's so damn perfect it gives me the jitters . And she 's so precise and  --  and what do you call it --  " " Exacting , " said Nancy Rockwood , who was more intelligentthan Denise . " She is . And cold as a fish . " " Nuts , " said Gerald Rockwood unexpectedly . " When you women start showing what you know about other women you make me snort . That gal is as hot as a stove . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hatred . " Who 's giving this party , anyway ? " " Well , she 's been a rotten wife for poor Brandon , " said Nancy . " Stiff and selfish as they come , I bet you . If I had to live the way she lays it down , I 'd have slept around more than he has . " " She used to be worse than she is now , " said Denise Jones , in the manner of one who knew from experience what she was talking about . " Jealous as hell . " " I remember , " said Nancy . " And after she got over being that way , she got this way . So goddam high-asted I do n't see how he stays in the house with her . " " Well , he does n't  --  much . " They all laughed . " I 'd still love to see her fall flat on her pan over this , " said Nancy Rockwood , indicating the doorway through which Jessie had passed with Mark Dwyer . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They ordered more drinks . In the theatre Mark and Jessie found themselves in the seats which Norman Feiner had given to Mark , separate from the rest of their party . They arrived as the house lights were going down . Jessie sighed with relief that they were to be spared momentarilythe ordeal of being scrutinized , tabulated , and forced to exchange greetings with people who measured their smiles and bows , in temperature and readiness , by the celebrity of the recipients . She felt a curious sense of contrariness ; just because a good many hundreds of persons considered this the most desirable of all places to be on this particular evening , she wanted to whisper to Mark , " Let 's slip out and go home quickly before the curtain goes up . " To her surprise he turned his head and looked at her in the nearly complete dark as if she had spoken aloud . He lifted his eyebrows as a way of saying , " What can we do , we are trapped now . " They exchanged a glance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having thus established its warmth and gentleness , changed gradually into a statement of clear , wholly requited passion . As he sat with his arms folded , Mark placed the fingers of his left hand , hidden beneath his right sleeve , in the curve of Jessie 's left arm , pressing the delicate skin inside the bend of her elbow to find the strong , accelerating pulse . They sat with their heads stiffly poised , staring straight at the stage , though Jessie would later be able to recall nothing beyond an intense excitement distortedly unrelated to the play upon which the curtain was now going up . " MARK , " she said , when the first act was ending . She spoke close to his ear in the unsibilant whisper which does not carry beyond its intended bounds . " Mark , how on earth are we to get through the rest of this ? " She had in mind as much the great disappointment of the play as their mood , which was grotesquely out of tune with it . The lights went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the deep warmth of his eyes . She could say anything , she saw , and no matter how she phrased it he would supply what she might omit or conceal . " I 'm afraid Norman was right , " he said , also in a dull whisper . " But I hoped not . " " I always expect so much of him and --  " " Particularly in this character of Jim Tilford . After all  --  he 's just Norman 's own convictions  --  with a very ingenious plot to set them off . This weaving between the front and the people at home ought to come off damn well . " " And it has no impact at all , " said Jessie . " Or is it us ? " Mark arched his eyebrows . " We 'll probably know better in the next act , " he said . " But something tells me that A Street in the Village of Bastogne ' is going to strike this bunch of cannibals like nothing but last week 's news . "  |p207Jessie  nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the usual first-night savages , was restless , bored , and typically ahead of the general public who would wait only to get their boys home before slamming shut the doors of their minds on the war and every shade of its meaning . " Wherever the fault lies , it 's damn tough on Norman , " said Mark , and Jessie felt the same , but she felt also a ripple of regret and some sense of guilt that her own tense preoccupation with Mark Dwyer was making her the poorest possible spectator at the play . She had so much wanted it to be a success , and she felt now as if she were wilfully withholding something that it was her part to contribute . " But I ca n't help it , " she smiled at Mark , lowering her eyes , and then , as the smooth , tough , arrogant crowd poured into the aisles , combing through the knots and pairs of men and women with bold , calculating stares , she said , " You go on out and smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I , " he said , stretching his legs under the vacant chair in front of him . He observed that Jessie was already involved in the multifacetedsmall necessity of balancing her attention between him and the greetings of acquaintances whom it would be an error to ignore . She was unwillingly playing the evening 's game , but having begun it , she could not withdraw and make herself conspicuousby proving to be more interested in Mark Dwyer than in the empty roundabout of seeing and being seen . " Hello , Althea , " he heard her say with a warm smile to a great , slow-moving mass which he discerned with surprise to be a woman . And he was more surprised to see that Jessie exchanged a wink with the small eye in the vast pink face , as the monolith moved past her up the aisle . " My God , " murmured Mark . " One of my very best friends , " said Jessie , " and I 'm not kidding . You ought to hear her sound off about these charming occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because some chappieinvited her . " He turned his head just enough to see that Althea Crowe was accompanied by a rail-thin mouse of a faded , middle-aged woman . " Business , " said Jessie . " She 's just as cynical about it as she looks . That woman with her is Barbara Straughn  --  you know , the widow of Desmond Straughn . When he was writing all those hits of his , these people used to flock around him and Barbara and lick the shine off their boots . Now Althea looks out for Barbara when all her so-called friends have forgotten her . " " Give me the stockyards any time , " said Mark . " Of course . That 's what I mean . " " You 'd think to hear us talk , " said Mark , " that there is n't a decent human being under this roof . " " Oh , there are lots , " said Jessie . She laughed shortly , rather a bitter small laugh , and added , " Perhaps much decenter than we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? I may let myself lash out now and then , but I try not to forget my mirror while I 'm doing it . Have you ever selected some single , small , special motive of your own , like one particular grape out of a cluster , and deliberately forced yourself to follow every shade and quiver of its way with you , from beginning to end ? " " Look here , " said Mark , " are you getting any special pleasureout of this ? " He smiled , but there was a flicker of something like pain , or it might be irritation , between the abrupt spacing of his heavy brows . Jessie felt troubled and uncomfortable , almostappalled to find that her contrary wish to be away from here had suddenly grown much stronger and in the growing , had momentarily turned her hard against Mark . She had a quick , disagreeable instant of hating herself and him too and anybody else whose identity crossed her mind , perhaps a natural reaction in the midst of so many flashing and insistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind I will have a cigarette after all , " and Jessie murmured " Of course . " He rose from his chair and she turned upon him a smileof extreme , meaningless cordiality . She was relieved that theirplaces upon the aisle would make it unnecessary for him todisturb anybody else when he returned , and she bent her headover the program in her hands as if the names of the stagemanagers and technicians , the house staff , and the firms whohad made the scenery , costumes , and accessories were keys tothe most critically important store of information that she wouldever wish to acquire . She stared blankly at the pages , thinking of the terrible phenomenon of a society which collectively professedthe keenest admiration and affection for Norman Feiner , and at the same time could watch with absolute relish and perverseexcitement while he endured the humiliation of a public failure . Why , she thought , as she watched Alexander Lowden escorthis wife back to their places with false , courtly pomposity , dop209they not turn their diseased attentions towards that ? She knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-in-law must be sitting with Isabel Allen , in seats that he could not properly afford , but which he had surely been browbeateninto buying ; and indeed it was just then that Mark Dwyer returned to his place to tell her so , with a short laugh as he saw the Lowdens across the aisle . " You never saw such a catfight , " said Mark of the hystericalcrush in the lobby . " Everybody but Adam 's off ox is here , making sure that all the others know it . And your friend there , " he whispered , indicating Serena Lowden with his eyebrows , " is a great lady . " Jessie imagined , because she knew it so well , the calm proud stare with which Serena Lowden had reduced the presence of Isabel Allen in the crowd to the status of an insect , buzzing outside a screened window . Yet on the other hand , she reflected , if one were to see Isabel Allen in her own peculiar milieu , as hostess of one of her chic , shrewdly devised cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some charm . Her beauty was inarguable , beyond competition ; but again , Jessie remembered having seen it crumble into comparative trash against the cool , sad nobility of faces like Serena Lowden 's . Jessie moved her shouldersin something more delicate than a shrug of dismissal and whispered , " You will see , Serena will go home after the theatre and Alec will show up alone at the party and make a fool of himselfwatching Van with Isabel . " " Isabel ? " breathed Mark . " At Bucky Whitelaw 's ? Why ? " Jessie raised her eyebrows . " Something with Phyllis , " she murmured . " She likes her . " And Mark thought , as Jessie had supposed he would , that a liking between two such women as Phyllis Whitelaw and Isabel Allen would most probably have come about through the complexitiesof what he was mentally terming a dry shave for some poor bastard . " And yet , " said Jessie , reading his mind , " Phyllis is not a bad woman . " " Not exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are travelling by . " His low chuckle cleared the air and restored for Jessie her calm which had been so disagreeably shaken . Then the lights went down and in the darkness , completely overriding her malaise , her sense of troubled disorientation , Mark took her left hand and wove its supple fingers lightly between his own , pressing the dry , silky warmth of his palm against hers . She was taken by surprise almost as keen and delicious as if she had been a young girl , but there followed immediately a surge of intense physical joy in his touch which she knew to be anything but young . She bent her head , lowering her eyes from the gloomy , unconvincingspectacle on the stage , and pressing tightly Mark 's fingers still entwined with her own . The program in her lap slid to the floor , and she sat motionless as Mark bent down , not to pick it up , but to place his lips hard in the palm of her hand , and for one bold instant to force his teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he sat back very straight , and with an odd brisk finality he laid her left hand aside , across the right one holding the handbag in her lap . Jessie swallowed in the effort to clear her ears , which seemed to her to be ringing with some great load of sound , though she knew when she looked at the stage that there was nothing to hear since the characters were at this moment engaged in a pantomime of crawling with their guns through deep snow . She drew a long breath , as deeply as she could fill her lungs , and tried like Mark beside her , to keep her attention on the stage . When the play was over , Jessie said , " Usually I am the first one out , but --  " " Of course not , " said Mark . Like her , he was applauding heartily ; so were many of the audience , Norman Feiner 's friends and the hard-working theatre professionals who rallied for a loyal moment out of the grim knowledge that this could happen to any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The critics , their bored faces set and sour , had slid out before the final curtain . And now the showoff spectators began to get to their feet , the fat-jowled balding men who were impatient to be outside where they could light their cigars , and their women instantlyidentifiable . Some were wives , with complicated arrangements of curled grey hair and faces that were curious mixtures of flint and slop , hard in surface expression and in their greedy eyes , but puddles of sagging over-massaged tissue beneath . Or the women were dolls or babes whose badge of investiture was the most beautiful shade of dyed hair that they could possibly achieve , worn in unbelievable lacquered mountings and turnings known as the upsweep , or in great cascades and falls whose vulgaritywas only exceeded by the complacency with which it was displayed . But all the women escorted by all the loud and terriblemen were uniformly sheltered from the zephyrs of a mildp211October night by fur capes and wraps and stoles of the most exaggerated cost ; they were all studded with supreme bad taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bulky jewelry ; and they all inched up the aisle past Jessie and Mark , clutching the trophies of their hunting in predatory fingers tipped by glittering blood-red claws . Therese Street and Mart Ferguson were taking a curtain call alone , gravely bowing to the charitable applause which they accepted for the personal tribute that it was . They had worked beyond ordinary exhaustion , their faces beneath their make-up were bone-white , their hands quiet with the stillness which Jessie could see to be stark control . She felt desperately sorry for them , not because the play was a failure  --  that was the natural hazard of their profession  --  but because she knew that they really loved Norman Feiner and had only gone through with this crushing experience for his sake , meanwhile refusing offers of other plays which would p. obably have been successes . She thought now of her own words when she reminded Mark that there were indeed good and decent people in this theatre tonight . " Do you think we have to go backstage ? " asked Mark , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and begin to move . Jessie sighed . " I told Helen we would meet them there . But it will be --  " " I know . " " Why do n't we wait in the alley ? We will see Norman and all the others at the party , and they would probably be grateful to us for not going back now . " " They would probably be more grateful if Buck would call the party off . " " So would I , " said Jessie quickly . She moved lightly ahead of Mark and through a row of empty seats , heading for a side exit which opened on the alley by the stage door . Mark followed her , his eyes resting with appreciation on her slender figure , more elegant in the stiff black and gold lame gown which she had said was six years old , than that of any other woman in sight . They stepped into the dark alley , which Mark was surprised to find quite empty . Evidently nobody was yet ready to leave the theatre from the stage door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a shuffling , raucous , fluid mob who had come to watch the celebrities at the first night . Just now the horde were pitching about and clawing one another in their struggle to get at some motion-picture star who would almost find the clothes ripped from her back by the time she had fought her way across the pavement to her motor . " Some more of our charming mores , " said Jessie , turning her back upon the spectacle . Mark had paid no attention . He put out his hand and drew her close to the wall , under the shadow of the balcony fire escape . " My dear , " he said , as if with difficulty . " Look at me . " She moved her head uneasily and murmured , " Oh , that uniform is so conspicuous . " " When my back is turned , " he said , with a glance towards the melee in the street , " I look like any other G I. " She shook her head again as he took her in his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that this was a preposterous , a dreadful place to find herself being kissed with commanding strength and passion . She felt the rare and lovely sensation of his lifting her outside the limits of her will , though she kept her elbows quite primly at her sides while he shielded her from the sight of the wild strangers in the street . When her lips were free she bent her head until her forehead rested on his chest , and she heard herself breathe , " Oh Mark . . . my ... I ... " " I know , " he said . His voice was thick . " I too . " They turned and stood waiting , lifting their faces to the gritty gasoline-laden air which hung over the echoing alley . Dereliction is the fate of great houses like the Whitelaw palace on upper Fifth Avenue , and tonight it seemed to Jessie that the vast rooms disdained the strange company rattling about in them as old Mrs. Dominick Whitelaw herself would have done had she come back to earth . The house was destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a syndicate of apartmenthousebuilders and it would be torn down as soon as new buildingbecame possible . Meanwhile it was used sporadically , casually , and inelegantly by Bucky and Phyllis Whitelaw in their passages between half a dozen residences and resorts to which their restless , rootless variations of mood propelled them . Bucky Whitelaw was rich enough to consider the fantastic town house , once called the masterpiece of Stanford White , a joke rather than a headache ; he had no love for it and doubted whether any of his family had ever had . The house had been intrinsic to the power pattern , the only imaginable setting for the monstrous twelve-course dinners , the solemn upholstered receptions , thep213coldly magnificent balls , with which the stamp of multimillions had come down upon Society from its origin in the jungles of railroads , coal , oil , and the bloody battles of the incipient Steel Corporation . And now in a pair of imposingly overfurnished drawingrooms ( the ballroom floor had been shut up for years ) a hundredor more of the new elect of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they were intentupon themselves alone , whether in actual self-concentration or in the mirrors of other personalities . The background of carved seventeenth-century panelling , bloated tapestries , forbidding Jacobeanchairs , gimp , gilt , crimson damask and Brobdingnagian chandeliers made no more and no less impression upon them than the mirrored and all-shades-of-white Park Avenue room where they might find themselves tomorrow night or the Hollywood swimming-pool where they might be next week . Phyllis Whitelaw with her perverse affectation of wilful vulgarity and hardness , her cadaverously pale face , her lank dark hair , her invariable black sheathlike gown , her sullen manner , was a bizarre mistress for this incredible house . Jessie wondered why the Whitelaws used it at all , but she knew too that the answer lay in Phyllis 's twisted , hostile personality . She had a sharp taste for distorting her heredity and its accoutrements to the roughest crudities of the contemporary world . She used the Whitelaw house for this purpose , dismissing any thought of running it as its style and size demanded . She kept most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the assembling of a staff of servants such as the place required . She could never have found them anyway , she shrugged , and thank God for that . When she gave a party like this she called in enough caterer 's help to leave her feeling less responsible for the pleasure of her guests than a total stranger . " What 's the use ? " she drawled , lounging with the inevitablecigarette and highball on a couch in the gloomy library . " We 're hardly ever here and the only kind of party I can stand is where nobody gives a damn . " Moving away from the dark small huddle of people around Phyllis , whence rose the aroma of sycophancy like mist over a bog , Jessie felt like a small child minding its manners for having sought out the hostess to bid her good evening . Phyllis 's attitude conveyed that any such person was far queerer than herself who by normal standards should have been standing in the centre hall greeting her guests at the top of the stairs  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie . " Poor Norman , how that play stinks . . . " Henry Greenberg made a remark , intended to be ruefully humorous , to the effect that Bucky would find his losses the most malodorous part of the disappointment ; and as she left the room Jessie found herself marvelling as she had before , at the cheapness of the people to whom Oliver Whitelaw had fled in his headlong rush to escape . But now as she saw him standing in the foyer between the drawing-rooms , quiet , pleasant , and in spite of himself a natural complement to the exaggerated setting , she realized that he was as helpless as Gulliver to free himself of the myriad threads which entangled him in his origin . In startlingly different degree , thought Jessie , he was in the same situation as everybody else . And just then she saw Mark , from whom she had purposely wandered away , for she did not intend to spend the whole evening at his side , catching the eye of a waiter who was passing with a tray of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , she heard a quick , quiet word between them in a totally unintelligible tongue , and she saw a grin of thorough satisfaction cross Mark 's face as the waiter went on about his serving . Her curiosity was extreme , but later she found it no surprise for Mark to explain that the man was a boyhood friend , the son of Bohunk neighbors on the block . " He 's doing all right , too , " Mark reported with approval . " He 's one of the owners of that catering business . When they 're short of help these days he just pitches in himself . " The party was in its early , uneasy , unfocussed stage . The guests of honor had not arrived , and Jessie knew that they would put off the ominous moment as long as they could , for to mount the stairs or step out of the elevator into this shifting sand of collective emotions , whether good or bad , loyal or treacherous , pitying or malicious , would be a horrible experience for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of fluidity and motion involving some choice of company . The high , nervous , collective chatter of a large party was already under way . Preston Shaw came towards Jessie , saying , " Do n't you want a drink , Jess ? " She reflected , while answering with a smile that she did not want one , that there was probably nothing else the poor man could say which would make the slightest sense . She saw some people clustered in the rear drawing-room across the stair-hall ; the musical-comedy actress Eva Moorhead , laughingp215and incredibly pretty with her blonde curls and sparkling beaded dress ; her present beau Simon Trumbull who used his millions as fingers with which to probe into every provocative pie ; the theatrical producer Laurence Millstein whose vein of golden luck had never failed him yet ; Maureen Stillman sharing some uproariousjoke with Sam Lee . " Let 's go and see what it 's all about , " said Jessie , moving along with Preston Shaw . That knot of people were all friends of his who would absorb his tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to carry him on to another momentarily willing prop . The elevator door opened as Jessie went past , and among the chattering people who trooped through it she saw without surprise the chill face of her brother-in-law and the seemingly fragile , floating beauty of Isabel Allen . She exchanged greetings with them in casual monosyllables and as she had anticipated , the pair moved in the opposite direction from her . Isabel Allen was exquisitely dressed in azure chiffon , her figure so delicate , her breasts so perfect that it was only after a purely aesthetic response to their loveliness that one realized the cool wiliness with which they were displayed . There were by now several dozen of the most beautiful women in New York assembledhere , but Jessie realized again , as she had before , that none of them had the unbelievable natural perfection of this otherwise ordinary creature . Yet as Isabel Allen passed her , the lights from the massive chandelier slanting directly upon her face , Jessie saw that beneath the strangely stupid lilac eyes there lay uncharacteristicdark smudges ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that about the delicately pouting painted mouth there were indications of unmistakable tenseness , and that the smoothness of the doll-like brow was held there by sheer force of will . Such tale-telling was so unusual in this woman 's stock-intradeof a face that Jessie 's curiosity was aroused . Of course Isabel Allen must be bored to despair by Van Fielding , but she would never have allowed that irritation so to jeopardize her looks . After all , it was her business to be bored at times . And certainly she must be pleased to be at this party tonight ; it was of signal importance to her to be seen here . No , thought Jessie , she is in trouble , very bad trouble because in Isabel Allen 's world nothing short of violence and terror would be recognized as trouble . Mere debt or scandal or the loss of a desirable man would be commonplaces.  | And then something struck Jessie as queerly alarming . Perhapsbecause she was moving slowly across the great stair hall with Preston Shaw , and his tormented silence made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention roved . She knew that she was nodding and smiling and lightly greeting people as she passed them ; but her eyes , quite contrary to what she thought was interesting , were following Isabel Allen into the farther drawing-room , where Jessie had not yet been . There , half in profile and half in a great Florentine mirror , she saw AlexanderLowden , who had left his wife at home and arrived here even sooner than Jessie would have thought . She watched with sardonic amusement as he greeted Isabel Allen and Van Fielding , a touch of the patronizing in his manner . But then , in total amazement , Jessie saw the elevator door slide open again , and , behind the shoulders of the women who stepped out first , the narrow , nasty face of Jack Spanier . How on earth , she thought , could he have got here !  --  not even Phyllis with her tastes would invite him . But here he was . And with his cheap , loathsome way of combing a crowd , his eyes seeming to Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth through which the shark strains its prey , he took his time in deciding to whom to speak , just what he wanted to do . Meanwhile , and Jessie was to rememberlater the abnormal sensation of fear , almost a prickling of the scalp , with which she observed it , Spanier stood with his hands vulgarly in his trousers pockets , his shoulders even more vulgarly slouched against a lozenged oak panel , and with the coolest insolence he stared at the tableau of Isabel Allen and her two pretentious laughingstocks . But Jack Spanier was not laughing . A beautiful red-haired woman gave him the empty highvoicedgreeting of " Jack ! Darling ! " which he answered with a careless monosyllable , all the while keeping his rodent 's eyes upon the trio across the room . Except for its permanent eager-greedy alertness , his face was inscrutable . Jessie turned from the sight , swept by disgusted resentment that through Brandon Bourne she should be linked with that ignominious situation because his fool of a brother-in-law was part of it . Her outraged self-righteousness was short-lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was alone , going towards the rear drawing-room , when a voice said " Good evening , Jess , " and she found her right hand in that of a tall , heavy man who was looking at her with the lightest possible tinge of irony in his otherwise cordial smile ; or so she thought , for this was ap217person whom she would be profoundly relieved never to have to see . But life was not like that . " Good evening , Enoch , " she said . " How are you ? " ( Idiot , she damned herself . Is that the scope of your ingenuity ? ) " You 're looking lovely , " said Enoch Starr . " I saw you in the theatre . " He meant more precisely that he had watched her in the theatre , and Jessie regretted once again that she had ever embarkedupon this evening . She was glad that Mark Dwyer was not beside her at this moment , that she could not see him and did not know just where he was . " When did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she wanted to know but because of her haste to throw the unavoidable moment of conversation upon him and his concerns . Also because she did not want to see him at all , now or ever , she looked straight at him , laughing and consciously coloring her expression with raillery . She knew that they made a pleasant and decorative sight , just the sort of attractive and amusing accessory to such a party that hostesses hope to assemble . Inwardly Jessie felt as if her stomach were poised upon the edge of a cliff , sure to be dumped into space by any current of motion or air . " Oh , quite a while ago , " replied Starr . " End of July . I was stationed in Rome , you know . Over a year . " " I did n't know . " " Have you ever been in Rome ? " he asked . He fixed her glance as tightly and wickedly with his twinkling eye as if he had taken her wrist in his hand and twisted it . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely . She could have killed him without a qualm , yet why should he not tease her at this level of precise mischief , had she not laid herself open to it ? Actually he had always behaved impeccably , he was altogether a gentleman , not a stuffed and mounted specimen of gentleman either . Jessie hated him now with flashing fury , and in the same instant she knew that it was not he , a charming man , whom she hated , but herself . No , she thought , pursuing the sniping , devilish smalltalk with the same apparent skill as he , no it is not even myselfbecause of whom I am swamped by this flood of hatred , it is Brandon Bourne . " I used to fly down to Capri for week ends , " said Enoch Starr . " Of course Capri was a mess with all those G I trippers , but if you knew Capri well you could still set yourself up pretty nicely . " " And of course you knew Capri well , " said Jessie , deliber/ately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant to extinguish the small flame with one figurative stamp of her foot . " Of course . It 's not the same as it was nine years ago  --  but I had no trouble recognizing it . " " I 'm sure I would not have remembered it , " she said , bringingdown the foot . " Because I have such an impossibly bad memory , you know . " " I would n't know , " he said , changing his expression and turning suddenly impersonal , as a spectacularly beautiful , very young woman swept up to them , saying " Oh , there you are , darling ! I 've been looking  --  " She was English , and a stranger . " Jessie , I do n't think you have met my wife . Susanne  --  Mrs. Bourne  --  " Enoch Starr could not have been more utterly at ease , nor Jessie . " How do you do ? " she murmured , as Mrs. Starr babbled some triviality and it became miraculously simple within a moment to drift away from the couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joining Sam Lee , Jessie felt as if the whole concatenation of horrible feelings stirred together inside her in these past few minutes  --  actually much less than five minutes  --  was about to explode and make a spectacle of her . She was standing as it happened just at the foot of the great sweeping red-carpeted stairs with their gilded lacework balustrade , and the steps beckoned her upward with the sudden driving realization that she had to be alone . She would move slowly , she would melt so inconspicuously away from this floor of the house where the party was going on that nobody would notice her absence or care . There is a way of moving in a situation like this which is artful in its aimlessness , and Jessie had learned it very long ago . She began to slide up the staircase in this vague and cloudlikeway and as she moved a thought slashed through her mind which made of the party , moving and glittering and chattering below , an utter brawl . I do not care , she told herself contemptuously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cared for a great many years . But she realized with a fresh surge of hatred that if she should pause now and look behind her , she would see not alone Isabel Allen but a distinct number of other women on account of whom Brandon Bourne had seared and scarred her in the long past before she had lost the capacity to suffer . All these experiences had finally come together into one hideous legacy , the brutal and shameless invasion of her privacy . Everybody else , her reason argued , is in the same situation , such things are only un/endurable as they are unique , and this is commonplace . But her encounter with Enoch Starr had roused to fury the ancient smouldering accumulation of her bitterness . Such a thing , she knew , should never have happened to her , it was alien , alien as crime to every fibre of her nature . The episode was comparatively meaningless in this milieu where her life was lived . Yet to her it was the dregs of humiliation , and she had never been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of killing despair that to which Brandon Bourne had driven her . I must be alone , she thought now , I do not care what anybody thinks down there , I am suffocating behind this mask of blitheness , I must be alone . She moved on up the stairs . SHE knew that beyond Phyllis Whitelaw 's bathroom , modernizedbut still a fin de siecle parody of pink marble , enormous redundant fixtures , and rampant gold dolphins , there was a queer , old-fashioned dressing-room redolent of the days when magnificencewas measured by wasted space . Here were cupboards and dress-closets sixteen feet high , from whose racks maids must use an extension pole to reach down the gowns ; not a mere dressingtablestood against twenty feet of mirrored wall , but the whole wall was one continuous installation of built-in dressing-table , with such a superfluity of drawers and compartments that one would need a catalogue in order to put one 's hand on a particular object . Jessie knew that there could be nobody in this room exceptPhyllis 's maid , and she had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caterer 's women in the ladies ' coat-room . So she felt sure of not being intruded upon when she slipped into the dressing-room , far from the stream of the party downstairs . With a sagging sensation of relief she turned the heavy silver door-handle . But as the door moved open Jessie started back , realizing that there was someone in the dark room . She heard a sharp gasp , heard the stir of a person startled and frightened , and heard a high , artificially levelled voice cry out , " Who is it ? " The voice was the voice of a woman who had been weeping violently and who was able to speak now only because of panic-stricken urgency . " I 'm so sorry , " said Jessie quickly . " I thought  --  " and she stepped backwards , drawing shut the door . She felt a nerve jumpingin her temple . " Oh , " said the woman in the room . " Perhaps  --  I 'm afraid I am in your way . " " No , " said Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " But before she could entirely shut the door a light was switched on , and she was confronted by the sight of Phyllis 's friend Elizabeth Betts , tensely twisted to a sitting position on the edge of the long massage-table in the centre of the room , her thin hands clutchingthe edge of the pink leather mattress . Jessie could see that she had been lying face downwards and had sprung to this attitude upon being disturbed . She appeared in every visible way a wreck ; her blonde hair rough and rumpled , her face puffy , streaked , and shapeless  --  the woman known to the fashionable world as perhaps its most exquisite , flawlessly perfect ornament . She moved her left hand in a curiously clumsy beckoning motionand said heavily , " Come in . I recognized your voice . " " But , " said Jessie , miserably embarrassed . " But  --  I --  " " You had the same idea I had , " said Elizabeth Betts . " You had some reason for wanting to be alone in here . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which Jessie would never have believed her capable , nor her sudden profanity either , " how do I know you are n't worse off than I ? " Jessie stood nervously in the doorway , intent upon getting away . " Now that you 're here , " said Mrs. Betts , " I wish you 'd come in . " " But , " said Jessie again , helpless . " Do n't ask me why ! " said the distraught woman . " Come in and shut the door ! " Jessie stepped across the marble threshold and silently closed the door behind her . " If , " she said , trying to find a word that would not be intolerablybanal , " if there is anything --  " " Anything  --  ! " Elizabeth Betts repeated the word in a shrill , but muffled cry . " Anything you can do ? Can you put this whole drunken cockeyed shattered world together again ? Can you give me back my  --  my --  " Jessie had never felt so crushed by inadequacy , dumbness , and helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounterp221like this , a brutal shove into the arena of another woman 's naked hysteria . I have held too much aloof , she thought now , and kept my mouth shut and my head up with the same stubborn pride as Elizabeth here . And now it is only accident that she has blown up and I have been swept into the wreckage , it could perfectly well have been the other way about . Perhaps it has happened just because she is so nearly a stranger , perhaps there is a design about this into which I am supposed to fit for some reason involving me too . She stared at Elizabeth Betts , whose delicate nose was red , whose fastidious mouth hung slackly open , whose beautiful eyelidswere crudely swollen . My God , thought Jessie , my God , shall I keep on trying to think what to say or shall I let her sweep me into her maelstrom ? Perhaps that is what she needs , perhaps there is nothing else for me to do . And quite without further deliberating she asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not Philip , " said Elizabeth Betts , with a dry sob , " not exactly Philip . But  --  " she leaned forward and Jessie saw the veins come up in blue cords on the backs of her hands , " the mess . The thing that 's happened to my life . I ca n't stand it , " she said , in a sudden dead , leaden tone , far more distressing than the high pitch of hysteria . " I was n't made for it . I ca n't endure it . You have no idea  --  " she paused . " But , " said Jessie , groping too clumsily for some rationalization , " but you were not happy with Philip . " " Of course not , " said Elizabeth Betts . " Happy ? Who is happy ? In many ways I loathed him . But I had got used to that . And I had a life , do you see what I mean ?  --  there was shape and form so you knew where you were  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said in a sudden outcry , " not to know who you are ? Not to be anybody ? " She thrust her chin forward and stared with her ruined eyes at Jessie . " You know , Liz , " said Jessie , her voice as gentle and slow as she could make it , " nothing would make you believe it just now , but that could not be true of you . Not to be anybody . You always were somebody  --  much more of somebody than Philip . In every way . " " Oh  --  family perhaps , or money . But that 's not what I mean . Just because I was Elizabeth Vanderpool and inherited a lot of money , do you think anybody cares about that ? They do n't give a damn . I thought we had a lot of friends , Philip and I , I had always taken the  --  the  --  you know , the whole shape of existence for granted . And now I 'm just another divorced woman , a drug on a glutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . It 's too God-damn much trouble , " she said . " I know . I remember how I used to feel when people got divorced . You meant to be kind to Vera or Claire or whoever she was but it was such a nuisance to fit her in , pretty soon you just naturally sloughed her off . " Jessie sighed . She understood so thoroughly what Elizabeth was trying to explain that she could have begged her to leave it all unsaid ; but that was not what she felt that chance had brought her here to do . There was a strange element of compulsion here , it was as if she had been ordered to listen to all this and she was far too shrewd not to sense exactly why . She looked at Elizabeth Betts and tried , though it seemed grotesque , to give her a small smile of encouragement or sympathy ; and just then Elizabeth leaned forward sharply on the table again and cried , " Have you got any idea what life turns into when this happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said earlier that she thought she knew but now she only shook her head weakly . " Well I 'll tell you ! " cried Elizabeth . " If you had the happiest marriage in three continents I 'd tell you . But you have n't . Your marriage is as bad a mess as mine was  --  worse , some people say . " She gasped then at her own brutality , but she was far too gone to care . She watched Jessie look at her with utter calm and by her silence , agree . " I know all about it , " said Elizabeth Betts with rasping urgency in her voice which belied everything that Jessie had ever known about her before . " I know so much about it that I 'll go stark staring mad if I do n't tell somebody what I know . I know what it 's like to be so wretched in a marriage that you sit for years on end dreaming about what heaven it would be to get out of the damned thing . And then something happens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling wilderness that you 'd never even suspected before . It springs up around you like  --  like weeds . Big weeds , miles higher than your head . " She gestured with both hands . " But Liz , " said Jessie slowly . " People are devoted to you . Honestly they are . Not so very many of them , perhaps , but who has more than two or three real friends in the whole world any-way ? " " I know . The way you feel about Helen Lee . The way I feel about Phyllis . But that 's not what I mean . You ca n't hang your whole existence around some friend 's neck like the albatross . Andp223besides , " she added , in a queer , insinuating slide of tone , " did you ever hear of pride ? " " Oh  --  forgive me , " said Jessie . " That 's the kind of hell it is . Pride and keeping up a facade and having to tell all the lies and do all the contortions that that means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you did when you were a debutante . Do you remember that little slice of hell ? " " My God , " said Jessie . " And you were called the most beautiful and popular girl who ever came out in New York . " " I 've been called the most beautiful something or other all my life , " said Elizabeth , " but here we are tonight . And as for popularity  --  youknow what that is . Slaving to set up this idiot 's delight , this endless chain of something to do , somewhere to go , somebody to be seen with , until you have them all thinking you 're practically impossible to reach , and they all start galloping after you . That 's not even fun when you 're young , but it 's comparativelyeasy . Now I am forty-one years old and I tell you I 'm too tired ! I 'm too old ! I ca n't , " she wailed , bursting into a torrent of sobs and flinging herself face down on the table again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ! " She wept wildly . Jessie sat rigid , appalled to horrified silence . Once she looked nervously about the room , as if a glass of water or some aromatic spirits could be of help to Elizabeth , and then she leaned back limply in the low slipper-chair , resigned that there was nothing whatever that she could do . To go and put her arm around the shattered woman on the table and make the motions and speak the words of overt sympathy would be a mistake . Elizabeth Betts even in this dreadful condition was not a woman who invited such demonstrations , and Jessie was not one who could give them , to anyone short of the most intimate possible friend  --  to no one , in fact , except Helen Lee . And Jessie knew well that it was precisely because they were not intimate friends that Elizabeth Betts had burst this dam tonight . Jessie sat quite still , once raising her eyes and meeting in the mirror-lined room uncountable multiplications of the wretched tableau made by the sobbing woman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes dark with distress , shrunken together on the small chair . There was a long silence , during which Elizabeth Betts ' sobs gradually faded , and finally subsided into deep , intermittent gasps . At last she raised her rumpled head , looked at Jessie , and said in a low , very controlled voice , " So you see what it is . If I were like a lot of women we know , with a profession or a job to keep me busy , or a family to keep me company  --  but this way I am honestly afraid I shall go mad . I was n't prepared for my life to turn into this , nothing had ever led me to expect it . The mere question of men ! " She made a dreadful grimace as if she had tasted aloes . " You can spell that one out for yourself . Would you pay off for any wretched dinner and evening at the theatre ? Or let your friends ' husbands  --  and by the way they are mostly swine  --  think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be driven to combing through all the crackpots and homos who have presentable clothes , just for somebody to take you somewhereor fill a place at a dinner table ? And if you could n't endure any of that , then where are you ? Back on the mercy of all the married friends you had before , who think an extra woman a visitation of the devil and I 've thought so many a time myself . So then you turn to the other women who are in the same boat as you , and could you spend your evenings dining cosily and playing a little quiet gin with them ? My God ! " cried Elizabeth Betts , driving her jewelled fingers into the wreckage of her lovely hair and shoving it back from her temples . Jessie had nothing to say , she was still sitting humped uncharacteristicallyin the least possible amount of space on the seat of her chair , with her hands clasped tightly around one knee . " That God damn book ! " said Elizabeth Betts , gritting her teeth . " That engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staring and staring --  " " But Liz ! " Jessie found herself interrupting . " You are alwaysinvited somewhere . We meet you everywhere we go . " " And what do you think is involved in that ? " replied Elizabeth . " Effort and planning and effort and coping and effort and  --  there it is . Entertaining without a host  --  the most nerverackingdamned ordeal . Keeping yourself in circulation . Plotting and thinking and wondering and twisting through a needle 's eye to make sure you are n't overlooked . And why do you care ? Becausethe moment they get used to your not being there , that 's the end of you . And I can tell you that a string of blank evenings ahead of you on the pages of that horrible book is enough to put you in the madhouse . And the whole thing is false and phony and strained , you must never let anybody think you 've nothing to do , they only want you so long as everybody else wants you too . The things you learn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner in the evening  --  they might think you 're alone with nothing to do . Suppose they thought that ! Just sup-pose ! "  |p225The  two women fell into a silence so deep , so pervasive , and so expressive that neither could think of another word to add to the torrent that had surged over the dam . Not a syllable of the lesson had been lost on Jessie . The dreadful immediacy and concretenessof Elizabeth Betts ' troubles had pushed Jessie 's more inchoatedistress into remote perspective . She had come here to this queer isolated room to escape ominous vibrations of past and present anxiety ; she had not expected to be handed a dossier of facts applicable to a possible future . Though no single statement of Elizabeth 's had been a complete surprise , Jessie found herself astonished at the sum of them . She realized now that she had presumed Elizabeth 's beauty and money and position and charm to have made her as desirable alone as she had ever been with Philip . The war too had obscured the real problem . Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been largely a matter of casual companionship with other women whose husbands were also at war , an atypical interval in the stagemanagedgladiatorial spectacle which Elizabeth 's outburst had proved her stratum of society to be . Jessie had known it all before , in a way ; she had always known it . That is why , she thought , I cling to the elements of my life which are alien to this jungle . They may be my only resource some day , they may save me if . . . if . . . Elizabeth Betts raised her head suddenly . She looked at Jessie with the cool mask and spoke in the clear ripple which were the face and the voice that the world knew . " Now , " she said , " I am going to take on the beautiful Mrs. Betts again . " She slid from the massage-table and with a graceful motion swept off her dress , shaking it out and reaching for a hanger on which to place it . She went into the adjoining bathroom , as slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighteen-year-old girl . Jessie heard her splashing in the shower ; then in a nimbus of fragrance she returned to the dressing-room , switched on the banks of theatrical lights around the dressingtable , and sat down to restore the work of art that was her face and hair . She chatted as she worked , touching casually upon this , that , or the other among personalities and happenings , as if no puff of wind had ever disarranged one iota of her poise . Though her skin was astonishing for the age that she had admitted , she loaded it with the cream-colored paste maquillage which accounted for Phyllis Whitelaw 's gloomy pallor . The effect on Elizabeth Betts was quite different , she emerged a pearl of subtle lustre . She brushed and shaped her fairy eyebrows , blued and oiled her eyelids , put a drop of some drug in each eye , after which nothing but knowledge before the fact could have betrayed the state in which Jessie had found her . Jessie sat during the whole performancetrying not to watch too closely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she remembered in her earliest childhood watching her mother make up in the theatre . This which Elizabeth Betts was doing involved infinitely more artifice , and in such different degree that Jessie could have shuddered at its implications . With her dress replaced , as unaccountably unmussed as she herself , Elizabeth Betts sorted out her jewels from the heap in which she had flung them upon the dressing-table , put them on with grave attentiveness , and stood up . " Let us , " she said , slipping her arm through Jessie 's , " go and be gay . " The noise of the party had reached the shrill unison key which to unthinking ears meant success , a good party . Jessie was not quite so sure . In any such gathering there were always certain people who drank enough , quickly enough , to prod them to the production of this kind of noise . Their unmirthful laughter , their insincere cries of delight as they greeted one another , their mercurialencounters and partings were so much stage-setting . One responded to it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for delusion . Jessie had never felt so remote or so indifferent as when she reached the bottom of the stairs and watched Elizabeth Betts melt off into the crowd . Then Mark Dwyer appeared beside her , his eyes full of question and anxiety . She realized that she must have been gone for a long time and she felt immensely glad to see him . " Hello , " she said , smiling reassurance . " Are you  --  all right ? Are you well ? " he asked . His voice was troubled . " As can be expected . Do you think I might have a little whisky ? " " Food too ? There 's  --  " he indicated the stream of decorativetraffic flowing in the direction of the dining-room . " I 'm not hungry . But why do n't we just  --  circulate a bit and then  --  " " Then by all means , " said Mark . They moved slowly towards the dining-room beyond thep227rear drawing-room , where a pair of carved oak doors had been thrown open upon a spectacle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Giovanni , does it not ? " George Stillman breezed up to them holding a plate of food and talking cheerfully around a mouthful . " Goddam , " he said . " Quite a sight , ai n't it ? " He could be speaking in derision or he could be impressed , though he had seen this room often before . The Sargent portraits of Bucky Whitelaw 's parents hung against the crimson damask walls , flanked by less spectacular portraits of old Mr. and Mrs. Dominick Whitelaw , he with his mutton-chops , she with her incrustation of diamonds . Great golden girandoles dripping with baccarat prisms flashed brilliance from every corner of the room . The crystal chandelier when brought from France had been the newspaper sensation of its day . The furniture was overwhelming . The carpet had already been promised to the Metropolitan Museum . The setting seemed haunted by the heavy-bellied lords of industrial empire and their forbidding wives , and by the ranks of liveried men who had served them terrapin and canvasbacks , haunches of Southdown mutton , giant prize asparagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family hothouses , architectural extravaganzas from the pastry chef , Lafite of ' 65 and Romanee of ' 95 and Cordon Rouge laid down in thousands before the vintage came on the market . And now a handful of hired waiters hurried about , indistinguishable in their black from more than a few of the guests , clearing away discarded plates and glasses and replenishing the dishes and platters on the buffet table where people helped themselves according to their natures , some with picking indifference and some with fervid greed . " Actually , " said Jessie , watching the scene from the corner where they stood , " it is as fascinating a study in anachronism as you will ever see . " " That old pirate would have a stroke , " said George , glancing at the portrait of Bucky 's grandfather . " There are probably not ten people in this house whom he would have let in , " said Mark . " Over his dead body , " said Jessie . " And as for her  --  " she indicated the old lady with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say of Isabel Allen ? " " Isabel hell , " said George Stillman between his teeth . " What about her grandson 's wives ? " " For that matter , " said Jessie demurely , " what about me ? "  | " You ? You are at least semi-acceptable , Mrs. Bourne . I bet your mother-in-law thinks the Whitelaws were parvenus . " " Oh , she does , " said Jessie with a laugh . " But what do you suppose she thinks about me ? " " Well , whatever it is , it has n't killed her yet , " said George , with a wink which Jessie understood too well to dare to notice it . " You know , " said Mark , watching the people at the buffet , " I think Phyllis does these things very well , considering the elementsshe is balancing . " " Very well indeed , " said Jessie quickly . " She might be a little warmer or more gracious if that were her nature , but her idea is sound . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  I almost said before the revolution . Anyway , before the last war ? Mother used to tell me all about them when she came home . Supper at little gilt tables , with your long gloves on  --  oyster patties and chaudfroid of chicken and fancy ices in spun sugar nests . And a string quartet out there on the stair landing . And now look . " They all broke into laughter as they watched the most admiredand envied brains and talent and money and fame from a dozen different circles , clamoring , gesturing , waving forks and glasses , reaching past one another to the buffet table , where the great silver platters and footed dishes were set forth full of corned beef hash , baked beans , hot dogs , kosher dill pickles , potato salad , and cold cuts . " And I hope , " said George with a snicker , " that the old girl up there on the wall really appreciates the dessert . I 'm going to have some now , how about you , Jess ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked George . " Goddam , usually when I wantLindy 's cheesecake I have to stagger there at three a.m. to get it . " He disappeared into the crowd and Jessie moved away withMark . How fine it would be , she thought , if we could leave nowand why , for that matter , did we come in the first place ? Butshe recognized among the other hard truths revealed by ElizabethBetts ' gashing of the silken curtain of expediency , the familiarsophism of wishing to be included in something for which onehad no real taste ; indeed which one might hold in contempt ordread . It was all very unpleasant , and she felt tired , helplesslypeevish , like a small child dragged by its mother on a shoppingtour , who flings itself down in the crowded aisle of a departmentstore and bursts into howls . She became so conscious of the imagep229that she could not help laughing at it , and thus she appeared to be in the best of spirits as they came upon Norman Feiner who stood talking with Bucky Whitelaw and Hall Peters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed his fingers warmly , but neither said anything about the play because they knew that Norman must already be exhausted by the thoughtless weight thrown upon him of hundreds of false assurances that the play was " wonderful , " and " sure to be a hit , darling . " He looked tired and strained , but not by any means tragedy-stricken , he was far too seasoned in the theatre for that . " I told you it stank , " he said quietly to Jessie and Mark . " It does n't , " said Mark . " But I think you were bucking somethingalmost hopeless , Norman . " " I 've thought of that too , " said Norman with quiet sarcasm . " I would n't accuse you of escapism , my boy , but just why are you leaving for Europe on Monday ? " " You could leave too , " said Mark . " I could also stay here , " said Norman quickly , " and try to keep them remembering what the hell it 's all about and incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " " With exactly what ? " asked Mark . " Too much of something , " said Bucky Whitelaw . " What 's the good of your job in Europe if people act here the way they did tonight ? " He was speaking of the audience at the theatre , but Jessie saw Mark 's eye sweep the crowded dining-room behind them and return to glance at Oliver Whitelaw with deprecation that was almost pitying as a comment upon his confused thinking . In these past days Jessie had not once heard Mark voice an emotion which she knew to be straining always at the brakes of his mind , his revulsion from the greedy , reckless spectacle of life in the United States . He was going back to Europe because he could not help it , because he had to go . Jessie stood obliquely watching his face which had taken on a forbidding expression that she knew to be unconscious . She had a startling impression of seeming to see this man apart from his identity , without the spectacular decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a figure of loneliness and humility , absorbed in something difficult and remote . The notion was gone in a flash and with it a thrust of poignant feeling which , had they been alone , would have swept her into his arms . Instead , she stood making the careful effort to appear230 EAST SIDE , WEST SIDEp230oblivious of him , joining in the delighted clamor which followed the announcement by the composer Abel Goodman , Sam Lee 's partner , that Jennie Wren was going to sing . " Ah , " said Jessie , leading her small group towards the front drawing-room where two pianos stood with their bends fitted together , " this is where I come in . " This was indeed the only development at the party which could have deflected her from her intention to signal Mark that she wanted to leave . But Jennie Wren was a taste as special as pickled herring ; one felt it as avid appetite or utter loathing . Jennie Wren was a dark , dumpy , pop-eyed woman with a hoarse , blaring contralto voice and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had earned her millions of dollars and millions of passionate aficionados . Mark looked at Jessie with astonishment as she settled herself on a couch beside Harry Blitzer , a Broadway character who performed some go-between function in the maze which a person outside the theatrical world could never hope to understand . The room was quickly becoming crowded , for the word about Jennie Wren was drawing the whole party to this spot , and Mark dropped down to sit on the floor near Jessie , with many others close about . " Do you know , Mark , " said Jessie , leaning forward , " Harry here was an old friend of my mother 's . I have known him  --  how long , Harry ? " Blitzer took the cigar out of his mouth and winked . " You really want me to tell , Jess ? " Mark felt a sense of the sharpest appreciation of Jessie for the tone of her introduction of Harry Blitzer . With his pot-belly , his sparsely covered bald spot , his fat face , his thick hairy hands inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe it ) a colossal star-sapphire and diamond ring , he was a masterpiece of vulgar ugliness . And yet Jessie had her reasons , which Mark did not know , for being loyal to Blitzer and for showing him that that was so . " Would it do the slightest good if I did n't want you to tell ? " Jessie teased him , her eyes twinkling . " He is one of those people who always knew everybody when , " she said to Mark . " Jennie too . As a matter of fact , you got Jennie her first job , did n't you , Harry ? " " In a basement joint in the Village , " said Blitzer . He looked up and about the room , making sure that Jennie Wren was not yet ready to sing ; then he leaned forward towards Mark Dwyer , his fat thighs straining the cloth of his trousers , and said , withp231the thick gusto of his kind , " The first time I eveh saw Jennie Resnick she was a dirty little kid playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He spoke almost in a whisper , but not such a whisper as is used for the communication of secrets . " You know why I noticed her ? " he asked Mark . Mark shrugged . " Yeh , " said Harry Blitzer , chuckling . " I guess we all looked fa ' the same thing . She did n't have any pants on . I noticed it because we boys were always in'arested , but anyway she was squatting there on that stoop with her behind up in the air , you could n't have missed it . " " Somebody told me once , " said Jessie , " that poor people 's little girls never wear drawers . I was terribly shocked , and my God !  --  what a prig . " " They never do where I come from , " said Mark . " Here or in Europe . " " Well you know , " said Harry Blitzer , " once that made me wonder if maybe that was the reason why it was always poor girls you heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding them in shoe boxes under the stairs . " He shook his head . " But later I saw it was just because there are so many poor girls . Rich ones get in just as much trouble but there 's always somebody to hide everything , with money and taking ' em away on trips and hushing it all up . It had nothing to do with wearing drawers , imagine , " he said . And he settled back to listen to Jennie Wren-Resnick with an expression of thoroughlysatisfied pride . It was during one of the spates of applause and shrill babblingsof delight for Jennie Wren and Abel Goodman accompanyingher in his own music , that Harry Blitzer moved his head closer to Jessie 's and spoke to her in the expressionless murmur , lips scarcely moving , which meant that he had something really private to say . " How much do you know about that damfool niece of yours and him ? " he asked , contriving to indicate Jack Spanier in an opposite corner of the room without a glance in his direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , look . You better do something . " Jessie gave Harry Blitzer a glance of shrewd questioning . " You mean you --  " She began to applaud and make herself part of the clamoring audience , to enable Blitzer to speak to her with the most possible privacy.  | " Spanier 's in for about a quarter of a million , " he said . " The Schimmers have it on him cold . He 'll have to get the money somewhere . " " But surely , " said Jessie , " that could n't have any bearing on this mess about Iris ? She 's just  --  " she made a gesture . " There are always fools like her . " " Yeh . " Blitzer gripped his cigar between his teeth . " But I 'm warning you . " " Me ? Why , Harry ? " Almost imperceptibly Blitzer rubbed his thumb against the tips of two fingers . Jessie tried to steady herself against a shudder . " But  --  but that seems impossible , " she whispered . Blitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The bastard 's desperate . Look a ' that . " Without indicating what he meant , he caused Jessie to look quickly at Jack Spanier , who then turned his head to avoid her glance ; and Jessie saw Spanier squinting at a corner where Alexander Lowden was talking to Phyllis Whitelaw , who had at last emerged from her retreat to join her own party . " He could scarcely blackmail a man for something that everybody knows anyway , " said Jessie . " Besides , Alec has not a penny of his own . It all belongs to Serena . " " Neveh mind the details . That 's a cornered rat and he is n't going to be so fancy whose place he stinks up . Sure , " he said suddenly aloud , very loud , lifting his head towards Jennie Wren , " you got ta sing Honeybee . Come on , Baby ! " In a short time Jessie signalled Mark and rose from the couch , bidding Harry Blitzer a warm good bye . He grinned up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Jessie nodded , turning away . Only a moment later , as she and Mark were about to start downstairs , she encountered her brother-inlawcarrying two glasses of whisky-and-soda across the hall . She contrived to let Mark go ahead of her and then she said , " Van . Just a moment . " Fielding stopped and looked at her with dull surprise . He was so accustomed to the cynical , tacit understanding by which his relatives conducted the fiction of not seeing him when he was escorting Isabel Allen , that he had quite forgotten he was not in the usual public place with Isabel Allen beside him . He was only carrying a drink to her , but he had had so many drinks himself that it was difficult for him to switch his habit-signals to the normal mien with which he should speak to his sister-in-law in the house of mutual friends . Nobody could say , thought Jessie ,  |p233watching  the narrow , blank face , the uneasy eye , that Evander Fielding was out of place here , but she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked  --  about distractedly , and just as Jessie was expectinghim to blurt , " Well , what do you want ? , " he pulled himself together , smiled idiotically , and said , " Good party , is n't it ? " " Yes , " she said . " Wonderful . Van , can you find time to come in and see me tomorrow ? Or as soon as possible ? There 's something I want to  --  " she paused , feeling for a phrase that would not antagonize him , for it was clear that he would be resentful and suspicious of anything that a member of his family might ask to speak to him about . " I ought to tell you something , " she said , hoping for the best . But he scowled anyway , the weakness in his face making petulance of the expression instead of determination . He made it clear that he supposed Jessie could have nothing to say to him except some tiresome protest concerning Isabel Allen , which would be none of Jessie 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance down the hall and through the room where Isabel Allen sat , among a group of four men and one woman , Mrs. Irving Laskin , whose husband was planted beside her with all the subtlety of a mameluke at the gate of a harem . Jessie watched Evander Fielding 's jellylike eye narrow and harden , though she could not read the least strength in the glance , only a disgraceful kind of consternation as he saw Jack Spanier materialize behind Isabel Allen , lean over her  --  making of her incredible barely veiled breasts an indiscriminate lubricity  --  and speak to her with the hard-lipped secrecy typical of his kind . How unbelievably disgusting , said an observing nerve in Jessie 's mind , and fascinated by the sheer scurrility of the scene , she stood beside Evander Fielding and saw Isabel Allen raise to the man behind her the face famed for its enamelled expressionless beauty , across which , almost faster than Jessie could believe , there flashed a break as violent as the smashing of a tray of crockery . Jessie could not remember ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had happened far too quickly for her to interpretanything . She turned aside , alarmed by what she had seen and what she sensed of its hideous inner workings , and found herself thinking with sudden icy concern of Serena Lowden . That is strange , she thought then , because at least that fool of a husband of hers appears to have gone home . And surely it is no business of mine . Evander Fielding spoke suddenly in his irritable , polishedp234drawl . " Well , " he said , " I suppose  --  " He was still nervously watching the group at the end of the long room , and he was too patently anxious to get away from Jessie . " I have to speak to you about Iris , " said Jessie quickly . " Nothing  --  else . " " Iris ? " " Yes . I can not tell you anything here . Will you call me tomorrow ? " Fielding 's blond brows twitched and he looked at the glass in his right hand . " What 's on your mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Van , it would be impossible to speak about it here . But somebody must do something about her . I think it should be you . " " Oh , all right , " he said with truculence . " I 'll call you some time tomorrow . " Jessie moved past him and down the stairs , certain that he would have forgotten all about the matter by tomorrow , and even more certain how fervently she would thank God for any miracle that would remove the entire Bourne and Fielding connection and all its ramifications from her life . Mark was waiting for her at the foot of the stairs , but before she could join him she found herself blocked by Henry Greenberg , on his way up , whose presenceat this particular moment was the final straw in an intolerable load . " Leaving , Jess ? " he smiled , in his most affectionate manner . " Why , the party 's just getting good . " " I know , Henry , " she laughed . She wished that there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Sam and Helen are waiting . . . " " Sam and Helen left an hour ago , tchk , tchk , " said Henry Greenberg with a wink for which she could have put his eye out . " You wo n't change your mind about the week end , Jess ? Come on out , the Porters are coming and Joe and Mack , and Dinko 's plane will be in from London . And bring anybody you like , " he said , as broadly as if he were pasting up a billboard . " Thanks , Henry , you 're a dear . I 'm going down to Virginia ... another week . . . yes , was n't it . . . " And joining Mark in the hall she cursed the eyes in the back of Henry Greenberg 's head , mounting the stairs . In the taxi Jessie turned to Mark with a low sigh . In one soft , exhausted sound she confessed more than she would havep235permitted any words to say . He leaned forward , finding her for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his arms , feeling her deliberately put aside the gentle stiffness which had been her way of admitting , up to now , all that at the same time she abjured . Her left hand went up suddenly and around his neck , her right arm lay limp between them as he bent over to hold her hard against the swaying of the cab , and to find that his mouth upon hers met sudden , complete response . He had not realized until this moment how very great had been her reserve , though he had also never been mistaken that that reserve was coldness . The discovery moved him to a hoarse exclamation almost as if of pain , and for what time they did not know , they remained lost in their first step together . When Mark released her lips , Jessie clung as closely to him , and presently whispered , " I think  --  I suppose  --  not even now  --  if you were not going away . " He did not answer , overcome with the sense that there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry and buried her face against his chest . He held her very tightly , his face against her hair , his closed lips upon her temple . It must be , he understood , a prodigious surrender of her guard that he could feel her slight body shaken by sobs , though she managed to make no sound at all . He said after a moment , " Darling , try to be calm , try not to cry  --  " and when she raised her head he kissed her eyes and the upper corners of her cheeks with marvelloustenderness . He drew her head to his shoulder , aware that she must wish him not see her struggle to compose herself . Almost until the cab reached her door he held her , one hand with the most delicate lightness caressing her hair , and in the last few moments he said softly , " You are very tired , darling . If I could , I would come with you and hold you in my arms all night . But it is nearly three o'clock now . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You are right , " she said , against his coat . " That is not what I want for you  --  that is not  --  not --  " " I know . " " Tomorrow ? " he asked , turning up her face towards his and looking into her eyes . " Will you spend the day with me tomorrow ? " She nodded slowly , looking straight at him , as plainly allowinghim to see all that her face could say as she had asked him , also without speaking , to take her in his arms . The cab stopped and the driver sat waiting for them to get out . Jessie drew apart from Mark , torn between the knowledge that it would be , as he had said , altogether a mistake for him to come into her house with her at such an hour , and the childish desire to cry out to him not to leave her . Then she saw in a rush of gratitude that he had prevented her from committing in her helplessness an unfastidious blunder which she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and Mark to share , he would bring to it a delicacy of taste and judgment which would keep it a lovely thing , " lovely enough , " he had said a little while ago , " for you . " He put his hands on either side of her face , his sad dark eyes intent but warm with the tenderness for which she felt a craving hunger ; and he said with such simple authority that she could not help smiling weakly , " Now you are to go to sleep , my darling . " He kissed her lips lightly . " To sleep . Will you do that ? " She nodded , conscious with sharpest relief of the luxury of meeting this small exaction of his will . It feels , she thought , like playing at being a child , but what is wrong with sensing oneself a child beside a thorough man ? He stepped out of the cab and helped her out and walked with her to the door where they stood waiting for the night man to answer their ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mark . " But not too soon before . You are to sleep until then , and I do n't want to hear about any engagements that you have made , all day long . " " I will cancel them , " she said meekly , " if there are any . I ca n't remember . " The man opened the door and Mark kissed her hand and left her . IVIt **28;2028;TOOLONG had slept heavily for a time after going to bed , but she was awake in the early morning , with the bludgeoned sensation of having slept too little . Nothing was more distressing to her than this , to wake unrested with black dullness in her head , with thoughts as rude and confused as the dreams which they had succeeded , dreams from which one wakes frightened or upset or resentful , with no tangible memory of their content . Then she fell into a brief period of almost weeping petulance , then a moment of feeling crazily sorry for herself because she had had the misfortuneto wake so soon . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock and her wish not to know what time it was . At last she turned over and examined the crystal clock on the night-table , its luminous dial glowing in the artificial dark of the curtained room , and she saw that it said a quarter past seven . " Oh my God , my God , " she groaned , rolling over with an **25;2058;TOOLONG of action , and burying her head under one of the pillows . " Oh damn damn damn . . . " It seemed cruel to her that this had happened when she needed so badly to sleep . She felt much too dull and distrait to clear her mind purposely to the anticipation of what the day was to hold , but she knew that she had hoped to meet this day fresher , calmer , more rested and serene than she had ever been in her life . She dare not give up the struggle and admit that she could not sleep any more ; she must sleep at least three hours longer or her day would be ruined . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make herself , and in the knowledge that unless she gave her mind some lovely and caressing thought to hold it would turn on her and become a snake 's nest of anxieties , she brought to it the image of Mark , and to her lips the sound of his name , which she whispered against the back of her hand . She drew long and regular breaths , inviting the conscious dream of his presence to come and take possessionof her and enclose her in the extraordinary sense of strength which she drew from his voice or the touch of his hand . This , she found , was good ; she was quite able to mould this mood to her desire , and she could feel the quietude travel as if from some central source farther and farther outwards , to her skin , to the nerves of her closed eyelids , to the tips of her fingers and her toes . The thought materialized slowly that this was to be the day that she had promised to Mark , and in time she discovered that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness to calm herself that she could lie here really resting and think , not of the splendor which she knew his lovemaking would be , but of his heavenly tenderness while she rested beside him when all time had been abandoned . She remained in this way increasingly content , motionless in a degree of relaxation which took from her light body any sense of contact with the bed upon which it lay . She might be floating . She might be drifting through air in which , if she listened , she could hear his calm admonition that she go to sleep again . Go to sleep , she thought , in unison with what she heard , go to sleep again , to sleep . When she came awake again it was past ten o'clock and she felt perfectly calm . She rang for Josephine , pursuing her usual habits of the morning . She took a strange and surprised satisfaction in proceeding with the small routines of mail and householdmemoranda and details about the evening 's dinner-party , which she would so thankfully have cancelled . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mark , I shall have travelled thousands of miles away from all this into a lovely place which will seem like my native land from which I have all my life been exiled . It was now that she realized how subtle and keen had been his instinct not to come into this house with her last night . Though she had for so many years been saturated in solitude here , it had been a solitude not of identity , but of force . This was the house where she was Mrs. Brandon Bourne , and no faintest element of her feeling for Mark Dwyer partook of the cynical contriving of a love-affair , which was exactly what all her detestableacquaintances must either be saying of it already , or would say before long . She could not prevent that , but she felt a sense of stature in the knowledge that such gabble did not really matter , and could not hurt though it would repel her . Brandon Bourne had no more bearing upon this day and its event than a total stranger , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care less than anybody on earth . But the depth of Mark Dwyer 's concern for her reassured and warmed her wonderfully . She had promised to cancel all her engagements for the day , and when she looked at her blue book she was relieved to seep241that she could free herself easily . There was only her lunch with Althea Crowe , afterwards the coiffeur , and then a cocktail party at an art gallery where the proceeds of the vernissage were to go to one of Patty Duncan 's charities . She telephoned Althea Crowe at her office . " Hell , no , " roared Miss Crowe , when Jessie asked if she would mind changing their luncheon engagement . " You could try giving me some bull about your husband 's maiden aunt descendingon you from Chappaqua but I 'm too smart for that and so are you ! Go ahead and have a good time . " " It 's not  --  " began Jessie a little lamely , but she was drowned out by a peal of brassy laughter . She could not help laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Next Tuesday , then . You 're a darling . " " Tell that to sweetie , " said Althea Crowe , and rang off . Jessie put off the coiffeur until next week , but arranged to have Miss Stella come here tomorrow morning to do her nails . She wrote a note of apology to Patty Duncan , enclosing a contributionfor her charity , and then she realized that she had better plan the seating of her dinner-table now , for she might not have a chance later , and in any case would feel even less like putting her mind to it . She sat looking at the list of names on today 's page of her book , wondering helplessly how she had come to let herself in for this , which had seemed so pleasant an idea when she had planned it and which now had lost every vestige of meaning , although she was fond of the friends whom she had invited . Sam and Helen Lee were coming , thank God , and the Clyde Pritchards whom she saw rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing them together ; and Jerome Block the economist whom Brandon dismissed as one of Roosevelt'scrackpots , with his wife Hulda , an extraordinarily fine pianist ; and now also Reath Sheldon , that sort of really dear friend , she thought , whom in this queer life that we lead here we so seldom see . A few others might come in after dinner , including Myron Waite , who had been a correspondent with the Third Army and who would have much in common with Mark Dwyer  --  and suddenlyJessie sat up tense with the thought that by this evening that name , that identity , would have become so transformed in her eyes , and she herself would have traversed such illimitable distances , that she might find herself in uncharted territory . Oh , she thought , I am not at all sure that I want Mark to be here for dinner , I think I shall tell him it would be better not to come ... but how do I know what I shall think by then , how can I tell ? And while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment by which to guide herself , Mark called her on the telephone . It was then at the sound of his voice that all the strange calm of the morning vanished in one unmistakable thrust , and she held the telephone in a shaking hand , trying to make her voice something other than a helpless gasp . " Have you slept ? " asked Mark , with the same grave quiet in which he had spoken on leaving her last night . " Yes . Well . Very well . " ( Oh , she thought , oh , I did not know , in spite of everything , how could I not have known ! ) " And you are still in bed ? " " Yes , but I was just about to get up . " She could hear her own voice unnaturally low and blurred , she could not have forced herself to change its tone , because something had overridden her control and was straining to tell Mark what she wanted him to know now ; at once , she thought , right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . " " Mark , " she said , without any forethought at all , " Mark , I think I would rather come  --  " she hesitated and still could barely say above a whisper , " come and meet you . " He understood , better than she herself , for she had not anticipated her own impulse . " Very well , " he said . " I see , darling . Come when you are ready . " He gave her the number of his apartment in the hotel and just as Jessie thought he was about to ring off he said in his characteristic , abrupt way , " Are you sure you want to come , darling ? Would you rather --  " " Oh , " she said , again without the least power to decide her own words , " Oh , Mark . I have never been so sure of anything before . " " I 'll be waiting , " he said ; she heard his deep voice turn thin and roughen . She put down the telephone and sat still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking not about the helpless tumult which was rioting inside her still form , but about the knowledge which had broken the shackles of half a lifetime and forged to the peak of her brain commanding to be recognized . She had her bath , precisely performing all the small acts of habit by which women make themselves desirable , thinking so concretely about Mark that at one moment the strain of cynicat humor imbedded in her personality roused itself to accuse her ofp 243physical coquetry or even wantonness . That , she replied , in the silent dialogue which an imaginative and solitary person typically holds within himself , is not the point . My wish to give pleasure wholly and as nearly perfectly as I can is but the outermost symbol of the force which is carrying me forward now . Once more there rose in her mind the knowledge , amazing , yet profoundlya matter of course , that her relationship to Mark Dwyer was not discovery but recognition , the acknowledgement of an intense natural intimacy established infinitely long ago . She sat down at her dressing-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her face and her hair . Inevitably she remembered Elizabeth Betts the night before , and again she wondered at the need in such a naturally beautiful woman to assume so much artifice . I thought I was the most timid of women , she mused , but whatever my fears may be , they do not seem to take the form of obsession with pots and jars . Even while she noted that her skin was not particularly young , and that the grey highlights in her hair would soon be less amusing ' than revealing , she took a strange satisfaction in the intention to let Mark Dwyer know her precisely as she was ; not without the subtle gratifications of delicacyand daintiness and fragrance and allurement to touch , but altogether without the kind of illusion which holds the imminent11fear of some disappointing discovery . She had finished with the simple matters of lotion and a bitof color and powder for her face , and was brushing her eyebrows , dipping the silly doll 's brush into a vial of scent , sweeping thedark silk of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plunged with frightful violence , because she heard the shattering slam of the front door downstairs . The small bottle slid from her left hand and crashed on the marble floor . She sat gaping at her mirror . Brandon . While her heart began to pound with the fear which his every unannounced appearance had for years past touched off , she sat staring at her reflection , saying half aloud , " But it does not matter . What does it matter ? Why do you care ? He never says when he is coming or going . You are silly , you are a fool . . . " But Mark , said the silent voice within her mind , but Mark . " But it does not matter , " she insisted again , forming the words with her lips . " It makes no difference whatsoever . . . " Josephine came into the dressing-room , taking a negligee from the rack where it hung , and holding it for Jessie to put on . " Mr. Bourne has just come in , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Jessie rose and allowed herself to be put into the dressinggown . She was cold with suspense and despair and the beating physical fear which the anticipation of seeing Brandon invariably roused , no matter how quickly thereafter she might regain possession of herself and appear to be wholly poised and normal of manner in his presence . By the time he had entered her bedroom she had seated herself again at the dressing-table , kicked the broken bottle out of sight , and taken up her hairbrush . He appeared at the door of her dressing-room , calling " Jess ? " " Why , Brandon , " she said , rather surprised at the calm coolness of her own voice . " I did n't know you were coming . " He made no motion towards a kiss of greeting or any salutationthat might be conventional after an absence ; Jessie felt casual relief at that . She had no wish to look at his face but she had not much choice ; it was the only thing to do . So she turned to him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished to find him drawn , tense , and obviously in the grip of some great alarm . " Why  --  " she said involuntarily , taking her cue from the anxious stare in his hard blue eyes , " why  --  what --  " Even while her whole reason was assuring her that this strange bearing of his could have nothing to do with her , the vibrations of her initial terror at his appearance had not quieted altogether ; she was desperately uneasy . But he said , his hard voice heightened by anxiety , " It 's Van . Van is in a terrible jam , Jess . " " Van ? " She would know in an instant what more there was to know ; just now she was deeply relieved that she had so accuratelyjudged the impossibility of Brandon 's concern having anything to do with her . " What has happened ? " she asked . " I saw him only a few hours ago . " " Isabel , " said Brandon . He looked over his shoulder into the bedroom to make sure that Josephine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jessie saw in the mirror her mouth drop agape and the hairbrush slither to the dressing-table from her hand . " But  --  " she said . " But --  " She rose and walked past Brandon into her bedroom . He followed her and they stood near the windows , talking . Jessie 's brow was stitched with perplexity . " But , " she said again , " that  --  why that ca n't be possible , Brandon . I tell you I saw them --  " " I know , " he said . " It happened early this morning . Van telephoned me at six o'clock --  "  | " Yes , I was going to ask how on earth you --  " " Chet Claymore flew me up to Washington in his plane and I caught the  --  never mind . We 've got to do something about Van now , Jess . This is serious . " " You mean  --  he  --  no ! " Brandon raised his eyebrows and put his lips together with the pursed expression of extreme doubt . " Van did not  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words  --  Van had nothing to do with it , " he said . " But he was there . And --  " " Where ? " asked Jessie . " In Isabel 's apartment . " " And where is he now ? " " Downstairs in the library , " said Brandon . " He met me at LaGuardia and I made what I could of his story on the way in . But he 's so  --  " Brandon moved his long hands helplessly . " You ii never heard of such a mess , " he said . Jessie wondered whether or not she had ever heard of such a mess ; she could have reminded Brandon of some that had been less terrible only in degree . " I do n't know what to do , " said Brandon , abruptly . Jessie could almost see him slinging down the thing at her feet . " It 's going to be a damned nasty business and  --  well --  " He looked at Jessie with the plain statement in his face that he took her unquestioning help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , she saw that she had already been rallied to the support of Brandon 's family , that she was committed abso- 11 lutely to protecting them whether that might be her own will or not . Standing there in the window , looking at this detested stranger who was fear and sorrow personified , she felt , with an abrupt tumbling inner sense of collapse , how utterly without choice she was . I wonder why , she thought , I wonder why I surrender to this blow now , why it is my responsibility , why do I know that I shall be hours or days or weeks at the beck and call of these savages . . . oh , she could have wailed , standing there staring at Brandon Bourne 's arrogant , coldly moulded face , oh , Mark , Mark , Mark . Today , tomorrow , Saturday , Sunday  --  was it too much to ask ? Am I not to live , not to live at all ? She knew as she looked at Brandon that she betrayed nothing ; perhaps , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , even a fragment of happiness ; after all , I am so used to not having any . She turned her head and looked at the clock with wretchednesswhich Brandon , if he noticed her action at all , probably mistookfor concern about him . Trying as if from perverseness top246make herself feel that this man standing here was her husband , which seemed an insane unreality , she said quietly , " Go down and tell Van I will be there in a moment . And ask Sarah to take him in some black coffee , and see that he drinks it . " She stood waiting for Brandon to close the door with his usual roughness , which he did ; and when she had recovered from that , she went to the telephone , flicked the switch which cut it off from the other extensions in the house , and called Mark . She found then that she could scarcely speak . " Darling , " he said , his voice strained with sudden fear , but trying to comfort her , " what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but beyond the fragments that she knew , there was nothing to say except , " I can not come . Oh , Mark ! " She wept helplessly , making a tangle of piteous sounds , and then she said , " If I had left the house ten minutes ago . . . if I had only been gone , they would not have been able to find me all day . " He was glad that she could not see his wry smile caused by these childish words . If some such thing had to happen , he thought , thank God that nobody had had to go searching for her all over town . " Darling , " he said , and she wept again because she was so far from the comfort of his voice , " darling , it may not be as bad as you think now . And anyway , " he said slowly ; and then he was silent . " What ? " asked Jessie , with a sense of fear . " Nothing , darling , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to convey to her . " Nothing . You do n't know yet , do you , " he asked slowly , " just what the details are ? How  --  in just what way Fielding is involved ? " " No , " she said . " Only that he  --  oh , my God . " " The newspapers , " said Mark . " Yes . " In a spasm of misery she felt herself stiffen with resentment that this unspeakable thing had happened , that the fragile loveliness of her mood and the paradise of anticipation in which she had enjoyed it , had been smashed in this way , for such a reason , so soon . " There may be some way that I can help , " said Mark . " You 're so good , " replied Jessie . " I have to go and talk to them now and find out all about it . " She spoke with a resigned control of voice which reassured him at least that she would be the calmest and sanest element in the mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked  | " Of course  --  but Mark , please do n't stay there and wait for me to call . It might be  --  I ca n't tell how long . " " Just call when you can , " he said . " And darling  --  " " Yes ? " He did not speak at once and she waited . She sensed what he might say and then she felt the presentiment that he would not permit himself to say it . This was not the first such moment , there had been others . He had had his reasons , amid the warm intimacy of all their talk , for leaving unsaid the thing that a different sort of man might have said quite lightly . " I am so afraid , " said Jessie , whispering . " So afraid that we will not  --  that --  " " Of course we will ! " said Mark 's voice , full-throated , almost a shout of reassurance . " Stop worrying . Call me when you can . " And breaking the connection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something that she had surely never heard before ; it was only while she was hurrying into her dress that she realized he had spoken in a language that she did not know . SHE found Evander Fielding seated in a stiff armchair in the library , and Brandon pacing up and down the room , jingling the keys or the coins in his trousers pocket . She shrank from the pacing and the jingling , trifles of themselves , but reflective of destructive and hateful qualities which she had learned to dread . She would find a way in a moment to stop that . First she had to accustom herself to the sight of Evander Fielding , whose face showed her the spectacle of a man in the grip of extreme panic and fear . He was a sick yellowish clay-color ; his eyes , always pale and vaguely focussed , appeared to have been cut off from contact with their controlling nerves , simply to roll loose in his face . His greying sandy hair had been thinning from his narrow forehead for years , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald . She closed the door behind her and crossed the room to a chair near Fielding , saying , " Brandon , come over here and sit on the couch  --  we can speak more quietly . " 1 Then she said to Fielding , " Van , Brandon has not told me anything except  --  except about your finding Isabel , and  --  " good God , she thought , is this all to be put in this way upon me ? What am I doing here ! She turned sharply to Brandon and made a gesture enjoining him to take over . But Brandon only said , " I think you ought to tell Jess the whole thing  --  if you can , Van . I mean , both of us . Maybe , " he said , " the three of us together will be able to figure out what you ought to do . " Fielding made a despairing sound , looking from Jessie to Brandon and back to Jessie again , and by his silence indicating that Brandon might as probably be right as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some coffee for him , saying , " No thanks , I 've had all I want . " He was in the trembling funk which resulted from having been violently and instantaneously sobered by shock . He made one attempt to hold and smoke a cigarette which Brandon lighted for him , but his hand shook so wildly that he could not manage it ; presently Jessie took a paper-knife from the desk and crushed out the stub in the ash-tray . " You know , Van , " she said quietly , " it 's really very hard to start making sense when one does n't know any facts . What actually happened to Isabel ? " " It was Spanier , " said Fielding , his mouth twitching . " Jack Spanier ! You mean he killed her ? " Jessie spoke in such spontaneous amazement , inextricable for the moment from relief , that to Brandon she sounded insanely gay . " Then --  " " No , " said Fielding . " He did n't kill her . Oh , God . " He dropped his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyebrows lifted in bewildered peaks . She shook her head as they both sat watching Fielding . Brandon leaned forward and touched him on the shoulder . " Van , " he said . " Why do n't you try to start at the beginning of what happened and simply tell us , just as you remember it ? I could n't get it straight in the taxi . And we 've got to do something , you know , damn fast . About Isa  --  about the  --  " Jessie saw his mouth form a soundless Jesus Christ ! ' as he took the handkerchieffrom his breast pocket and mopped his forehead . Again she asked him a silent question , this time horrified , and Brandon shook his head with a grimace . Jessie sat back against her chair . Fielding raised his head , swinging it like an animal , and said , " I 'd better have a drink . " " He had , at that , " said Jessie . Brandon brought a pony of whisky and Fielding gulped it off , shuddering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesquely expected that he would . Then he moved as if to straighten himself , gripped the fragile , turned arms of his chair and said , " Maybe I ca n't remember what happened exactly , it gets harder to remember all the time . " He paused to try to think , and Jessie said , " Put it any way that it comes to you , Van , but is it the case that nobody  --  that Isabel  --  I mean is she still there ? In her apartment ? " " You mean do the police know yet ? " asked Fielding in a sudden streak of lucidity as shocking as if he had begun to gibber . " No , they do n't . At least they did n't an hour ago and nobody would have gone there since . " " How about Alec Lowden ? " asked Jessie in a tone of which she felt in some way ashamed . " He never went there in the morning , " said Fielding , revealingthe whole cynical , sordid pattern of which he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Jessie ; everybody did who was familiar with the scared , pompous hypocrisy of Alexander Lowden'sexistence . For twenty-five years he had been at his desk at The Press punctually at nine-thirty every morning , " to set an example to the staff , " to make of the indefensible fatuity which was his life " an open book . " " But he may  --  soon , " said Brandon , glancing at the small clock on the desk . It was twenty-five minutes before twelve . " Or try to telephone . " " I know , " said Fielding . He made a vast visible effort to order his senses and his wits , and he began suddenly to talk . " The size of it is , " he said , " Isabel is lying dead there in her apartment and so far , nobody knows it but Jack Spanier and me . But somebody has to know and  --  do n't you see ! " , he exclaimed wildly , " as soon as anybody finds her of course they will call the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens in a thing like this , Bran ? Do n't you know ? " " Has n't Isabel got a maid ? " asked Jessie slowly . " No , not now . She did . I mean she never had one who lived there , just women who came in . And she has n't had one for a week or more  --  she was always in a mess like that . " Once again Jessie tried to make Fielding begin at the beginning , and in answer to her question about when he had left the Whitelaws ' party , he said , " About four o'clock . I took it for granted that I would take Isabel home , I had brought her to the party , and  --  you see . It was that way . " He meant that Alexander Lowden had purposely left the Whitelaw party early and alone , not expecting to see Isabel Allen again that night . " But when we were in the taxi Isabel acted very queer . As a matter of fact she had been jumpy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jessie . " I saw her . " She remembered now every detail of the impression made upon her by Isabel Allen 's damaged looks and harassed manner . " She told me she did n't want me to come up to the apartment with her , " said Fielding . " She tried to make me leave her in the hall downstairs . Jesus ! " he groaned , " if I only had ! " But then he shook his head wretchedly and said , " But it probably would n't have made any difference . I told her I was damn well going upstairs with her . " Brandon leaned forward sharply and said , " Say , Van . By the way . Has Isabel moved ? Since  --  lately , anyway . " " No , " said Fielding , not understanding . " Why ? " Brandon did not answer him , but he did turn to Jessie . " I was worried about a doorman or elevator man , " he explained . " Oh , no , " she said . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , that I should have reason to care that Isabel Allen lived in a remodelled private house with an automatic elevator . Fielding seemed not to notice that he had been interrupted . Started upon his story , he went on talking doggedly , repeating himself . " I told her I was going upstairs with her , " he said . " I ca n't see now why I had that fool idea . It was n't as if --  " Jessie and Brandon exchanged a glance which was almost the equivalent of a shrug . When Evander Fielding was drunk he was sure to be seized by some such stubborn obsession . " Anyway , " he said , with a horrible sweeping gesture of admission that the thing was sordid beyond their worst conclusions , " after I found out she was n't expecting Lowden I insisted on going up to her apartment with her . I ca n't remember how long it was exactly , but we had a drink and Isabel got more and more jittery . Now I see why , but of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're tight  --  you always get so  --  so  --  " You do , thought Jessie . He went on talking . " All of a sudden we heard the noise of the elevator outside Isabel 's apartment . She nearly had a fit . The doorbell rang and I guess I got pretty rough about it and she said she was expecting somebody on business and had n't she told me not to come up with her anyway . I said what the hell kind of business did she have at five o'clock in the morning but by that time she was in a realp251panic . She shoved me into her bedroom and shut the door . I guess she did n't know what she was doing , she could n't have thought it out . " Fielding clutched his head between his hands . " If she had , she 'd have shoved me into the kitchen and I 'd have gone out the service exit . But there is no way out of that bedroom except through the living-room . " Jessie thought , barely avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So you heard everything that happened after that , " she said . Fielding nodded , his face if possible more nearly green than before . " And  --  " he choked over the thought  --  " and saw it too , finally . Because they got so  --  it was so --  " " It was Spanier who came in ? " " Yes . When I heard his voice through the door I could hardly believe my ears . The way she talked to him . My God ! " He turned his hagridden face questioningly to Brandon . There was silence for a moment while Jessie looked from one man to the other , weighing the monstrosities of knowledge suspended between them , and fitting into place the shocking thing which she had seen flash across Isabel Allen 's face last night . She stared at her husband with so flat and cold a reminder of his own past history in respect to Isabel Allen that Brandon gave a sudden , sharp shrug , turned to Evander Fielding , and said , " Did n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a tone as to heap deprecation and scorn upon the befuddled stupidity of Fielding ; as if to rub his nose in the raw fact that if he had gone adventuring in such a quagmire he should at least have provided himself with maps and charts before setting forth . " No ! " said Fielding , in defiance that rang with hysteria . Jessie saw at once the reason for the voluntary fog in which he must purposely have obscured the identity of Jack Spanier , but they would get to Iris 's place in this nightmare soon enough . Jessie was herself without the pivotal fact which would explain what Brandon was projecting now , and she listened in dull amazementas he said , " Isabel was absolutely blind , crazy , mad about Jack Spanier . Nuts about him . " " You mean , " asked Jessie , knowing that she sounded like an idiot , " she was in love with him ? " " What did you think I meant ? " asked Brandon . " She certainlynever gave a hoot in hell about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue of Isabel Allen 's connections was to Jessie almost unbearable . " For years  --  fifteenp252years , maybe  --  Isabel was in love with Jack Spanier in the way I guess only a woman like that can be . " Jessie suppressed a shudder . " He kicked her around and dragged her through hell  --  " Brandon broke off and looked with sharp anxiety at the clock and then at Evander Fielding . " Look here , " he said , " for God 's sake let 's get to the end of this . It 's late . " " Well , " said Fielding , hopelessly , " you see . That explains it . He came there to get money . An awful lot of money , " he said , in the incredulous tone of a person reading a ghost story aloud . " She did n't have it and she tried to tell him she did n't see how she could get it . " " From Alexander Lowden ? " asked Jessie . " Who else ? " replied Fielding with a hoarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never  --  oh , Christ ! " His voice slid abruptly upward to a screech and in the collapse of his control they saw and heard more than any words could have told them . They sat in silence , Jessie so overcome by disgust and shame that she could scarcely see the two men in front of her ; she had a sharp sense that the only one of her faculties which was functioningwas her hearing , because the ticking of the desk clock seemed so insanely loud and she realized that ordinarily one did not hear this little timepiece at all . " Well , " said Brandon 's voice , after what seemed a long time , " just exactly what did you see , Van ? How did you come to see it ? " " They had this fight , " said Fielding , trying to speak coherently . " Spanier raised such hell threatening her that I was damn near beside myself  --  " He turned on Brandon a look which struck Jessie as intolerably tragic ; it held the wreckage of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd have felt you had to protect a  --  I do n't know  --  an animal , even , from that . And then she cried and pleaded and carried on and tried to get him to  --  to  --  " he clawed at his forehead with his twitching hands andJessie breathed , " Oh , do n't say it , Van . Never mind . " " She only made him madder . I ca n't remember what either of them said , there was such hell going on , but finally she screamed just Jack ' in such a way I guess I thought he was really going to beat her up , and that was when I opened the bedroom door just enough to see through it . They were standing near the fireplace and she was trying to put her arms around his neck and he was looking at her  --  " Fielding stopped speaking and just as Jessie was bracing herself for another explosion of hysteria , he leaned forward slowly and spoke with heavy , horrible clarity . EAST SIDE , WEST SIDE 253 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the look on that man 's face . It was angry , God knows  --  but cold . Not excited , not excited enough for him to have struck her a blow that would kill her . He just pushed her , gave her a shove with the heel of his hand that made her lose her balance . She fell and struck her head on the brass fender of the fireplace . And Spanier  --  " Evander Fielding paused and looked at Jessie and Brandon with eyes which appeared at last to have regained the capacity to focus , but which to Jessie seemed to be trained upon the utmost possible horror , visible only to Fielding . " What did Spanier do ? " asked Brandon . " He put his hands in his pockets , " said Fielding , " and  --  and  --  he shrugged . " Fielding 's forehead was laddered with lines of horrified bewilderment . " Do you suppose he knew she was dead ? " " I do n't know , " replied Fielding , " whether he knew it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then all of a sudden he seemed to get angry all over again . He was just turning away , he had n't bent over her or touched her or even really looked at her , and I could see him stiffen up the way he had been , ugly mad . He kicked the  --  the thing like that . " Fielding pointed at the rack of fire-tools which stood by the hearth on the other side of the room . " He gave it a terrific kick , and knocked the whole thing over and it fell down and those brass things hit Isabel on the head . Then Spanier just turned away and picked up his hat off the couch and walked out . He even slammed the door . " " Did he , " asked Brandon very slowly , " still have his hands in his pockets ? " " I do n't know , " said Fielding , mumbling a little . He stared at Brandon with his mouth open . " I could n't see the front foyer . But I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie . " What did you do , Van ? " " That , " said Brandon , rather gently for him , " is just the trouble . " So Jessie understood that Evander Fielding had done what any normal human being would have done  --  rushed to Isabel Allen , touched her , moved the things around her , acted in spontaneousconcern and fright without the least thought of criminal involvement . " But when I realized that she was dead , " he said , " I  --  you know , it must have been quite a long time that I just stood there feeling paralyzed with no idea what to do . Then of course it began to occur to me that somebody had to be told , something had to happen . Would you know what to do in such a spot ? " he blurted at Jessie , swinging round towards her . " I  --  " she spoke with difficulty  --  " I suppose  --  the police --  " " That 's what he says he thought , " said Brandon , as Fielding clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would just tell them the truth about Spanier and then he realized  --  " Brandon turned his right hand over , palm up , a gesture which said more than enough about fingerprints . " All over the place , you see , " he said , shaking his head . " I tell you , it 's a damn bad mess . Because no matter how it might come out in the end --  " " I see , " said Jessie . They did not need now to go into the horrors of an inquest , an investigation , and all that must follow , about which none of them understood anything at all . " So  --  what did you do , Van ? " she asked . He raised his head , trying so hard to breathe deeply enough to continue speaking that they could see his nostrils pinch and flatten . " I went to Jack Spanier , " he said . " Oh , " said Jessie . And then with what seemed to her the utmost stupidity she asked , " Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glancing again at the clock , for nearly half an hour had passed and they had come to no decision about anything . " Van told Spanier Isabel was dead and that he had seen the whole thing and asked Spanier what he intended to do about it . " " And --  ? " " Spanier told me , " said Fielding , " that the bead was on me . He said I could call in the police if I wanted to but when he  --  when he  --  " Fielding paused and the enormity of the case against him slid , all its components complete , through Jessie 's mind . " Spanier told me , " said Fielding again , his voice thick in the back of his throat , " that he did n't give a damn what I did . But  --  but that after I thought it over he was betting I would find a way to hush the whole thing up unless  --  " he stopped , apparently unable to say any more . They sat for a moment but Jessie , nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , Van ? Unless what ? " " Unless I did n't care anything about Iris , " he muttered . " I see , " said Jessie , sinking back against her chair . " Oh God , " said Fielding , covering his face with his hands again and mumbling from behind them . " The things he said about Iris . " He turned roughly in his chair , put his arms across the back of it , and laying down his head broke into sobs . Jessiep255rose from her chair , unable to endure the spectacle , and went to stand at the window , gazing down at the blue brilliant river and the utterly lovely day in the midst of which the stinking shame of these happenings seemed so wildly unbelievable . It might be a year since the time less than an hour ago when she had felt so perfectly part of all that freshness and radiance . Behind her , Brandon said , " It was after that that Van telephoned me and I told him to go home and change his clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief silence and then Jessie walked across to the desk and picked up the telephone . " What are you going to do ? " cried Fielding in terror , and Brandon exclaimed , " Wait ! " Jessie went on dialling a number . " I am telephoning to Horace Howland , " she said . " Can you think of a better person to ask what to do ? " She said in a moment to Howland , " Horace , something perfectly terrible has happened and I  --  we  --  have no idea what to do . " To her astonishment Howland did not ask her what the trouble was . He said , " I see . Where are you , my dear ? " " At home , " she said . " With Brandon and his  --  our  --  brotherin-law . Could you possibly come here right away ? " " Jessie , " said Horace Howland 's cool , beautifully articulated voice , " I gather it must be the same thing . Serena Lowden telephonedme a few minutes ago . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie , in a flat sag of tone . " Already ? " Fielding and Brandon , listening , exchanged a look of fear and Fielding started from his chair . " What do you mean ? " he shrilled , " ' already ' ? The police ? The newspapers ? " Jessie was saying to Horace Howland , " Not so far as we know . But it 's so late , Horace , anything could --  " " I will be there as soon as I can , " said Howland . " You caught me just leaving the office , because I am on my way to Serena 's . " " But  --  " said Jessie nervously , " I hate to say this , but I 'm afraid our  --  we have to do something even faster than Serena . You see , Van Fielding was there . " Howland was silent for an instant . He said , " Suppose you telephone Serena now and tell her you have spoken to me and ask if she could manage to go to your house and meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They are all going to have to face it together anyway , " he said.  | Jessie put down the telephone and turned to Brandon , who was once again pacing the end of the room , running his hand through his hair ; and Fielding , leaning over the back of a chair , his eyes senselessly hanging upon Jessie . " The Lowdens know , " she said . " How ? " asked Brandon , which Jessie ignored . " That means  --  " mumbled Fielding , clutching the chair . " Anything , " said Jessie , picking up the telephone again . " We will hear soon enough now . " " EITHER , " said Horace Howland to the circle of faces hanging upon each of his words , " a doctor signs a certificate of death from natural causes , giving the direct reason ; or , death of any other sort  --  accidental , violent , anything that could happen to a person  --  must be reported to the police . And from there on  --  " his quiet gesture indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide squad , the whole machinery of the law , would move into action within a few moments . Jessie sat thinking : but this is insane , obscene , impossible , this can not be us , that can not be Horace , talking to us about such a thing . Not Horace Howland ! In the pause which felt to her a bottomless hell of frightened silence , she turned her head and looked at Serena Lowden . The lovely remote profile with its deep-lidded eyes and delicate mouth had the look of a clay mask ; Jessie imagined it to be hardening in proportion to the inward anguish which it must conceal . She had learned in a few murmured words upon the Lowdens ' arrival what had happened to them this morning . Jack Spanier had gone to Alexander Lowden and had demanded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars , on the threat of tipping off the police and all the newspapers about Isabel Allen . " Alexander as much as told the man that he refused , for of course he had nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then he realized that that would make no difference . He told the  --  that man  --  that he would speak to him again by two o'clock . Alexander " said Mrs. Lowden , " could not  --  hisp257position could not  --  survive the scandal . Nor  --  " with a glance so fleeting that Jessie was just aware of it , Serena Lowden had indicated Evander Fielding . It was an unbearable , grotesque injustice , but Serena Lowden had made clear her acceptance of the urgency of protecting the Fielding family together with her own . It seemed to Jessie the depth of abomination that two such men as Lowden and Fielding might escape the direct consequence of their acts through the intervention of a woman like Serena Lowden . " But Serena , " Jessie had said , " even if you should  --  " she swallowed nervously and bit her lips , for only to seek the words to discuss such a thing with Serena was torment , " if you should give  --  pay  --  the money , you could never be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " said Serena Lowden . " That is perhaps the vilest part . " " But what will you do ? Pay the money and then  --  ? " " I do n't know , my dear . It is not the money as money that Icare about , it is the  --  whether that man  --  you understand . " " Oh , surely Horace will find a way . He must . " Serena Lowden had only shaken her head faintly and sighed . And now with the time racing on , a little before one o'clock already , they were still sitting here in Jessie 's quiet sunny library listening to Horace Howland , the unlikeliest person in the world , discuss what they ought to do about a disreputable woman lying dead in a grubby apartment whose nastiness of soiled furniture and curtains , sticky glasses , reeking ashtrays and bad air Jessie was envisioning with disgust . " Therefore , " continued Horace Howland , " there is no choice except to find a physician who is willing to sign a certificate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy thing to do  --  it could very well be impossible . " Jessie stared at him , conscious of what it was that people meant when they used the phrase , " to look through the wrong end of a telescope . " More clearly than any part of what she saw here , she could picture scenes of ten or twenty years ago when this wise and gentle man had been integral with treasured memories of her mother , and with poignant passages of her own life . This , she thought , is too fantastic to be borne ; and turning her head she encountered the sight of Alexander Lowden , sitting panic-stricken , the rags of his false self-importance clinging about him like straws to a clod emerging from a haystack . If he had not been the precipitant of so much danger , he wouldp258have been supremely ridiculous . His queer turtle-like eyes which had always suggested his faculty for duplicity and evasiveness were now slanted downwards in his intent not to look directly at anybody ; Jessie could also see his glance slide nervously towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so have dramatized the hollowness of the man 's bombast about his " position " as this admission that it could , like Cinderella'sjoys , vanish on the stroke of an appointed hour . But that is what Serena will prevent , thought Jessie , and she could not help but ponder why . why . . . as if you do not know ! she rebuked herself . As if we are not all committed to this wretched venture in equal helpless acquiescence . Self-preservation , yes , she thought , and all that that can mean , but responsibility also , this iron collar which Serena has worn for so many years , and I too in different degree . She looked about the room again , observing the paralysis in which Howland 's last words had left each of these people . Somebody had to say what all of them were thinking , but what none could bring himself to say . Jessie spoke at last , with a sense of fearing the sound of her own voice . " Does any of us , " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing  --  take such a risk  --  for his sake ? " There was another silence . Then Brandon said , " Of course there are lots of doctors who skate around the fringe  --  there must be some who do this sort of thing as a  --  a --  " " A sideline ? " asked Jessie , with scorn in her voice which she wished she could have concealed . Horace Howland said quickly , " I think that is precisely the sort of character that we do not want to bring in . Is it not enough , " he asked , with a frankly baleful look first at Lowden and then at Fielding , " to be at the mercy of a man like Spanier ? " " Yes , " said Brandon , " but a doctor who has broken the law or connived at a  --  at something , is so vulnerable himself that --  " " Brandon , we had better leave this to Mr. Howland , " said Serena Lowden sharply . Jessie felt the blood surging to her face ; she turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , " said Horace Howland , " this does not begin and end with the doctor alone . What we are really facing is the need to make a plan around the entire matter , which will take every aspect of it into account . You realize , of course , that you are not going to keep Mrs. Allen 's death out of the newspapersaltogether . " He watched the faces of the three men fall into appalled consternation . Fielding 's mouth hung open . " Youp259cannot ; and if you tried you would precipitate exactly the hue and cry that you want to avoid . The woman is sufficiently conspicuous so that she can not die without the usual newspaper notices appearing in the normal way . To suppose anything else would be insanity . You , " he said , looking at Alexander Lowden , " realize that , do you not ? " Lowden nodded , with shame as repellent as his former pomposity at its boldest . He was far too experienced a newspapermannot to have known what Howland had pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the danger to himself and his fear that all the rival newspapers of The Press would break out with the full scandal while he was trying to suppress it . Howland waited as if for someone else to make a suggestion , but since nobody did , he continued . " So it seems to me that some very simple consecutive story must be decided upon as being what happened to Mrs. Allen from the time she reached home last night  --  or this morning , more exactly  --  and the time it will be reported , as vaguely as possible , that she died today . " There appeared now in Evander Fielding 's distraught face the semblance of some effort at thought . He was following Horace Howland 's words with painful , scowling attention . BrandonBourne , sprawled in his chair , his feet twisted in the same ugly disposition as Jessie remembered Iris Fielding 's a day or two ago , smoked assiduously and gazed at the ceiling . Jessie realized that he wished not to look at Horace Howland . It can not be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for him ; it would not occur to Brandon that anybody could feel so about him . She remembered instances of suffering because of some rash or cruel or angry act of Brandon 's , when she had suppressed the urge to scream , " What makes you think you can do this thing and go scot-free ! I will make you know how hateful you are , I will make you realize it . I will make you see how others hate you too ! " But she never had . Now she could sit here as coldly disdainful as Serena Lowden , and look at the well-shaped planes of Brandon Bourne 's face , and wonder with acid curiosity how she could so helplessly have loved this man and struggled so long to hold him . All the while she sat with her hands folded in her lap , her face intent upon Horace Howland , her mind the only one in the room which was working together with his , disciplined to the execution of a detestable necessity because there was nothing else to do . Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go in forcing himself to acute , precise thinking in a range that was absolutely alien to his instincts . Horace ! thought Jessie , Horace who will not touch a case which has the slightest human ill-savor , and here he is descending to this unendurablebeastliness to protect Serena and me . She listened as Howland said slowly , " I believe that if we follow this plan , this hypothesis of stating what happened fictitiously , so to speak , we will then fit in the necessary identities , if we can find them , to make the picture complete . " He leaned back in his chair , braced by his elbows , with his hands placed palms together , and said , " Let us say that for some weeks or months past , Mrs. Allen had been under the care of a well-known specialist in some type of serious illness which , in the nature of her activities , she was extremely anxious to conceal . Something which could terminate fatally , quite suddenly . Let us say that she had been warned not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and no late hours , which she had disobeyed . You realize , " said Howland , with a resigned sigh , " that everybody close to Mrs. Allen must have this clearly in mind , because  --  " he shrugged delicately as the swiftest way to dismiss what they all nervously understood , the flurry of gossip which would briefly follow tomorrowmorning 's news , until the next sensation came along to supersede it . " Upon reaching home from the Whitelaw party she felt very ill and , naturally , she became panicky . She was afraid to be alone ; that was what she told some woman friend to whom she telephoned , asking her to come at once . Now we must decide just who that woman friend could have been . " Howland looked about the room , as if inviting each person to make a suggestion . But the faces remained as blank as before , some of them even more baffled , for the roster of Isabel Allen 's women friends was bizarre at best , and , as Howland now pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself ; such personalities were too vulnerable to scandal . " Phyllis ? " asked Jessie of Serena , raising her eyebrows . Mrs. Lowden shook her head . " Not at all , " she said . " Besides , I do not think we should drag Oliver into this . " " No , " said Howland . " Some older woman , with a far less well-known name . A plain , capable sort of woman , remote enough from the rest of Mrs. Allen 's acquaintance to be outside the spotlight . I think it safe to say , " he added , " that all conspicuous or  --  eh  --  notorious people have such connections . I think we have all had experience of that . "  |p261Jessie  bit her lip , for an idea was beginning to form in her mind . A plain , older woman , vigorously not of Isabel Allen 's definition , and necessarily , no fool . A woman shrewd and wise and somebody who would have a motive for willingness to do this dangerous and disagreeable thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as possible , was admitted by Mrs. Allen , and helped her to go to bed . It was then , say , about five o'clock this morning . The friend did not realize the seriousness of Mrs. Allen 's symptoms . But after sleeping for a length of time , Mrs. Allen appeared to be , late this morning , in a state of acute illness . Her friend then telephoned for her physician . He arrived about noon , to find Mrs. Allen in very grave condition , and he remained with her until she died . Naturally , the friend  --  " Alexander Lowden raised his white head , its handsome arroganceall collapsed , and asked , " I do n't exactly see why all this about the friend --  " " Because , " replied Howland , with tartness so crisp that it became almost visible contempt , " because there is a time element of speculation as to who might have been with Mrs. Allen during the night , or what remained of it ; or whether anybody was with her at all . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could probably not have telephoned to the doctor herself , or admitted him to her apartment so close to the time when she supposedly died . And also  --  " Howland 's expression became even grimmer  --  " because I am coming to the real point of just exactly what is to be done  --  now . You remember . The  --  ah  --  Mrs. Allen is still lying there in that flat . " Lowden 's head went down between his humped shoulders , and his eyes to the floor . Fielding and Brandon Bourne exchanged a look . " We have no choice now , " said Howland , " except to throw ourselves upon somebody 's mercy , and such a woman as I have described is the safest sort of person to choose . Obviously none of you can be the woman who has been in Mrs. Allen 's apartment since five o'clock this morning . " Jessie made a quiet exclamation , rather to her own surprise . Howland looked at her in question . She stared back with meaningmore cogent to him than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that apartment ? " asked Howland as if they had had a detailed conversation about the person in Jessie 's mind . " And does she know the doctor who will join her there ? "  | The three other men and Serena Lowden sat stupid with amazement and suspense , watching Jessie and Howland . " She knows him very well , " said Jessie . She felt as if she must be talking in her sleep ; no part of this idea seemed to be her own , or within her own power to arrange . " I will telephone her now . " She rose to leave the room . Lowden looked up at her with dumb anxiety as to what she meant to do , but without the courage to inquire . Fielding jumped forward as he had when Jessie had telephoned Horace Howland , but Jessie ignored him . On her way upstairs to her own room where she could telephone privately , she realized that Althea Crowe must be out at lunch . But suddenly the heavy voice boomed " Hello ! " and Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so afraid you would be out . " " What the hell , " said Althea Crowe . " When you stood me up I decided to have a sandwich and a beer at my desk and do a day 's work for a change . But why are n't you out with dreamboat ? " Jessie told her . " Is that so ? " was Althea Crowe 's comment , spoken slowly and with extraordinarily little surprise . " Right in the groove , is n't it ? " " How amazing you are , Althea . " It was indeed typical of her that she should see this thing panoramically ; if one surveyed life as objectively as Althea Crowe , one must lose the capacity to be surprised when women like Isabel Allen met violent deaths . They met them all the time , reflected Jessie ; they committed suicide by jumping from high windows and inhaling carbon monoxide in automobiles and taking lethal quantities of sedative drugs ; or they died like Isabel , in shadows which the convergence of public and private influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate too deeply . With her blue blade of a mind Althea Crowe cut across Jessie 's troubled and hesitant preliminariesand said , " I see . " There was a pause while Jessie knew her to be weighing the possibility of success in carrying through the ruse , for Althea Crowe would not undertake any venture unless she felt  --  she would say  --  mathematically sure of succeeding . Jessie held the telephone , staring meanwhile at her reflection in a mirror across the room . She looked at her own face with a sense of crazy unreality , feeling that she had lost the power to know through which of several different lenses her mind 's eye could discern her real self . Then Althea Crowe said , " All right , Jess . I 'll do it . "  |p263Jessie  knew that this was no moment , either in time or mood , to try to thank Althea Crowe . Instead she made her own voice as precise as possible and she asked , " What about Reath , Althea ? Shall I speak to him now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Althea . " You stay out of his corner in this . He may have some way of  --  anyway , leave it to us . I want a key , right away . " " I 'll send Josephine with it . Where do you want her ? " " My office . She 'll be on her way while I 'm talking to Reath . Good bye , Jess . " Downstairs again Jessie opened the library door and called Alexander Lowden out to the hall . He came , stooped , shuffling , looking a raddled old man . " I want the key to Isabel 's apartment , " said Jessie brusquely . Lowden opened his mouth , an uneasy glimmer in his eyes . Jessie said , " Please do n't waste time proposing you have n't got the key . If it is not in your pocket , where is it ? " Lowden swallowed and drew a gold key-chain from his pocket . With fumbling fingers he detached a Yale key and handed it to Jessie . " Does this open both doors ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment upstairs ? " Lowden nodded . Jessie motioned him back to the library and took the key to her room . When Josephine had left with it Jessie sank into the low chair near the bedside table and heard herself , with surprise , utter a strange , weary sound , neither a groan nor a wail , but resembling both . She bent her head , pressing her temples hard between the thumb and fingers of her right hand , holding her eyes closed as if that could help to shut out the hideousness through which she had been struggling and must still further make her way . After a moment she opened her eyes and looked at her bed , made up for the day now , closed , beautiful , discreet , the rough rosy silk of the coverlet falling in sculptured folds to the carpet . She tried to make herself believe that less than three hours ago she had been lying in that bed , alight with the supremest joy , talking to Mark Dwyer who had been transcendentlyimportant to her . And now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in a crowd . " Oh my God , " said Jessie aloud . " My God , my God . " Her sense of unreality had become so great in the midst of this morning'snightmare , that Mark Dwyer too had lost identity . She sat frowning , confused and shaken , trying to recapture the mood which had enclosed the beginning of the morning , with all itsp264magic anticipation . But she only found herself dully disbelieving that it could have been true . " Oh , yes , " she said finally , half aloud . " I did say I would let him know . " At least , she thought , as she dialled the number of the Ritz , I can prevent his wasting any more of the day , when he has so little time in New York . His voice brought warmth to her chilled , shocked nerves . But it is only comforting , she thought , as she listened to him asking how he could help ; only consolation , not enchantment , not anything that was coming into bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " she said quietly . " I 'm so grateful to you , Mark , and if there were anything you could do I would n't hesitate to ask you . " " Would you mind , " asked Mark very slowly , " would it seem too intruding if I asked you a question or two ? " " No , " she said , " except that this --  " " I see . " She was quite right in her reluctance to talk through a hotel switchboard . " I only had the newspapers in mind , " he said . " I think I could help there . " " Could you ? " asked Jessie . He took that almost as permission to go ahead and do what he could . " But not before --  " " I understand . I think you can leave that to me . " " Thank you , " she murmured , because she could think of nothing else to say . At this point some part of her mind was blankly inquiring just who this man was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Can I reach you later in the afternoon if I telephone ? " , he asked . " Why not ? " " I wo n't keep you now , then . Bless you , my dear . " As she reentered the library Jessie thought first of the time . It was just short of half past one . The Lowdens and Fielding and Brandon were sitting as she had left them , all silent , all turningtheir eyes from Horace Howland , who was at the desk concluding a telephone conversation , to Jessie , shutting the door . Tacit questions lay in each face , some that must be answered , some which deserved only to be ignored . Jessie conveyed silently to Howland that Althea Crowe had taken her assignment in hand , and Howland said , " My office has been in touch with  --  " his face showed disgust at having to pronounce the name  --  " the man Spanier . I have delayed giving him his answer at two o'clock by arranging that he come here . But he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as if it had been suggested to bringp265something foetid into her house . " And how did he consent --  " " My dear , I did not ask him here from choice . " Howland spoke so distantly that Jessie winced for having forced him . " I believe that he will find himself at the greatest possible disadvantagehere and --  " " But surely he knows that himself . And also that time is on our side . " " Certainly . But , you see , he also knows that he is guilty of manslaughter . It makes no difference that Fielding here did not realize it  --  nor the rest of you . Naturally Spanier was not going to point it out . " " Then  --  " Jessie 's hands went up in a gesture of vast , relieved dismissal . At the same moment she saw that nobody else reflected such feelings , and Horace Howland said , " Not quite , my dear . It is not quite so simple . Spanier does not get convicted of manslaughterwithout an inquest , an indictment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preventing that . Fielding and Lowden would both be dragged through it and , worse , their families . No , Spanier remains as dangerous as ever , and now we have to use his tactics too . He is gambling that he gets what he has demanded , and we must gamble at his level . There is no defense against a blackmailer except to hold some knowledge over him as ruinous as his over his victim  --  worse , if possible . And it must be knowledge about something in which one is totally uninvolvedoneself  --  that is the weakness in the matter of Mrs. Allen 's death , and you may be sure that Spanier knows it . But I tend to think  --  " and Howland paused . " This town is full of people who know enough to jail Spanier , " said Brandon , coming down with a thump on the front legs of his chair . " Say , Jess , " he added , " can you have them fix something to eat ? " " I 've asked for some sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Okay , " said Brandon . " Who do we know who has the works on Spanier ? " Jessie 's mind stirred with dislike for Brandon 's way of speaking ; it was meaningless slang , but its flippancy at a time like this was disturbing . As if for corroboration when she had need of it , she turned and met the glance of Serena Lowden . Mrs. Lowden 's face was if possible more frozen than before , but the heaviness of her eyes proved her despairing concern with every word that was said . Jessie watched her as she turned about and levelled her gaze at Evander Fielding . " I think , " she said , her voice falling like drops of ice-waterp266in their ears , " your daughter may be such a person , Evander . " Fielding 's putty-colored face turned a dull , shamed red as they watched him . His head came up as if to defy the slur upon his daughter , and then went slowly down between his shoulders again . It was , thought Jessie , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which Sarah brought in a coffee tray and a dish of sandwiches and arranged them on the tea-table in the corner . When she had left the room Jessie said , " Please help yourselves if you wish something to eat . " She queried Serena Lowden silently , who shook her head , and then Jessie said , " I agree with Serena . I think , actually , that Iris is too  --  ingenuoustounderstand much of the truth about Spanier , but I think she should be here , anyway  --  and Millicent too . Iris had better learn once for all just what she has been mixed up in . And , " Jessie added ruthlessly , " what it has cost her father and the rest of us . " " That still leaves us looking for somebody who really has the dirt , " said Brandon . It was Lowden then who looked up with a sigh , and for the first time appeared to dare to speak at all . " I should think Henry Greenberg is the man , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distaste which colored Horace Howland 's face seemed to Jessie the least surprising of sights . Yet she knew that Howland would weigh the usefulness of Greenberg , completely dominating his feelings with his reason . She said , " I think we all realize that Henry is a dangerous man but -- - " " He is less dangerous than Spanier in this situation , " said Howland . From the corner where he was pouring a cup of coffee Brandon said , " You ca n't stop to be so particular now . Henry fishes in this kind of muck all the time and he may haul something up for us . " " That is perfectly true , " said Horace Howland . " On the other hand , " said Jessie , thinking carefully as shespoke , " Henry will do nothing without his pound of flesh . " " Whose noose would you rather be in ? " asked Brandon withhis mouth full . " Brandon is right , my dear , " said Horace Howland . He examined his watch doubtfully . " But Greenberg is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out at lunch . " Brandon was at the desk , about to telephone for Henry Greenberg . " Then he 's at Twenty-One , " he said . " He 's never out of reach of a telephone . Here , " he said , beckoning to Lowden , " you talk to him . "  | " You may as well send for Iris , Evander , " said Serena Lowden . Jessie crossed the room and bent over Horace Howland 's shoulder . The speculation about Greenberg had thrown her mind back for the moment to last night 's party , which the happenings of the morning had obliterated . How very curious , she thought , that only now am I remembering Harry Blitzer 's warnings . I am becoming an imbecile . Why did n't I think of this right in the beginning ? She told Howland now what Harry Blitzer had said . " Let 's get him here at once , by all means , then . He 's all right , that man . " " Oh , " said Jessie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? But for years , child . " " Of course , " she said . She put her hand to her forehead . " I must be losing my wits , Horace . " " I should say that the provocation was extreme , " he murmured . " I 'll go and try to reach Harry Blitzer , " she whispered to Howland . She went again to her own room . His office told her that Blitzer was still at home , and Jessie remembered thankfully his queer Broadway habits ; he spent the night in circulation , wound up with a weird meal at Lindy 's , and went to bed at seven o'clock in the morning . His voice when he answered the telephone was thick with sleep and the coarse morning roughness of the heavy cigar-smoker . But he reacted so fast to Jessie 's few words about Jack Spanier that she could almost imagine she heard his brains click into action . He promised to come as quickly as possible . She put down the telephone and sat back to try once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to her that they were scattered . The telephone buzzed and Jessie jumped so sharply at the noise that she felt ill with the rawness of her nerves . Althea Crowe said " Jess ? " " Yes , " said Jessie . She looked to make sure that the switchoffkey was down . " What  --  how --  " " So far so good , " said Althea . " The bus is on its way over . " " Oh , God , " said Jessie , feeling a faint unnatural moisture spring to her forehead and the palms of her hands . There flashed then through her mind , in precise tandem form , two thoughts : how she would never in her life be able to compensate Althea Crowe for this unbelievable service , and how miserably undeservingof it its beneficiaries were . " Has  --  are  --  " she scarcely knew what she wanted to ask Althea , but she realized too that any questions would be dangerous . She paused.  | " There 's a sister in Wapwallopen , Pennsylvania , " said Althea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a snap of hysteria which sent a mad laugh into the telephone . " Where did you say ? " " Only what I found in the desk while I was cleaning house , " said Althea drily . She paused to give the fullest possible import to what she had said , and then she continued while Jessie listened in a haze of relief mingled with awe at her boldness . " Apparently our dolly came from there , " said Althea . " I called up the sister . She will reach town this evening and take baby home with her . She 's as sore as a boil . Says dolly has never been anything but a pain in the neck to them and I should please  --  " Althea gave an equine snicker  --  " keep her out of the papers . " " Oh , God , " said Jessie again . " So I 'll meet Mrs. Katzenschwanz --  " " What ? " shrieked Jessie , surrendering to idiocy at last . " Look , " said Althea . " I did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meet Mrs. Katzenschwanz at the Penn Station and by God she wo n't be out of my sight until she 's back on the train with dolly . " " Oh , Althea . " " I do n't mind . By the way , how are you making out at your end ? " Jessie explained . " Anh . " The noise through the wire was a type of grunt ; Althea Crowe was thinking . " You can always ask that bastard a question or two about that Thorne girl , you know . " " You mean  --  really ? Did he , was he  --  ? " " Well , " said Althea Crowe thoughtfully . " Who is to say , Jess ? Who is going to say three years from now exactly what happened about all this today ? " " Why , yes , " said Jessie . She felt extraordinarily naive . " Why of course . " " That 's just what we are doing now , " said Althea . " When we are through we will have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be talking mostly through their hats . We 're buying the hats , right now . " " But  --  the Thorne girl . You knew her , did n't you ? " " Sure . She worked for me for a while . She was a flyweight . Drifted around and got into some show or other and fetched up with Spanier . The usual thing with that kind . I had n't seen herp269for a long time , but I did see her a day or two before she died . " " You did ? " " Jessie , my dear , do n't get so melodramatic about this . Just  --  try to see it for what it was , the same thing that happens every day . The kid was in the usual jam and she came and asked me what to do . So I told her and the next thing I knew she was dead . But that was n't necessarily enough to make her commit suicide , my God if it were , the town would be strewn with female corpses every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars or whatever she needed and he probably pushed her in the face . But one of you can tell him --  " And Jessie listened carefully to Althea Crowe . IT IS true , thought Jessie , that when the unbelievable happens , the utterly grotesque , one sits in the midst of it and finds it familiar in the same way that the most horrible bad dream is never novel ; one has dreamt it often before . Not in the wildest imaginable nightmare could I have contrived to bring together in such a way , for such reasons , all of the people in this room . Yet now that they are here I am without surprise , I feel as if I had been through it on some occasion before . She turned her head slowly and examined one by one the faces ranged about her ; and when she came to Jack Spanier , though she averted her eyes to suppress visible evidence of her disgust , she could still not achieve that sense of astonishment at his presence here which would have relieved her , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended in a heavy , tangible silence which had followed the last words that they had heard , a slow and thoughtful admonition from Horace Howland to Spanier to considerwell the meaning of the presence of each individual here . Iris Fielding and her mother were isolated in a corner , seated side by side upon a small settee , curiously erased in personality ; they were one-dimensional , it seemed to Jessie , as if they had been squashed flat by a steam-roller like the idiotic clowns ' turn in the circus , where nothing remains but a great paper doll . Harry Blitzer , gross and crude and blue-jowled , his clever270 EAST SIDE , WEST SIDEp270pop-eyes moving from warmest devotion for Jessie to shrewd peril for Spanier , belied in character everything that his physical presence proclaimed . And Henry Greenberg over there , Jessie realized , is the precise opposite  --  kindly , easygoing Henry with those steel-rimmed spectacles and that benign , soothing manner  --  think what lies behind it ! In some way the two men had contrived to place Jack Spanier , cocky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His dark beads of eyes switched constantly from one face to the next , boldly roving round and round the room . Horace Howland , seated at Jessie 's desk with his frail hands quietly folded before him , created the grave impression of sitting in judgment , which Jessie knew , for all his fineness , to be no accident . If he must deal , she thought , in the cheap stuff of charlatanry he will carry off a better show than those who make a trade of it . She watched Henry Greenberg 's face , aware that for such a personality , driven by a perverted craving to hold power over others , it must be insufferable to see a man like Howland calmly assume the mastery of this situation . Yet Henry is so clever , Jessie knew , that he concedes he could not possibly have done so dramatic a thing so well . And he is utterly overjoyed to be here , to be in on this . He will never let Alec Lowden forget it for one breath , all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact for his cooperation now , Jessie had not the courage to weigh . Serena Lowden sat near her husband , her head raised and poised with the majestic remoteness of a queen , her eyes fixed upon Howland , directed icily past Spanier . Evander Fielding had succeeded almost in obliterating himself ; he was shrunken and silent in a chair , his chin in one hand , his eyes lowered . And Brandon  --  Jessie sighed . Perhaps it was as well , it lent a variety of mood to the grotesque gathering , at least . Brandon had sat as long as he could ; his physical restlessness had reached the peak of compelling impatience where he could no longer remain in a chair , and he was standing by the fireplace , one arm on the mantel , crossing and recrossing his feet as he shifted his weight from time to time . There stood upon the mantel a pair of very old miniature girandoles which had belonged to Rosa Landau , small blossoms of prismed brilliance , and each time that Brandon in his kinetic inquietude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urge to tell him to be careful . Ah well , she told herself , you should have learned to bear that by now , you have far more critical things to worry about . And she turned to listen to Horace Howland.  |p271He  was speaking , in manner and voice so much the classic image of a great judge upon the bench that he compelled the eyes , the mind , and the will of every person in the room . He said , " To sum this matter up , Mr. Spanier , I will now review exactly what your situation is in relation to each person present here , and to others with whom they are connected . " First , in respect to the death of Mrs. Isabel Allen . Mr. Evander Fielding is prepared if necessary to testify and to describeexactly what he witnessed , which resulted in the death of Mrs. Allen . You hold nothing over Mr. Fielding . You not only have , by your own admission to him early this morning , no personalevidence that he was in Mrs. Allen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever that he was present there , innocent as that presence was . " ( Oh , thought Jessie , God bless Althea Crowe ; and for an hysterical instant she faced the incredible image of that trumpeting elephant of a woman , grimly scrubbing down that evil place . She composed her face with care . ) " On the subject , " continued Horace Howland , keeping his fine eyes coldly upon Jack Spanier , " on the subject of your character and your habits , which would be inextricable from the issue should it ever receive public hearing , there is the word of Miss Iris Fielding , who is prepared if necessary to repeat in court those statements about you which she has made here during the past hour . " Sitting with her head bent to avoid the sight of Iris and Millicent , Jessie heard the loud uneasy breathing of all the others , burdened with shame for the girl and for a father who could have dragged her into this . Howland continued speaking . " You have brought into this matter certain questions relatingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a period of several years past . You have heard Mr. Lowden admit , and Mrs. Lowden agree , that that friendship has been a matter of such general knowledge that there is no way in which you could embarrass Mr. and Mrs. Lowden by threats of public exposure of it at this time , or ever . " Pursuing the all-important matter of your personal and professional record , which , I repeat , would be cited in any open issue brought in these connections , you have heard Mr. Harry Blitzer declare that he can produce evidence by which you could be proved liable to prosecution for certain specific financial improbitiesand dishonesties in connection with theatrical undertakings . Mr. Blitzer has knowledge of your collusive dishonestyp272together with a Mrs. Emily Sanders , in connection with falsified accounts of funds raised at two large theatrical benefits for war philanthropies during the past year . I believe that these facts in Mr. Blitzer 's possession have made clear the uselessness of your attempting to give information to any newspaper about any elementof this afternoon 's discussion , and particularly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now employed . " Jessie looked up suddenly to meet a cold blue stare from Brandon ; and as if correcting herself , she bent her head again , not wanting to read his mind . She listened carefully to Howland . " Again , " he said , " in respect to your own reputation : you have heard Mr. Henry Greenberg cite three specific instances of dealings that he has had with you , or in which he has represented as counsel those who have had dealings with you , any one of which is sufficient to make you liable to various processes of law . " " Finally , you have heard Mrs. Brandon Bourne , in the presence of these witnesses , declare her knowledge of the existence of a letter , which would be produced should you make it necessary . The letter was written by a certain Miss Leda Thorne on the day before she was found dead , presumably a suicide . The contents of the letter are such as to furnish proof which any court would find incontrovertible , that Miss Thorne was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you ; that this fear was directly involved with her violent death ; that these proofs would be sufficient to reopen the medical examiner 's verdictof suicide ; all of which , I may add , would come , at this time , well within the statute of limitations . " Horace Howland paused , gazing sternly across the desk at the ten faces ranged opposite him . Of them all , only Serena Lowden and Jessie Bourne met his eyes squarely , although Henry Greenberg was gazing in his direction with a mild , quizzical expression which might mean anything , but which Jessie interpretedas wondering , if reluctant , admiration . Harry Blitzer was looking at Jack Spanier with the rough , final disgust that might have marked his knocking out a mug in a brawl . Brandon Bourne , lighting a cigarette , remained peculiarly impassive which was unusual , since the hard , open planes of his face had never enabled him successfully to veil his reactions , had he found it important to do so . It was part of his strange , intent arrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their eyes downcast , forcing uponp273Howland the cynical knowledge that , escaped or not , they felt intolerably their disgrace and guilt , in a degree of shame of which Jack Spanier was proving himself incapable . He sat , still raking the room and the people with insolent eyes ; upon his pointed , weasel face he wore a snide grin . Howland shut out the sight by a faint motion of his deep eyelids ; even more deliberately than before , he said , " Therefore , upon the strength of the combinedknowledge of facts and circumstances concerning you which I have just reviewed , you will kindly sign this waiver of claims and threats against all the concerned persons whose names are appended , and against all members of their families and their associates who are included . " And he pushed across to the front of the desk the papers which he and Henry Greenberg had hastily put together , while waiting for the arrival of Spanier . Greenberg had expressed doubt as to their legal validity and Howland had echoed that they were , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their psychological effect upon Spanier would be the only result that mattered . Spanier shrugged , lifted himself vulgarly from his chair , ambled to the desk and , taking a fountain pen from his pocket , signed the papers spread before him , after so cursory a glance down the sheets as to dismiss them contemptuously . Gravely Horace Howland and Henry Greenberg affixed their signatures as witnesses , and Howland said , scarcely permitting a moment to intervene , " Brandon , will you please show Mr. Spanier out ? " As the library door shut loudly behind them  --  in her relief Jessie felt that for once in her life she was grateful to Brandon for slamming a door  --  Harry Blitzer said something to Henry Greenberg in words which nobody else understood , but which elicited a thick snicker from Greenberg . Jessie 's one idea now was to stir the group up , get them moving , get them out . This was no time either to thank those who had so amazingly been of help , or to excoriate those who had dragged them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , making uncertain motions in the direction of breaking away , for this had been so fantastic an experience that there was no precedent for extricating oneself from it . Harry Blitzer was standing in the window embrasure , talking to Horace Howland , and Jessie moved over to join them for a moment . She smiled at both men with feeling so deep that they saw the tears standing unshed in her eyes , and Blitzer , squeezing her hand , said , " She looks more like Rosie all the time , heh ? "  | " I told her so just the other day , " said Horace Howland with a tender smile . " You 've been splendid , Harry . Just  --  " he gestured . " Just as I 'd have said you would be . " Blitzer nodded and smiled warmly . " And why not ? Neveh mind how I hate that slob , to me Jess is another Rosie . Well , " he said , extending his pudgy , jewelled , hairy hand , " I got ta run . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thumb and forefinger joined in a circle , the hand flipped from a stiff wrist , which marks the special approval of his peculiar world ; and Jessie accompanied him out to the hall . " You 're such a darling , Harry , " she said , as they stood waiting for the elevator . " Nah . It all shook down , that 's all . What a prince , that Howland , " he said , wagging his head . " A real prince . " " You 've known him a long time , " Jessie mused . " And how . My God , since he began going with your mama . Jeez , that 's a long time ago . " " It seems funny in a way , that you and he became friends . " " Nu ? " shrugged Blitzer . " Should I hate him on account of Rosie ? No , I should love him . So  --  " He made a sign of wonder at the years that had fled . " It 's good , " said Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , all your life . Where did you first see him ? " Blitzer squinted . " Lemme see . Maybe  --  no  --  wait , I got it . On a Staten Island ferryboat , one Sunday afternoon . Well  --  " he grinned . " So long , honey . " She stood at the door , shaken by fatigue , by her thoughts , by the great vibrating arc of memory , by the discovery of iron strength in old , forgotten links , by glimpses into a buried , tightlyknittedworld which seemed a safer and a better place than this in which her visible life was lived . But it is wonderful , she thought , it is beyond belief that by turning back to all that , to the people in it , I can find safety . " Do n't forget , honey , " Harry Blitzer had said on his way out , " you still got an ace up your sleeve if that bastard eveh lets out another yip . " She had had no idea what he meant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . Your cousin Louis Schwartz . He 's a big shot in the Department , did n't you know ? " " I did know , " she said slowly . " In a way . But I 've never  --  it sounds crazy to you , Harry , I know --  " " Listen , " he said . " Nothing sounds crazy to me . I neveh see anything but nuts . " " Well  --  since I 've never seen Louis , I would n't like to turnp275to him suddenly for the first time when I am in trouble . That 's not  --  you know , Harry . " " Sure I know . But look , people like Louis do n't want to know you just because  --  " he gestured to indicate the world and all its accoutrements to which Rosa Landau had risen and carriedher daughter with her . " You 'd be surprised . People 's folks takewhat happens to them for granted . You get rich , you get famous , 4 okay so you get rich and famous . Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everything . " Jessie had listened with fascinated appreciation . " So if you got any more trouble , you give me a buzz and I 'll tell Louis , " Blitzer had said . That was when he had rung for the elevator and Jessie had stood there waiting with him , talking about Horace Howland . After the elevator door closed upon him she had turned back into the foyer of her apartment , and she was standing there , leaning back upon the closed front door with her hands clasped behind her , groping inwardly for a moment 's peace , when Brandon came out of the library , escorting Henry Greenberg to the door . Jessie was immensely grateful that Greenberg made a quick departure ; she thanked him as fervently as she knew would please him and , indeed , as he really deserved . Then Brandon said , leading her into the empty drawingroom , " Jess , I think we ought to  --  well , you know , sort of anticipatethe kind of talk that will start tomorrow when the papers come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sew up Van and Alec in --  " " Oh , Brandon , " she sighed . She sank into a chair and leaned her head back , and felt the weakness of utter exhaustion flickering up and down her limbs and her spine . " I am so tired . " Her voice broke a little . " I know , " he said , in an unusually sympathetic way . " It 's a hell of a note . Personally I 'd like to get royally plastered to forget the goddam mess . But we 're in this so deep already --  " " I suppose you 're right . What do you suggest ? " " What 's going on tonight ? " It was like him to speak as if he took it for granted , like other husbands , that his wife would have made plans for both of them ; it seemed not to occur to him that she might be engaged quite differently in view of their peculiar situation of his own making . " I have some people coming for dinner . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " Friends of my own , I 'm afraid , " said Jessie wearily . " Peoplep276you do n't care for much . Sam and Helen and the Blocks and --  " " Damn , " she heard him mutter . She could so easily have lost her temper that she pretended not to notice him , as the only way of saving herself . " You can be out , " she said indifferently . " They all think you are in Virginia anyway . " " No , I have to be here , " he said with irritation . " That 's what I 'm trying to set up . Any more of your friends ? " " The Pritchards , " she said . He raised his eyebrows . " That might not be so bad . Anybodyfrom any other paper . . . well , I think it would be a good idea if we had the Lowdens here and Van and Millie . " " Oh my God , " said Jessie . " Do you think this is my idea of a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly right . Well --  " Brandon was counting names on his fingers . " That 's twelve , " he said . " It might be --  " " No , " said Jessie . " Thirteen . Reath Sheldon is coming too . You forget you were away . " She had decided hours ago not to let Mark Dwyer come , and she saw in view of Brandon 's idea how fortunate it was that she had asked Reath Sheldon here . Only she and Horace Howland and Althea Crowe knew now what Sheldon had done today , but tomorrow 's newspapers would name him as Isabel Allen 's physician ; and since he brought the most august of reputations to a very wide practice including many celebrities , it would not occur to anybody to raise a question . " Hell , " said Brandon . " Well , who 's another woman ? " Jessie looked at him as if to remind him how many women he knew , and he glared , pacing up and down . " Ca n't you think of another woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gets around ? " She could . Tired as she was , and feeling as if she never wanted to see a human face again , she knew exactly the person : Elizabeth Betts . But how can I put it to her , she thought . After last night , she will think I am taking advantage of what she said , acting as if she might be free for dinner at the last moment . Oh , rot , she rebuked herself . After all that has happened today , can you waste the strength to care about such a thing ? " I will get Elizabeth Betts , " she said to Brandon . She had not decided what story to tell Elizabeth , but she would think of something drastic enough to make Elizabeth feel that she was desperate in a small social way . They returned to the library , where Jessie had a quiet wordP277with Serena Lowden while Brandon spoke to his sister . Eight o'clock , they agreed ; and Jessie , bidding Horace Howland good bye , expressed to him with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood near the door feeling as if she had turned into a human clock ticking off the seconds until the last of these people should be gone . She meant after that to send in Sarah and Josephine to turn out the room as if it had not been housecleaned for weeks . Though she had had the windows open , and all day long had emptied ash trays and kept order in small ways , the room seemed to her an infected and befouled place . They should go ; they must go ; why on earth had they not already gone ? She turned from the door and looked once more at the three Fieldings and the two Lowdens , and Brandon waiting uneasily to escort them out . What was their delay , why were they lingering ? Jessie was aware suddenly that in her fatigue she had ceased to notice the play and interplay of glances , the ways in which fearful and nervous people balanced themselves on one foot or the other foot or uneasily upon their heels ; the strange , guiltlike hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerisms with match stubs , with their rings , their neckties , their eyeglasses . Then she saw why they were hesitating , and , apparently , waiting . They were compelled by the fact that Serena Lowden , risen from her chair , had walked across the room and placed herself with intentional precision before the fireplace , and that she was looking at them all with an expression which amounted to command . She let them wait until the air had become tense with question , and then she began to speak . " Before I leave this room , " she said , her limpid voice like crystal , " and before you leave it , I am going to say something which none of you might otherwise ever hear . " She looked at Evander Fielding ; she turned her fine dark eyes upon her shamed and despicable husband ; her glance rested upon the blighted paleness of Millicent Fielding and her daughter , failing to control the shifting of their light , uneasy eyes . " The lot of you , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more contemptible than anybody with whom we have been forced to deal because of what you have done . Those people began life in the gutter ; it is not unrealistic to expect some of them to have remained there . All of you knew better . You knew better . That is unforgivable . " She looked at Millicent Fielding , who could not look at her , 278 EAST SIDE , WEST SIDEP278and so she said , " Millicent ! " The woman raised her head . Serena Lowden stared at her and spoke again . " I have known you all your life . I suppose you have made some effort to drag Iris back from the filth in which she was determined to wallow , but you have failed because your own motives were shabby and trivial . Even though my own mother thought your mother the same kind of fool that you are , you should have known better . I could understand how a woman like that wretched dead creature could make of her daughter what you have made of Iris . But not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years your life has been a mean thing . Most recently your cowardice has taken the form of seeming not to know . I , " said Serena Lowden , turning a tragic and terrible face upon her husband , " I am the woman who knows what that means , seeming not to know . It is one thing to be driven to that on account of a husband . " She paused . " It is quite another to descend to it in dealing with one 's child . " Jessie found herself clasping her ice-cold hands together ; she felt the sharp staccato of her heightened pulse . Where , her thoughts raced , where shall I look ? What shall I do ? She pressed her lips together and raised her head and kept her eyes upon the face of Serena Lowden , who turned now to Iris Fielding . " As for you , " she said , " after I have made every allowance for the failure of your parents to live so that you would know good conduct from bad  --  even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayer of the world into which we were born . It was a world , which is better than the ruin that you and your kind are making . It produced fine people , not always people born in it either , but shaped by it , people like your aunt here . To me you are more vicious than the Mrs. Allen and the Miss Thorne about whom we have talked today . I have no reason to expect that your future will be different from theirs , but there will be less excuse for you , and more people will suffer . I am saying all this because I want you to understand that what we have done today was not done to save you from the consequences of your acts . What you have seen today probably looked to your mind like a clever battle of wits , with the smarter people winning out . What you have seen , " said Serena Lowden , " was a tragedy in the lesson of responsi-bility . " Jessie tottered to the kitchen . On her way through the pantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " Come here , Sarah . Listen to this . " And throwing herself with absurdly unnatural heaviness into a kitchen chair , she clutched her headEAST SIDE , WEST SIDE279P279in her hands over the marble table , and said , " We have to be fourteen for dinner . Big dinner . Horrible , lace-pants , stuffedshirtdinner party . Oh my God , I want to die . " She gazed up at the two women , who were exchanging inevitable look . Anna shrugged ; Sarah 's face set in the wit did when anything was precipitated by Brandon Bourne . They all consulted the clock . It was past four . Sarah said , " Well , Mum , there 's still time to get Delia Reardon if she ai n't servin ' some place else . " " Bribe her if she is , " said Jessie . " Offer her twenty dollars  --  twenty-five dollars . I do n't care . You and Josephine will need her . " " We 'll manage , " said Sarah bitterly . " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a cup of tea . Your tea , in a kitchen cup , right here . I am dying . " " Ye look it , " said Sarah , pouring the tea from her own brown earthenware pot . It was dark , red Irish tea , scalding , strong as liquor . Jessie clutched the thick crockery cup in both hands and gulped , wincing . Sarah went away , her stiff back eloquent . " Oh , Anna , " said Jessie . " What will you do ? " She looked at the covered iron pot on the back of the range . Anna shrugged . " Soup I got , " she said . " I leave out the Lebernockerl , I make it some foolishness . Fancy custard , couple truffle . Fish gives quick , I make I guess filets , stuff mit crabmeat . Bechamel sauce . " " And potroast with potato pancakes after that , " moaned Jessie . " Nein , I call butcher quick . I make it slobs  --  " A shriek of crazy laughter burst from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna had not learned to pronouncethat word . " Oh , Anna , " she howled , rocking back and forth over her teacup . " Oh , Anna , if you only knew ! " " Braised slobs , " said Anna , waddling to the telephone . " Nice , bisserl wild rice and mushrooms , ja ? Du ! Putzl ! Geh ' weg ! " He had leaped to the table and was licking butter from the tip of Jessie 's finger , his eyes sensuously closed . " Jar , shouted Anna into the telephone . " Und quick ! You want I come ? " she bellowed , a terrible threat . " So , " she continued , coming back to Jessie , " so maybe a salat , I got couple elevator pear  --  " Jessie buried her head in her arms and laughed until her stomach cramped . " Und dessert ? " asked Anna . " Mine Aufgezogenes would n't do , such Trottls . "   " I 'll call Sherry 's , " said Jessie . " Ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . You get me maybe mould mokka ice cream , I make it Praline gedeckt , make nice rum sauce , few cherries , few mandels . So all right , you go now , lay down . So tired , like dead , you . " At half past one in the morning Brandon shut the front door behind the last of the guests , and turned to Jessie . He put his hand on her shoulder . " Jess , you were wonderful , " he said . " God knows how you managed it , but the damn thing worked . " " You were wonderful yourself , " she answered . He had been ; he could be the most charming of hosts when he chose . Between them they had carried off brilliantly an almost impossible feat . The dinner party had been from the first moment a sparkling success in the wildly unpredictable way that dinner parties often prove the opposite of what is expected of them . Jessie wondered now that so much collective apprehension could have been convertedto so surprising a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , wandering back into the drawing-room . " Helen and Serena were on the job every minute , and Hulda was an angel . How she played ! But my God , poor Serena . . . " She lay down flat on her back on the Aubusson carpet , stretchthecurve of her spine hard down against the floor . " I am so tired , " she said , with a shaky laugh , " that I would n't feel it if you burnt the soles of my feet with matches . " She gazed dully at the ceiling . Brandon sprawled in an armchair with a whisky and soda . " Carrying Van and Millie , " he said , shaking his head . " This has been the god-damnedest day I ever remember . " " I felt so foolish , with Alec and Van at the same party , I was terrified that somebody would notice how grotesque it really was . " " We 've done such wild things already today , that part of it was comparatively easy . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wilder than you will ever know , or than I knew while I was doing them . She remembered again her last telephone conversation with Althea Crowe , while she was dressing for dinner . She had asked Althea what she should do if it should ever be necessary to produce the letter from the Thorne girl , and Althea , invoking a holy suffering God , had snorted , " There is no letter , you innocent , there never was . " " But  --  you let me think so , " Jessie had said blankly.  | " Of course I let you think so , you babe in arms ! If I had n't , you 'd never have had the nerve to bluff it through ! " Now she realized that that was the merest sample of the grotesqueness of which this day had been compounded , one total incredibility piled upon the next , to build a rickety pyramid upon whose apex a dozen people would precariously teeter , holding their breath , and weighing their every syllable and every glance until the last echo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all went well and typically , oblivion would close over Isabel Allen and over people 's connections with her , as quickly and quietly as the surface of a pond swallows a tossed stone . But Jessie would carry for years the dead weight of what she had learned today . She had a sense of its literally pressing her now , down , down hard against the floor . She closed her eyes and groaned softly . " That was a brilliant idea of yours , getting Liz Betts , " said Brandon . " By the time everybody 's read the morning papers she will have laid it down like a course of bricks . She was here , dining with you know who , and she is going to make the most of it . " " Clyde Pritchard will actually be much more useful , " said Jessie . She wished heavily that she had the energy to pick herself up and go to bed , but she knew that she was too overwrought to sleep ; and she remained here from inertia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw , " she said . " Can you imagine what Serena 's life has been , all these years ? Why could she ever have married him ? " " He did n't develop these pretty ways until after Old Man Forbes died . " " Yes , I suppose . . . he always acts out this farce of attentivenessto Serena in public , but tonight --  ! " " Van was the one that got me down . He does n't know how to put on that act with Millie , and watching him try was too god-awful . He was so shot that he had no idea what anybody was talking about . Thank God he did n't make any breaks . " Jessie thought it as well not to tell Brandon how she had briefed Helen Lee before dinner , and how Helen , seated next to Evander Fielding , had been the principal insurance against his making the breaks that Brandon had dreaded . But she did say , " Can you imagine what it would have been like if every person here tonight had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus Christ , " said Brandon , " have n't we had enough trouble today ? " Jessie was thinking then of Reath Sheldon , who had gone through the evening without so much as the flutter of an eyebrow to mark the acknowledgment of the secret that they shared . Knowinghim as she did , she knew that it might be months or even years before he would refer to Althea Crowe in speaking to Jessie , and there was . no possibility at all that he would ever mention Isabel Allen . He had been calm , gracious , gentle ; he had conversed charmingly at dinner , and afterwards he had listened with his special intense kind of appreciation to the beautiful playing of Hulda Block . His personality would rule out absolutely the merest breath of comment , after tomorrow morning 's newspapers appeared , that he should have been Isabel Allen 's physician . " And the funny thing is that if you had asked Jerome Block to talk about something just to hold such an ill-assorted lot together , you could not have succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feller , " said Brandon , " but I see what you mean . " For the talk , just before Jessie had taken the women away for their coffee , had become a round-table , somebody having tossed up in conversation the strange and eternally fascinating glass bubble of identity in New York , and the ways in which it made men and women differ from others anywhere else . Jerome Block had talked , with the indefinable inflection of the superbly educated , self-made , Columbia University Jew , and though Jessie had been a little nervous for a moment , she had relaxed when she saw how he had held everybody 's interest . " That business of wondering who somebody was to begin with , " he had said , " is a different thing here from anywhere else . All metropolitan places are full of people who rose from nowhere , but here there is a special kind of fraternity to which they  --  we  --  belong . We are all about the same , a few removes from the old Fourth Ward or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde Pritchard 's wife had laughed ; she was the granddaughter of Danny Monahan , perhaps the most spectacularly corrupt Tammany boss that had ever run the Fourth Ward . " Maybe it was we , " Jerome Block went on , " but more probablyour parents , maybe even our grandparents , who made the break from the East Side . By the time we get our names brushed up and recognized ( and they are usually a good deal different from the names we first had ) , and by the time we 've got handsome apartments with English furniture and Fifty-seventh Street lampshadesand antique Sheffield plate , by the time we 've got a good address that 's not in the telephone book but might be in the Socialp283Register , nobody remembers just who made the break and when . " " Does it really matter much ? " asked Reath Sheldon . " No  --  not really , " said Block . " But among ourselves it has a queer twist ; simply that people seldom mention it . By then we 've been through the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain details , and we feel pretty surefooted . And then it 's very smart to come right out flat with the original facts . We put them in Who 's Who , and we 've become so sure of ourselvesthat we know it 's smart to say we are guttersnipes born and bred . But we might not have said that twenty years earlier . And that makes our city belong to us in a way that it never can belong to anybody else , not even to people like you , " he had nodded at Brandon Bourne and then at Serena Lowden , " who were also born here . " There had been a round of laughter at his conceding the right of the old aristocracy of New York to claim it as their birthplace . " There are two kinds of people born in New York , " he had added . " The privileged ones who never had to take it in the raw . So they can put it on or take it off like a coat . And then there are the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stay in that . " " You certainly do , " Sam Lee had said , " and you better had . " That had marked a convenient moment for Jessie to collect her women and retire . But she had wondered while she was pouring coffee for them what turn that conversation might have taken had Mark Dwyer been there to add to it the color of a still different Manhattan nativity , which none of the others knew . Perhaps , she thought , those bright , contrasting threads which run through the main texture of this thick brocade are the most fascinating part of it all , those people in the neighborhoods , the transplanted villages , whom we scarcely ever know . She remembered the life of his childhood which Mark Dwyer had described ; and that forced her mind to review an infinity in an instant , all that had happened up to the shining threshold of this morning , from which violence had snatched her back , slamming the door in her face . Now that the people were all gone she felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , an exhaustion so crushing that she was unable to disentangle the snarl of horrors of which this day had been compounded . Yes , she had told Mark Dwyer , she would see him tomorrow , but now she felt unable to care whether or not tomorrow ever came at all . She opened her eyes , and when she had rallied enough cohesion to interpret what she saw , she recognized upon Brandon 's face a cogitating expression . She had not realized that he was speaking , but now she made an effort and she heard him say , " I suppose we ought to be setting up something pretty definite around tomorrow and the week end . We 'll have to --  " " Oh , do n't , " said Jessie . If I sound tired enough , she thought , and incapable of following him , he will just drop it . And neither of us can possibly make sense now if we talk about anything . " This day , " she mumbled " has been the one that the Lord was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is it , in Matthew ? " " How should I know ? " " I just thought you might . After all those years of chapel . " " I have an order for enough India paper to print three millionBibles , " said Brandon . " And no dice . " " You can read one eventually . " Jessie sat up slowly , inch by inch , gathering her skirt about her ankles , and then drawing herself to her feet . " I 'm going to try to get upstairs now , " she said . " I could drop dead on the way . In fact I hope I do . " " Please . Must you ? " " Oh , " she said , " I 'm all mixed up . I forgot for the moment how inconvenient dead women are . " They both laughed , utterly meaninglessly . Jessie said , " Good night , Brandon , " and began to move towards the hall with an uncharacteristic , weaving walk . Flipping his hand by way of answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
