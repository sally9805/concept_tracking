Staring nervously out the clubhouse windows at the remorseless rain , young ( 23 ) Righthander Rex Barney scuffed the floor with his spikes . To keep the Dodgers in their waning National League pennant race ( see above ) , he really had to win this one ; the Bums had lost eight of the last ten , and dropped from first to third place . Besides , Mrs. Barney had got a baby-sitter and had come to watch , and Rex owed her a no-hitter ( he had promised it after he pitched a one-hitter , nearly a month ago ) . If only the rain would stop . . . A Polo Grounds clubhouse boy handed Barney a hot dog ; against his better judgment , he munched it . <P> By 9:26 , almost an hour late , the tarpaulins had been hauled away . In the first inning , with only one out , Rex filled the bases with Giants-on a walk , his own error , and another walk . Between fast balls , he could still taste that hot dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a change-of-pace pitch , Willard Marshall grounded to Second Baseman Jackie Robinson for a double play . <P> In the third , Jackie muffed an easy grounder . That was the last Giant to get to first base ; Pitcher Barney started the double play that wiped him out . From then on , it was three Giants up and three down , as Barney 's fast ball and tantalizing curve both clicked . <P> On the Dodger bench , Eddie Miksis spread consternation among his superstitious teammates by blurting out the unmentionable : " Hey , they have n't got any hits . " Out there on the mound , Rex Barney did not need to be told ( " I always know when a guy comes up there what he 's done the last time ... I remember the ones that have hit me , and there were none to remember " ) . <P> In the sixth , the rain started again . In the ninth , the ball was slippery , and Barney was pressing . With the count three-and-two , the first batter swung at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped a mile-high fly to First Baseman Gil Hodges , who wiped the rain from his face and caught it . Then Whitey Lockman , who had hit three home runs off Barney earlier in the season , stepped up . He got a piece of the ball , but it fouled off near the Dodger dugout . Looking up into the lights , Catcher Bruce Edwards thought he was " seeing dozens of baseballs coming down , " but managed to catch the right one . <P> Pitcher Barney leaped " 20 feet " into the air , and took off for the clubhouse like a man possessed . He was ; he had the National League 's first no-hitter of 1948 . Score : 2-0.
