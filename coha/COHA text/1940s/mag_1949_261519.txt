A TALE OF POOR LOVERS ( 369 pp. ) - Vasco Pratolini-Viking ( $3.50 ) . <P> Publishers have begun to balance the flood of G.I. novels about wartime Italy by letting the Italians speak for themselves . The American veteran 's picture of Italy ( in such books as All Thy Conquests , The Gallery and The Wolf That Fed Us ) stressed the loneliness and isolation of individual Italians and their G.I. counterparts . Pratolini 's Tale of Poor Lovers , a novel of Italy after World War I and of the goings-on in Florence 's impoverished Via del Corno , makes the converse point : that men 's lives are intricately intermingled , for good or evil , with the lives of their neighbors . <P> To most of the workers , merchants , prostitutes and thieves who inhabited the tiny Via del Corno in 1925 , Mussolini 's recent power grab was of less interest than neighborhood scandal . But Carlino , the Fascist clerk , itched for the Second Wave that would bring revenge on his political enemies . And Maciste , the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered . Fruit Peddler Ugo , his hotheaded disciple , broke with him over weakkneed party policy , but returned one night when he learned that the Second Wave was starting . They roared off on Maciste 's motorcycle in a desperate attempt to warn their comrades , but the squadristi shot Maciste dead and wounded Ugo . He eluded them and made his way back to the Via del Corno , where he collapsed near the apartment door of the street 's most curious personality , the Signora . <P> The aging , bedridden Signora had been shrewd enough to quit her life as a ruthless courtesan before she became the victim instead of the victimizer of men . Now her cook , spying from the window on what happened in the Via del Corno , kept her supplied with the essential information for her intrigues and extortions . In the end , deserted and foiled , the half-crazed Signora determined to punish the entire street ; she bought up every house and ordered wholesale evictions . But her fury brought on a stroke that left her a speechless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and hunted down young Communists like Ugo to tighten their political stranglehold . <P> Vasco Pratolini 's jigsaw picture of violence , perversion and young love is colored by a tired tenderness for people too much at the mercy of their own appetites and apathies to fight or even to visualize the blackshirt terror closing in . Some readers will not have the patience to keep track of the dozens of lightly sketched characters ; others will gag on the implication that communism was the only answer to Mussolini . But A Tale of Poor Lovers is no U.S.-brand party-line novel . It is wise , involved and European-a swarming microcosm of social and psychological complexities in modern Italian life .
