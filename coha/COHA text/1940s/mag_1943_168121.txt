Ages &; ages ago , the Snow God " Kun " destroyed all life on earth , and only the ill-tempered " supaya " ( devils ) lived to roam the highlands of Bolivia . The " Pacha-Camaj " ( Gods of Fertility ) then sent down their own sons , the " Paka-Jakes " ( Eagle Men ) , to create a new race of their beloved Aymara people , all of whom had been snowed under by Kun . The Paka-Jakes settled on the land around holy Lake Titicaca , recreated the Aymaras , and named the province Pacajes after themselves . <P> Centuries passed . Not so many years ago the last of the Paka-Jakes returned to the Aymara people of Pacajes . He was fortyish and fat , but he had the authentic eagleface of his predecessors . He was illiterate , and he bore the earthy name of Damasco Maldonado . But he had the power to look into the future and the past and the thoughts of men ; he cured sick llamas and women &; children , got rid of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small Aymara pueblos of the Altiplano and among the Indies who worked the copper mines near the Chilean and Peruvian borders , his name was spoken with reverence . On festive days thousands of Indians crowded Lake Titicaca 's shores , watched in awe and admiration as Paka-Jake swam : no mortal , sensible Indian would think of swimming in the holy water which is also ice cold . <P> A true god needs apostles , and Paka-Jake picked up plenty . He especially favored females between 15 and 18 , and selected the likeliest of them on his excursions through the province . Each chosen one had to present herself alone at " Kullusmalla , " favorite miracle-place of the gods . There &; then the earth trembled , fire flashed and from behind clouds of smoke Paka-Jake appeared , smiling . <P> But , even to a god , there comes a time of reckoning . When his female disciples numbered more than 50 , young Indians became jealous and old ones were shocked . Even the divine performance in the waters of Titicaca lost its interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new football team which had been organized in Paka-Jake 's native village . <P> Paka-Jake , needing another outlet , concentrated on clairvoyance : he could always tell that one of his more affluent neighbors was about to die in a few months . Forthwith one of the disciples would be dispatched with a warning-and a promise that Paka-Jake would intercede with the gods if the neighbor paid Paka-Jake a couple of thousand bolivianos ( about $40 ) . Sometimes he paid and sometimes not . If not , the neighbor kicked the bucket . <P> Last week Bolivian authorities put Paka-Jake in jail , began to produce evidence that , in at least 28 cases , his divine prophecies were nothing but ungodly murders .
