The queues in Atlantic City 's expensive restaurants were never longer , the prices never higher , the exhibits never gaudier . The conventioneers were plied with free drinks , free cigarets , free gadgets , fan dances . To oldtimers , the American Medical Association 's 100th anniversary convention last week seemed to be its biggest and most star-spangled . <P> Thoroughly relaxed , A.M.A. 's delegates gossiped , gamboled and , for a few days , found nothing much to argue about . But by convention 's end , some solemn business demanded attention after all . One grim reminder was a pair of radioactive goats ( survivors of Bikini ) munching hay in the exhibition hall . Another was an appeal by Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson for the doctors ' support of a bill to remedy a serious shortage of Army doctors . The Army has only 1,100 Regulars in its Medical Corps , needs 6,000 for its present strength of some 1,000,000 men . The bill would raise medical officers ' pay , let the Army hire civilian doctors ( at salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army medical policies . <P> But the bill is only a peacetime measure , and does not touch the vastly greater problem of medical mobilization for a possible World War III . On that problem , the delegates were confronted with a grim report by a special committee headed by A.M.A. 's president , Dr. Edward L. Bortz of Philadelphia . <P> The Minute Men . In any future war , doctors expect to have to cope with simultaneous mass attacks-atomic bombs , poisons ( probably radioactive ) , viruses and bacteria-on many cities and industrial suburbs . The nation 's doctors and all health facilities would have to be ready for total mobilization within 24 hours . A major problem : preventing the disruption of health services by the first attack ( as happened in Hiroshima ) . Atomic-age warfare , military and medical men agree , would wipe out all distinction between combatants and noncombatants : there would probably be more civilian than military casualties , and doctors would have to be assigned flexibly to both groups . <P> The A.M.A. proposed that 1 ) a National Emergency Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) medical officers be consulted by the military on war plans , 3 ) civilian needs be considered in the building of military hospitals , and 4 ) plans be made for efficient wartime use of doctors. * First step ( to be taken by A.M.A. ) : a card system registering every U.S. doctor as a " minute man . " His title will mean what it says . <P> <P> * An A.M.A. poll of Medical Corps veterans showed that during World War II both Army &; Navy doctors spent only half of their time on medical work . The doctors concluded that the military could have got along with three-quarters as many doctors as they drafted .
