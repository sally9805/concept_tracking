OUR UNDECLARED WAR IN FRANCE .. 2 ? eona4ee Bms Germany E governments of the United States and of Germany have come to the end of their first campaign in the oddly camouflaged war which they have been fighting ever since June , 1940 . Two events marked the close of this undercover struggle for which the derelict empire of France served as a battleground . The first was the abrupt removal , a few weeks ago , of the former French commander in chief , Gen. Maxime Weygand , from his strategic post as commander of the French armies in North Africa . The second was the announcement that our Government had extended lease-lend aid to the breigr ? government of Gen. Charles de Gaulle . Although one campaign has thus ended , our undeclared war in France still goes on . Because we fought in France with diplomatic rather than with military weapons , the nature of this conflict has been widely misinterpreted . Because our relationships with France have been enveloped in an atmosphere of universal make-believe , many of us did nut even suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us and Germany . Only now is it possible for us to recognize what our Government was trying to do in France , and also where our actions there are likely to lead us in the immediate future . We can see now that our representatives fought an undeclared war because the American people were not yet ready for all-out war . Our battle in France was a rear-guard action against Germany , designed to tide over the period of waiting until our people could he persuaded to use force as well as diplomacy in Europe . This rear-guard campaign in France was waged with two principal objectives . The first was to try to prevent the Germans from towing the wreckage of the French ship of state into the port of their " new European order . " The second was to try to prevent the Germans from seizing strategic French positions in Northern and Western Africa . After the German conquest of France , the whole French empire began to break up , with its wreckage strewn across four continents and seven seas , like some vast fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent attack at that hour , could attempt only to sink those parts of the drifting wreckage which impeded its own defense maneuvers . But the new German empire was advantageously placed to salvage the French flagship and thus , as the Germans then hoped , to control the entire derelict fleet . There was only one power great enough to obstruct this German scheme and that was the United States . Almost singlehanded , our Government undertook this formidable task . This was America 's first direct challenge to Hitler 's domination of the continent of Europe , and in order to carry out this diplomatic war against Germany , our Government was compelled to initiate a policy of its own , a policy which deviated from and sometimes even ran counter to the military policy which the British empire was pursuing . To direct the salvaging of the French ship of state , Hitler selected an astute and subtle engineer in the person of Otto Abetz . I was in Paris when this tall , blond German with soft voice and persuasive smile arrived with the official title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who lived in France during those first months after the German occupation who can appreciate how very nearly Abetz succeeded at that time in putting across his mission . The new German ambassador was no stranger to Parisians . His wife is a Frenchwoman , and for years before the war he had made frequent visits to the French capital on various good-will missions . Abetz is a product of the German youth movement which had preceded the rise of National Socialism , and when he joined the Nazi Party , he had assured his French friends that he had done so in order to be able to counteract the anti-French extremists within the party . When he reappeared in Paris after the German conquest , he triumphantly reassured these Frenchmen that his appointment as ambassador was proof that the pro-French faction in the Nazi Party was holding Hitler 's support . Bringing Vichy Into the Nazi Fold ( TIHESE assertions made a tremendous impression 1 in France during the suntmer of 1940 . Abetz soon proved that he could grant extraordinary favors to Frenchmen and could , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gestapo chiefs . He was working , it must be remembered , with men and women who were bitterly disillusioned by their recent ignominious defeat , and were only too eager to hope that something good might emerge from it . He came to France , too , at the moment when Britain 's downfall seemed more than probable . He said to Frenchmen whom he had known in the past , If you and I can only work together now , before the wrong kind of men interfere with us , both in Germany and in France , then everything will be all right for the France you and I both love . " The Abetz strategy went very far indeed toward fitting the Vichy government into Germany 's New Order . While , on the one hand , he talked in terms of bargains and bribes to the tough-minded Frenchmen who had seized control of that government , his continued expressions of sympathy for dear old France gained widespread popular support for the Vichy government 's policy of co-operation with Germany . While Germany was thus enjoying better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain was rapidly alienating the regard of her erstwhile ally . The British attitude toward France after the French collapse can be understood only if we dispense with the legend of Anglo-French solidarity . That Legend was revived for war propaganda , but it never had much basis in reality . The British and French were held together , as long as they were held together , only by their common peril . During this war , as during previous wars , Anglo-French relations were constantly poisoned by mutual distrust , a distrust which has deep roots in British and French history . The part which this poison played in the German conquest of France in 1940 has been set forth with remarkable frankness in the recent official report by General Viscount Gort , who was commander in chief of the British armies in France . General . Gort cited several vivid examples to show how French and British military and political leaders frequently obstructed one another in their conduct of the war . Because Anglo-French distrust had become so acute even while France remained in the war , British leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse . Under Churchill 's dynamic leadership , the British government did not hesitate to risk a complete break with French leaders in order to prevent the Germans from using the derelict French state against Great Britain . The rulers of Britain naturally thought first of the French fleet , and they took rapid and effective measures by bottling up French warships at Oran and elsewhere in order to make sure that the French navy could not be used against themselves . Wherever French naval commanders rejected a British ultimatum , their ships were fired upon and many were sunk , with considerable loss of life . At that time , the British government would not have hesitated , if it had been possible , to wage open war against a French government whose motives they thoroughly distrusted . ( Continued on Page 541 happened to be in the city and was invited to attend . Part of the agenda was the busses . The chairman asked my cousin Ji-um for his opinion . He advised the board to slick up their trains , meet approximately the bus rates and drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the passenger trade ever did slip to the busses , they would never get it back again ; the busses were too mobile , convenient . . and polite . He dwelt on this last feature . He pointed out that railroad impoliteness was not just the natural cussedness of station agents ; it was the psychology of power developed by roaring freights and expresses , and permeated the whole system from the brass hats to the brakemen . He compared that with the friendliness and intimacy developed by bus drivers passing along the highways , avoiding wagons and pedestrians and stopping for whoever waved them down . The board was astonished at such a speech from my cousin Ji-um . They asked him how he came by it . He said through cantaloupes . It appeared that he had been furnishing the diners cantaloupes , and that the busses had cut into the Pullman traffic until his melons were no longer in demand . This loss had given rise to Ji-urn 's reflections . The board was amused and did nothing about it for ten years , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second little difficulty came up over telegraph poles . My cousin Ji-um threshed out a wonderful idea about telegraph poles . He took it to Louisville and explained it to the purchasing agent . It was this : All sorts of accidents happen to telegraph poles  --  train wrecks , storms , fires , lightning , old age and decay . Railway telegraph poles are always toppling over , for one reason or another , and trains and passengers are imperiled . Ji-um 's plan was to have piles of poles strung along the whole right of way , so telegraph repairs could be made with the utmost speed . Incidentally , he had about a half million telegraph poles on his hands , with no creosoting plant to save them , and he did n't want to build one . So , naturally , he arrived at this idea of saving human lives . Mr. Harrison could n't see it . The road bought its poles when it needed them . It looked as if Ji-um was going to have to build a creosote plant after all . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies , headed for Pensacola , Mobile , New Orleans and points south  --  all along the bottom of the L. &; N. map . My cousin Ji-um reached for his telephone , called up Mr. Harrison , urged that the L. &; N. ship poles south at once and get ready for the storm . Mr. Harrison was convinced . He not only placed the order but directed the train dispatchers to give my cousin Ji-um 's poles right of way over all freight . The poles went through on time , but the storm did n't . It fizzled out in the Gulf . However , the poles proved so handy , scattered along the southern reaches of the system , that Mr. Harrison ordered my cousin Ji-urn to service his whole right of way . So he built no creosoting plant . All during these years of receiving blessings from Providence , my cousin Ji-um had been figuring that he ought to pay it back . Of course , he had been keeping the interest on his debt to Providence paid up by helping on the preacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parsonage shored up . It is a strange thing , but in the South the church roofs and the foundations of the preachers ' homes are always giving way . I have thought at times there must be something symbolic about it , but I am no Daniel and I have never been able to interpret what it means . But after the telegraph-pole deal , Ji-um decided he ought to make a payment on the principal . This disbursement took the form of a high-school building . Now , up to that time , his home county had no high-school building to speak of and Ji-um had got notions about such things in Texas . I should mention here that he believed in high schools , but did not believe in colleges . He had never been to either , hut , like all successful Americans , he felt that if the oncoming generation could be given one jump ahead of himself , that ought to put them over the top . If my cousin Ji-um had ever gone to high school he would have backed a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have endowed a research foundation . Every man at the peak of his life realizes how much better he would have done if he had received just a little more help . The philanthropy of all our American millionaires expresses that feeling . Well , Jisum bought up a bunch of lots and built such a high school as none of the villagers had ever seen , and few heard of . It had a gymnasium , drinking fountains , indoor toilets , a kitchen ; it was a kind of mythological high school . When it was all finished he dedicated it to the service of man and the glory of God and presented it to his village . But there was one catch in the gift . It was stipulated that the Bible should be taught in the high school . The village accepted this in very good spirit until presently one of those foaming revivalists who infest the South came along and decried the Bible being taught in the high school . His objection was that the high school did not teach the creed he preached . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer endure my cousin Ji-urn 's Bible class . Finally the County Court got together and voted the Bible class had to be stopped . But if they stopped the Bible class , they automatically kicked out the school . The court went into a huddle over this and came out with the decision they would buy the building and run the school to suit themselves . They asked what it was worth . My cousin Ji-um said he could n't price it ; he did n't know what it was worth . The court asked him to look up his old bills . He said he had burned the bills up as he paid them , because he never kept hooks on a gift to the Lord . The court came back with a proposal that my cousin Ji-um should pick two men and they would pick two of their own number , and the four referees should set a price on the building . This was agreed to . The court picked two of their own body . Now , in the court were two of Ji-um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to represent him . They swore they would n't do it , but Ji-um insisted it was their own proposition , and finally they served . As they were forced continually to consult with Ji-um throughout the arbitration , they became quite goad friends with him , and still are . The four judges decided the county should raise $56,000 by selling bonds . In relating the story , my cousin Ji-um said , " That was eleven years ago . The county is still paying assessments on my bonds . It 's expensive to get the Bible out of a high school . Germany and Italy and Russia may finally feel the same way about it . " With $56,000 of the Lord 's funds on his hands , he studied and prayed a long time about what he should do with the Lord 's money . Finally he built an orphanage . The $56,000 did n't build the orphanage , but it paid for the blueprints and the execution of the deeds and the incorporation of his project . He deeded a small domain to the orphanage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever there was a creek , my cousin Ji-um dammed it up and made a fishing lake out of it . The lakes are stocked with bass , bream and crappies , and one very cold lake grows rainbow trout . The orphanage building is an old-fashioned colonial home surrounded by orchards of apples , plums , pears , peaches , and checkered with grapes , raspberries , blackberries and watermelon patches . The orphanage dairy draws a monthly income from the cheese factory of my cousin Ji-urn 's old and trusted friend , Swift &; Company . The boys and girls in the orphanage go to the regular county schools , but their instruction is supplemented by Bible lessons at home . In short , the children are getting everything my cousin Ji-um dreamed of and longed for when he was a boy , but never got . And it is quite probable that they are not getting the spark which he did get . The county is having a certain amount of trouble over the orphanage . Besides the annoyance of the high-school bonds , the county can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings are so extensive that the county is getting into the red . The assessor came to my cousin Ji-um with his troubles , who consoled him in this fashion , " My boys and girls will grow up and marry someday . When they do , I 'm going to give each one of them who wants it a farm for a wedding present . So a lot of this land will get back on the county tax books in time . " Such a self-liquidating orphanage struck me as an inspiration . There is a focusing on the actual children in hand which , to me , is eminently Southern , as contrasted with Northern philanthropy . Northern bequests always look to perpetuity and the projection of the name and will of the donor into the future . This Southern plan centers on the children themselves , and expects them to spread and continue the kingdom of God . When I asked my cousin Ji-urn for this story , he said he would he happy , more than glad to give it to me . Said it might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside one of the fishing lakes , with bream currying its surface from the underside . When he finally finished , he said , " Now , Ta-um , I want you to do me a favor in return . When you write up my life for The Saturday Evening Poet , please do n't mention my name . " I told him I would n't . OUR UNDECLARED WAR IN FRANCE ( Continued from Page 251 If the British had possessed the means , they would promptly have seized French North Africa and French Syria and French ports on the coast of West Africa , including Dakar . The French empire was a floating wreck , free game for anybody . A little later , when they thought it was possible , the British did try to seize Dakar , and they managed , months later , to occupy Syria . But the British have rarely been able to take the offensive in this war when they wanted to . In this instance , they lacked the ships and warplanes and soldiers which were necessary to take over all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view , they had to hold back enough to protect their own islands and their positions in the Mediterranean . From a political point of view , they had to consider the attitude of their greatest potential ally , the United States . As far as we were concerned , the situation was that the American people had been oversold on France . Up to June , 1940 , every conceivable propaganda device had been used to arouse our sympathies for France and the French people . In such instances as this , propaganda is a boomerang . It is only under absolute dictatorships that propagandists can suddenly reverse themselves . After having attributed every virtue to the French , our propagandists could not now , in the hour of French defeat , accuse them of every vice . A national election was at hand in the United States , and the American people were far from convinced that we should get into the war in Europe . Our Government , therefore , was in no position to grab pieces of the French empire , even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use force , it was restricted to diplomacy . But sometimes diplomats , as well as soldiers , can become combatants . And our American diplomats in France did become combatants . It was no accident that we sent to Vichy as our chief of mission a retired admiral of the American Navy . Admiral Leahy . A fighting man was the right choice to direct such a battle , He had to contend at Vichy not only with German generals but also with two French militarists , Marshal Petain , of the French army , and Admiral Darlan , wartime chief of the French navy . The United States Government began its campaign in France as soon as French leaders signed an armistice with Germany . Washington immediately rushed its scouts both to Vichy and to French North Africa to investigate how far we could succeed in persuading or bluffing or bribing French leaders . The reports our scouts sent back from Vichy were not encouraging . They stated that the government there had been captured by a group of hard-boiled Frenchmen who were not in the least interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them had been distrustful of French parliamentary democracy for years , and were now thoroughly fed up with it . The whole question , so far as they were concerned , was to put France and themselves on the winning side in the war . As matters stood , they argued , the Germans were sure to win ; unless the United States were to come in , the British did n't have a chance . They intimated to our embassy at Vichy that if they could be assured that we would come in , then they might talk business with us . But of course it was impossible , in the summer of 1940 , for any American spokesman to promise that the United States would enter the war . Our scouts in Vichy reported back to Washington , therefore , that mere threats from us were futile . The only effective weapon we possessed was a bribe  --  and the one great bribe we could offer was food . Both occupied and unoccupied France were desperately hungry ; the ? Vichy statesmen themselves were living on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lacking milk , butter , meat and almost everything else . If the American people were to agree to feed the French people , and if we could induce both the British and the German governments to let us do that , then the Vichy leaders said they might make a deal with us . If not , then they said they would make a deal with the Germans . When our Government received this report , it assigned a responsible American who was then in France to look into this matter of feeding the French people . The investigator whom our Government selected for this task is personally a kindly and philanthropic gentleman , but it was not primarily for these characteristics that he was chosen for this important mission in France . War is not a humanitarian enterprise , and war directors are selected not for their soft hearts but for their hard heads . Our investigator understood that his problem was not to regard food as a humane means for saving lives but as a weapon for waging war . Everyone remembers that starvation was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategic question for the United States in the summer of 1940 was how to distribute American food so as to defeat Germany again . Our food expert therefore studied the situation in France with great care and submitted a detailed report on the matter . His survey disclosed , first of all , that the distribution of food in Europe in this war is altogether different from what it was in the war of 1914-18 . In the first World War the most severe effects of the British blockade fell upon Germany alone . But now , with Germany in control of most of Europe , Berlin could arrange supplies so that malnutrition would hit Germany 's opponents first , pinch her allies next , and not even be seriously felt in Germany itself until most of the rest of the continent was starving . If America refrained from sending food to Europe , the report emphasized , starvation would descend , not upon the Germans or friends of Germany but upon the friends of the United States and Britain . The next subjects for investigation were whether , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship food to France in large quantities ; whether its distribution could be supervised to insure that it would not fall into German hands  --  or be utilized by the Germans to substitute for German-controlled food which the French would otherwise consume  --  and , lastly , whether our proposed charity would be effective propaganda in winning French support . For it must be kept in mind that the fundamental object of the whole program was to try to make the French people grateful to the United States for donating food , grateful to Great Britain for permitting it to pass through the blockade , and , as a corollary , to make them hate the Germans for creating the famine and therefore hinder France from falling into Germany 's New Order . The report concluded that all this was feasible . If the British would permit our ships to pass through the blockade , we could send limited amounts of special , concentrated food to France . The Vichy government then could bring pressure on the German authorities to allow American philanthropic organizations , such as the Red Cross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , nursing mothers , the aged and the sick . The Germans , still uneasy about the temper of the French people , and still hoping to mollify the temper of Americans , could hardly refuse to co-operate in such a project and would not dare to use the American donations as an excuse for depriving the mass of the French people of the meager rations already scheduled for their consumption . The propaganda value would inevitably follow of its own accord . What happened to that report ? Our Government in Washington pigeonholed it for more than a year . The proposal to send food to France was being violently opposed by many Americans who sincerely believed at that time that any food sent to German-controlled territory would necessarily be of assistance to the Germans . These Americans thought that if the - subject populations were left to go hungry , they would be inspired to revolt against their conquerors . The British government also opposed all American plans to send food to Europe , because its leaders still clung to the belief that a leakproof blockade would eventually bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last war . Our negotiators at Vichy were thus left practically empty-handed , having neither guns with which to threaten the realistic Frenchmen there , nor gifts with which to bribe them . These French politicians were insisting upon something tangible , and the most concrete offers were coming , not from Americans or Britons but from Germans . From another part of the derelict French empire , however , our scouts sent back more encouraging reports . From Gen. Maxime Weygand 's preserve in North Africa came word that the former French commander in chief was ready to do business with us . But General Weygand insisted upon driving a hard bargain . He agreed to accept food and certain military supplies from us , but offered no more in return for our generosity than a tacit understanding that he would do what he could to keep German and Italian troops out of French North Africa . That is as far as he would go . He refused to dissolve his allegiance to the Chap Stick ! As necessary for winter fun as hockey stick or skates . For there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart .

Vichy government and he most emphatically declined to have anything to do with the Free French forces of General de Gaulle . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly had more confidence in General Weygand than they did in Marshal Petain and Pierre Laval and Admiral Darlan . They argued that General Weygand was playing Americans for suckers , and that as soon as he got as much out of us as he could , he might then turn around and make a deal with the Germans . They insisted that General Weygand could show his good faith only by breaking with the Vichy government immediately . They argued that if the Americans would join the British in an ultimatum to General Weygand , then he could he forced to show exactly where he stood . If he rejected the ultimatum , then the British believed that there was enough pro-British sentiment among French officers stationed in North Africa to overthrow General Weygand . Our American advisers in North Africa , who had been rushed to this territory just at the time the French were signing their armistice terms , disagreed with this British opinion . They reported that General Weygand was convinced that the British government had let France down , and would do the same thing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Weygand 's associates shared this conviction . Our investigators reported also that these French officers were doggedly determined , so far as it was possible , to avoid tying themselves either to Britain or to Germany , but they added that unless this isolated army got supplies from some source , its position would became desperate . General Weygand was so hostile to the , British , our observers declared , that he would not hesitate to make a deal with the Germans if it should become necessary to do that in order to maintain the organization of his North African forces . They added that General Weygand was obsessed with the notion that it was his duty to France to keep the Italians out of French North Africa , and that we could use this obsession to our advantage and to Germany 's disadvantage . The Dakar Fiasco While this question was still being debated between Washington and London , the British intelligence service revealed its incompetence in this field by incorrectly reporting that French officers at the West African port of Dakar would welcome a joint British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiasco at Dakar , when the British expedition was ignominiously repelled by the local French garrison . Contrary to published reports at the time , there were no Germans whatever at Dakar when the British attempt was made . The American Government thereupon decided to act upon the advice of its own observers on the spot , to accept General Weygand 's proposal , and to send some supplies to his North African detachments . In order to accomplish this , it was necessary for our Government to persuade the British to let our supplies pass through their blockade . After some further discussion , the British reluctantly made this concession to us . Our policy caused acute discomfort to General de Gaulle , the leader of the Free French forces in London . To General de Gaulle , French patriotism can be expressed in one way only , and that is by fighting Germany . According to his view , any Frenchman who has taken an equivocal ground , as General Weygand did , is an enemy of France . That is the stand which General de Gaulle adopted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British government promptly supported . But our Government did not follow this British lead in recognizing General de Gaulle 's movement . In the first place , our political leaders had to act with caution so long as we were not yet in the European war , and while American public opinion was extremely confused in regard to France . In the second place , it appeared probable that we might do more good  --  for the British as well as for ourselves  --  by pursuing an independent French policy . Because so long as we considered it advisable to continue our dickering with General Weygand and to keep our scouts at Vichy , we had to ignore General de Gaulle 's opposition movement . As the months passed , this American policy gained solid support , in Britain as well as in this country , because it was duly credited with having kept Germans and Italians out of French North Africa . But our policy had one result which may not have been anticipated . In consequence of our withholding recognition from General de Gaulle , the Free French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with various other emigre governments in London which we had officially recognized . A number of French patriots in this movement began to suspect that they had become the proverbial stepchildren . Their position was humiliating , they felt , not only because they were not accorded formal recognition but also because we declined to turn over to them any part of the French gold reserves which the United States Government had blocked . We had released some similar gold to the Dutch and Norwegian and Belgian governments , which gave them a greater degree of self-respect . But the emigre French , not having access to French gold funds in this country , had to depend for support upon the British , and they found this embarrassing . The reason why we did not release any gold to the Free French movement was that our Government was holding this hoard for use as a possible bribe in its dealings with the Vichy government . Early last autumn , General de Gaulle became so irritated by this state of affairs that he gave an interview to an American reporter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Free French movement . When he discovered how badly that interview was received , both in this country and in Britain , he attempted to repudiate it . But the American reporter 's reputation is excellent , and there is little doubt that he correctly set down General de Gaulle 's own words . I discovered for myself in London that General de Gaulle had good reason to feel alarmed concerning his own position . Some men in the Free French movement were beginning to suspect last autumn that General Weygand had played his cards more skillfully than had General de Gaulle , and was therefore in a better situation to represent an " independent " French policy . That , of course , was an unfair way to regard the situation of these two French leaders . General de Gaulle went to Britain immediately after the French collapse and identified himself completely with the British cause at a moment when Britons alone stood out against Germany . At that time it was apparent that continued British resistance was the only thing which stood between Germany and complete victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to rally French support for the British . He risked that move at an hour when German victory appeared a strong probability , and he understood that if the Germans did win , then he and all those who joined his organization must forever after be outlawed from their own country . General Weygand , on the other hand , took no such personal risk . But he was quick to perceive that the French empire was a derelict and that he could salvage for himself a comparatively independent position . Unlike most Frenchmen , he was intimately familiar with the overseas possessions of the French empire , and he selected French North Africa as his own preserve , with thorough understanding of the strategic importance of this territory , particularly in relation to Italy and Spain . Nazi Machiavellis Whatever our respect for General de Gaulle 's courage may be , the success of the American policy in favoring General Weygand was belatedly appreciated by the Germans . They used all the pressure they could muster to force Vichy to sever the tenuous ties between General Weygand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with General Dentz , the French general who had already proved in Syria that he would not hesitate to fight Britons . Marshal Petain resisted this German pressure for months , obstinately rejecting the persuasions of several of his associates at Vichy . As the Germans began to understaxid what dangerous antagonists we had become , not only in North Africa last in France itself , they did everything possible to provoke an open break between us and the Vichy governmeit . They hoped that they had accoinplished that when they induced Vichy to turn over French Indo-China to the Japanese . This was a direct threat to our interests in the Far East , and was obviously intended to divert our attention from the war in Europe . But our Government did not rise to this bait ; our diplomatic combatants stuck to their posts in Vichy . One reason why they stayed on was that by this time the British as well as the American government had begun to revise its attitude on the question of sending food to France . The two governments finally came to the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after the collapse of France , that food would prove a better weapon if sent to France than if it were withheld . Months had passed and it had become increasingly evident that the British food blockade was unlikely to starve any Germans , but might very well starve the European friends of Britain and the United States . Moreover , it was recalled that malnutrition , long drawn out , does not affect its victims with fighting tempers so much as with painful apathy , and , consequently , that resistance to the Germans might be more likely from healthy subjects than from hungry ones But the Germans understood all that too . They understood it so well that as time went on it became doubtful whether a food bribe was any longer possible . French leaders at Vichy , under ever-increasing German pressure , had been sucked deeper and deeper into the meshes of the New Order . When they talked now about making a deal with the Americans concerning food , they made suggestions which bore the imprint of German inspiration . " Yes , your food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts at Vichy , " but we will not be obligated to you by taking it as a gift . We will pay for it with the French gold reserves which you are holding in the United States . That is French money , and we are the representatives which you yourselves officially recognize as the government of France . If it should be necessary , in order to pass this food through the British blockade , then your own Red Cross delegates will be welcomed to supervise the distribution in France , to guarantee that this food goes only to needy French civilians . But our people will understand that this food was purchased with funds belonging to the government of France . " This suggestion , if carried out , would dull the propaganda edge of our food weapon . It therefore began to appear that the American and British governments , between them , had moved " too little and too late " to make the most effective use of our food as a war weapon . Arrangements which had been possible in the summer of 1940 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , however , events had progressed to the point where President Roosevelt could proclaim that the " shooting " had started between us and Germany . It was possible now to add force to the arguments of diplomacy . For American public opinion had changed , as our Government had calculated it would do , so that there was comparatively little popular resistance to the use of armed force , wherever that might become advisable , to enable us to join with Britain in open warfare against Germany . Although most of us may not have realized what was going on , some of our American strategists foresaw all this from the moment when the French empire became a derelict . I talked with one such American only a few weeks after the collapse of France , and I remember having asked him , " Why has the American Government rushed its military and diplomatic scouts to French North Africa ? " He replied , " In a war like this , you must look far ahead . Let us suppose that we will have to send an expeditionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must have bases where we can land such a force . The Germans already have seen to it that we can not land directly on the European continent , as we did in the last war . So we will have to find springboards for our expeditionary force much closer to Europe than anything which we now possess . " But the Germans understand strategy as well as any Americans do . They , too , kept their eye on French North Africa . They could see exactly what we were aiming at . Perhaps the Germans hoped at first that the British were right , and that General Weygand was playing us for suckers . Perhaps they hoped that General Weygand would prove to be a thorough " collaborationist " when the showdown came . However , the Germans had made up their minds by November that we had been right and the British had been wrong about General Weygand . They learned that the former French commander in chief , however loyal he was to Marshal Retain , was as much of an obstacle to German aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after the Germans became convinced of that , they had to use tremendous pressure to eliminate this dangerous Frenchman from a position where he might be as menacing to them as he might have been useful to their enemies . Once again , in French North Africa , we had followed a policy of " too little and too late . " We gave General Weygand enough food and gasoline to keep his army in being . But we refused to give him the tanks and warplanes which would have enabled his troops to resist German armed invasion . We gambled timidly on the assumption that the French general would guard his independence , but we lacked sufficient confidence in the reports of our own scouts in North Africa to overrule British objections and thus make General Weygand strong enough to pursue a really independent line . So we lost this battle , but that did not necessarily mean that we had lost our undeclared war . For seventeen months we had delayed , so far as that was possible by diplomacy , the German salvage of derelict France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were assembled in Egypt  --  materials which enabled the British to initiate another African campaign . During that same period , American warships and sailors and marines were being prepared to assume open belligerency in Africa . For both British and American strategists , however much they might disagree on some points , united in regarding Africa as the most likely springboard for their eventual onslaught upon Hitler 's new European empire .
