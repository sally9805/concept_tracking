txt The United States Government has developed in the past fifteen months a vast uncoordinated defense information service which will cost more than $10,000,000 in the current fiscal year . This service is being run by an army of 1,436 newspaper reporters , clerks , poets , stenographers , psychologists , cartoonists and song writers , whose object is to inform the people of this country of the requirements , objectives , and progress of their defense effort and to remind the enemies of this country that it is concerned in the war . It is a unique experiment in American government , imaginative , complex and controversial . It sprawls all over this country , extends into the English countryside , and carries its message all over the world . It is run by nobody in particular and by several hundred government officials in general , and its actions are bound to affect the whole course of the national effort . Eight government agencies are chiefly concerned with defense information , as distinguished from the non-defense information which is handled by twenty-six other agency press departments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Departments , the Office of Emergency Management and the Selective Service System , all of which are concerned mainly with the distribution of information at home , and the Offices of the Coordinator of Information and of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs , who are charged with " telling the world . " Superimposed on these press departments is the new Office of Facts and Figures , headed by Archibald , Librarian of Congress , who was appointed last Saturday to the task of " correlating " defense information . Somewhere alongside this organization is the Office of Government Reports which gathers information about what the country is thinking and puts out a defense information digest of its own . The eight defense information organizations have seven press sections , six radio sections and five separate groups dealing with the production or presentation of motion and still pictures . Each department has its own head , who is subject to his own discretion and the dictates of the ofcials of the department which he serves . That is one reason why Mr. was appointed to " correlate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense information sections shows that the Navy Department has the largest personnel , yet is operating on one of the smallest " direct " budgets . Lieut . Comdr . R. W. Berry , who runs this service , has under his direct or indirect . control 211 employes , comprising thirty-nine officers , fourteen enlisted men and fifty-four civilians , and there are 104 officers with clerical assistants over the country . The Navy unit is working on a 1941-42 budget of $75,000 , which does not /pay for any of its salaries or any of its main press , radio , or motion picture projects . The general opinion is that it is an efficient , careful organization with an annual expense nearer $1,000,000 . The War Department 's organization , under Brig . Gen. A. D. Surles , has 259 employes , of whom fiftytwo are officers , twenty-six are actively engaged in the preparation of material to be put out to the public , and the rest are clerks and stenographers . This organization is divided into several sections , preparing material for the press , periodicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials . It also is working on a $75,000 budget , with all salaries coming out of other funds available to Secretary Stimson . Dealing With Foreign Affairs The State Department and Selective Service System press units are small , with personnels of eight and nine , respectively . The chief of the State Department 's Division of Current Information is Michael T. , who is generally recognized as one of the most able press officers in Washington . He has recently assumed the additional task of laying down the broad policy to be followed in broadcasts to foreign countries . His budget for the last fiscal year was $110,113 and the Selective Service estimate for this year is $30,000 . The two most active information departments are at the Treasury and the OEM . Charged with presenting the defense bond program to the nation , the Treasury has increased its normal staff of about ten to fifty-nine and has also added forty-three persons in Washington and 132 throughout the forty-eight States . The Treasury division 's allotment for 1941-42 is $3,343,085 , the largest amount for any information group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money back into the Treasury . The services of top-flight song writers like Irving Berlin have been acquired gratis ; free time has been given as required by the radio companies , by independent stations and by the producers of sustaining programs ; four regular programs have been produced over nationwide chains , and both newspaper and motion picture company owners have cooperated in the campaign . Actually the Treasury Department has branched out from the narrow aim of selling bonds to the broader field of creating public morale , appealing to patriotism and reaching a wider audience than any of the other departments . Explaining Defense Problems The operation of the OEM press division under Robert W. Horton , former Washington correspondent of The New York World Telegram , indicates the flood of copy that is now pouring into the newspaper , radio , and motion picture offices of the country . Since OEM and its subsidiary , the Office of Production Management , are dealing with such technical questions as the supply of machine tools and the shortage of strategic materials , Mr. Horton put trained newspaper reporters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be not only intelligible to experts but also understandable to the public . To do this ar i to present it to the public over all effective means of communication , Mr. Horton assembled a staff of 220 , which will spend about $700,000 this year . In one month alone his division issued 197 handouts and distributed 3,960,000 mimeographed pages . It has spent $40,000 producing transcriptions for about 375 radio stations which were induced to run off records explaining to the public the problems in " tooling up " for national defense . In the field of presenting defense information abroad , the Coordinator of Information , Colonel William J. Donovan , has the largest staff , with 175 persons here in Washington and about forty in New York . It is difficult to ascertain the cost of this work because half of Colonel Donovan 's work is in coordinating all defense information coming into this country , while the other half deals with a United States news propaganda campaign going abroad . Between fifty and 100 persons are working for Colonel Donovan at the Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information to be used in shortwave broadcasts . Another large staff is engaged in the strategy of the foreign broadcasts and in writing the scripts which are submitted to short-wave stations for use as they desire . A more accurate idea of the extent of our news service abroad is given by the Office for the Coordination of Inter-American Affairs which , under Nelson Rockefeller , is looking after morale in Latin America . This information service , with seventy-two employes under a former Pulitzer Prize winner , Francis A. Jamieson , has a grant of $2,974,682 for 1941-42 to tell Latin America what the United States is doing . Of this , $300,000 was allotted for an expert analysis of totalitarian propaganda in Latin America ; $250,000 for the publication of a magazine called En Guardia ; $150 , - 000 for the preparation and distribution in Latin America of books , pamphlets , leaflets , posters and other printed material about the United States ; $125,000 for the production of news pictures and feature articles about the United States , and $175,000 for the improvement of United States newsdistributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also allocated $700,000 to improve our radio programs in Latin Arnefica , $600,000 for the production and distribution of United States films below the Rio Grande and $150,000 to translate our books into Spanish and Portuguese , and added a contract authorization of $850,000 to carry on all this work into the fiscal year 1942-43 . It is clear from these facts that the United States Government is now engaged in a campaign to spread the news of its activities and objectives all over the world . There are differences of opinion here about how this should be done . Some authorities think the information services should be centralized with a view to efficiency and economy ; others believe such a system would lead to censorship at the source and thus infringe the freedom of the press . The Administration is attempting to steer a middle course , with Colonel Donovan running the broadcasting and psychological warfare everywhere except in the Western Hemisphere ; with Nelson Rockefeller directing the widespread dissemination of news and only news in Latin America , and with Mr. " correlating " the defense information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of these bureaus is touching the other twenty-six non-dedense agencies , whose information activities will be discussed in the second and last of these articles tomorrow .
