Frank Leahy had been crying quietly all summer . His Irish had n't lost a game since 1945 , and his record at Notre Dame was 41 victories , three defeats and four ties . But , as usual , the future looked black to Leahy . As his 72-man squad stepped briskly through its pre-season paces at South Bend last week , Leahy looked ahead to opening day and turned away with a groan . Said he : " September 25 is going to be a sad afternoon . I think Purdue will beat us . " <P> Sleep &; Steak . If Notre Dame were starting the season against Spearfish Normal , Leahy would probably predict victory for Spearfish . But for once , this coachly gloom seemed to have some slight justification . Notre Dame 's 1947 All-America Quarterback Johnny Lujack had graduated ; the departure of Ziggie Czarobski and All-America George Connor had left holes at both tackles . ( Gritted Leahy : " You ca n't lose boys like that without having to start over . " ) And Purdue 's 1948 Boilermakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an opening-game breather . To many experts , they looked like the strongest team on Notre Dame 's ten-game schedule-which this year , for the first time since 1913 , does not include Army . <P> The Notre Dame players had returned to South Bend from their summer vacations looking bronzed and rugged . They had kept in shape as farmhands , icemen , truck drivers and lifeguards . Now they were back on a Leahy diet of football , sleep and twice-a-week steaks . Coming out of each scrimmage huddle the players yelled : " Beat the Boilermakers . " <P> Board &; Room . For Lujack 's successor at quarterback , Leahy was counting on Frank Tripucka , a shy , skinny New Jersey senior . Like all but a few Notre Dame players ( and like many other college players ) , 21-year-old Tripucka is " working his way through . " In exchange for free room , board and tuition , he does easy campus chores ( e.g. , painting stadium seats ) after football season is over . Last year Tripucka completed 25 passes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - but he was not yet a Lujack at tackling , running , or field generalship . <P> At Lafayette , not far away , Purdue 's Boilermakers were practicing in secret last week behind a high canvas screen . Businesslike Coach Stu Holcomb , who had been an assistant to Earl Blaik at West Point in the Davis-Blanchard heyday , had them hustling . He got the Boilermakers out on the practice field at an ungentlemanly 8:30 a.m. , needled them with his impatient " Let 's go , let 's go ! " <P> Compared with Coach Leahy , Stu Holcomb sounded like Pollyanna . Ten of Purdue 's eleven 1947 starters were back this year , including Quarterback Bob De-Moss , a fine passer , and Halfback Harry Szulborski , who averaged better than six yards a try in 1947 . That left Holcomb only one understandable gripe : a schedule that pits Purdue against Notre Dame , Northwestern and Michigan in the first three weeks .
