The showdown came at 7 in the morning . German General von Neubronn ordered his SS men to break down the door to old Marshal Petain 's bedroom . To the half-dressed Chief of the Vichy State , he issued an ultimatum . <P> At 8 o'clock , six automobiles whisked through the city of Vichy , sped northeastward , convoyed by German Army motorcycles . Among the passengers : Ptain , his wife , his personal physician . <P> By 9 o'clock , friends of Ptain were passing out circulars , with the Marshal 's farewell message : <P> " Frenchmen ! At the moment you read this message , I am no longer free . Although I could not be your sword , I tried at least to be your shield . My words and my acts have surprised you occasionally . But you may now know that they hurt me more than they hurt you . " <P> Three days later , Petain turned up in the small French town of Morvillars , six miles from the Swiss border . Near by were Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joseph Darnand . At last report , Petain and Laval were in Germany . The whereabouts of labor chief Marcel Deat and fascist leader Jacques Doriot were not reported . But Fernand Bouisson , president of the Vichy Chamber of Deputies , had been caught by the Maquis four miles from St. Raphael , was being held for Allied justice . <P> As the Vichyites disappeared , the names of democratic French leaders came back into the news . Former Chamber of Deputies President Edouard Herriot and Premier Leon Blum , who had been reported dead , were now reported to be in Germany . Reported " living quietly " was : General Maxime Weygand ( in the Tyrol ) . Reported assassinated by Darnand 's militia in Paris : ex-Cabinet Minister Georges Mandel . <P> Justice of another kind quickly overtook the Vichy regime . Switzerland withdrew recognition of the Vichy Government , prepared to recognize the Government of General Charles de Gaulle . The Vatican ceased to recognize Vichy . Sweden and Turkey bowed out . Spain and Portugal raced for the privilege of dropping the hot cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's further right to diplomatic recognition . <P> Thus , unwept , unhonored and unsung , died Vichy France .
