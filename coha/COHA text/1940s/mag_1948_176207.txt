For the first time in history , South Carolina Negroes voted freely last week in the Democratic primary ; by evening of election day nearly 35,000 had cast their ballots . To old families in the mansions along Charleston 's historic Battery , as to most South Carolinians across the state , this was sacrilege . But proud Charleston spent its bitterness on the cause , rather than the effect of this enormous social change . It charged it all up to cold-eyed , 68-year-old Federal Judge J. Waties Waring . <P> Antique Grandeur . Judge Waring was one of Charleston 's own . He was born of an old and honored family ; he married a Charleston girl . He was appointed to the bench January 1942 on the recommendation of the late Senator " Cotton Ed " Smith . Until he was 65 , he abided by the insular mores of Charleston 's first families and devoted himself to the dusty grandeur of Charleston 's traditions . <P> Three years ago , after 32 years of marriage , he and his wife got a Florida divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge married a Connecticut woman . He was instantly ostracized . He did not take it well . Charleston lawyers complained that he grew more vituperative and irascible month by month . But as time wore on , he also grew more liberal in his opinions . His onetime friends did not consider the possibility that an elderly man might gain a new and deeper understanding of justice and the law . They whispered that he was " out to get his revenge . " <P> Last July they were sure of it . Judge Waring ordered the Democratic Party to open its enrollment books to Negroes and permit them " full participation in party affairs . " He went even further . When a white man , Senatorial Candidate Alan Johnstone , rose to protest , the judge had him forcibly ejected . He told the crowd of Negroes who jammed his courtroom : " It is a disgrace when you have to come . . . and ask a judge to tell you how to be an American . " <P> He was jeered and denounced . When lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Island beach , its owner nailed up a neatly lettered sign : " Dear God , He Lives Next Door . " Every man entered in South Carolina 's senatorial race vilified him during the campaign . Congressman L. Mendel Rivers sought to institute impeachment proceedings against him , cried : " Unless he is removed . . . there will be bloodshed . He is now in the process of extracting a pound of flesh from the white people of South Carolina because , through his own actions , he has been ostracized from their society . " <P> <P> New Dignity . Last week there was no bloodshed . South Carolina 's Negroes voted quietly . Their votes did not change the result-all the favorites , including blue-blooded , well-heeled U.S. Senator Burnet R. Maybank of Charleston , won handily . Whatever South Carolina thought last week , history might remember crusty , umbrageous Judge J. Waties Waring as a man of cool courage .
