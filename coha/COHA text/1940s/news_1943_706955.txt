txt Raid Signals Rouse Irony I want to cooperate with the civilian defense when an air raid comes , but I am a little confused in spite of the repeated explanations of the new simplified warning system . I do n't know where to look for the blue or red signals . I can not see the lights on the Empire State Building and my radio set is not equipped for color television . When the red light flickers , is it warbling ? I am a little nervous because I am troubled by night blindness , and am deaf to certain colors , and my wife 's family has a tendency to color blindness , not being able to see the difference between certain notes . Last Saturday , at noon , I thought I heard the red signal , but the longer I looked , the more the red sounded like blue , and after a minute the blue seemed to warble a sustained note that looked as if it had red overtones . If I did not see these sounds correctly , I will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . I have the latest type bifocal earphones , equipped with anastigmatic color filters to align my right eye with my left ear , so I can see the signal no matter how lusterless it sounds or how warbling it looks , and regardless of its odor . In other words , I am trying to hint that it would cause less confusion if all reference to color was dropped from the air raid signals . ADOLPH MOSES . New York , Jan. 31 , 1943.
