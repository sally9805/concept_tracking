txt The practical men of aviation who get paid for dreaming are planning to give you a ride ri a strange-looking airliner , built as cheaply is today 's planes but traveling perhaps twice as high and about twice as fast . They want to take you from Los Angeles to New York in less than five hours , and on to London in six or seven . It 's a date for 1956 ? if they can make it , It will take a coordinated effort . Engineers at such plants as Boeing . North American or Lockheed must work with military appropriations and military airmen to achieve safe 500 mile-an-hour-plus jet flights . Tests of new craft at military bases like California 's Muroc Dry Lake , Point Mugu and Inyokern are just as important as the work in drafting rooms and on production floors . For it 's no secret that private capital no longer can risk the millions needed to create the first of the brand-new transports . Before the air traveler gets his first commercial jet ride in eight or ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ne safe to fly people at 40,000 feet ? Can airline traffic control handle the special problems around airports created by fast-moving jets ? Will wings be straight as in today 's planes , or will they be swept back like arrowheads , with slots and flaps to slow them down ? And will the jet engine turn a propeller or use pure " thrust " as today 's jet fighters do ? Traffic Control Let 's start with the air traffic control problem , admittedly a tough one : At Point Mugu , 50 miles up the California coast from Los Angeles . the Navy is pushing development of a S30 million base for testing guided missiles . Point Mugu , which meant " landing place " to the Indians , might today be called " launching , place. - Some 2,200 military and civilian personnel are busy sending up " birds " ( guided missiles ) seeking to control their flight by radar and radio , and tracking their course by electronic detectives . Technicians from Glenn L. Martin Co . Fairchild Engine .4- .. Airplane Corp .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Navy men . Queer names such as Lark , Loon , Bat and Gorgon are commonplaces of conversation , together with other names , still on the military secret list . The tests , too , are secret . but it 's known that good progress is being made on short range missiles . What these technicians learn will someday be applied to a jet airplane approaching Nev. - York International Airport at perhans 530 miles an hour , seven miles above the ear : The plane will be guided to the airstrip wit : - out delay for weather or traffic and lande I with much less human control than today . pilot is accustomed to . These electronic controls niuqt be rcrfeeted because the jet plane might no be able to respond quickly enough to radio instructions by voice , as today 's planes are handled . And since jet planes will have fuel reserves too small to permit much circling of a field in bad weather , it 's imperative that a landing be made quickly . Urgency of the traffic control problem is summarized by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot ) just ca n't react quickly enough , " says one . " Jets will come in so fast that they may have to have special fields of their own not mixing with today 's planes which have a top speed of only about 300 miles an hour , " says the other . Propeller May Come First These operational hazards , which airlines must solve if passengers are to fly with safety and contictence , may mean that proponents of " turbo-prop " planes will win an mitial argument with designers favoring pronellerless craft . Most airline men think the turbo , orop will he a better " transition " plane than the pure jet since it will only increase speeds to between 400 and 430 miles an hour from today 's 200 to 300. whereas the pure jet might provide 500 to 550 mile an hour velocities . The turbo-prop engine shoots a jet of gas through a series of turbine wheels , which turn like a windmill . They revolve a central shaft , which spins the propeller . The British are nearing production of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slated to use turbo-prop engines and so is the Boeing NB-52 bomber and probably a later model , the tiB-55 . " Speed of commercial craft has each year increased an average of about eight miles an hour , during the lifetime of commercial aviation That 's only a little more than half the speed progress of military planes , " says a leading airline engineer . " It 's just common sense to jump to a 400-to-450 miles an hour range first , and try to fit it into our operational pattern , rather than leaping to over 500 miles an hour in one jump , " he thinks . Engineers contend they know enough about gas turbines plus propellers to give the airlines a good reliable engine by the time they will want the planes some half a dozen years hence ( it may take a couple more years to test and perfect the new craft for scheduled operation ) . Anti-Propeller Talk But proponents of pure jet such as Hall Hibbard and Kelly Johnson of Lockheed argue that propellers wo n't be necessary . These experts say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure jet planes , whereas the turbo-prop is largely . a testblock engine , and has actually flown only a few hours .
