The potent post of Federal Loan Administrator , which a suspicious Congress denied Commerce Secretary Henry Wallace , had remained uncomfortably open . <P> ( Fred Vinson had quit it April 2 , after a 29-day occupancy , to become Franklin Roosevelt 's War Mobilizer . ) Last week , in his first major appointment , President Truman filled the job . His choice seemed to please everybody . <P> Seasoned , solid , 48-year-old John Wesley Snyder , the new Administrator , is a hard-driving St. Louis banker , a former manager of the St. Louis branch of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. , and an old and close friend of Harry Truman . <P> In 1940 , Jesse Jones brought him to Washington , made him executive vice president of the Defense Plant Corp. , <P> and an assistant to the directors of RFC . <P> There , John Wesley Snyder endeared him self to all &; sundry by his swift cutting of Government red tape , his shrewd spending of some $3 billion of U.S. war money . <P> The only feelings of hostility he raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-boss , Jesse Jones , who sent him packing to St. Louis in January 1943 . But by last week even this quarrel was patched up . <P> Said Jones : " President Truman could not have made a better appointment . " The man who will now have many billions to spend was an artillery captain in the 32nd Division A.E.F. He is an eager reader , religiously reads four books a week . ( Standard regimen : two biographies , one book of history , one novel . ) Like many another of Harry Truman 's Missouri friends , he plays a close game of poker . Unlike others he collects dimes ( one of every U.S. issue ) and pictures of airplanes ( he considers them graceful ) . <P> As Loan Administrator , Snyder said . <P> he would " extend credit only to those people who have demonstrated that they deserve it . " Then he went to work .
