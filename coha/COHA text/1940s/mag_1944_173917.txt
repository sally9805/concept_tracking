For six years Mohamed Ali Jinnah , head of India 's Moslem League , has dodged Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi . Jinnah has declined to discuss , man to man , the League 's lack of relations with the All-India National Congress . Last July Gandhi accepted the Moslem League 's Pakistan principle-autonomy for all Indian areas with a Moslem majority-and again proposed a meeting with Jinnah . Jinnah said yes , but fell sick . Gandhi bided his time . <P> Last week he walked 300 yards up the hill to Jinnah 's modern bungalow in Bombay . The two men greeted each other , then disappeared inside . <P> Three hours later Gandhi came out again : the unity talk had been postponed until the following Monday . Sunday is the 21st day of Ramadan , the Moslem holy month , and Jinnah must spend it in silence .
