txt // other motifs taken together , that the pottery made by the German colonists is often spoken of as " Tulip Ware . " So beloved was the tulip by these early German settlers in America , indeed , that they habitually pourtrayed it in every conceivable place and under every conceivable form , either natural or conventionalised . They cast it in their iron stove plates , they painted it on the dower chests of their brides , they worked it on their samplers , they illuminated it on their Vorschriften , they carved it on the date-stones of their houses along with the initials of the goodman and his spouse , and , finally , they chiselled it on the headstones of their graves when they were gathered to their fathers . Besides all this , the early colonists cultivated the bulb most extensively . It could scarcely have had greater veneration in Holland in the days of Tulipomania . Some mystic symbolism seems to have attached to this prevalent use of the tulip motif ? perhaps , like the old Persians , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love , and immortality . At any rate , it lent itself admirably to decorative treatment in the hands of unskilled draughtsmen , and is by far the most successful of all the subjects they attempted . Indeed , the plates , platters , jars , and other articles decorated with the tulip design often possess much genuine artistic merit and charm , whereas many of the other designs appeal to us merely by their rugged vigour in both conception and execution or by their naive grotesquerie . THE FUCHSIA . Next to the tulip in popular favour as a motif for decoration came the fuchsia . Like the tulip , it lent itself conveniently to conventional treatment or , if preferred , to a semi-naturalistic representation . " One of the striking characteristics of the German // people in Pennsylvania , which has clung to them through all the years that have elapsed since their ancestors left the fatherland , is their love for flowers . " Historians tell us that the people in the Rhine country take an especial delight in flowers , and that " nowhere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left side of the river , " the district from which so many of the Pennsylvania German colonists migrated . The fuchsia was a familiar and much-esteemed flower in the gardens of the farmhouses , and its almost invariable presence there is probably to be accounted for in part by the fact that " the fuchsia in Germany has long been regarded as sacred , since it is one of the first signs of the returning life of spring . " THE FORGET-ME-NOT . Sometimes in connexion with roses , sometimes by itself , the forget-me-not appears as a decoration on slip-traced or sgraffito pottery . Its clearly defined outline invited depiction . Sentiment , also , dictated its use , especially on pieces intended for presentation . It was a traditional subject , too , and often appears as a motif on some of the old pottery made in Germany . OTHER FLOWERS . The rose , the lily of the valley , the Persian pink , and other blossoms also were used by the potters to embellish their handiwork . While , in some instances , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom represented may be , the indications are usually plain enough for identification . In the selection of floral motifs , the craftsmen were guided not only by personal preference or the readiness with which certain species lent themselves to adaptation for decorative purposes , but also by a regard for the symbolism expressed in the language of flowers ? the accom232 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS panying inscriptions on many pieces prove this ? and by the promptings of traditional attachment , for these simple colonists , under an oftentimes uncouth exterior , were , after all , tender sentimentalists , rigorous conservatives , and mystics in their own somewhat clumsy and bucolic way ( Fig. 4 ) . FRUITS . Apples and grapes seem to have been the favourite fruits chosen for representation on the slipdecorated ware , although other fruits also may now and then be found . Fruit motifs , apparently , were not nearly so popular as some other subjects . Birds. ? THE TURTLEDOVE . Among birds , the turtledove held a place comparable in favour to that of the tulip among floral motifs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its recurrence is frequent not only on the sgraffito decorated plates , platters , and jugs , but also in other decorative work wrought by the Pennsylvania Germans . THE EAGLE . The eagle appears both in its natural shape and in the traditional double-headed form proper 0 // to heraldic representation . As a natural bird it was , perhaps , indicative of patriotism on the part of the potters who potted after the king of birds had become a national emblem . As a double-headed creature it was reminiscent of the devices they had so often seen blasoned in the land of their origin or of the design on some treasured heirloom they had brought with them to a new land . THE PEACOCK . The decorative possibilities suggested by the peacock could not fail to impress a craftsman considering a subject of design . Furthermore , the peacock was a familiar fowl in the farmhouse dooryards , as it " was raised quite extensively in the Pennsylvania German settlements , as elsewhere in the Eastern States , and in some of the rural districts it was looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to indicate the approach of rain . Its gorgeous plumage was used for mantel decoration , sometimes being placed in an earthen jar , and was also made into pliant brooms to be waved across the dining table in fly time . For ordinary purposes brushes made of fringed paper were in common use , but the peacock broom was always brought forth on state occasions . " OTHER BIRDS . In addition to the birds just named , the potters made more or less use of the following in their decoration : the duck , the drake , the swan , the oriole , the parrot , the domestic cock ( Fig. 5 , B ) and hen , and the pelican ( Fig. 5 , A ) , the last being regarded as emblematic of maternal devotion . ANIMALS . Besides the deer , the horse , and the rabbit , which seem to have been looked upon with special favour among the representatives of the animal kingdom , lions , dogs , and other four-footed creatures made // their appearance from time to time . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain flowers and a few of the birds , the representation was not infrequently vigorous and spirited . HUMAN FIGURES . When it came to tracing the " human form divine , " the " Pennsylvania Dutch " potter can scarcely be reckoned a skillful limner . Most of his efforts in that direction are frankly grotesque , but refreshing , nevertheless , if we take them simply for what they are worth and do not expect too much . On a plate showing a wedding scene the bride and groom are evidently people of very positive mould . If physiognomy be any criterion , one might reasonably suspect the lady of having a truculent disposition and a shrewish temper . The wasp-like waists of the damsels on the Mischianza plate excite our pity , but , notwithstanding the physical limitations of their tenuity , they seem to be having such an agreeable time treading the minuet with their gallant British partners that perhaps our compassion is not needed . At any rate , whatever their // i defects from an artistic point of view , they are interesting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dress and manners of the time . MISCELLANEOUS DEVICES . The slip-ware decorators now and again had recourse to miscellaneous devices not included in any of the foregoing classifications . Among these may be found houses , trees , hearts , swords , stars , fish , serpents , herring-bone patterns , and serpentine scrolls . INSCRIPTIONS . For marginal use or incorporation in the body of the decoration , inscriptions , dates , names , and initial letters were of frequent occurrence . Moral admonitions , mottoes , proverbs , expressions of affectionate regard , and indications of ownership are all to be found , and sometimes the name of the maker occupies a conspicuous place . The snatches of verse and the couplets thus employed are often exceedingly quaint , and , by this means , one occasionally finds an allusion to some peculiar local custom or gets an insight into an interesting bit of folk-lore . The general tone may be judged by the following specimens : To paint flowers is common , But God alone is able to give fragrance . Rather would I single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tobacco does a man as much good As though he spends his money with the girls . I cook what I can , If my sow will not eat , my husband will . The last was probably in allusion to an old German saying that " He is a poor farmer because he eats all the good things himself and does not give his pig any . " // Nearly all of these inscriptions are in the " PennsyIvania Dutch " dialect . The lettering is generally vigorous and possessed of a certain rude grace which accords well with the naivete of the sentiments expressed . Sometimes the marginal inscriptions on plates were in the nature of a grace , and filled a useful purpose in supplying occasional reminders of moral principles and food for reflection while the plate itself supplied food for the body . It must be remembered , too , that among these people there was little popular reading matter , so that the inscriptions , therefore , ministered to another want . The potters , in some cases , put small marks or devices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces with their names . In forming our estimate of the intrinsic merits of Pennsylvania German slip-decorated pottery it is not , of course , fair to apply the tests that we should ordinarily apply to work of a more finished character . It was a spontaneous expression of folk-art among a crude people , and we must consider all the attendant circumstances of its production . The conception is full of vitality , and the depiction energetic and straightforward . The artists were not skillful , but they were sincere , and their honest efforts should command our respect , because they were evidently doing the best they knew how . Above all , it was appropriate , for it suited the conditions of the people by whom and for whom it was made . Notwithstanding all the imperfections in drawing , notwithstanding the frequent crudity of colour , notwithstanding the general bizarrerie of many of the pieces , they all possess a decorative charm that compels our interest , if not our admiration . Indeed , in // the light of recent post-Impressionistic inspiration , it seems hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual deficiency of drawing , the painfully jimp waists of the women , the misshapen anatomy of the men , the exaggerations and distortions in the pourtrayal of birds , beasts , and flowers , are all very like the earmarks of draughtsmanship that receive the approval of our most modern art mentors . There is this difference , however . None of the old potters were posing , and all of them were unquestionably sincere . The old potteries are now all idle or have fallen into ruin . They have not been operated since about 1850 . We can not help feeling some regret that this craft is no longer practised , and it is quite possible to understand the inspiration that prompted English Colonial potters living near the Germans to imitate their ware . Apart from the purposes of the collector , the present value of the pottery is twofold . By its own visible evidence we can learn much of the people who made it , and , more important still , it is capable of supplying a stimulus to the craftsman of to-day . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be , but the processes by which it was made can be used again and with as great success . The collector never knows when or where he may chance upon a piece of slip-ware and , incidentally , a discovery regarding manners and methods . If one really wishes to find novel pieces he must be constantly on the lookout in every imaginable place , just as he would for any other kind of pottery or porcelain , and he must be willing to poke into all sorts of unpromising nooks and corners . One can never tell where the treasure may lie . The rural districts of Pennsylvania , // however , and the cities not too far removed from the eastern portion of the State are likely to be the most fruitful hunting ground . In any of these places it is worth while to nose about any antique shop or the habitat of any junk dealer . The finest collection of slip-ware in any one place is to be seen at Memorial Hall , in Fairmount Park , Philadelphia , a part of the Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection at Manhelm , Pennsylvania . STONEWARE It would be unjust to the eighteenth century craftsmen to conclude a chapter on early pottery without some allusion to the grey or grey-brown stoneware with blue decorations . Such ware , consisting chiefly of pitchers , mugs , butter crocks and pickle jars , was made in several places and , in one or two instances ? notably at Haddonfield in West Jersey ? has been manufactured without interruption to the present day , the same forms and methods of decoration being employed without change . The shapes of these vessels were good and the colour scheme ? deep blue decorations in a grey or grey-brown ground ? pleasing . Simple floral devices were either painted on a flat surface or else blue colouring was run into shallow incised patterns , after which the glaze was applied . Sometimes the whole surface was covered with incised ornament and not coloured . CHAPTER IX DECORATIVE PAINTING ON HOUSEHOLD GEAR F J ABLY American decorative painting has far more than a purely antiquarian interest for us to-day . The various decorative objects wrought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the articles of common household utility , to which they applied some sort of painted ornamentation , have aroused in recent years a lively interest on the part of both collectors and professional decorators and have supplied abundant inspiration and patterns for modern emulation . Collectors esteem them for their intrinsic merits , for the gratification of some individual fancy , for some peculiarity of historical consideration attaching to them or the like . Decorators have recognised their value for purposes of a kind of embellishment , especially effective in certain appropriate settings , and when they can not come by originals they are not slow to demand reproductions , so that the craftsworker has found much employment in this fruitful traditional field . The private purchaser , too , has not been slow to see the merits of this old work and turn it to good account . Although the decorative painting representing the handiwork of long-past generations has not been made the definite object of the collector 's energies in a comprehensive way , so far as the writers are aware ? it really spreads over almost too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one in-239 // dividual ? its appeal has proved so compelling , and we find the application of the decorative resources it offers made in such various and ingenious ways , either by the use of original " finds " made at antique shops or at the junk dealer 's , by reproductions or by adaptations that adhere pretty faithfully to the spirit of their prototypes in colour and design , that it deserves systematic and extended attention from those who would be fully cognisant of the wealth of our decorative heritage . Abundant examples of early decorative painting are to be found on the usual pieces of household furniture , especially chests , cupboards , chairs , and tables , and also upon mirror tops , clock faces , the doors of bracket and hanging clocks , trays , small boxes , bellows , snuff-boxes and band-boxes , and many other small odds and ends . First in order we shall consider the larger pieces of furniture . FURNITURE We are altogether too apt to take it for granted that our Colonial forebears depended wholly upon the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the gratification of any taste for the amenities of existence that they might have leisure and means to entertain or cultivate . As a matter of fact , they were not so busy subduing the wilderness and battling with adverse conditions that they had no time to devote to anything not savouring of severely practical utility . One of the things for which the desire seized them was some sort of decoration for their simpler and often home-made furniture , much of it constructed of cheap , common , and easily worked wood of whatever kind chance brought readiest to hand . With characteristic resourcefulness , they supplied the want themselves , // depending for inspiration upon the traditions they had brought with them , as a part of their heritage , from the lands whence they were sprung . The form of decoration they applied to their plainer furniture was painting , and we find furniture painting practised from New England to the Southern Colonies . Its character differed widely in different localities and was determined in the several regions by the several types of tradition to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one style , derived from English tradition , in New England ; another style , derived from Dutch tradition , in New York and the Dutch parts of Long Island and Northern New Jersey ; while , in Pennsylvania , there flourished among the Pennsylvania Germans still a third style , derived from the peasant traditions of Bavaria and the neighbouring German principalities . Pennsylvania also exhibited examples of English tradition among the English eoionists , and the same may be said of the Southern Colonies . The want of some sort of decoration was perfectly natural . Of necessity , the home-made furniture , chest , cupboard , or what you will , was severely simple in form and line and evidenced the need of something to relieve its austerity and baldness of aspect . Paint afforded the easiest means of supplying the obvious need , and paint was the first to suggest itself . It ministered to native love of colour . Besides , paint was the logical preservative of the wood . But , even at the very beginning , paint was not regarded from the merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest instances it was applied to only a part of the surface and in a decorative design . This method of embellish-16 // ment was customarily employed where the object to be decorated was made of oak or some other wood whose grain and colour had a decorative value in themselves . NEW ENGLAND . The first examples of American Colonial furniture painting are to be found , of course , in ' New England . There chests , hutches , small boxes , and the like were not infrequently adorned with simple floriated or foliated designs , more or less conventional , applied on a background of colour or upon the natural wood . Sometimes the decoration consisted merely of scrolls and waving lines . Nearly all the painting of this sort is of very early date , and most of the pieces in which it is found belong to the seventeenth century . The mouldings on many seventeenth- and some early eighteenth-century New England-made chests and cupboards were of pine or some other soft wood , although the rest of the piece may have been of oak . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stain these mouldings red , in imitation of cedar or rosetta-wood . Likewise , the turned and applied ornaments for seventeenth-century New England oak cabinet work , ' such as round or oval bosses and split balusters , spindles , or maces , were frequently made of pine , or of some soft wood that could be easily worked , and then painted black to look like ebony . Sometimes , however , even hardwood mouldings were painted or stained . It was a common practice to stain parts of cabinet work instead of using paint , but , as the chromatic effect was obtained in practically the same way , the process is to be included under the head of painting . A more // extensive use of staining than that already alluded to , in the case of mouldings , is to be found on some of the " Hadley " chests ? so called from the peculiar form of carved decoration found on many chests and boxes made in the vicinity of Hadley , Massachusetts ? where rails , stiles , and panels are all given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable variety is attained by the use of two or three hues , such as red , mulberry , and black or red , brown , and black . Oftentimes , also , on pieces of furniture other than chests , or on pieces with a device quite different from the Hadley pattern , where the ornament consisted of flat carving in low relief , the design was strongly accentuated by the application of colour to the background . Occasionally panels were painted with stripes . Then , again , the flat surfaces of panels or stiles of chests , or other articles of cabinet work , are sometimes found ornamented with painted line or dot designs in geometrical or floral patterns , and , in some cases , the tulip motif appears in this form , which circumstance would seem to point to a strain of Dutch or German influence and occasions some surprise , as one scarcely expects to find this flower painted although its occurrence elsewhere on carving is common enough ? outside of the Pennsylvania German sphere of inspiration . The least worthy form of painted decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . After the period of profuse carving had passed , the flat drawer fronts of chests of drawers and highboys were now and again enlivened with painted patterns of flowers and leaves . Doubtless the inspiration for some of this species of ornament came from the ja244 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS panned or lacquered pieces , so popular in England in the latter part of the seventeenth century and the early part of the eighteenth . Some of them , of course , found their way to America , and examples are not wanting of fairly sucessful attempts , on the part of American craftsmen , to emulate the lacquer work of contemporary British manufacture . In England , the art of lacquering was extensively practised by amateurs , with varying degrees of success , and no doubt the same was true in America , for London fashions found a very prompt echo on our side of the Atlantic , and , in all probability , a copy or two of Stalker and Parker 's " Treatise on Japanning and Varnishing , " published in 1688 , reached Colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not extensively undertaken , and outside of New England few , if any , serious attempts were made in that direction . Thus , with the conclusion of the lacquer episode , we reach the limit of furniture painting phases peculiar to New England . Other types of painted decoration practised there were shared with other parts of the Colonies . Before quitting the consideration of forms of decorative furniture painting peculiar to New England , however , a word must be added anent court cupboards , press cupboards or wainscot cupboards , and their various mobiliary kin and descendants , which seem always to have been especially favourite subjects for painted decoration . The taste and precedent for such decoration are , in all likelihood , to be traced through England , Flanders and Holland , and finally to Germany , where , in the early seventeenth century , the cabinet makers , inspired by the elaborate and multi-coloured inlay of woods , metals , and stones or mosaic , wrought by Italian and Spanish artisans , // seem to have achieved brilliant results with paint , which offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill and infinitely less labour , some approximation to the interest and relief of design and colour produced by more complex decorative processes . In this connexion , in his book on the furniture of Colonial America , Mr. Lockwood calls attention to the frequent use of paint to enliven the mouldings , cornices , and turned ornaments of early New England cupboards , and the occasional presence of stain or paint as a background to set off carving . It must also be remembered that not a few of the early cupboards or buffets were painted wholly white , or in some colour , and picked out or lined with gold enrichments . This was particularly apt to be the case when the cupboards were built into the walls or when they partook of architectural features in their form or method of ornamentation . The insides were usually adorned with paint and gilding , while the coved scallop shells that generally formed the arch at the top especially invited such decoration . NEW YORK , LONG ISLAND , NORTHERN NEW JERSEY . In Dutch New York , and the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting of chests , chairs , stools , cupboards , and other articles of furniture was commonly practised . Chests in the Hudson Valley were rarely made of oak , as in New England , but were customarily constructed of pine or some other cheap wood and painted . Many pieces were painted a solid colour all over , while the grace of design was added here and there as a relief . The great kasses or cupboards were sometimes made of black walnut , but , for the most part , were of pine and painted , not seldom // with elaborate and ample decorative bunches of fruits , flowers , and ribbons . PENNSYLVANIA GERMAN WORK . One of the most interesting and strongly individual manifestations of furniture painting in Colonial America was that practised by the Germans of Pennsylvania , to whose singuarly fertile perpetuation of traditions , transplanted from their fatherland , allusion has previously been made . A comparison of the painted chests and boxes to be found by roaming about in out-of-the-way corners of the counties where the " Pennsylvania Dutch " chiefly settled ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Northampton ? discloses a striking resemblance to the painted furniture of Bavaria , characteristic specimens of which are preserved in the National Museum of Munich . While the colouring of the Pennsylvania chests is sometimes more subdued , it is not universally so , and there is a close likeness shown in the method of combining the colours . There is also a remarkable similarity in the decorative motifs employed ? stiff , crudely drawn flowers and fruits , birds , and decorative bands . Of course , in the choice of designs , the " Pennsylvania Dutch " showed a local predilection for the tulip , which they never failed to introduce in every possible place , from tombstones to iron stove-plates or illuminated baptismal certificates . Other motifs , specifically mentioned in the chapter on slipdecorated pottery , were also employed in their furniture painting . Besides the conventional decorative panels and bands separating them , inscriptions were almost invariably used as an additional embellishment . Sometimes merely the initials of the owner or owners and // the date would appear . Then , again , some homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious sentiment , or a practical bit of advice in proverb form , would be employed in addition . The articles chosen for this kind of chromatic decoration were chests , especially the so-called dower chests , which the bride took with her , filled with ample store of household linen , to her new home , and the small wooden boxes , often of oval shape , which the groom customarily gave to the bride at or a little before the time of the wedding . These " bride-boxes , " as they are sometimes called , were filled with linen , laces , ribbons , and other small finery dear to the feminine heart , for the personal use and adornment of the bride . Whether oval or round in shape ? both forms were common ? the boxes are made of four pieces of wood ? two in the box itself and two in the cover . The bottom and top are made of thin pieces of white pine of the required shape . The sides of the box and the rim of the top are made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to cover slightly more than the circumference of the bottom and top pieces and allow enough to lap over . Where the ends lap , they are pierced and strongly sewed together with split willow withes or rattan , in much the same way that the caning of a chair seat is bound . The top and bottom pieces are fastened inside these bands with tacks or small nails . The inside is left unpainted , and the outside is coated with a solid ground colour ? green , red , blue , yellow , or brown , as taste dictated . Upon this solid colour fanciful decorations in bright hues and flat treatment were lavished . Floral designs and birds were the favourite motifs , although representations of the human figure and in248 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS scriptions were by no means unusual . The human figures sometimes present a valuable commentary on the costumes of the day . As in most of the German peasant work , tulips , pinks , fuchsias , doves , and parrots supply the chief themes for ornamentation , although other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The execution is crude and the colouring oftentimes exceedingly bizarre , but the effect , nevertheless , is , in the main , agreeable and harmonious after its fashion , and the perpetuation of transplanted folk traditions ? practically all of this work was home-made and may be said to have been home-decorated ? is made perfectly obvious . Other pieces of household equipment besides chests and boxes were also painted , although the greatest efforts seem to have been lavished in the direction just indicated . The vivid colours of these painted articles ? bright greens , reds , blues , and yellows were the favourites ? added a note of life and point of interest in any room where they were placed , and it is needless to say that they were cherished with a good deal of pride and satisfaction , not to mention sentiment . It is really remarkable to see how much variety the painters sometimes achieved by the ingenious combination of comparatively few colours . A comparison of several of the dower chests will show how closely the Pennsylvania furniture painters followed the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One chest , to which we shall refer for this purpose , is an exact replica of a bride chest in the National Museum at Munich , the other was picked up at a country sale in Bucks . The Bavarian dower chest has a cream-coloured ground in which the bright-hued // flowers , figures , and bands stand out in strong relief . The front of the chest is divided into three panels by wide yellow , decorative bands . The stiff sprays of flowers and leaves in the side panels , springing primly from graceful little vases , are painted in strong tones of red , green , blue , and yellow , while the bunch of four plums with leaves , in the central panel , is done in plum colour and green . The chequered diaper-work in blue and yellow , at the bottom of the plum panel , is exceedingly effective . The letters J. V. C. A. , in the lower corners of the two side panels , are presumably the initials of the contracting pair , and the figures 1705 doubtless show the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise fully decorated . One shows a quaint little man , fancifully arrayed in mediaeval costume , leaning on a staff and an equally quaint little woman , in gown of the same period , presenting him with a nosegay . The other end has simply a floral design . The Pennsylvania chest is likewise divided into three panels in front . The body of the chest is a dull blue . That the decoration was " home made " may be inferred from the ruled scratchings and carpenter 's compass marks on the wood , made in laying off the spaces for the painted embellishment . The groundwork of the panels is cream coloured , and the flowers , lettering , and figures are done in reds , greens , and yellows that were once brilliant and glowing , but are now dulled by age and perhaps a degree of neglect and exposure . The panels at the ends are much marred , and the design is incoherent and almost obliterated . Quite enough is visible , however , in the decoration of the old Pennsylvania chest to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneness of tradition that supplied the humble painters on different sides of the Atlantic , and at an interval of eighty years , with inspiration to guide them in their task of adornment . ENGLISH WORK . The English settlers in Pennsylvania did not practise this style of furniture painting , but occasionally their work was slightly influenced by contact with their German neighbours . An instance of this is to be seen on an iron-bound strong-box , once the property of Robert Morris and now in the collection of the Pennsylvania Historical Society . The decoration was , in all probability , done either by a German colonist , working in Philadelphia , or else by an English colonist who had seen somewhat of the decoration done by the German settlers and recognised its intrinsic value . Tulips and birds of gay plumage are the motifs of ornament and are painted in the little squares between the heavy iron bands or straps . Windsor chairs and settees were almost invariably painted , dark green being a favourite body colour , although other colours also were used , and the decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour or gilt . Towards the end of the eighteenth century and in the fore part of the nineteenth , wooden chairs and settees , with wide top rails and vertical slats in the back , of a common farmhouse type that is probably to be attributed , in the first place , to a Dutch origin , were painted with great care . A body colour was first applied ? green , red , yellow , blue , brown , or grey ? and lined and banded with black , and then the decoration , consisting of conventional designs , flowers in baskets of sprays of flowers , was painted on the wide , flat space // of the top rail . This decoration was sometimes painted in black from a stencil pattern and sometimes in colours , with a touch of gilding added . Not a few of the top rails and cross rails of chairs and settees were decorated by the application of transfer designs , laid on in the same manner as decalcomanias . The metallic colours and the exact repetition of the same design in hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs and settees of both this type and the Windsor pattern was common throughout the country . Chairs of a late Sheraton type also came in for a share of decorative painting . During the early nineteenth century ? the American Empire period in furniture ? the practice was prevalent of applying a stencilled decoration to furniture with gilt . Colours , too , were frequently included in the scheme of embellishment . The ornament was bestowed upon the top rails and cross-bars of chairs and settees , the top rails , seat rails , and rolled-over arms of sofas and couches , and the fronts of drawers . Lining was used wherever it might show to advantage . This liberal use of gilt was obviously a substitute for the elaborate brass mounts so characteristic of French Empire furniture , but the craftsmen managed to put a good deal of life and individuality into what , at first , was a mere cheap imitation , so that it came to ha e a distinct and legitimate decorative value . The gilding was sometimes applied directly to the mahogany , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been first painted with a body colour ? oftentimes drab , olive green , or brown ? and appropriately lined . The gilded or painted and gilded pattern of decoration , stencilled , free-hand , or transfer , // was generally elaborate and embraced the motifs that were characteristic of the carving of the period ? acanthus leaves , cornucopias , fruit , flowers , cords and tassels , drapery , swags and drops , the anthemion , and other designs that may be readily identified . When the work was done free-hand or stencilled , shading was accomplished by applying umber , sienna , or even black in the required places . MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS The wider general field of domestic decorative painting , comprehending numerous small objects of miscellaneous purpose and varied form , but of a decorative value equal to , or even greater than , that of the larger articles of furniture , has been little heeded except in a fugitive sort of manner and more by way of allusion than by direct reference . We have , as a rule , failed to grasp the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , as units of the residuary milieu of heirlooms constantly surrounding us , we have taken them as a matter of course , without particularly noting their details ? for most people see least what is right under their very noses ? or else because they have only recently been rescued from the oblivion of garrets and junk-shops and paid new honours of appreciation by antique dealer and purchaser alike , both of whom , until a few days ago , were usually too much occupied with the bulkier and more substantial pieces of furniture to bother with " small rubbish " that was only one degree better , to their then way of thinking , than the stuff sold in penny lots at country sales . CLOCK FACES . In the household gear of our forefathers the clock was a point of central interest for its // utilitarian value . It was but natural , therefore , that they should try to make an object towards which , of necessity , their eyes turned many times a day a point of decorative interest as well . Accordingly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or hanging clocks , as circumstances permitted . The spot most available for ornamentation in the tall case clocks was the face , and there we find a variety of treatments , elaborate or simple , as fancy or skill dictated . In the eight-day clocks with the astronomical attachment , showing the lunar phases , there was always an excellent opportunity for painting jolly-faced , ruddy-cheeked , round-eyed moons , the rotundity of whose optics carries the beholder back to the Iliad and makes one think of the " Ox-eyed Juno . " Then there were the starspangled spaces of dark-blue sky between the moon faces , and , occasionally , square-rigged ships that sailed majestically by on heraldically waved seas , as the disc revolved with the passing days of each month . In the spandrels , at the upper and lower corners of the dial , Father Time , hour-glasses , scythes , gay-plumaged birds , stiff little bunches of flowers or baskets of varicoloured fruits oftentimes lent an additional touch of decorative attraction . Judged from a purely naturalistic and pictorial point of view , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless , was good , even when there was no attempt at conventionalisation and the canons of perspective or proprieties of anatomy were cast to the winds , and so the object really aimed at was fully accomplished . Clocks without the astronomical movement , but with a lunette or round arch at the top of the dial , especially invited the labours of the decorative painter . In the // semicircle or lunette of one old clock face an ambitious country artist ? probably one of the German colonists ? has had the temerity to attempt a reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci 's " Last Supper . " Viewed seriously , it is , of course , a caricature . The drawing is grotesque , and the colouring , done purely from imagination , is startlingly crude and garish . Nevertheless , it satisfied the decorative cravings and the piety of its simple maker and owners , and it must be admitted that , when seen from a distance , it is not wholly ineffective as a piece of decoration . The stiff little bunches of flowers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful and convince one that it would have been far better if the decorator , for his main embellishment , had stuck to the birds or fruit or some such unpretentious subject , as most of the faces display . The faces are made of either wood or metal . Oftentimes the dials bear the name of the clock maker , so that the place of authorship is thus established , although , in some instances , the dial makers ' names appear to the exclusion of the clock makers ' names . It is not difficult to identify unsigned faces of native American origin , for the decoration is cruder than that found on imported dials painted in England or on the Continent . PAINTINGS ON GLASS . Another sort of painting that challenges attention by numerous examples is executed in reverse on the under side of glass , so that the picture shows through . These glass paintings are found chiefly in panels in the heads of mirrors and on the doors of clocks of both the Willard banjo and Eli Terry bracket types . The finest painted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make , but a great many of the American efforts in that direction possess considerable merit , while others are crude and sometimes // frankly ugly and clumsy . Notwithstanding their faults , however , they all have a genuine decorative value . The panels that are only painted are apt to be heavy and blotchy in colour , with a marked preference for strong greens , insistent reds , and staring whites . The drawing is generally poor and often childish , and the subjects are most frequently bits of local landscape , familiar to the painter , or merely isolated houses , trees , or fences that might be labelled " a house , " " a tree , " " a fence , " and so on , and serve admirably for illustrations of the old-fashioned spelling-books , to which , as well as to the examples of pictorial art seen on many of the samplers of the period , they bear a close resemblance . At times , also , we find various historico-patriotic subjects depicted , or perhaps a front view of Mount Vernon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other Revolutionary heroes , surrounded with laurel wreaths , flags , and other emblems of military glory . The mirror-head panels in which gold decoration occurs are , in the main , somewhat better in execution than those that are merely painted . In such panels the design was first laid in with black paint , the drawing , of course , being done in reverse . Gold size was then applied to all the surface intended to display a gold backing . Gold leaf was next applied . This adhered firmly to the sizing and made it possible to wipe off easily whatever portions were not intended to remain . The next step was to run in the background of white or grey . The effect of such panels is often exceedingly chaste and refined . The best were made in England and France and displayed high artistic merit , but a great many of real excellence were executed in America . It was the period at which classic feeling was nara256 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS mount in artistic expression , partly owing to the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent influence of the Empire style as set forth by David , Percier , Fontaine , and their contemporaries . It is not unusual to find mythological subjects executed with Flaxman-like spirit , simplicity , and delicacy . These gold bases and black-line pictures stood out in strong relief against the background of grey or white and were exceedingly effective . In some of these mirror-head panels the greater part of the ground was taken up by a cross-hatched diaper pattern in black or black with gold rosettes , while a medallion or cartouche in the centre was reserved for more elaborate embellishment . American makers eagerly copied the decorations of the imported mirrors and produced work of all grades of excellence , some of it rivalling the performances of the British or French glass painters and some of it sinking to the level of puerile crudity . In the absence of accurate historical knowledge of the authorship of an individual piece , it is often possible to establish its American origin by the subject illustrated , and occasionally reliable tradition and internal evidence unite to confirm the attribution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose frame is known to have come from Baltimore . The work on the frame is unquestionably American and is precisely similar to that on other frames known to have been made in Baltimore about the beginning of the nineteenth century . Added to this , the scene in the middle of the panel , pourtrayed in black lines with gold backing on a white ground , is , with the exception of a fanciful mountain across the water , exactly like what one might encounter in a thousand places along the shores of the ChesaDECORATIVE // peake . The style of boat , the low , bluff-like headland , and the little house of a Colonial type now fast disappearing , but still to be met with in out-of-the-way places , all contribute their share of cumulative evidence . On the doors of bracket or shelf clocks of the Eli Terry type the painting on the under side of the glass closely resembles in general character that of the panels in the heads of the numerous small mahogany-framed , upright mirrors of the early part of the nineteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper containing the clear glass in front of the dial , and the lower displaying the painting . The banjo clocks usually had two painted panels , a large one on the shank between the base and the face and another on the square or oblong base . These panels were decorated sometimes with paint only , sometimes with varicoloured paint and gold . The battle between the Constitution and the Guerriere and other equally stirring historical events supplied a favourite set of subjects for the adornment of these clocks and held their own in popularity with the imaginary landscapes . It is worth noting that these decorations painted to show through glass are being excellently reproduced in large numbers , and it is even more worth noting that the method is susceptible of extensive and successful adaptation for decorative purposes . The small paintings on the glass sides of the hexagonal hall lanthorns should not be forgotten . Paintings on glass of a distinctly pictorial nature ? portraits , still-life , landscapes , and the like ? enjoyed much vogue in England in the latter part of the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts at the same form of artistic expression on our own side of the Atlantic . Occasionally one meets with examples 17 // of this more ambitious style of glass painting , and now and then a small portrait turns up that seems to bear internal evidence of American origin . METAL , LEATHER AND SMALL WOODEN OBJECTS . Decorative painting of the same general description as that previously noted , running largely to fruits , flowers , birds , and stiff little bits of landscape , was constantly employed for the embellishment of trays , bellows , canisters , tin tea- and coffee-pots , and other small objects of household utility . Some of the most interesting and agreeable examples are to be found on the trays , both large and small , which played a conspicuous part in dining-room garniture . The usual ground colours were black , coral red , green , or straw colour , and the decoration was generally gold , black , or polychrome . Besides the trays , there were tea-caddies and small tin boxes designed for various odd purposes . All were regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather was chiefly to be seen on the water buckets belonging to the members of the old volunteer fire companies . Two or three of these // buckets , now highly prized as heirlooms , generally hung in a convenient and sometimes conspicuous place in the houses of the members , and , as almost every man of substance belonged to one or another organisation , they were familiar objects of household equipment . Curtains of glazed muslin were used as a subject for painted decoration , some of which was good , while other was but indifferent . It is interesting to note the present recurrence to landscape and other painted decoration for this same purpose . Bellows and sundry little boxes were the small wooden objects upon which the dignity of painted decoration was ordinarily bestowed . The study of these curious manifestations of early American decorative painting is leading to a growing and wholesome appreciation of the daily intimate environment of our forebears and to the modern emulation of what was really good in their handiwork . Under all this painted decoration we can detect a sturdy spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the old fireside art had so much vigorous decorative value that it is still fresh and potent to influence us . Primitive and even grotesque it may be at times , but it all appeals to us with new force and living interest when we realise in a connected way what it really expressed , and it also possesses the charm of stimulating inquiry into its varied sources of inspiration . Excellent examples of one sort or another are to be found in nearly every museum , and there is scarcely an antique shop that does not offer one or more specimens for purchase . The value of this old decorative painting as an inspiration to the modern crafts worker is too fully recognised to require any comment . CHAPTER X EARLY PORTRAITURE AND ALLEGORICAL PAINTING IN THE COLONIES UPON first thought , it may seem to be stretching a point to include portraiture and allegorical painting among the decorative arts , but a closer acquaintance with both , as commonly practised in the Colonies , will justify the classification . With the exception of the work produced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters are scarcely to be ranked in the realm of art , and if they are not considered in their decorative capacity they would have to pass unnoticed , which would be a pity , for they represent much honest creative effort , and by ignoring them we should be deprived of a source of considerable amusement . The modern schoolboy , the old Roman street gamin , and the early American painter all display one quality in common . The modern school lad , armed with a piece of chalk or crayon , defaces the sides of houses or fences with his crude but oftentimes vigorous pictorial fancy , for which inchoate expression of a deeply implanted human instinct he is chided by his law-abiding elders and roundly cursed by the owner of the disfigured walls . In precisely the same way did his youthful Roman prototype , two thousand years ago or more , give vent to his untutored artistic promptings in sgraffiti , to which we now attach importance for their historic value . In like manner did the early American painter , with no mean degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject he was minded to depict and proceed to put it on canvas as best he might with his limited technical equipment , producing results frequently full of vitality , however lacking in accuracy or elegance . The common quality alluded to , in which Colonial limner , Roman street urchin , and the schoolboy of to-day all alike share , is vigour of conception combined with crude expression . The modern cartoonist , comic illustrator , and designer of pictorial advertisements are fully alive to the striking effectiveness of this primitive crudity and exaggeration and its appeal to popular imagination , and have assiduously employed it for their several ends at the risk of overdoing its commercial and comic usefulness . As an episode of pictorial utterance , this aping of juvenile crudity is not devoid of interest . While we are amused , our attention is also focussed on what one might call aboriginal pictorial principles . We derive much the same sort of amusement from an examination of the early American essays in the fields of portraiture and allegorical or biblical painting , and , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . The gaucheries perpetrated attract us , of course , by their very naivete and quaintness , but the chief import attaching to a scrutiny of the first Colonial efforts lies in the ground it gives us for making comparisons between the results of primitive endeavour among European colonists in the direction of pictorial art and the products of recent achievement . At the same time , an inspection of the infancy of American painting and the contrast it presents with subsequent developments is essential to a thorough and appreciative understanding of our present art status . // There is no need to dwell upon Benjamin West ? at least the mature West whose labours won recognition and patronage on both sides of the Atlantic ? nor to survey the work of Copley , Gilbert Stuart , Charles Willson Peale , Rembrandt Peale , Sully , and sundry others whom one naturally associates with a period when American painting had reached a point where it was entitled to serious consideration on the score of inherent artistic merit . The names of these men are household words , and their pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneers who represent the incipient stages of painting in America when the course of pictorial art , like the course of true love , ran none too smoothly and there were all manner of obstacles to be overcome , a time of rugged , struggling , and not altogether promising infancy . Only a few of them can be mentioned here by name , but they will serve to indicate the general types that existed . Starting at the very beginning , there is the portrait of the pietist , Magister Johannes Kelpius , painted by Dr. Christopher Witt , in 1705 . This was the first portrait in oils executed in America , and is now preserved in the collection of the Pennsylvania Historical Society . It is painted on heavy linen and pasted , like a flyleaf , at the beginning of a manuscript volume of hymns and other mystical religious effusions composed by the artist . Both subject and painter were quaint characters of unusual interest , and what the portrait lacks in technical excellence or artistic charm is made up in the remarkable associations attaching to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange Rosicrucian community , composed of German mystics or pietists , which , in 1694 , founded its monastery on the wild banks of the // Wissahickon Creek , upon a tract of land within the present limits of Philadelphia . The arrival of these peculiar people on St. John 's Eve and their kindling of the Beltane Fire , with its mystic rites , made a suitable and spectacular introduction for the curious touch of transplanted mediaevalism grafted upon the life of the Colony so long as the brotherhood continued to flourish . The head of this extraordinary society , Johannes Kelpius , wasted by the practice of a too strict asceticism with its rigid fasts and long vigils in a damp cave , whither he was wont to withdraw for meditation and prayer , died in 1706 , at the age of thirty-three . Less than a year before the death of Kelpius , the portrait was painted by Dr. Witt , who had just joined the brotherhood upon his arrival from England . In many places the paint has flaked off from the linen back and the hues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now virtually a study in bluish greens and browns , but there is a vigour about the drawing that compels attention . Neither composition nor drawing is beyond criticism , the colour is muddy and depressing , and , even when fresh , could have had but little interest ; regarded as a work of art , the painting is clumsy and crude , but , nevertheless , there is such a quality of a rough-hewn boldness and honesty about it that one feels constrained to pay it more than merely passing heed . It is , to say the least , unpretty , but it is interesting and , if tradition may be trusted , is a tolerably faithful likeness of the emaciated mystic whom we see clothed in a long , monkish gown or cassock and seated in a contemplative attitude in an armchair beside a lecturn . There are doubtless other pictures by Dr. Christopher Witt ? chance may bring them to light at any time ? // for he was a most versatile and productive person . Besides practising as a physician and ministering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simples , paint pictures , as we have seen , make clocks ? possibly the first of native manufacture in America ? play upon the virginals and organ , the latter instrument being of his own construction , pursue the study both of the occult sciences and practical astronomy , and cast horoscopes for the children of the colonists . Another early painter who , as well as Christopher Witt , was also an organ builder was the Swede , Gustavus Hesselius , who arrived at Christiana , now Wilmington , Delaware , on May 1 , 1711 . A few weeks later he took up his residence in Philadelphia . In 1719 or early in 1720 he removed to Prince George County , Maryland , and received from the parish church of St. Barnabas " the first commission on record for a work of art for a public building in America , " the vestry engaging him in June ( 1720 ) to paint the church , " and in August following , to paint ye Altar piece and Communion Table , and write such sentences of Scripture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of this commission was satisfactory may be inferred from the fact that " on Tuesday , September 5 , 1721 , the Vestry agrees with Mr. Gustavus Hesselius to draw ye History of our Blessed Saviour and ye Twelve Apostles at ye last supper . . . proportional to ye space over the Altar piece , to find ye cloth and all other necessaries for ye same ( the frame and gold leafe excepted wch .

' " In writing of Hesselius , // Charles Henry Hart observes that it " surely marks an epoch to receive more than passing consideration , " " that more than seven years prior to the arrival in this country of John Smibert , who is commonly regarded as the father of painting in the Colonies , an elaborate altar-piece of the Last Supper , ' with thirteen figures ? Christ and the twelve disciples ? should have been commissioned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hesselius was a limner of no mean ability , as the paintings that may with certainty be attributed to him show , and he is not included among the pioneers of American pictorial painting to be pointed out as the producer of crude or grotesque canvases , but rather to show the difficult and precarious conditions by which the path of the early painter in Colonial America was beset and how he had to resort to divers expedients to hold soul and body together . By 1735 he was back again in Philadelphia , and in the columns of the Pennsylvania Gazette for December 11 , 1740 , appears the following advertisement : " Painting done in the best manner by Gustavus Hesselius from Stockholm and John Winter from London . Vig . Coat of Arms drawn on Coaches , Chaises , &c.,; or any kind of Ornaments , Landskips Sign Show-boards , Ship and House painting , Guilding of all sorts , Writing in Gold or Color , old Pictures cleaned and mended &c."; This advertisement simply meant that Hesselius had to come down to common sign painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what others had to do at a time when only a small portion of the public was sufficiently discriminating in taste to distinguish between art and paint by the square foot and only a limited number of patrons could afford to // employ an artist or to compensate him adequately . In England , too , it must be remembered , more than one great painter has been obliged to do signs for potboilers to tide over some struggling portion of his career . The only compensating feature of the situation , so far as artistic expression is concerned , was that coach and sign painting in the eighteenth century offered a far more varied and interesting opportunity to the painter than it has at any time since . Indeed , we are only beginning to appreciate the possibilities for doing fine work on the signs of hostelries and tea rooms , and it is only within the last few years that several eminent artists have executed such signs for places in which they felt some particular interest . Hesselius and his contemporaries did such painting not from sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit that : , they closed their eyes somewhat to the purely commercial aspect of the transaction and threw themselves into the spirit of the thing , producing many really fine pieces of work , as the weather-beaten remains of old sign-boards still occasionally testify . It may readily be imagined how wide a field of design was open to the versatile painter when not only hostelries and alehouses , but a great percentage of the shops also , displayed signs to attract notice and give individuality at a time when street numbers were not much in use and it was customary for a tradesman to designate his place of business , when advertising , as located at the sign of the Blue Boar over against St. Paul 's Church or the sign of the Three Loggerheads hard by the Pewter Platter . Besides the variety afforded by the execution of signs , there were coach doors to be blasoned herald-i // ically and armorial bearings to be painted on hatchments or in some other form to be dung up in the churches , and , if we may believe old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often imposing in edifices like Christ Church , Philadelphia , King 's Chapel , Boston , and several of the other important Colonial places of worship . While not despising these jobs , Hesselius also found other occupation for his brush , and seems to have travelled about from time to time to execute commissions , and doubtless there are many anonymous canvasses in the Middle Atlantic States that might be ascribed to him , were all the facts known . In the hallway of the Manor House at Croton-on-Hudson hang three full-length portraits that family records show to have been painted somewhere about 1715 . Certain features of internal evidence indicate that they were painted on the spot and not done at some distant place . The name of the artist , however , has long since been forgotten and can not now be discovered . The paintings were executed by a limner of some ability , and it is not impossible that Hesselius may have been their author in the period between his arrival in America and his removal to Maryland . While such men as Hesselius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ameriea , displayed far more capability in their profession than did our own native Americans prior to their crossing the Atlantic to study under competent masters , we must remember that not a few of the local forgotten and nameless painters whose crude and clumsy portrait efforts are to be found from New England to Georgia were practically self-taught and probably had as much // latent ability as their more fortunate and better tutored contemporaries who achieved eminence after a sojourn abroad . A comparison of their work with the early essays of our more celebrated Colonial artists of American birth tends to this conviction . Despite discouragement from Quaker parents and relatives , who regarded the " vanity of likenesses " with high disfavour , Benjamin West persevered in his ambitions ? all honour to him for so doing ! ? and finally succeeded in going to England to study , with what results we well know , but many of the performances of his youthful period are sadly lacking in the qualities one might expect to find in the juvenile attempts of one who afterwards rose to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little picture , painted in oils , on a piece of board , by West at an early age . In nearly every respect it is puerile . Of its authenticity there can be no doubt . Its pedigree , pasted on the back of the shingle , speaks for itself : " Painted b Benjamin West before he left America for England . Obtained by Horace W. Smith from Mrs. Pennypacker ( wt. 90 ) , in whose house , near Phoenixville , Pa. , this daub had remained from the time it was painted . West was intimate in this house . Given by H. W. Smith to Dr. John H. Brinton , 1872 . " The picture is evidently one of West 's very youthful performances and is correctly described as a " daub . " John Valentine Haidt was another painter who is almost unknown , but his crude portraits and curious allegorical pieces are fairly representative of the work produced by the generality of Colonial limners . He was born in Dantzig in 1700 . His father was court jeweller in Berlin , whither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's trade , he was EARLY Pol ( TRAITURE instructed in drawing at the Academy . Although compelled to work as a , jeweller , he longed to he a painter , and in 1714 went to study in Dresden , in 1716 in Prague and Augsburg , in 1718 in Venice and Dome , afterwards visiting Florence , Paris , and London , in which latter city he established himself in 1724 and married . He later joined the Moravians and came to Pennsylvania on the church transport vessel Irene , landing in New York in 1754 , whence lie went to Bethlehem . While there he painted in oils biblical scenes , allegorical pieces , and the portraits of prominent Moravians . A great number of his canvasses may be seen lining the walls of the archive room of the Moravian Church , where their crudity seems singularly in keeping with the quaint surroundings and piles of musty , yellow documents . Anywhere else they would be out of place and some of them almost ludicrous . Judging from their abundance , one might fancy that Haidt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these solemn old gentlemen and their placid visaged wives , with preternaturally narrow and high corsage and tight white caps . Notwithstanding their crudity and their overpoweringly brown and sombre tone , there are occasional refreshing dashes of rich and vigorous colour and a certainty suavity of brushwork that show that Haidt imbibed and retained some of the elements of his previous instruction . In the allegorical and heroic field we come to Edward Hicks , a cousin of the famous Elias Hicks , of Jericho , Long Island . Born in 1780 , in Bucks , Pennsylvania , in which county he passed most of his life , Hicks presents the incongruous spectacle of a Quaker painter . West surmounted the obstacles of his Quaker // birth and training , but Hicks remained a rigid Friend , deeply concerned in the affairs of meeting , till his dying day . He seems , nevertheless , to have been able to reconcile his occupation with the principles of his sect , whose stricter members were generally averse to the frivolity of art . Perhaps Hicks 's failure to achieve anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his case . He died in 1849 , and painted prolifically up to the time of his demise . Although his labours spread over the first half of the nineteenth century , their spirit of conception and execution belong rather to the immediately post-Colonial period , when the exodus or financial ruin of large numbers of erstwhile affluent Loyalists deprived artists of much patronage and encouragement that they would otherwise have had . Although Hicks painted prolifically , he painted but three or four subjects , which he reproduced again and again in unending succession , sometimes on boards to be used as fire-boards , sometimes in smaller size on canvas to be hung on the walls as adornments ? Heaven save the mark ! The most favoured subjects were " Washington Crossing the Delaware , " " The Signing of the Declaration of Independence , " and " The Peaceable Kingdom . " " The Peaceable Kingdom , " here reproduced in its fire-board form , is really a chef d'muvre of grotesquerie . The ruddy-faced infant in pantalets leading the lion with an insufferably bored expression , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king of beasts ; the truculent wolf looking daggers at the lamb and the spotty leopard ; William Penn and the red Indians in the distance , making a treaty and quite oblivious of the menagerie in the // opposite corner ? all these features are delightfully incongruous . Incongruous , also , is the picture of the " Signing of the Declaration of Independence , " in which one of the august signers usually has three legs , while one of his less fortunate compatriots can muster but one , and another sits evenly balanced in a chair two of whose legs rest in space beyond the edge of a platform . Frankly hideous , clumsy , and grotesque as are so many of the efforts of pictorial art done by the lesser painters of Colonial and post-Colonial times , there is at least a sincerity of purpose about them that commands our respect , and , though we may not desire to possess them or to study them , hoping to find any great intrinsic merit , an examination of their shortcomings , at any rate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own day . CHAPTER XI EARLY AMERICAN DECORATIVE WEAVING THE old fireside crafts of the loom have a glamour all their own . By the very simplicity and dignity of their homely products they compel a far more general and sympathetic appreciation than many a higher type of art utterance . They afford a sincere expression of folk-spirit and indicate an inherent love of beauty that effected a happy union , wherever it could , between art and common household objects of daily utility . Furthermore , a knowledge of the old fireside loom crafts , as they have been appropriately called , throws an interesting and valuable sidelight on the intimate domestic life of the people during the early formative period of Colonial existence , a period we are somewhat too prone to associate with only the sterner and more strenuous side of nation building . Among all those " homespun " crafts , none was of more universal practice than the decorative weaving of coverlets for the imposing bedsteads in which the eighteenth-century housewife took such vast pride . In the seventeenth , eighteenth , and early nineteenth centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture than nowadays , when our modern notions of sanatory propriety prompt us to have the equipment of our sleeping-places as simple as possible . In the days of the Stuarts and during the reigns of William and Mary and Queen Anne , the magnificence of the pillared and canopied bedstead and its trappings was indicative of the rank or affluence of the owner , 272 // while the truckle or trundle bed served for the children and domestics of the household . The elaborate embroidered or brocaded hangings of the state bedsteads and the costly coverlets belonging to them were the objects of great care and esteem , and were so highly prized that they were especially mentioned in inventories of household gear and bequeathed in wills . During the whole of the eighteenth century , the heyday of the four-poster , bedsteads were regarded with special pride by our foremothers , and their fitting equipment was a matter of much housewifely concern . In England the bedchamber not infrequently did duty as a reception room , while , in the Colonies , plenty of instances are on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , and coverlet , formed a part of the parlour furniture . Under the circumstances , the mistress of the house , quite naturally , wished her coverlets to present the best appearance they might , and lavished a degree of pains upon them of which the modern housekeeper never dreams . To the average woman in the Colonies , the rich silks and damasks , employed by her more affluent sisters in England , were out of the question , but , with her characteristic resourcefulness and self-sufficiency , she set to work with the materials she had at hand and wrought fabrics that compel our admiration , both for beauty of colour and grace of design . These hand-woven coverlets , which collectors and antique dealers eagerly search for to-day , were either entirely of home manufacture , the materials being spun , dyed , and woven by the women of the family , or else the threads , spun and dyed ready for weaving , were given to a professional weaver , who sometimes plied an itinerant trade , sometimes mainDECORATIVE // practised from north to south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used seem to have been the common property of the women from one end of the Colonies to the other . While certain well-known designs appear to have originated or to have enjoyed unusual popularity in certain localities , at the same time one is just as likely as not to find absolute identity of patterns in coverlets woven at the opposite ends of the land , and oftentimes the identity extends to colour as well as pattern . Doubtless patterns or " drafts , " as they were called , were passed on from one woman to another , and styles in coverlet designs travelled in much the same way as fashions in clothes . A knowledge of the decorative weaving employed in making coverlets was more or less general in European countries , and the wives and daughters of the American colonists preserved the traditions . Thus we may account for the general similarity in the character of the coverlets , no matter whether they were made by colonists of English , French , Swedish , Dutch , or German extraction . In minor details of colour and pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in major features a remarkable uniformity prevails . These coverlets were woven throughout the eighteenth century and continued to be made in considerable numbers till about the middle of the nineteenth . Since that time their manufacture has been practically restricted to the mountain regions of the South , where so many old customs and forms of speech have lingered unchanged . The continuous vitality of craft traditions among the southern mountaineers may be understood when we remember that it is no uncommon thing to find // Thanks to Eliza Calvert Hall 's entertaining book , * published several years ago , closer interest and wider attention have been directed to the old woven coverlet handicraft and the decorative and historic value attaching to the coloured spreads that once adorned the beds of nearly every house in bygone generations . The hand-woven coverlets consisted of a " foundation of cotton or linen overshot with wool . " In a vast number of cases the flax was spun , the linen woven , the yarn made and dyed , and the coverlet woven by one woman , carrying out each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials as the home farm supplied , for not a few of the eighteenthcentury housewives were as expert with the loom as they were with the spinning-wheel , and they were likewise adepts in the mysteries of the dye-pot and knew how to make strong and durable vegetable colours whose freshness time has been powerless to dim . A great many of the nineteenth century coverlets were woven by itinerant weavers who carried their looms with them from farmstead to farmstead and did the year 's stint of weaving , just as the itinerant cobbler paid his annual visit and made the year 's supply of shoes for all the household , from master and mistress down to swineherd and dairy-maid , but even till the time of the Civil War probably the majority of the women in the southern mountains and in remote districts of other parts of the country did their own weaving , and on many of the plantations in the South there was a room where an experienced slave spent most of the time weaving . Since so much of the coverlet weaving was done in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brown &; Company . // would be strange indeed if the products of the isolated domestic looms did not show evidence of the weaver's. originality in colour arrangement and combination of patterns , although the methods of work and the limitations of design formation necessarily produced a generic similarity between the chief features of the spreads . The very act of decorative creation has always appealed to woman 's imaginative faculty , from the time of Helen of Troy with her handmaidens , deftly plying the silken threads , or Queen Matilda and her tire-women , picturing on the Bayeux tapestry the story of the Norman Conquest , down to the day when the work-hardened hand of the Colonial farmer 's wife drove the shuttle to and fro as she wove the coverings to adorn her beds . The individual sense of colour or harmony of design prompted many a housewife to act upon her own initiative and depart from the plan or " draft " before her in the selection of her hues or the marshalling of her figures , thus , by the exercise of her inventive ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time to her neighbours and by them , in turn , transmitted to others , until , in time , they passed through the length and breadth of the land . The later coverlets , woven by professional weavers whose greater skill enabled them to deviate from the rigidity of geometrical devices and conventional repeats , display patterns of great intricacy and elaboration , including human figures , birds , and beasts , as well as flowers , fruits , and foliage in profusion . It was customary to name the simpler geometrical designs such as were used from the earliest times by the housewives who did their own weaving or the more conservative itinerant weavers of the old school . SomeDECORATIVE // times one design was known by two or three , or even more , different names in different parts of the country , and , vice versa , the same name was occasionally applied to different designs in different localities . Now and again these names were descriptive of the character of the designs , but more frequently they were purely fanciful and dipped into the realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hear of " Sunrise , " " Checkers , " " Stripes and Squares , " " Maid of Orleans , " " Rose in the Valley , " " Washington 's Victory , " " Missouri Trouble , " " New Jersey Dream , " and scores of others . It is worth noting , while speaking of these old patterns and their endless variety of colour combination and design , that the weaves and , in many instances , the colour schemes have been adapted by some modern craftsworkers to the manufacture of both silk and mercerised cotton textures . The " drafts " or patterns which served as guides for both the housewife at her home-made loom and the itinerant weaver were sometimes fully worked out , so that a modern textile worker could follow them with comparative ease after a little study , and , on the other hand , sometimes they were merely indicated by cryptic signs and figures , somewhat resembling ancient musical notation , on narrow strips of paper or parchment , that to the uninitiated are as baffling and unintelligible as Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colours as well as the pattern were indicated , but the chromatic choice was usually left to the discretion and taste of the individual weaver . The " draft " book shown in the illustration is in the Frishmuth Collection in the Pennsylvania Museum of Industrial Art , Philadelphia , and from the // internal evidence supplied by the paper used , the binding , the ink , and the handwriting of the compiler or owner , it seems to date from the latter part of the eighteenth century . It is not unlikely that John Landes , whose name appears in the front of the book , was an itinerant Pennsylvania weaver , and it is quite possible that he took the pains to collect a large number of acceptable patterns and transcribe them in this convenient form to carry about with him and show to his patrons , who could pick out " drafts " to their taste . The colours most commonly used in these coverlets were blue , red , and white , but we also find a good deal of green , pink , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make their appearance . The dyes employed , as previously stated , were of home manufacture and were derived from vegetable substances , so that the colours are still fresh and vivid . The renewal of interest in vegetable dyes of native manufacture , now being successfully employed by numerous craftworkers , owes not a little to the inspiration supplied by the chromatic beauty of the old coverlets . The Colonial American woman showed herself quite as resourceful in the skillful preparation of a wide range of fast dyes as she did in other particulars , and knew how to make cochineal , madder , Brazil wood , turmeric wood , indigo , peach-leaves , barks , roots , gums , and blossoms yield all their varied hues . When there was one of them she could not obtain , she always had a satisfactory substitute . The collecting and study of the old hand-woven coverlets is well worth while , both because of their intrinsic beauty of colour and pattern and because of the light they throw on an important domestic craft of // bygone days which never quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft susceptible of numerous applications to our present-day requirements . HOME-SPUN LINENS . Vast quantities of the linen thread , spun on the wheels that whirled busily in every well-ordered household , were woven into sheets , tablecloths and bolts that could be cut as needed for clothing requirements . The quality of this linen varied according to the notions of the individual maker , but even the coarsest was a fabric of admirable character . The weaving was , in many cases , done at home either by members of the household or by itinerant weavers who went from farmstead to farmstead at stated times , set up their looms and stopped in the house until they had finished all there was for them to do . When the weaving was not done at home , the spun thread was sent out to be woven . Most of the linen was perfectly plain , but decorative effects in weave and colour were not wanting . In some instances a chequered pattern of blue and white was woven , the threads being dyed prior to the weaving operation ( v. plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a blue and white chequer pattern , but there is no reason that other colours could not have been used as , in all probability , they were . A woven pattern was also occasionally essayed with good results ( v. plate illustration ) in linen intended for table use . WOOLLENS Woollens of excellent quality were also produced by the Colonial weavers for blankets ( v. plate illustration ) and dress goods . // RUGS AND CARPETS Under the head of Colonial decorative weaving we shall include rugs and carpets for want of a better place to consider them , although they were not , strictly speaking , wholly woven products . So soon as the first strenuous phases of home-making were past and there was the least opportunity to think of something more than the barest necessities , the early American colonists shewed a measure of attention to the matter of floor covering in both its utilitarian and decorative aspects . Bare boards were much in evidence for a great many years , but in some of the rooms at least there were attempts to mitigate the bareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom of sanding floors remained in favour and late into the eighteenth century we find records of sanded floors upon which decorative designs were carefully traced in the freshly strewn and brushed sand , but such decorations were necessarily short-lived and the process of strewing , brushing and tracing patterns had to be repeated at frequent intervals . At best , the drawings on sand could give but ephemeral satisfaction to the eye and nothing at all of physical comfort , so that we can readily understand the craving for something more permanent and comfortable in the form of rugs and carpets . Such rugs and carpets made their appearance at a very early date , although woven or hand-worked rugs large enough to cover the greater part of a floor , and fulfil the modern notion of a carpet in their extent , did not appear until much later and even then were of comparatively rare occurrence . For the most part a great portion of the floor boarding remained visible and the // rugs , though they might be fairly numerous , were generally of limited dimensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DYES Reference has already been made to the skill of the Colonial housewife in making the dyes she needed and attention has been called to their variety , their beauty and freshness and the permanent qualities they exhibit , even after years of exposure and wear .

MORDANTS were , of course , necessary to fix the colours and for this purpose alum was , perhaps , the most universally useful .

CHAPTER XII THE ART OF " FRACTUR " OR PEN-AND-BRUSH ILLUMINATION HEREDITY and tradition are two of the most potent forces to be reckoned in the shaping of human tendencies and actions . Deny the one and decry the other as we may , their influence , nevertheless , is very real and shows its power in every phase of creative activity . By no means the least conspicuous workings of heredity and tradition are observable in matters of art . No more apt illustration of the vitality and long persistence of hereditary art traditions could be found than the endurance of a medieval illuminating process found among the Pennsylvania German colonists and perpetuated by their descendants , till quite the middle of the nineteenth century . This illuminating process was called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a consideration of slip-decorated pottery , attention was called to the origin of these same people , their dominant characteristics , and their peculiar isolation from the other colonists by whom they were surrounded , an isolation that has continued , in large measure , to the present day and made possible the vigorous survival of many customs and traditions which otherwise must inevitably have vanished long since . However little we Americans of English descent and tradition may know of the Pennsylvania Germans , and however slightly we may understand the ways and ideals of this " people apart " who , nevertheless , have been our neighbours for centuries , we can not fail to be strongly impressed by the various manifestations of 286 // their art that come to our notice from time to time . Crude , very crude , it unquestionably is , but , all the same , there is a certain virility inherent in it and a fresh fertility of decorative sense that , despite all rudeness of form and execution , convince us that here is the genuine expression of a folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers migrated to Penn 's land of promise . This particular instance of the perpetuation of old German craft traditions that forms the subject of the present chapter , cherished for many years with an almost religious veneration among the descendants of the early settlers from the Rhine countries , shows that the history of these folk is deserving of close study , and we can not but feel regret at its discontinuance and the discontinuance of the various other crafts about the middle of the nineteenth century , when there began a process of assimilation to the ways of the outside world , a process now well on its way to completion , with the result that the manifestation of picturesque originality has been replaced by an all too evident and commercial vulgarity . Now and again , in examining the decorative craftsmanship of the old Pennsylvania German colonists , we detect the recurrence of motifs and methods of expression that unmistakably evidence a close relationship with the peasant art of Bavaria and some of the neighbouring provinces . The art of " fractur , " or pen-and-brush illumination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania and , in a modified form , adopted to a slight degree by some of the neighbouring English colonists , affords an intensely interesting revelation of folk-art about which next to nothing was known , out288 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS side of a limited local sphere , until comparatively recent years . This manner of painting is of deep interest , because it embodied the survival on American soil of a mediaeval art tradition that had virtually disappeared in Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century , in other words , the art of illumination practised by the monks of the Middle Ages ; because some knowledge of it explains many curious things that turn up from time to time in junk-shops and the purlieus haunted by collectors ; because the quaint naivete in the colour and design of the specimens most frequently met with is fascinating ; because , finally , it reveals the vigorous but wholly untutored decorative sense of a primitive people . It may seem a far cry from the mediaeval monastery to the woods of Colonial Pennsylvania , from the cell of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missal or breviary , to the little schoolhouse or the cloister of the Pietist , where mystic and country schoolmaster alike adorned the pages of psalmbooks or painted gorgeously coloured and fancifully designed birth and baptismal certificates , but the line of descent is clear and unbroken to prove that " fractur " was a survival of the ancient art of illumination , and the tradition can not be denied . Besides being replete with the marks of a derivation from Continental sources , the pen-and-brush illuminations are engaging and varied in scope and application , as may be readily seen from the collections of such zealous collectors and antiquaries as the Honourable Samuel W. Pennypacker , sometime Governour of Pennsylvania , or Henry Chapman Mercer , Esq. , of Font Hill , Doylestown , Bucks , whose valuable monograph , entitled " The Survival of the Mediaeval Art of IlluminaTHE // five Writing Among Pennsylvania Germans , " read before the American Philosophical Society in September , 1897 , contains a graphic account of the practice of the art and a classification of the several ways in which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rescue the remaining vestiges of this folk-art from oblivion or utter destruction . MATERIALS . A number of years ago , among a " penny-lot " of miscellaneous trash that had come from a country sale , part of the contents of a garret in Bedminster , Bucks , Mr. Mercer discovered a roughly made , lidless paint-box , about a foot long and six inches broad , with several compartments containing glass bottles . For a long time the " find " baffled all attempts at identification , but it finally turned out to be the colour-box of a teacher in one of the German schools that had been maintained in Bucks till about 1840 . The longest compartment was used to contain " goose-quill pens and brushes made of the hairs of the domestic cat . The caked colours in the small bottles had been the home-mixed inks and paints of the schoolmaster , once liquefied in whiskey , and the varnish was composed of the gum of the cherry tree diluted in water . " With this outfit the German schoolmasters were wont to instruct their pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwriting on paper or parchment . PURPOSE AND SORTS During the latter part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth this art flourished vigorously in the counties inhabited by the Pennsylvania Germans , and illuminated hymns and ornate title pages of religious books were produced in great numbers . Although " fractur " painting may be said to 1Q // have been of two sorts , the religious and the secular or semi-religious , for even the pieces that were not of an ostensibly religious character rarely escaped altogether from some trace of religious symbolic allusion , the art was undoubtedly derived from religious sources , was first practised in America with exclusively religious intent , and seems not to have been used " for the decoration of secular themes , such as songs , ballads , or rimes . " Whatever instances of its entire secularisation do occur are comparatively rare . " Fractur " found expression in illuminated song-books , such as those made in the religious community at Ephrata ; in the title pages of small , plain manuscript song-books , often with the owner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tulips or lotus , or birds and trumpet-blowing angels " ; in rewards of merit on loose leaflets ; in book-marks ; in baptismal certificates , marriage and death registers in family Bibles or on separate sheets of heavy paper , and , finally , in the less common essays at pictorial adornment to be framed and hung upon otherwise bare walls . The noticeable difference in the character and quality of these illuminations is to be explained by their difference of origin . Those that came from the religious community at Ephrata , for instance , , are characterised by a certain refinement of design and dexterity of touch ? they were evidently the objects of loving care and pride , and time was freely spent upon them ? while some of those that emanated from the desks of country schoolmasters or were produced by their pupils were gauche and grotesque in form and colour to the last degree . In between the two extremes came all shades of excellence . Both sorts are shown in the accompanying illustrations . // RELIGIOUS " FRACTUR ' 1 WORK. - THE EPHRATA PAINTINGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of psalm-tunes made by members of , or belonging to , the community in the cloister at Ephrata , in Lancaster County . They occur on title-pages , as single-page embellishments , interspersed here and there throughout the volume , and , above all , as decorations to fill the spaces between the ends of tunes and the margin . Double bars in the music were adorned with smaller illuminations of the same general character , and occasionally the tops and bottoms of the pages came in for a share of coloured enrichment . As stated before , coloured inks were used and were applied with quill pens and fine cat-hair brushes . The colours were vivid and often employed in great variety . Then , again , in some specimens , only two or three colours were used , and not a few of these simple schemed pieces are among the most artistic and effective to be found . In all the Ephrata illuminations we see the same marvellously minute pen-work that reminds one of the fine lines in old Persian miniatures . As an example of simple colouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed entirely in green and blue of a subdued tone , so combined , however , that there is no lack of variety and interest . The big heart with the doves from " Andenken am Schwester Martha " is effectively executed in black , vivid green , and carmine , while the lotus-like tulip , from the same volume , is done in black , green , brown , and red . This book also contains numerous examples of the diversity of intricate pen-work often employed . There are , for instance , many stippled or etched backgrounds edged with a fine line of bright green or red , while the bold lettering in German text is cross-hatched or left in white . // The illumination from the manuscript music-book is a full-page illustration in olive , mauve , and green , skillfully combined to give great variety of colour effect . An illumination from the Ephrata Choral Book is exceedingly interesting , because of the simplicity of colouring and delicacy of drawing . The alternate petals of the pinks are of deep blue , while the lighter petals between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white ground of the paper . The doves are of a lighter blue , as are also some of the upper leaves . The black ink has become a mellow brown from age . Another small design is taken from a leather-bound blank receipt book which was turned into a hymn-book with characteristic thrift . There is no title-page , but a note on the flyleaf states that the owner , probably a member of the Ephrata community , bought it in 1817 , and another note at the end states that it was finished in 1820 . During this space of three years the one hundred and ninety-nine pages of closely written notation were transcribed and embellished with a large number of illuminations . The mere manual labour involved must have kept the scribe and illuminator busy a great portion of the time . The design is wrought chiefly in blue , red , and black . The alternate petals of the flowers are made of fine dots of blue and bright red , which , with plenty of white background showing , give the effect of pink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapered in red , black and white . Olive brown , a deeper brown , dark green , black , and bright green are observable in the leaves . The chequer border at the bottom is made of green , black , red , and white ingeniously combined . // THE SCHOOLMASTERS ' PAINTINGS . Of quite different stamp and far inferior merit is the Taut schein , or baptismal certificate . In design it is involved and gauche , the execution is grotesque , and the plenitude of clamorous reds and yellows is blatantly rampant . The lady angels at the top , loudly clad in alternate red and yellow stripes , are truly fearsome creatures . The central portion is filled with text giving the date of the baptism and also the date of the child 's birth , most accurately recording the exact hour and minute . This punctilious solicitude about the hour and minute of birth is found in all these old records , and the entries were thus made for reference for astrological purposes ; in other words , so that the local astrologer might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic ? witch doctoring it is called-and the casting of horoscopes are still practised in rural Pennsylvania German communities . The baptismal certificate , just discussed , represents the opposite extreme of fractur expression to that executed by the religious at Ephrata . It is evidently the indifferent work of a country schoolmaster or one of his pupils . In between this extreme and the delicate , finished illuminations from the Ephrata cloister were paintings of all grades of excellence wrought by clever pupils and their instructors . There is little doubt that some of the potters who decorated the slip-traced and sgraffito plates and platters produced in the field potteries also tried their hand at illuminating baptismal and birth certificates , marriage records and death memorials , book-marks , testimonials , and pictorial devices for wall embellishment with fractur painting . It is also highly probable that these same potters received // their first training in draughtsmanship and the principles of design , which they afterwards applied to the decoration of pottery , through their lessons in fractur painting as children or youths at the hands of village schoolmasters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing touches in the curriculum . After the middle of the nineteenth century , when illumination or fractur was no longer taught in the German country schools and the art was rapidly dying out , substitutes for the hand-painted certificates were printed in coloured inks , and were so dreadful that the kindest thing is to let them pass without further notice . Although the semi-secular application of fractur painting was reminiscent of religious inspiration , and the baptismal and birth certificates had their distinctly religious significance , they also served a purely secular purpose by being used as wall adornments . SECULAR " FRACTUR " WORK . Other fractur paintings there were , too , although few in number by comparison , that were devised altogether for ornament and had no religious inspiration whatever . Both sorts supplied a need in the homes of their possessors , who had practically nothing else in the shape of pictorial garniture . Human nature is the same the world over , and has not changed from the earliest times in its deeply implanted love of ornament . We see this innate fondness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fractur paintings of the German colonists . The resources for wall adornment in Colonial days were not abundant , and in the houses of the majority they were decidedly scant . The English colonists , besides samplers and little pieces of simple framed embroidery , had a few paintings on glass and // such edifying and gruesomely moral prints as " Death and the Lady . " The German settlers , with a child-like devotion to bright colours , rebelled against the unbroken austerity of whitewashed walls , and had their fractur paintings , which were certainly more worth while than the ghastly chromos and appalling crayons that have now taken their place in the houses of simple farmer folk . Of the secular pieces of fractur work , one of the most amusing is the apocalyptic fantasy , which exhibits in the lower part a behemoth with a murderous mouth , a blandly idiotic simper , and a pointed tail . His forelegs are black and his hind legs are red , and his claws are fearsomely sharp . His body is of a whitish yellow mottled with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is evidently a long-suffering and patient creature , or else quite pachydermatous , for he seems not in the least to mind acting as a stage for the antics of the two slim and jaunty green-bodied , redlegged beasts , although the needle-like claws of one are jabbing his nose , which might supposedly be tender . Just what may be the full significance of these strange animals with pallid faces and rouge-spotted cheeks , furred or crocketed tails waving gracefully aloft , and towering crowns set on their heads at a rakish angle , it would be hard to say . It would be equally difficult to determine the meaning of the heart-bearing vine growing from the behemoth 's back , of the red and black rhapsodic birds fluttering above the beasts , or of the vixenish little parrot trying to pluck the tail feathers from one of the aforesaid birds . Surely there is no passage in the Apocalypse by which this pictorial caprice could have been inspired . It has been suggested // that the theme might have been derived from one of the " Lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the artist even knew of the Vitae Sanctorum . It might , perhaps , be explained by some old legend preserved in the heritage of folk-lore . Quite as vigorous and quite as ungraceful is the picture , about sixteen inches by twenty in size , of two women . This " masterpiece " is executed entirely in ink and is altogether devoid of bright colour , even in the nondescript tree at the left , with its top divided like the antenna of a beetle and its fruits and flowers alternating with extreme regularity . Judging from the peering , inquisitive expression of the younger woman and the didactic attitude of the elder , a lesson in botany seems to be going forward , based upon the portions of a plant which each holds in her hands . The lower portion of the picture has nothing to do with the upper . " FRACTUR " WORK BY ENGLISH COLONISTS . The birth certificates of the three Shinn children and of Caleb Lippincott are particularly interesting as showing the development of fractur painting when it got into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it depicts one of the local sports , and the fox-hunters apparently wear the coats and caps of the old Gloucester Fox Hunting Club , which started a few years before the date of the certificate and afterward became the nucleus of Philadelphia 's First City Troop . Foil THE COLLECTOR . Now and again these paintings may be picked up in the most unexpected places , and are always worth examining as specimens of an amusing and instructive art episode and for the light they occasionally throw upon Colonial history or the manners of the colonists . In his monograph Mr. Mercer // observes that previously the existence of these illuminations had been " little more than casually alluded to by any writer . " With the exception of Mr. Mercer 's account , the same is still true , and comparatively few people have seen or know anything about them , although , in the counties where they were once made , it is by no means unusual to happen upon them in second-hand shops and at the country sales of household effects . Sometimes these specimens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often they are either semisecular ( birth and marriage certificates and the like ) or else the secular wall embellishments . They are especially numerous in the Mennonite and Dunkard communities along the Perkiomen and the Skippack Creeks and in Berks and Bucks . Besides the fractur paintings in the collections previously mentioned , there are some excellent specimens in the Frishmuth Collection in the Pennsylvania Museum ( Memorial Hall ) and School of Industrial Art , Philadelphia , and also in the collection of William Springer , of Kulpsville , Montgomery County . The old art of fractur painting contains the seed of suggestion for a modern development utilising the same processes and methods . No one , of course , would wish to emulate the grotesque and childish performances of many of the specimens , but a study of the Ephrata work reveals many points of substantial merit and a general character quite different , in conception and technique , from that of the small amount of ecclesiastical illumination now being performed . A resumption of this delicate pen-and-brush work with coloured inks might be suitably carried out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certain types of illustration . CHAPTER XIII HAND-BLOCK PRINTING ON FABRICS AND PAPER HE likewise cuts neatly in Wood and Printeth Calicoes . " So ran the end of an advertisement that appeared in a Boston paper , in 1715 , setting forth the occupations of one Francis Dewing , lately come into the Colonies from London . Of this same Francis Dewing we shall hear more in a later chapter . What concerns us here and now is the end of his advertisement , stating that he " printeth calicoes , " a statement plainly indicating that the craft of printing designs upon fabrics with hand-blocks made of pearwood , or of some other wood , such as box , holly , or maple , was certainly practised at this date to a sufficient extent to make commercial mention of it worth while . Had not the good housewives of Boston Town been familiar with hand-block printing , Dewing 's announcement that " he cuts neatly in Wood and Printeth Calicoes " would have been without point . It is not at all impossible , in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally have cut blocks and sold them for the women to do their own printing from . A competent housekeeper would have sufficient knowledge of making the dyes it would be necessary to use . Whether hand-block printing was done upon fabrics or wall-paper , substantially the same method was employed . Printing on fabrics was a household craft and might be successfully pursued , as occasion demanded , by any woman who owned or could borrow the blocks . 29S // No doubt blocks were lent from one neighbour to another throughout whole communities , just as were the moulds for pewter spoons and platters . Hand-block printing on paper for walls was necessarily somewhat restricted in extent and specialised in the hands of a few craftsmen . In the majority of cases , when wall-paper was used , it was of imported origin , and the attempts at home manufacture in the hands of a country craftsman were primitive in the extreme , both as regards colour and pattern . Attempts at hand-block printing in colours on paper for wall decoration were not made in America until very late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as the demand was so limited , owing to the presence of good imported papers and the fact that not nearly so much of it would be required as of printed fabrics , the hand-block printing of wall-paper in the Colonial and post-Colonial periods is practically a negligible ' natter , so far as any great results were concerned . Nevertheless , the specimens that have come down to us are amusing and show a decided spirit of independence and enterprise on the part of American craftsmen which ought to afford encouragement to the present craftsworker , endowed with infinitely superior facilities . FABRICS MATERIALS USED . As we have seen from Delving 's advertisement , calico was a favourite material for block printing . Besides this , linen , muslin , and any kind of cotton cloth could be used . Most of the fragments that have been preserved are either of linen or calico . The colours were made from vegetable dyes , blues and reds being the usual favourites . // The blocks were generally about an inch thick and of any size and shape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-grained wood had to be used so that the design could be cleanly cut : pear , maple , box , holly , bass , or gum was suitable for this purpose . The design was carved in bold relief with a smooth surface ( Fig. 1 ) , or else reversed so that the design was incised . The effect of the first was to print the design in colour on the fabric ; the effect of the second was to colour the background and reserve the design in white or whatever was the natural colour of the fabric before the dye was applied . Specimens of both are shown in the plate illustrations . PROCESSES . The design was first drawn upon the // uncut surface of the block or traced upon paper and pasted on . With a sharp knife it was then cut out and the background gouged out to a depth sufficient to insure a clear impression . Some of the blocks were large ( Fig. 1 ) , while others were very small ( Fig. 2 ) and often of irregular shape ( Fig. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , geometrical patterns , and flower-andleaf designs were ordinarily employed . If more than one colour was used , there had to be an additional plate for each colour . As a matter of fact , in the home-done block printing more than one colour was very rarely used . Besides the block , there was a pad on which the block was charged before making the impression , and this pad was saturated with the dye , which had been mixed to about the consistency of cream and spread on the pad // with a brush . A little mucilage or glue was sometimes added to keep the colour from spreading , and a mordant was occasionally needed to set or fix the colour . The material to be printed was laid flat and fastened down , and then the impressions were made , moving the block along as the impressions covered the fabric . PAPER The processes in use for printing coloured paper were , as previously noted , substantially the same as those employed for fabrics . The main difference was that the paper was , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours and therefore , required more blocks in the process . It was printed in very small sections , no larger than could be conveniently covered by one block , or by several adjacent impressions from one block , and these small and gaily coloured pieces were used for borders . Festoons of drapery and floral patterns were executed with more concern for trenchant hues than for refinement . The illustrations will give a fair notion of the wall-paper block printer 's efforts . Printing paper in several colours in this way with small blocks necessarily consumed much time , to say nothing of the time required to put small pieces on the wall . It is not surprising , therefore , that it was used chiefly for borders only . The introduction of rollers or cylinders , with the repeat adjusted to one revolution , of course wrought a complete change in methods . It is worth noting that the old wall-paper , both of domestic and imported origin , was habitually used to cover hat-boxes , cap-boxes , band-boxes , and numerous small boxes , which were extremely decorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EARLY AMERICAN WOOD AND STONE CARVING CARVING is the outward manifestation of a natural impulse . It is an impulse partly destructive , partly creative , and partly decorative . The boy with a new jack-knife affords an epitomised evidence of the result of innate promptings , too strong to be resisted , to whittle and shape if the means and material be at hand . Wood first , and then stone , have always invited the craftsman to prove his prowess in the decorative manipulation of their surfaces . Examples of the early American carver 's handiwork in both wood and stone are more numerous and varied than most of us , at first thought , realise . For specimens of wood carving , some of it of considerable excellence , we must look to the furniture made by the colonists from the seventeenth century onward ; to various small articles of household utility that were deemed worthy of ornamentation ; to the figureheads of American-built ships and , lastly , to such portions of architectural woodwork as required or permitted carved embellishment . Specimens of the last-named sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For examples of early American stone carving we must turn to date-stones , inscriptions , and simple mural devices on old houses ; window and door trims and capitals of pillars ; old milestones with heraldic devices , and last of all , tombstones and monuments . 303 // The interest attaching to these evidences of the Colonial craftsman 's handiwork in wood and stone is necessarily , to a great degree , historical and antiquarian , in the first place , because in no other field of decorative activity do we find more convincing testimony to the continuity and perpetuation of Old-World craft traditions on this side of the Atlantic , and , in the second place , because they show the extent of Colonial achievement and stimulate our appreciation of a native craftsmanship whose best accomplishments we are too ready to attribute to an overseas origin , without taking the pains to inform ourselves of the real facts concerning them . Despite the comparatively limited scope of any modern application that can be made of these Colonial precedents and patterns , there are , nevertheless , not a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall do well to study and ponder , both in the matter of technique of execution and in the uses to which carved embellishment was put . They also show , in most cases , notwithstanding certain minor crudities that occasionally appear , the strong innate sense of refined proportion so eminently characteristic of much of the work done in the seventeenth and eightenth centuries , particularly the latter . Furthermore , they materially increase our esteem for the average ability of the Colonial artisan , and no account of the early arts and crafts would be complete if it did not include some notice of the labours of both wood and stone carvers . WOOD CARVING PROCESSES . Before specifically directing attention to the several fields in which carved ornamentation was customarily employed , it is desirable to explain the // varieties of carving methods and their points of difference . " MODELLED " carving exhibits the design standing out in well-moulded relief from a surrounding background that has been lowered by gouge and chisel ( Fig. 1 , A and B ; Fig. 2 , A and B ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a further development of it ? is " CARVING IN THE ROUND " ; that is to say , carving in which the figures , cleanly undercut , stand well forth from their ground ( Fig. 3 ) or else stand altogether clear of it , being supported by some suitable projection from the rear , from below or from above . Excellent examples of CARVING IN THE ROUND are ships ' figureheads and carved finials or pendants of any description . " FLAT " carving shows a design whose surface is flush with the uncarved surface of the piece of wood ( Fig. 4 ) on which it is wrought . The relief is secured by a " sunk " or sharply gouged-out groundwork , and the edges of the figures composing the design are not rounded off or modified in any way , but are left sharp and rectangular . 20 // " SCRATCH " carving is just the reverse of the forms of carving more commonly practised , in that the design , usually of simple character , is vigorously and sharply incised ( Fig. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poplar , oak , mahogany , and walnut were the woods most used by the American craftsmen for carving purposes . White pine was the wood used almost exclusively for purposes of architectural carving , and it was usually protected afterwards by a coat of paint . In a few instances poplar was used for the same purpose . Oak was used by the seventeenth-century carvers for both furniture and architectural embellishment . Examples of both are shown . Walnut was used in the eighteenth century almost exclusively for furniture , but occasional instances of its // architectural use may be found . It was also used for small objects of household utility ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) . Mahogany was used solely for furniture ; with rare exceptions for other purposes . Other woods than the four mentioned were sometimes met with , but not sufficiently often to merit special notice . FURNITURE . So far as carved furniture is concerned , the best seventeenth-century examples are to be found in the oaken pieces of New England origin , which are , to all intents , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the English work , there is , as a rule , greater nicety of finish . In the Bolles Collection , in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York City ; in the Boston Museum , and also in several smaller and private collections may be seen excellent specimens of this seventeenth-century American carving in oak . It should be added that the Bolles Collection is especially comprehensive in this respect and affords typical examples of modelled , flat , and scratch carving . // The execution of some of the carving is so exactly similar to that of English pieces , both in point of technique and pattern , that its American authorship can be determined only by the fact that it is wrought on American oak . It is but natural that semi-mediaeval ( Fig. 4 ) and Renaissance traditions of wood carving should be thus faithfully perpetuated on American soil , for the craftsmen who did the work were English to the core , no matter on which side of the Atlantic they happen to have been born . Indeed , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other crafts practised in the Colonies , the obvious continuity of traditional methods and processes forcibly brings home the realisation that , after all , we , through our American English forefathers ? Washington and Adams , though the staunchest Americans , considered themselves also Englishmen to their dying day ? have quite as ample and honourable a traditional background as our contemporary British English cousins , even though we may sometimes have been oblivious of it and withheld our appreciation . The designs employed were , to all intents , identically the same on both sides of the Atlantic , although certain local preferences for one pattern or another are observable in the New England work , just as they were // in different parts of England , and occasionally we meet with a design that has no exact counterpart in English work , albeit the manner of execution does not differ from the customary processes . A notable instance of such a local peculiarity of design ( Fig. 4 ) is found on the " Hadley chests . " These chests are so called because a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town of Hadley , in Massachusetts . The device used for the decoration consists of a crudely drawn leaf and flower , carried out in the requisite number of repeats , wrought in flat carving , while numerous small scrolls or tendrils , the veining of leaves , and the divisions of petals appear in scratch carving ( Fig. 4 ) . This seventeenth-century method of carving , characteristic of the Stuart period in mobiliary parlance , continued to be practised during the fore part of the eighteenth century . The other early American manifestation of carving on furniture is to be found on the walnut , cherry , bilsted , and mahogany articles in the Chippendale , Hepplewhite , Sheraton , Phyfe , and Empire styles , the best of which were made in New England , Philadelphia , and New York , where the most expert chair and cabinet makers and carvers seem to have been established . In these cases the carving is chiefly of the modelled or moulded variety , sometimes in the round , and rivals in excellence the work done by the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate the subject of furniture in detail are referred to " The Practical Book of Period Furniture , " by the present authors , and issued by the same house as this volume . SMALL ARTICLES OF DOMESTIC UTILITY . Small wooden objects of household use were now and again dignified // with carved adornment . Such articles are more likely to be met with among the domestic effects of the Dutch and German colonists than among the goods of colonists of English or Welsh extraction . Good examples of these ornate minor domestic accessories are to be found among such articles as the carved hanging spoon racks or lepel-borties of the Dutch housewives , the brush-and-comb holders that hung beside the pumps in the wash-sheds or out-kitchens of farmhouses among the Germans in Pennsylvania , the razor boxes and shaving boxes , and the kitchen implements of both Dutch and Germans , such as butter moulds , tankards for cider , and the handles of pie markers . An excellent specimen of this German peasant domestic wood carving appears on the handle of the pie marker ( Fig. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania Museum of Industrial Art , Fairmount Park , Philadelphia . The design is characteristically German , and the carving is carefully executed and probably represents the winter evening industry of a farmer with a jack-knife , sitting in the light of a roaring wood kitchen fire . SHIPWRIGHTS ' CARVING . It was a matter of no small pride among seafaring men and merchants in Colonial times and in the early days of our national existence ? in fact , until the advent of steam put an end to the picturesque side of maritime life ? to have their ships , barques , and smaller sailing craft adorned with elaborately carved , painted , and gilt figureheads . The figurehead gave a stamp of individuality and , as a thing almost alive , seemed to personify the character of the hull and rigging behind and above it . Both pains and expense were lavished upon the carving of these pieces , // and they were boldly wrought in the round with a refreshing degree of lively spirit . Their design and execution alike do credit to their nameless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we owe a debt of gratitude whenever , in old seaport towns of our Atlantic coast or in the neighbourhood of ancient shipyards , we come upon one of these relics of a bygone day , removed from its former place of honour and doing duty as an adornment in some unfrequented corner . The least we can do is to remember with thankfulness the men who made them and the wholesome spirit in which they wrought . Somewhat akin to the work on the figureheads , though not so fine and executed for a purely commercial and land-lubber purpose , was the carving of Indians and other figures to stand by way of advertisement before the doors of tobacconists ' shops . These figures belong to the nineteenth century . Some of them display considerable excellence of craftsmanship in their execution . ARCHITECTURAL CARVING . Architectural opportunities for wood carving were abundant and were not neglected . In the earliest Colonial period the oaken beams , posts , and studs of the half-timbered New England houses ( the same that were afterwards encased in clapboard coats ) ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eberlein , 1915 , p. ? ) were embellished with stopped chamfer edges and hand-wrought moulds executed in a bold and virile manner that clearly bespoke the persistence of the medieval wood-worker 's methods . Brackets and corbels and the pendants or drops from the corners of overhangs were decorated in the same lusty fashion . Nor was the architectural application of the wood312 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS carver 's art in seventeenth-century America confined to New England . In some of the old houses in the other Colonies were to be found creditable examples of craftsmanship in this direction . One of them ? and there were others ? is shown in a plate illustration . It is a piece of oak and is wrought in the modelled type of bold relief , displaying such characteristics of technique as one is accustomed to find on the Jacobean cupboards , panelled chests , and wainscot chairs of English make . It bears the initials of Phineas Pemberton and the date of the house he built for himself in 1683 at Bolton Farm , near Bristol , in Bucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the eighteenth century , however , the wood-carver 's art was called more frequently into play for purposes of both exterior and interior ornamentation , and , at the same time , was given a wider scope for displaying the niceties of craftsmanship . It has , unfortunately , been the custom of a great many people either to assert or assume that most of the finely wrought woodwork in our more ornate Georgian houses came from England , because they have heard , perhaps , that such was the case in some one particular instance . Nothing could be more unjust to the reputation and memory of our own Colonial craftsmen . An interesting bit of tangible and eloquent evidence of the American wood-carver 's ability is the instrument cupboard or press made , in 1739 , to hold the air-pump and other scientific apparatus presented , in 1738 , to the Library Company of Philadelphia by the Honourable John Penn . Although a piece of movable furniture , this press is of such distinctly architectural character that it is to be ranked in the category of architects ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobiliary equipment in the Queen Anne-Early Georgian period , and it is , therefore , appropriate that it should be discussed in this connexion . It was wholly designed and made in Philadelphia , and all the circumstances anent its construction are duly recorded in the minutes of the Library Company . The carving of this press is an enduring tribute to the skill of the artisan or artisans who executed it , and any man who could accomplish such a piece of work could , beyond all question , have done any of the architectural wood-carving in the State House or in any other of our Georgian buildings , public or private , no matter how elaborate it is . With this incontrovertible proof of the ability of at least one wood-carver ? there were doubtless other wood-carvers in the Colonies every whit as apt as he ? there is a strong presumption in favour of the American craftsman that the beautiful carved architectural woodwork of our Georgian houses and public edifices was the product of his hands , except in cases where the records show that the carvings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architectural carving of undoubted American origin compare very favourably with the work we know to have been brought over from the Mother-Country . In the latter part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth , one wood-carver who ably upheld the traditions and maintained the reputation of the American craftsman was Samuel McIntire , of Salem , master carpenter , wood-carver , and architect . Not only did his work compare more than favourably . ith any that was executed in either England or // America in his own day , but it has stood the test of time and has never had to yield the palm for excellence to any work executed since . Though ranked as one of the foremost architects of his generation , and though his work had far more than a local influence on our domestic architecture , 2 wood-carving seems always to have been his first love , and the fame of his houses rests on the beauty of their embellishments ? " their doorways , window frames , cornices , gate posts , and their incomparable interior woodwork " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his work , Mr. Dyer says of McIntire : " Ile was the artistic descendant of Inigo Jones , Sir Christopher Wren , Grinling Gibbon , and the Brothers Adam ; he was also their peer in originality as well as in fidelity to the best classic traditions . More chaste and severe than Wren and Gibbon , he was more fanciful than Adam . Perhaps it was his very freedom from the schools that gave him faith in his own genius to do the thing that best suited given conditions , and this faith seldom led him astray . " McIntire also tried his hand at sculpture to some extent , and executed in wood several medallion likenesses of General Washington and a bust of Governour Winthrop . The Washington medallion was first designed and carved in 1805 as a decoration for the western gateway of Washington Square , in Salem , Massachusetts , and was fashioned " after drawings from life made by McIntire during Washington 's visit to Salem in 1789 . " Another carver of signal ability was William Rush , of Philadelphia , born July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the then best carver of his ' See " The Architecture of Colonial America , " H. D. Eberlein , 1915. // day , " in Philadelphia . He specialised in carving figureheads for ships and his work elicited such universal admiration both in British and in foreign parts that he received orders from England . His best known and , perhaps , his finest piece of wooden sculpture is the statue of Washington in the State House in Philadelphia . The motifs employed in the Georgian architectural wood-carving were chiefly of classic provenance or else of Renaissance or Baroque inspiration , tempered by a classic spirit of interpretation . They included roses , rosettes , foliated scrolls , acanthus leaves ( Fig. 3 ) , egg and dart courses , urns with flame or cover tops , swags and drops of flowers or drapery , cockle-shells , pineapples , masques , and , towards the end of the period , some of the more delicate Pompeian devices imported into English usage by the Brothers Adam . Nor are attempts wanting to emulate occasionally the more florid conceptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chronicle of wood-carving the chubby-checked cherubs whose heads and wings often figured in the embellishment of Colonial churches and were usually placed somewhere near the pulpit or the organ loft . In nearly every case the old American wood-carver 's work is executed with a refreshing boldness and freedom of sweep . Heraldic carving , too , was practised to some degree , and in more than one place the royal arms of England , carved and displayed during our Colonial period , are still carefully treasured . The objects upon which this architectural woodcarving was bestowed by way of enrichment were the brackets beneath stair treads , mantels and overmantels , pediments and overdoor adornments in general , door // and window trims , cornices , the capitals of pillars and pilasters ( Fig. 3 ) , and whatever architectural features or details were fitting subjects for ornamentation . Carving on the exteriors of buildings was , of course , not as abundant as carving for interior adornment , but it was by no means uncommon . Many old cornices , capitals , finial urns on the posts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning the achievements of the wood-carver we must remember to make a distinction between carving in wood and modelling in compo when we come to examine some of the very elaborate mantels of the late Georgian period . Not a few of these mantels displaying exquisite Pompeian motifs of adornment which at first appear to be carved are , in reality , moulded in compo and painted after being set in place . STONE CARVING PROCESSES . The processes used in stone carving were virtually analogous to those employed in the carving of wood , or sufficiently so , at any rate , to make the same set of definitions answer in indicating the treatment of both substances . KINDS OF STONE USED . The kinds of stone used by the Colonial and early post-Colonial stone-carvers were marble , sandstone , limestone , slate , soapstone , and , occasionally , granite and mica stone . Marble served both for architectural work , especially in the later period , and for carved tombstones and mural tablets . Sandstone and limestone were employed for both architectural and mortuary work , but chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for tombstones . Slate could be used only for scratch carving and inscriptions . Granite was but slightly used , and that for architectural purposes . Mica stone was occasionally used in Pennsylvania , both for rude architectural work and for tombstones , but it was not a kindly medium for carving . ARCHITECTURAL CARVING . Two things militated against any extensive architectural development of the stone-carver 's art among the craftsmen of the Colonial and post-Colonial periods . The first was the common lack of , or at least the difficulty of obtaining , suitable stone as a medium in which the sculptor might conveniently express his cunning . The second was the fact that , in the majority of our Georgian buildings , wood was ordinarily substituted for the stone or marble that was often used in England , so that there was little opportunity for the stone-carver to develop his craft in its application to the exterior embellishment of buildings , and little encouragement for him to attempt to do so . In New England the native granite did not offer a kindly medium for the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , that there are few examples of this sort of craftsmanship to be found upon any of the New England structures dating from the Colonial period . In New York and the Middle Colonies the presence of sandstone was . occasionally taken advantage of , and a few keystones and capitals were executed . In Pennsylvania , also , one now and then finds examples of attempts at carving the native mica stone . // The most notable instance of this crude work , necessarily crude owing to the intractability of the material , is to be seen on the Bartram house , at Bartram 's Gardens , Kingsessing , Philadelphia . There a date-stone in the western gable bears the inscription " 0EOF . I'QZ God save John and Ann Bartram , 1731 " ( the year in which John Bartram added to the structure originally standing on the site ) . On the river front of the house are roughly wrought Ionic capitals to the pillars of the portico ( a later addition ) , and carvee , window trims with an interesting inscription beneath one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One By me ador 'd John Bartram 1770 Quaint little scrolls fill in the otherwise vacant spaces , as they also do on the earlier date-stone in the gable . Other specimens of carving in this native mica stone are to be found in the milestones set out in 1703 along the Lancaster Pike bearing Penn 's arms in bold relief on a sunk ground , and on date-stones and wall devices , such as the tulip and heart or other mystic emblems , among the Pennsylvania Germans . Late in the Colonial period and in the early postColonial period , architectural carving in marble came more and more into fashion , and was wrought in the manner in which we of to-day are accustomed to seeing it treated . It was at this time , too , that some of the exquisite marble mantels of Adam pattern were carved . Others , also , were wrought in Empire designs at a slightly later date . // TOMBSTONE CARVING . If the early American stonecarver was limited in his architectural scope , he made up for his lack of opportunity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mural tablets . Every old churchyard and burial ground in the country is full of the evidences of his prowess with the mallet and chisel . The choice of subjects , to be sure , was somewhat circumscribed ? cherubs , death 's heads , skulls and crossbones , and hour-glasses , with and without wings , seem to have been the universal favourites ? but he managed to inject not a little variety into his interpretations of these lugubrious emblems of mortality . There were dolorous cherubs and merry cherubs ; lean cherubs and fat , mumpy-cheeked celestial youngsters joyously fluttering their robust little wings ; cherubs with curly hair and cherubs with head dresses , and , now and again , cherubs with their ambrosial locks done up in puffs that would have put the most proficient Parisian friseur to unending and envious shame . Occasionally the cherubs were dour of visage , and there is one creature , done in scratch or incised carving , on a mica stone in St. Thomas 's Churchyard , Whitemarsh , Pennsylvania , with a frilled head dress and three-. cornered ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howe 's soldiers , when they were encamped on St. Thomas 's Hill , used this vixenish object as a target for pistol practice . The majority of cherubs , however , were apt to be phlegmatic and stupid looking . In some cases tombstones were bordered with decorative bands of fruit , flowers , leaves , and , now and then , other motifs . The tulip was a favourite flower , and its use was not restricted to the Pennsylvania Ger320 EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS mans , for instances of its employment have been found in parts of New England for tombstone enrichment . In a great number of cases the lettering on tombstones was of rare excellence , and the letters were shaped with such delicacy and beauty of proportion that they are carefully copied to-day by architects . Of course , the lettering was not universally good and sometimes it was exceedingly poor , but , as a rule , it was at least creditable ; and , indeed , it had need to be , for when soapstone or slate were used , materials that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only decoration . As an agreeable change from cherubs and death 's heads , numerous old tombstones exhibit armorial bearings , which it was comparatively easy to execute creditably when the material of the monument was either marble or sandstone . Urns also enjoyed considerable vogue as motifs of adornment . Mural tablets in churches usually displayed a far greater nicety of finish than the stones that stood in the open . The devices employed for their embellishment were of the same general character as those already mentioned ? heraldic devices , urns , cherubs , and hourglasses.
