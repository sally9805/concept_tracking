txt Representative Thomas H. Eliot ( D ) of Massachusetts , grandson of Charles W. Eliot , former President of Harvard University , went over the record of individuals and organizations charged by the Dies Committee with being " un-American , " " subversive " or " Communistic , " and told the House that he had found some of them indorsed by such men as Wendell L. Willkie , Attorney General Francis Biddle , William Allen White , Thomas E. Dewey , Gov . Leverett Salstonstall ( R ) of Massachusetts , and Charles , Evans Hughes . In one of the strongest attacks made on the Dies Committee , whose life expires next month unless a pending continuation resolution is passed , Mr. Eliot urged its abolition for incompetency , and the substitution of some other agency . The Dies Committee , Rep ' resentative Eliot recalled , listed ' indorsement of the American Youth Act as evidence of " un-American activities . " Mr. Eliot pointed out that Warden Lewis E. Lawes and several members of the House indorsed the Act , including a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr. , Listed William E. Dodd , Jr. , was listed as " un-American " by the Dies Committee . Mr. Eliot pointed out that this was because " his father , Ambassador Dodd , not he himself , was a member of something called the Council Against Intolerance . " Other members of the same Council were Senator W , Warren Barbour ( R ) of New Jersey , George Gordon Battle , William Allen White , Attorney General Biddle , Senator Bennett Clark ( D ) of Missouri , Thomas E. Dewey , Frank Gannett and others . " How can we stand for this sort of thing ? " demanded Mr. Eliot . " It is just silly , and it makes the House look utterly ridiculous . " Representative Eliot recalled that one " Mary Johnson " had been ordered investigated by the F. B. I. as a minor clerk in the Government on information of the Dies Committee , because " somebody named Mary Johnson drew a pie ture for a Communist paper six years ago . " The two people were not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. I. was forced to make the inquiry ? " while the Normandie goes up in flames . " Mr. Dies included one " George Saunders " on his list of un-American Government employees , charged with being a Communist living in Pittsburgh . Actually the George Saunders referred to , Mr. Eliot recalled , lives in San Francisco , where " he was active in the Junior Chamber of Commerce . " The Dies Committee , however , ordered the F. B. I. to track him down although , as Mr. Eliot recalled , " George Deatherage , the frank American fascist who used to head the Knights of the White Camellia and who planned a fascist coup to seize the Government , is executive engineer at an immense naval construction project right down here at Norfolk . " Anti-Nazi League 's Case A Government employee named " Gauld " . was labeled " un-Amer- 1 lean " by the Dies Committee , Mr. Eliot pointed out , " because he was a member of a Committee headed by former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes . " Mr. Eliot pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-sectarian Anti-Nazi League , and recalled that this League had had the full indorsement on the floor of the House of Majority Leader John W. McCormack ( D ) of Massachusetts , who called it " a fine organization of Americans . " Representative Dies called the China Aid Council subversive , Mr. Eliot recalled . This is part of the United China Relief whose Honorary President is Wendell Willkie . " Finally , here is an activity which the Dies Committee considers subversive , " went on Mr. Eliot . " Yes , this is an activity listed in the Dies Committee files and charged against United States employees as un-American  --  signing a petition against the Dies Committee . Anybody who opposes the continuation of the Dies Committee is ipso facto un-American . I need not comment on the dangerous implications of a thing like that . It is enough to point out the amazing and smug self-righteousness of the Committee . " Charges Irresponsibility Mr. Eliot charged the Committee with irresponsibility and making announcements without any meet , mg or Committee discussion . He quoted Chairman Dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document relating to I fascistic , anti-Semitic groups . The 1 document , however , has never appeared . " On March 8 of last year , " Mr. Eliot continued , " he was reported to have evidence concerning a huge organization to promote Nazi ideology . There has been no mention of this since then . " Fourteen months ago he promised to expose Nazi money-raising campaigns in the United States , and said the Committee had seized the records containing 220,000 names . Has anyone even seen the names or heard of that exposure ? " The Philadelphia Inquirer quotes him on Nov. 30 , 1940 , as promising to reveal ' next week ' a plot of the Bund to sabotage American industry . But to this day the plot remains unrevealed . " Mr. Eliot cited a Dies radio ' speech of Sept. 18 , 1939 , declaring he had evidence of co-operation between the Bund and native Fascist groups , including the Deatherage outfit , the Knights of the White Camellia . " But no action of the Committee followed , " Mr. Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up in ' a key defense job . " , Anti-Russian Bias Charged Mr. Eliot recalled evidence of the Federal Communications Commission that Representative Dies has been " freouently and favorably quoted on Aida propaganda broadcasts . " He charged Mr. Dies with neglecting to investigate Nazis , Fascists or sabotage , and concentrating against Russians , and making " false charges " against the Administration , calculated to throw national distrust on its wartime leadership . " Think of the accusation , " he added , " thinly veiled , that the Dies Committee could have prevented the Pearl Harbor tragedy if the President had not interfered , Think of the need for solidarity among the United Nations against our enemies at a time like this . " And when we read the record and think the thing through , we know that it is the truth , " Mr. Eliot concluded . " We know in our hearts that this Dies Committee had a record of high-handed hearings , high-sounding promises , very little accomplishment , and endless , ridiculous , unforgivable smearing of decent and loyal Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
