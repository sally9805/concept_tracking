Berliners , like all Europeans , know the face of sorrow by heart , and it generally leaves them numb . But this picture was haunting , and the gallerygoers kept returning to it . It was an autumn landscape in which two old people , their backs turned , appeared to be thinking things over ( see cut ) ; a painting which spoke the timeless reproach of the dead , of those who would never again turn to face their persecutors . <P> The artist was Henry Koerner , a Vienna-born Jew . The painting , which was good enough to make Koerner 's first one-man show an important event , represented his parents , liquidated by the Nazis . <P> Koerner himself had escaped in the nick of time . In 1938 he went to the U.S. to seek his fortune as a commercial artist , and never again heard from his family . Now 31 and a U.S. citizen , he illustrates pamphlets for the U.S. Military Government in Germany . Although his war posters had earned him a reputation as a designer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was still unknown in the U.S. Koerner intended to change that ; he refused to sell any of the paintings in his Berlin show . He was saving them for one in Manhattan . <P> Koerner 's paintings , at the Hau am Waldsee , were a high spot in Berlin 's booming art season . Cheaper and easier to find than movies , galleries have become popular entertainment in Berlin . German painters can still buy canvas and brushes on the black market , and almost anyone can sell his stuff ( paintings are considered a reasonably good hedge against inflation ) . But German art is still far below pre-Hitler standards . One good reason why : the painters Hitler had exiled have shown no inclination to hurry back . George Grosz has become a Long Island suburbanite ; Lyonel Feininger is busy making watercolors of Manhattan skyscrapers ; Max Beckmann broods in Amsterdam . <P> With few old favorites left to warm their adjectives over , German critics pounced on newcomer Koerner . Those who supposed that his work showed the trend of U.S. art proudly concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's painting did have the heaviness , the harsh humor and the all-pervading weltschmerz which characterized German expressionism in the 1920s . Along with My Parents , the show 's strongest painting was The Prophet ( see cut ) , which reminded critics of Expressionist Grosz and also of Koerner 's favorite Old Master , Peter Bruegel . ( Of his bony , monkey-like Prophet , Koerner said that he " might be a demagogue or a statesman , and the man hanging might be a villain or a hero . The people must listen because they can do nothing else . " ) <P> Despite the critics ' prompting , some Berliners-those who were too young to have seen the art that Hitler banned-frankly disliked Koerner . " Why , " asked the conservative youths , " does n't he paint things as they are ? "
