In mild embarrassment , OPA last week finally took note of the new sugar shortage . It let out the news that the rations of industrial sugar users will be cut 10% ( they are already using 20% less than in 1942 ) . This will mean less candy and soft drinks . <P> The new cut is the result of OPA 's freehanded passing of the sugar bowl last summer . As one OPAster ruefully said : " We went overboard on the allowances for home canning and I 'm afraid the housewives kind of did us dirt . Their good intentions just went wrong . They did n't do as much canning as they said they would do and now we 've got too many sugar coupons out . " <P> One reason that OPA can not make good on these sugary promises is because another well-intentioned promise went sour . The War Shipping Administration promised that more ships would be available to haul sugar into the U.S. from Cuba , where warehouses are bulging with 1,000,000 tons , bought &; paid for by the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , U.S. beet-sugar growers harvested only 1,100,000 tons this year-more than last year , but still a big 500,000 tons less than the 1942 crop . Also , in 1944 about 900,000 tons of Cuban production were diverted from sugar to high-test molasses for industrial alcohol . <P> Thus , the supply of sugar for civilians in the first ten months of 1944 was reduced to 6,650,000 tons . But civilians swallowed 5,973,000 tons , biting deeply into reserves . Now , reserves are down to 677,000 tons , lowest on record . OPA still hopes to stave off tighter rationing of civilians . But if the cut to industrial users does not save enough sugar , OPA will have to balance its books by either : 1 ) invalidating all sugar stamps up to a certain date ; or 2 ) reducing the value of stamps which become good henceforth .
