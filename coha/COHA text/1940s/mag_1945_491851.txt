i ' NcitTyHEwhberaer sopfateh isHotelo aRpeofkorer aingehMt Mexico Broadway warned us not to go to Guatemala . as it was about to enjoy a revolution . Now , that bar is a featherbed for phonies . Drinks are a dollar , but rumors free , so I listened with my cocktail-party ear , and we enplaned next morning , October nineteenth , for the Switzerland of the Americas . As we slid south , the Mexican mountains scaled down to grass bumps with tousled rocky heads , and then into banana jungle along the coastal border . Once into Guatemala , peaks and cones started to thrust up toward the plane , and soon we sloped down to the flossy airport of Guatemala City . The atmos  --  phere , 5000 feet up , was as fresh and clean as the broad boulevard which leads through manicured suburbs . In the city itself , marble banks , spotless chain drugstores , capacious movie theaters and super-hot-dog emporiums make it as modern as our Middle-towns . But it has a Latin accent . Ladies sporting the latest models from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets of exotic fruits on their heads and babies bouncing on their backs .

The beautiful National Palace , set apart from the native central market by the sweeping Plaza de Armes. and the gaudy National Police Building  --  larger than one of our statehouses  --  were dreamed through by Jorge Ubico , the country 's deposed dicta  --  tor . The Palace Hotel , for which we were headed , is a worn small-town hostelry with a marimba band in  --  vading its wide , friendly lobby on fiesta nights . The inside of a night club has no nationality , and the Casablanca ? Grand Opening that very night  --  was domed and spired in colored canvas as if it were in midtown New York .

Our nighteries have no Indian waiters sliding across the tile floor in their bare feet . Our new friends were growing lyrical over the won  --  ders of their mountain country , for which we were to start out early the next morning . It was nearly two when people who had loft their tables a while before began to wander back and sit quietly by empty glasses and smoking ash trays . I heard a low boom over the band music  --  a boom followed by rumbles . " Thunder , " I remarked . " Thought your rainy season was over . " " It is , " one of our Guatemalan friends said , sud  --  denly solemn . " An earthquake ! " broke in someone nervously , and then , " Oh , no . That does n't make any noise , does it ?

She was talking Spanish now , but did n't know it . Just then the band stopped and we could hear rifles and machine guns . There was a moment of hush , then excited Latin babble and a rush for the one door of the night club . Before the door , stood the owner , a tall tango dancer who has often graced the New York Waldorf . " Stay here , my friends , " he begged . " It 's dangerous out there . Just sit quiet , please . I am buying everyone a drink . . . Waiters , take my guests ' orders . " Machine-gun bursts , that now seemed to be just down the street , did more than mine host 's suave words to send the night-clubbors back to their tables .

How 'm I going to get there ? I 'll try to phone from the hotel . There 's none here . " He ran across the street to the hotel and battered on the locked door . Rifles popped from the end of the block . but we saw the door open . slowly , then close behind him . All at once , a dignified Guatemalan strode to the bandstand and shouted something . The music died off , and through the mike he commanded the dancers to stop . " People are dying out there  --  our people ! And you are dancing ! " Jay came back and herded us across to the hotel . We all felt safer in the empty lobby .

What should they do ? They were in uniform , all set to go . He told them he could n't reach the field , could n't get a car . When the younger one suggested that they might walk out to the field and fly the Douglas out of danger , Jay eyed him dryly . " Stay here , " he ordered . " We can replace planes . " There was bed and there was the roof . In bed , we could only see our fears in the dark , but on the low roof  --  the constant earthquake threat keeps buildings low down there  --  you could see the whole works , we figured . Mildred chose the roof . My head came up over the ladder into the dark blue plush of the night . I stepped out and pulled Mildred up beside me . Then the sky lit with a flash and a voice near by yelled " Duck ! " We did , and before time for another breath , heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's pretty close , is n't it ? How close is that ? " I asked the dark . I felt Mildred 's hand in mine . " Oh , that 's not near . They 're getting the range now . A while back they were coming just over my head . You do n't really have to duck , you know . It just seems the thing to do . " Another flash , another whiz , and the little woman said she liked lying down . I stayed there toe , " Look , " said Mildred , the practical . " Who 's firing at who , and why ? Nobody seems to know , and my husband says I should n't ask . Should n't I ? " 25 " Why not ? I can tell you . I 'm a radio operator . I was born here . " That explained the soft intonation of his English . In between mortar burets he gave us the picture . About five months back , the thirteen-year dictator , Ubico , had been forced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . Soon the civilians , he said , found out that Ponce was planning to by-pass the free elections he had promised ; that he was building favor with the Indians in the country and making them members of his secret police , edu  --  cating them , even giving them shoes . Then they dis  --  covered that Ponce was meeting secretly with Ubico , supposedly retired to private life . Alejandro Cordova , publisher of the newspaper reporting this , was threat  --  ened by the Gestapo . Then doctors , lawyers , professors and businessmen were jailed in the ornate Police Building . Some were beaten , others exiled . Next , Cordova , still protesting in headlines , was murdered . That gritted many teeth . Then Ponce would not set a date for the elections , and that touched it off . The uni  --  versity professors planned it and students and civil  --  ians were seeing that it was carried out . " Why do n't they hit that fort ? They 've been firing for hours now . " The dark little radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Lend-Lease big guns and dragged them down in the valley . Fort San Jose does n't know where they 're being shot at from . Those loyalist generals must be all mixed up . " I asked him if it would be good for the country if the revolution were a success . He said it would be good for the Ladinos . " What 's a Ladino ? " asked Mildred . " Any Guatemala Indian with enough Spanish blood in him to be proud of it . I 'm a Ladino . " " Will it help the Indians ? Is n't this Ponce for them ? " " Nobody 's for the Indians , senora . Not even the Indians , I mean they do n't know how to help them  --  selves or get together . Ponce seems to be helping ? them , but it 's so he can use them . They 're more than half the population , and if they ever got together ? " Another shell whizzed over . We thought we were used to them , but this one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great burst of flame , as the ammunition dump popped off and Fort San Jose be  --  came a mass of rubble . In the glare , we could see sol  --  diers pouring out , running down the hill , scrambling away into the darkness . The fort burned like a beach bonfire . " I 'm going down , " said the radio operator . We fol  --  lowed him on the ladder . The lobby was dotted with nervous folks from their rooms , and groups from the Casablanca in their wrinkled party clothes . Everybody was waiting for dawn . The radio operator told his countrymen about the fort . They seemed pleased , but their women 's lips tightened . They all had menfolks on both sides of this scrambled war . We went to bed and dozed between far-off shots that sounded like firecrackers thrown from the hand of a little boy . As the sun slid through the blinds , there Came a barrage of machine-gun fire , regular and pro  --  longed . Someone who knew his business was ordering that barrage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a line waiting at the ladder . Before I could get my feet on top , the firing had ceased and everyone was pointing to a white flag on the Police Building , not five blocks away . As we watched , the machine guns started again , but this time they sounded muffled . The firing was from inside the building . They let the regular police surrender , but kept firing at the Gestapo till there were none . There were no cooks , waiters or maids in the hotel , so I stuck my head out the door , and , finding the street empty , started down the block to forage for breakfast . The corrugated-iron fronts of the shops were shut tight , the traffic cop was missing from his little stand at the corner . But it was a false moment of calm , for before I could reach the corner , there was a bark of motor horns , and a jeep jammed with soldiers , a light tank , and then a truck piled with wounded , Guate  --  malan Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all waved to me , and I , not knowing which aide they were on , waved back . It seemed safer that way . After all , I did not know what side I was on . A station wagon , blue and gray , wear  --  ing the airways insigne , pulled up with El jerk . Jay jumped out . We looked at Jay 's face end then at the station wagon . It was practically a colander ; bullet holes through the roof , the buck seat , the running board , and two neat holes through the windshield .

I 'll be waiting WEEK-END REVOLUTION ( Continued from Page 25 ) Inside , we found out how they got out the station wagon and left with a pilot and the chief airport mechanic to fly out the Douglas . How the pilot insisted on going back for his wife . How they got her and made for the airport . As they started under the viaduct just short of the field , a burst of bullets from nowhere slapped the car . Then another . They stopped . Nobody was hit , but , deciding this was no place to sit around , they for you . . . in the valley . and do n't forget . . that I love you ! " In the valley  --  the valley of death ?

His eyes were tightly closed , but he saw Jane Hudson 's face quite clearly , and she smiled at him through a radiance brighter than sunlight until he went to sleep . Somebody who sounded like his Uncle Jeff was talking low , " You sure that he ai n't hurt bad , Charley ? " " Jeff , I tell you he 's a submarine cast-iron miracle ! A flood like that can make sawdust out of a steam shovel . . and he rode it through ! He 's a miracle ! " " I know he 's a miracle , but just how bad is he hurt ? Tell me again , and do n't lie to make it easy on me . " " Well , runnin ' from the head down , he 's got a four-inch gash in his scalp , a piece of meat rubbed off of his left shoul  --  der as big as your hand , his left arm is broke above the elbow , both knees are cut up some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog bit where a rock gashed it . " Suddenly , wide awake and remember  --  ing everything up to the moment that the flood got him , " Charley , are you talking about me ? " Spike asked . " Was that Uncle Jeff speaking ? . . . Jane , darling , where are we ? It 's so dark . .. . Why are you crying ? " " We 're in the back seat of Uncle Jeff 's car , " Jane said . " Charley is driving and Jeff is right beside him . " " And I 'm just ridin ' high and thankin ' the Lord for runnin ' the whole show , " Jeff added . Spike felt Jane 's face , wet with tears , against his throat . " Did you hear me , " he whispered , " just before I took off , when I said I 'd meet you in the valley ? " " I heard you , darling . " ' ' All of it ? " " Of course . . and I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . There never can be now . " " I 'm hearin ' you both , " Charley Walker declared . . . . " Spike , there is a new preacher in Beatty with a wife and four children that could use fifty bucks Shall I bring him back to Sundown when I go after your doctor ? " Spike waited without replying until Jane voiced her decision . " Bring him along , Charley , " she said . " Can we get a ' marriage license this late at night ? " Jeff answered that question , " Honey , of course , you can ! I bet a million dol  --  lars that you and Spike can have about anything you want on this earth , and I 'll spend the million to buy it for you ! " " Buy her a ticket to France , " Spike suggested . " She can come with me while I catch up with my high-flyin ' gang . " " I thought you told me this after  --  noon , " Jeff began slyly , " something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " forget it . I 'm cured .

" streaked for the long grass by the road . Another burst came , and when they reached the grass , the pilot and mechanic were bleeding . They saw no one . After more than an hour of quiet fear in the grass , the pilot 's wife said she would drive her husband to the hospital alone if the rest would n't go with her . Both wounded men were bleeding badly . Jay ran for the car and pulled up by the road . They got the men in somehow and streaked for the hospital , waving a white flag made from the wife 's blouse . " They 're over there now , waiting for a blood transfusion , " Jay concluded . A man in khaki , a carbine across his shoulders and a pistol in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay in his uniform , he bowed . " I am one of the leaders of the Libera  --  tion Party , senor . I have heard of the unfortunate accident to your men . I am certain the other party fired the shots . Our men are all disciplined . But I would like to offer my blood for the transfu  --  sions . " The power of his guns rang in his voice . Jay hesitated . All the pilots had offered their blood , but he could n't offend a leader with two guns . so he said he 'd call on him if his type of blood was needed . The leader said he could be found at the National Palace . Seeing the surprise in our faces , he went on to say that the pal  --  ace had fallen without a struggle , and the hand-carved mahogany doors , the tilework that tells the country 's story , and the vast murals of the squat Mayan original settlers were all safe . " Beauty is everlasting and only man is vile , " he actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was fantastic . Two American Red Cross nurses , on leave from Panama , dropped in and made for the leather chairs across from us . They told of being pressed into serv  --  ice at the hospital , and , once there , kept going for twelve hours . They were just off for a bite now . There were hundreds over there , dripping blood while waiting in line . Two doctors were operating on three cases at a time . Not enough drugs or anything . " Three years in the big fight and noth  --  ing but malaria to handle . Now we get over three hundred amputations at a crack in this Page Seven war , " mused one , as they both picked at the food we had scraped up from the kitchen . Fighting continued sporadically all day , but we were kept tight in the hotel . Saturday morning was bright with highland sun/shine , and the dining room was open . The hotel employees were drifting in . Their grapevine was quicker than the radio , which began crackling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse Spanish , and when every bit of breath was out of it , another , incredibly higher and faster , relieved it . Guatemala has a double Winchell . " The war is over , " the voices an  --  nounced , " Ubico is hiding in the Spanish legation , after fleeing from the roof of his mansion next door , where he was gunning for his ousters with a stolen machine gun . Ponce , the deposed Cae  --  sar 's tool , is cowering in the Mexican legation , and will be flown out of the country forever in the morning . Peace is here , friends of democracy . Turn in your rifle , receive five quetzales , and go to your homes . " Five dollars  --  the price for your life ; in a country where it is almost a mon th'spay . The streets around the hotel were quiet . A youngster with a machete and a trolley conductor 's cap tried to look fiercely at me , but I gave him good day and he smiled . A few shops had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tively , and feet moved around within . Then the chain drugstores opened . Crowds of young men packed into trucks , happily waving the guns they were going to exchange for cash , shot by . . Joining a crowd in front of a shop window , I saw the owner pasting up an action photo of the three leaders of the revolution , stand  --  ing in front of the palace , looking stern and triumphant . " Give them a break , you three guys , will you ? " I found myself saying , as I hurried back to the hotel . " All is peaceful now . Why ca n't we go to the country ? " " The car will go if you want to make the trip , " answered the manager of our tour , " but the other people have can  --  celed . " " Scared ? " asked Mildred . " No . They were the two nurses from Panama . They 're busy . " We arranged to leave in twenty min  --  utes , packed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said his boys were doing pretty well and his Douglas was in New Orleans . All flights had been canceled . Then he saw our bag and asked us where we were going . When we said to Chichicastenango and Lake Atitlan , he dragged us to the phone and called the United States consul . The consul told him we 'd go at our own risk , and Jay started to take our bag from us . But Mildred said we 'd been doing everything at our own risk for a long time , so I went to the desk to check out . The little Ladino clerk cliched , " I would n't go . I really would n't . " He leaned over the desk . " Ubico and Ponce have sent word to the Indians in the country . You know Ponce promised them the coffee farms ' confiscated from the German Nazis , and they love him . He 's sent word that bad people in the city are trying to kill their god  --  that 's Ubico . They 'll be marching up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye . But we slid into the waiting car and found a fellow passenger , a tall young man from the Rockefeller Foundation . Mildred asked him if he was n't afraid to go , and he told her he guessed it was safer than his room ; a shell had crashed through the wall during the night and he had slept on the floor , crawling out at dawn . We passed the stumps of the fort , and for the next few blocks twisted our heads from ruin to ruin . Tanks and jeeps were drawn up by the road , the teen-age sol  --  diers balancing rifles on their knees as they munched tortillas , They glanced re  --  spectfully at the American flag that snapped from our front bumper . Right outside the city , the mountains came down to meet us , and we tooled up and around dark green creases to reach An  --  tigua , dozing in a sunny valley under its own volcano , Agua . A little revolution was kid stuff to Antigua after the earth  --  quakes , floods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road gives up its normal life and becomes a snarled fish-line . Our driver honked continually at hairpin turns and streams of Indian men loaded with packs of such weight and size that just the strain of moving under them must wipe the ability to think from their minds . They carry for days , strug  --  gling up to the market at Chichi . Their conquest , first by the Spaniards , then by the Ladinos  --  blood of their own blood  --  and now by modern civilization , is in their eyes . The slickers in the towns grin and pretend to understand tourist Span  --  ish , but the real Indians , the million that crowd the countryside , are untouchable . Even the war below is something from a book they cannotread , A young lady archaeologist with a sketch board arrived from the city with the reports of new firing , and of a small army of Indians marching on the city being dispersed by bombs from planes . So the little clerk was right . Only the new gods of the air kept them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel on the shores of Lake Atitlan , the radio crackled . It was the double-Winchell boys again : " Keep watch for a tan sedan  --  a stolen car loaded with escaped members of the former Gestapo . They carry guns and were last seen headed for the highland country . " The highland country ! That 's where we were , and as the plump Yankee hotel manager went into a mild tizzy , ruing the day he left his bookshoppe at home for this wild outland , the calm , attrac  --  tive daughter of the Ladino owner , who was really in charge , asked her seven guests who wanted to go riding in the morning . Mildred and I accepted . We rode with Adelita in the morning , into the flowered hills . A young coffee farmer named Paco came along and guided us to a cliff high above the lake where he has a cabin so like the one in Rose-Marie that Mildred stood on the ledge among the tall pines and started to warble the Indian Love Call . All around , grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his farm and came down to the highway , Indians , their packs now loaded with exchange goods from Chichi , sidled sullenly away from the horses . Little boys , ten at the most , were bent under their own packs , learning to live a life like father 's . The sight of this drained the sun out of me . I told Adelita , and she looked down , notic  --  ing the beasts of burden for the first time . " Oh , you Americana must n't judge by your standards . Our Indians are happy people . They have no worries . " We clattered down the last grade and drew up . There , on the rocks above the bridge , were soldiers . They peeked out from the high bushes , but let us ride on . In the village by the lake , a truckload of ragged boys were fingering old-time rifles . This was the home guard . Women with pots , pans and babies on their heads and backs were struggling through the river bed and up the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paco galloped past us , a pistol in each hand . At the hotel , we found what it was all about . The mail truck had raced through with the news that a drunken band of 1000 Indians , roused by the loss of their promised German farms , had risen in the town of Patzicia thirty miles away and massacred every Ladino man , woman and child they could catch . And now they were on the march  --  where headed for , no one could tell . Our bookshoppe manager was practi  --  cally frying in his fear .

But while the Indians were sleeping of their orgy in the plaza , the new government had sent a tank in from either end of the town and turned a revolving pillar of fire on the murderers .
