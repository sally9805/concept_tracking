This week , after dawdling 14 days , the Finns cautiously accepted Stalin 's handwritten summons to a talk about a proposed pact of mutual assistance which might end Finland 's freedom . Last week from Helsinki TIME 'S John Walker cabled : <P> Spring came to northern Europe nearly a month ahead of time , and Helsinki had an unbroken succession of lovely sunlit days . They formed an oddly unsuitable background for glum apprehension and nervous political maneuverings . <P> It took five hours to fly from Moscow to Helsinki in a Soviet DC-3 . But I found myself in an atmosphere so hauntingly reminiscent of Europe in 1939 that I had the weird feeling that what I had really climbed into at Moscow 's airfield was a Wellsian time machine which whisked me back nine years . There is the same excitement , of alternate pessimism and hopefulness , the same underlying feeling of a great overall drifting into disaster . <P> Helsinki has virtually no foreign merchandise . All foreign exchange has been hoarded to buy machinery and raw materials . The people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking themselves out trying to keep ahead of the Soviet reparations program , to give the Russians no excuse for interfering . <P> " The Poor Swedes . " Politically the week opened in confusion bordering on panic among the parliamentary blocs . The Communists alone promptly embraced the treaty proposal . The others looked at it with despairing distaste . The Social Democrats , as usual , pretty much held the key to the situation and , as usual , did not seem to know what to do about it . <P> Other parties felt bewildered and let down ; hence the week 's real surprise came Friday when they stuck to their guns , and Agrarians , Liberals and Conservatives , controlling 86 of the 200 parliamentary votes , notified President Paasikivi that they opposed treaty negotiations with Russia . Considering Finland 's geographical and political position , these 86 showed plenty of courage . <P> Of the political leaders the most interesting-because they hold the greatest potential influence-are Social Democrats Karl-August Fagerholm , speaker of Parliament , and Onni Peltonen , locomotive engineer by trade , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Affairs Committee . Peltonen has led the fight for a firm policy , while the softening influence is attributed to Fagerholm , who was in Stockholm the first of the week and returned with a roaring case of jitters . <P> The Swedes are apparently in a worse flap over this than the Finns , and view the whole thing as a Swedish problem . The Finns derive a certain sour satisfaction from this . A Finnish Liberal rolled his eyes heavenward and said : " Oh , the poor Swedes ! I do n't know how they 'll be able to bear this . " <P> The most sinister figure around Helsinki is that of Lieut . General Grigory Savonenkov , the Soviet minister , a bullyragging , bellowing , table-pounding type . Savonenkov 's arrival in Helsinki in mid-January was the first tip-off to the Finns that trouble was brewing . At that time I filed you a brief piece about his arrival , and the Moscow censor deleted his military title and all reference to his general 's uniform . This time I inquired whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent Finnish observer : " I think he sleeps in it . "
