NOTHING MADE A STORY BY COLIN WILLS T HE sooty London rain smeared the carriage windows until the train was well out in the suburbs ; then it eased off to a gray dew . He lowered the window and breathed the wet air . It had that choking debris smell that comes from old buildings when they 're bombed , and he could see through the mist the ragged shape of ruins  --  terraces of pinched little houses blasted apart and deserted . Those who were n't killed had gone , leaving only a few tatters of blue and pink curtains and smashed ornaments , and on one doorstep a battered enamel chamber-pot . A jerry for Jerry , he thought . Hell , I 'm going nuts all right . The woman opposite was laughing to herself at the jerry . They smiled at each other . She was a good-looker and smart . He had developed an eye for tweeds since he had been in England , and hers were good . Kind of a mustard check . He looked at her shoes and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at that . So was her luggage . He passed her the Times and she handed back Punch . The summer number with colored pictures of Mr. Punch in the uniforms of all the Empire armies . " A man does go to pieces in this country , " he said with a grin . " I even like Punch now . " " I only took it up recently . I used to prefer the New Yorker , " she said . " But you 're not American ? " " No . " That was all she said , but he knew from the way she talked she was n't English either . Her English was perfect but she pronounced all the syllables . After a while he asked her how about coming along to the restaurant car for some coffee , and they went ; but they had tea , because they agreed the English could n't make good coffee . So it came out she had lived mostly in France although she was born in India . Her father was an Irish officer and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying on the airlines . But it was just like driving a bus , monotonous ; so he took up private flying for rich men , and teaching them to fly , and once he had taught the British Ambassador . He was a funny guy , that ; no sense of humor , but everything he said gave you a laugh . Then , when the war started , he came to England to join the R.A.F. ; but they would n't have him because he had a German grandmother or something and M.I.5 were n't satisfied about him . But his father had been a Canadian , and he was still trying to wangle it . In the meantime he was a ferry pilot in the A.T.A. , ferrying aircraft from factories to air fields , and from one R.A.F. station to another . It was interesting all right , and damned dangerous , handling all sorts of strange machines in country you did n't know . He had cracked up a crate only the week before , hit a high-tension cable . That 's why he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kind of all on edge and could n't concentrate . Well , it got to showing her pictures taken back home and then she showed him one of her daughter , who was still in France with her father , who was a horse-breeder in Normandy . That was pretty rotten for the mother all right . Mrs. Romfils her name was . She was on leave too , from her job with a mobile canteen . She had been at it ever since she came over from France . He wondered why she had come alone and left the kid behind , but he did n't go into that . She was no quitter , that was clear enough , working right through all the blitzes , carting round tea and stuff to the rescue workers . He gave her a Lucky , and she said he was an angel ; you could n't get cigarettes for love or money half the time in London now . When they had dealt with rationing and picked the war effort to pieces and summed up on grand strategy the waiters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of the way for the first service of lunch , so he took two reservations for the second service and they went back to their carriage . Then they got started on defeatism , and what they said was n't one hundred per cent Churchillian enough for the old boy in the corner , and he got up with a snort and slammed the door behind him . They laughed about that and had another cigarette . They were getting along fine . And then she started to talk about how wrong it was to blame the French , and got all fiery aboutit , and in a more marked accent than ever , and he began to wonder if maybe this was n't careless talk on his part . After all , he did n't know this Mrs. Romfils . But when she got on to the Nazis he knew she was all right . The slickest spy in the world could n't fake that flash in the eyes and that little flick of spittle on her lip-rouge when she spat out those ace-high expletives that nobody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit wet when she talked about the Nazis in France , and he told her not to worry ; that everything would be all right , though he had to admit he could n't see quite how , the way things were going , and sometimes he felt a bit defeatist himself . She said who would n't ? and they went along to lunch feeling savage and very companionable , like fellow-citizens of some nameless country of the mind , and they cold-shouldered the two Englishmen at their table , a snooty young Guards officer and a little old man in tweeds with a face like a smoked haddock and bright blue eyes . But when the salad arrived there were only three radishes and after they 'd all tried to give them all to Mrs. Romfils and she had insisted they toss for them , they all got quite friendly , and the Guards officer turned out to be a regular fellow after all , and the old man talked about Devon , where he came from and where they were all going . And when it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chance without booking rooms , the old man said they would n't have the ghost of a chance , because North Devon was a reception area for evacuees , and half the hotels had been taken over by evacuated schools and all the rest , and the boarding houses and farms and cottages were all filled up with mothers and babies from London and Plymouth and Bristol . Well , Mike and Mrs. Romfils looked at each other and laughed and felt more companionable than ever , and they both said they were going on to try their luck just the same . On the way back to their carriage he asked her to call him Mike , and she said her name was Alice , and he said she was certainly having some adventures in Wonderland , and he must be the Mad Hatter , or maybe the March Hare . They went in the compartment laughing , and the old boy in the corner glared and sniffed , and Alice nodded her head towards him in a French way and said " The Mock Turtle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of the way and told crazy stories and some moderately hot ones , until the old boy was purple . When they got out at Barnstaple it looked like where the pavement ends , but they found a luggage clerk who was n't a defeatist about their chances of getting rooms , and he helped them hunt up hotels in the directory and Mike got busy on the telephone . When he was through the list he came out and told Alice none of the hotels could give them two single rooms , or even one single . She looked a bit blue at that and he felt very fond of her and said , " There 's one has a double . " She said : " Too bad , " in a completely final tone , so that was all about that , and he hunted up the luggage clerk again and got two more hotel names . The first hotel manager was terribly discouraging and advised Mike to take the next train back to London . The second groaned a bit and then said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of dim conversation at the other end he came back on the line and said all right he could take them for three days only . After the way they had been feeling this sounded like a free gift of a manor house for life , so they piled their luggage on the bus and Mike gave the porter ten shillings . Alice said a bob would have been plenty , and did n't he know there was a war on ? He said English money was no good anyway , and they both started getting things off their chests about England till a Home Guard sitting behind them wanted to turn them off the bus or even have them arrested for spreading gloom and despondency . And then suddenly the bus came to the top of a high hill , and they saw Devon rolling and surging away beneath them in great still waves of moorland and downs and big check patterns of rose-colored earth and green fields and yellow gorse , and hills like half-shorn sheep with a fleece of trees on their backs ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked terrible from the outside -- a dingy gray farmhouse with high walls and small dark windows , and the hall was full of revolting olcographs of The Wedding Morn and Baby 's First Prayer and the storming of Majuba Hill . But Alice pushed open a door and said : " My God , a bar ! " They both fell in love with that bar at first sight  --  a low ceiling , walls out of plumb , a fire in the grate , and four fat barrels cocked up behind the counter . There was nobody behind the counter , so Mike pressed the bell , and after a while a short sandy man of fifty came in and said : " Arrterrnoon , zur , arrterrnoon , ma'am , " in a voice like the way rough cider feels going down your throat . They each had a pint of ale and Mike said , " Set up another , barman . Say , what 's your name ? " It was Arrthurr . So Arrthurr set up two more pints and went off to fetch their luggage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , zur , " he said , " I 'm the boots here as well as the barman . " " I could n't let that old man clean my boots , " said Mike . " Do n't be absurd , " said Alice , " who do you think cleans them for you in London hotels ? " " I thought the brownies did . " " Brownie yourself , " said Alice . " Let 's have a game of darts . " She beat him three times and then went upstairs to unpack . He rang the belt and the hotelkeeper came in , a farmer with manure on his boots . They got talking and Mike said , " I suppose you 're a native of these parts ? " " Oh , no , " said the hotelkeeper. " 1 coom from Silvercombe . " " Where 's that ? " " Ah , Silvercombe would be matter of mile and ' arrf from ' ere . " That night the bar was full of those deep , soft , burring cider voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pint glasses passed over the counter full of yellow cider and brown ale , a steady stream of darts flew across the light in threes , like birds in migration They thudded softly in the colored cork of the board , and the wooden ball hanging on a string toppled the table skittles with a hypnotic rattle . At nine o'clock the innkeeper switched on the B.B.C. news . Deep in Devon , the announcer 's English sounded like foreign speech . Afterward , from the shadowy benches , polished by generations of rustic backsides , the undulating voices rolled out their comments and philosophies , with pauses between , like the slow puffs of the pipes . " South Wales again last night , then . Thought as it were . ' Eered them planes goin ' over yer steady all night long . They flies over yer on way to Wales , ee know , zur . Do say as one were brought down in Devon few nights back . Good dart that were , Sammy . " " Fifteen double top for to get for game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these parts . Would n't get no coop of tea from us yolks , I tell ee . " " Ah . Like to see un try invasion on this coast too . We 'd deal with un as Devon men dealt with Spanish Armada . " " Ah . Swing un round more , Joe . Ee 'll not get king pin that way . " " I 'll get un all right . Spanish Armada did n't have they Tommy guns and tanks , did they though ? " They went up to bed feeling mellow . Peace dripped over the moorlands like the dew . Night-birds called somewhere in the combe that carried the river to the sea . Mist dimmed the moon . Around midnight an air-raid siren wailed out over the downs from the town miles away , and later they heard the throb of German bombers going over to raid the industrial towns of South Wales , just across the Bristol Channel from this North Devon coast . But it seemed a long way away . He woke before sunrise and went down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then out through the mud of the farmyard and the soaking bracken of the hillsides . The mist shredded away , and he saw the rabbits lolloping through the fern by the mossy brookside . He got in two barrels at onebunch that had a long way to run to their burrows , and hit three of them . As he was sloshing along on the fringe of the woods through the wet branches and brambles Alice came up to him . She looked fine ; her cheeks were pink and her eyes shining . She was pleased when he shot two more , but when they came up to them the smell of the blood reminded her of the air-raids , so he laid the gun on a stone fence and they went walking up on the rise of the moor , watching the early birds come out with the early sun on their feathers . It was good . Everything smelt alive . The wild violets and primroses were shaking as the dew rolled out of them , and the white flowers on the hedges were just beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back wet to the knees and ate breakfast in a dining room full of more oleographs ; but they were only funny now . It was n't much of a breakfast for hungry people , what with the rationing , but they got along fine ; not talking much , just watching the sun color up the wallflowers in the garden and now and then smiling at each other as though they had had breakfast together for years . Afterward they walked along a road that wound over the hills high above the shore . Shaggy sheep were grazing in the green fields inside the hedges and stone fences , and the larks went up like autogyros . The sun came out hot , and after about six miles they sat on a stone on the crest of a hill and let the sea breeze cool them . Beyond the last fields the sheep picked their way over rock ledges and steep slopes covered with gorse . It was all in flower , deep yellow , a hot color like the smell of honey . " It blooms somewhere or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why they have an old country saying : ' Kissing 's out of season when gorse is not in bloom . ' " Across the sea they could make out the dim coast of Wales . Far below them they could see the shore , all tumbled rocks and boulders , with the big head-lands jutting out like rearing horses . Inland , the downs rolled and the moor stretched out to the horizon . Ahead , down the winding road , they could see a small village ; white walls , thatched roofs , and a church with ) a square gray tower . " Do you know what ? " said Mike . " In a village like that ? " " What ? " " I 'll bet there 'd be a pub . " " I thought for a minute you were being poetic . " " I am . " There was a pub , all right  --  no bar , but a whitewashed stone room with two oak settles and a bench . They had a pint of ale and wandered back along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside . Great gulls with gray backs and white bellies came sailing over and planed down to the sea at a dizzy angle , their wings half folded and motionless . " You call yourself a flier , " she said . " I 'd like to see you do that . " " I know , " he said . " I often wish I had wings . Real wings . Imagine now if we had . We could just take off , with a kick , and soar away straight to ? " " Where ? " " That bar of ours . " They got back in time for lunch . In the afternoon they took a bus to a town on the top of the cliffs and rode down a steep cliff railway in a little green car . There was a little seaside village at the bottom with fishermen in blue jerseys doing things to their boats . They walked on along the shore . It had no sand , but all smooth pebbles , gray , blue , and pink and purple , from wrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressed among the rocks and swam . It was cold . They came out and lay on a rock in the sun . The sky was blue and the gulls screamed around them . A lugger tacked up the channel , but nothing else moved . The cliff that towered above them was all bright green , with grass and ferns and trees . From over the channel they heard the noise of aircraft , and every now and then the thump of gunfire . They did n't know whether it was a raid or practicing , or what . But it all seemed a long way off , and the blitz in London seemed like something way back in history . They lay for a long time without talking much and then they started talking quite a lot . It got round to personal things , and she told him she was divorced and her husband had the child . She had come over to England just before the war , after a holiday with the kid , and then she could n't get back . She had n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while they heard a bomber way up out of sight , heading down channel fast . He said he could n't tell if it was a Jerry . It did n't seem likely in daytime , but you never could tell . It might be reconnaissance . " What does it matter , " she said , " ours or theirs . It 's all senseless , anyway , all this killing , killing . . . . " " That is n't really exactly the way you feel , is it ? " " Yes , in a way it is . And yet if that plane came down in the channel now , and it was a German , and I had a chance . . . he 'd get no cup of tea out of me either . " When they got back to the fishing village the boats were coming in , and he asked would she like to go out fishing next day . She said yes , it would be fun . So he hired a boatman named flaws , a shrivelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly any teeth , but bright eyes like a gull . He was walking away when flaws called out to him : " Better pay ' posit , zur , if ee wants to make sure of un . There 's plenty after un . " He gave him a quid and they went home to the hotel , to dinner and darts and ale . In the night he could n't sleep . He dressed and was going out , but he saw that Alice 's light was on , and he knocked at her door and went in when she said to . She could n't sleep either . After all , she said , heather for asphalt and rocks for ruins does n't mean you get peace of mind just like putting a penny in a slot . She was right . This peace was so shallow . And yet it must mean something . If the two of them , strangers , each with plenty on the mind , could come down here and feel something in this country touching them , giving them back something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? And yet they could n't sleep . It was a problem . Naturally , he thought : how about if they slept together ? But that would n't be a solution . He knew about that already . The real solution was , if there was n't a war . Fine , but there was a war . The trouble was they did n't feel Churchillian . Oh , yes , they wanted to win ; they wanted to wipe the Nazis off the face of the earth . But Hell ! you ca n't wipe off Nazis with ferrying planes and running mobile canteens . It 's part of the war effort , yes . But how about the effort ? Is the effort okay , he wondered . Well , you ca n't do anything about that . You 've got to hope and try . But he did n't feel like trying any more , not by ferrying planes . If he could get in a Spitfire , and have a smack at them with those eight guns , then it would be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like taking time out Devonshire , this country that was the peaceful , enduring country every man wanted , this was doing something to both of them . It ought to make both of them want to go back and fight , but somehow it did n't do it . When you 've been through a lot you can go on fighting , but it 's hard to go on thinking . " What do you figure , Alice , this country 's doing to us ? " " England ? " " No , Devonshire . " " I never was much on countries . I would n't care if this was Kent , or Luxemburg , or Kansas . . or Nor-mandy . " " Alice , you ca n't be cosmopolitan when there 's a war on . " " You ca n't he anything else . It 's the world against the Nazis . " " Then how do you account for the way we feel down here ? " " Only that since we came here we 've both felt different . We do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like being in another world . We 've slipped out of war into peace . We ca n't think the same any more . Maybe we should n't have come . " " You 're telling me . And yet if we had n't . . . " " I know . " " Alice , " he said , " maybe we ought to relax . " " The bar 's closed . " " I know . I did n't mean that . " " I know . I know what you mean . " " Well ? " She did n't say anything , lying there on the pillows , with her hair all anyway . He leaned over and kissed her . " Mike , " she said , " what do you do about that sort of thing ? " " There is n't any that sort of thing , " he said . " This is you and me . " " AI/ right , " she said . " If you think it would help at all . " He did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the stone pier at noon , and Daws was waiting . There was n't any bait , he said ; you could n't buy fish any more except for food . So they trolled with red rubber imitation worms , running down the coast from headland to headland , and going in now and then to pick up a lobster pot . They did n't get any fish , but they got three lobsters , and Mike bought the lot from the fisherman for five shillings ; which was something . You 'd pay God knows what for them in London . That was a lovely coast . The headlands towered sheer from the sea , bold , green , and overpowering , and in between there were wild black masses of rocks and little beaches with one or two bathers basking ; unreal , bright colored figures from some lost age of peace . Mike said it was the finest coast he had seen , and he meant it . Daws said , in his strange idiom of comparing things to something else unknown : " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he added : " You know ; all natural , nothing made . " " Nothing made , " said Mike . " I get that . I like it . " Finally Alice said she was sick of that kind of fishing , and Mike said how about cruising over the channel , down by the coast of Wales , and it seemed good to him to cruise along the coast of an unknown country . Alice said all right , and Daws said that would cost them another two pounds . So they set off across the Bristol Channel , and ran down under low cliffs and a dark line of hills , and smoke was going up from a factory somewhere ; but it all seemed very unreal , as life on the land always seems from the sea , and as life at sea always seems from the land . It had been clouding up ever since they lifted the last lobster pot , and it had meant tricky steering to get it up , at that . It kept on clouding up and the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shook them , even out there at sea . The fisherman was all hunched up over the tiller , and when they asked him what was the matter , he said he had toothache , bad . He had only about five teeth left and could n't hold his pipe ; so he 'd been smoking Mike 's Luckies all afternoon . But one of his last teeth was aching and he was all in . He lay down up in the bows , and Mike took over the tiller and the engine . It was easy , but he did n't know the waters or the tides . Daws lay huddled up like a small dog asleep , small and pathetic in his blue jersey and cap , his brown face wrenched with the pain , even in sleep . Mike thought he 'd better turn the boat for home . The currents were funny all right and the clouds were low . It was almost dark , although it was early in the summer evening . They headed across the Channel toward where Mike had figured the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the drone of planes . It grew and got savage . A lot of planes were about and they were flying fast . They heard machine-gun fire above the clouds  --  and it was n't very far up . And then they heard a big plane coming , diving down through the clouds away from pursuers . " This is a Jerry , " said Mike . It was . It came in sight , a good way off up the Channel , a long black Dornier , flying despairingly low . There were Spitfires after it , but they had lost it in the clouds . Suddenly the war seemed a good deal nearer . They were still a long way from the Devon coast , and Daws was unconscious , with sleep or pain , or both . Mike steered for where he had fixed on as the port , and watched the Dornier come nearer . Suddenly he saw it let go its bombs , the whole rack at once . They burst in the sea , a good way off still , but near enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the long plane shot down toward them , still losing height , and as it passed over they heard the machine guns go . The Nazi pilot was all out to escape , but the gunner thought he might as well have a pay-off , even if it was only a fishing boat . He was a good shot or lucky . The bullets hissed on the sea and rattled on the motor boat , all along from stem to stern . Daws gave a jump like a rabbit and then curled ? up , a little more clumsily than lie had lain before . Alice called out in fear and then sat back . The engine made ugly noises and then was silent . The plane flew away and there they were , with no engine , a long way from the coast . Mike had a look at the motor ; it was all right . The petrol tank was smashed . Daws had at least one bullet through him . He was bleeding and still unconscious , but alive . " Are you all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " she said . " I 'm going to row , " he told her . She said she would take an oar . Each took an oar . It was heavy . He cursed the dead weight of the useless engine . He cursed the dead weight of Daws too ; but the wounded man was alive ; they had to get him to port . Pulling in the bows , he watched Mice 's bare back straining . She had a bathing suit on , to get the sun , and she had got it plenty . She was red-brown . Her arms were slim but her shoulders were strong . They pulled together , and the current now seemed to be with them . He did n't understand these seas at all . The clouds had lifted and the sky was blue . There were no more planes and the gulls came wheeling down . Only the creak of the rowlocks and the futile struggles of the lobsters in the tin . pail broke the quiet sound of the sea . They got to port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lifeboat man there and he helped Mike to lift Daws out and on to a stretcher . Mike asked Alice if she would be all right , and she said yes . She sounded very tired . They carried Daws to his cottage , and somebody went to fetch the doctor . When the doctor came he said Daws would be all right . Two in the thigh , he had , and one on the shoulder . Mike asked would he come along to the boat There was a girl there who had been rowing too hard . She seemed to be all in . The doctor came along . Alice was lying down across the boat . The doctor had a look at her and said she was dead . She had a bullet somewhere in the stomach and an internal hemorrhage . . . and of course the strain of rowing . . . Mike went up to his room at the hotel . There was a telegram there from Harry Forbes , the fellow who had been trying to wangle it to get him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could join up as soon as he liked . He filled in the form and sent it off with a telegram to Forbes . They had Alice in the hospital mortuary but he did n't go to see her . He went down and sat on the edge of the cliff and looked along the coast that Daws had said was " more natural like . . . nothing made . " Sunset threw up the headlands in fierce , impressive relief . Late in the evening , as the light was dying , an air-raid siren wailed . He thought about flying a Spitfire and firing eight guns together .
