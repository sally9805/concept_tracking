Manhattan 's tabloid News educates more people-and knows it-than any college in the country . For one thing , its single editorial column is written in a hoarse , impudent lingo that every one of its readers ( 2,275,000 on weekdays and 4,375,000 on Sundays ) can understand . One day this week the News 's editorial headline bazooed : IT AI N'T THE LENGTH , IT 'S THE OBSCURITY . The News was barking in sidewalk scholars for a two-minute lesson on the use of the English language . <P> Some reader , it seemed , had yapped that the News , which loves to scoff at " big $7 words , " had itself been guilty lately of such windy words as " intolerable , " " incompatibility , " " vulnerable , " and " genocide . " Asked the reader : " Ai n't going highhat on us , be ye ? " <P> " Nope , " the News swore , " we ai n't . " Then it pointed out that a four-letter word is n't necessarily simpler than a twelve-letter word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd call real $7 words , and would n't use here at this time without explanation : adit , erg , ergo , ohm , gloze , cozen , griff , modal , mure , snash , viable . " On the other hand , the News thought that most of its readers would understand fairly longish ones like " intolerable " ( though " unbearable " was better ) , or " incompatibility " ( because of divorce cases ) , or " vulnerable " ( because of bridge being so popular ) . The News conceded that it should have explained " genocide . " <P> Since the subject had come up , it seemed a good time to list a few of the " big , fat blimps of words " the News was really against : puff balls like " quadripartite , " " unilateral " and " directive . " " Why the boys ca n't just say ' four-party , ' ' one-sided ' and ' order ' is beyond us . . . " <P> The real object of the kind of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say things so the public can understand them at a glance , " without having to go grubbing into a dictionary to find out what in the blue blazes you are trying to say .
