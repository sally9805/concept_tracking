Some of the Negro congregation began to murmur the words of the hymn the choir was singing , " How sweet it is to know Him , Jesus Christ divine . " Slowly choir and congregation began to sway and clap and stomp to the rhythm . People in the audience jiggled and jounced up &; down shouting " Oh Lord , tell a story ! " A mother pushed her child from her lap , crying " Oh Jesus , I 'll fly away ! " <P> The powerful , primitive singing of its huge ( 203 voices ) Echoes of Eden choir had been bringing in new members to Los Angeles ' stuccoed St. Paul Baptist Church at the rate of 18 a day . It now takes five cops to control Sunday crowds that jam the street out in front to listen over a loudspeaker ( and six nurses inside for worshipers who get too wrought-up ) . The choir 's weekly radio program is broadcast to 17 states . Two months ago Capitol Records began putting the choir on wax . <P> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Temptation and I 'm So Glad Jesus Lifted Me , were sellouts . <P> Black-robed Choirmaster J. Earle Hines* took over a scraggly group of 60 voices a year and a half ago . He picked his new singers on the old religious credo that who sings well prays doubly . Says he : " I tell my folks they got to feel the spirit inside before they can sing it out . Spirituality covers up for voice . " <P> Few of the singers , many of them housewives , can read music . They sing with none of the trickiness and polish of professional Negro groups like the Hall Johnson Choir . Sure-fire " lifter " at St. Paul is Hines 's setting of the Lord 's Prayer . The choir chants the first line in unison , adding more harmony with each new line . The screaming climax leaves the church shuddering . Says Hines : " We do n't sing to entertain . We sing to lift . " <P> * No kin to famed Jazz Pianist Earl ( " Father " ) Hines .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
