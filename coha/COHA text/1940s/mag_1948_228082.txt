It had been eight years , but Paris had not forgotten its Jennie Tourel . Last week , when she showed up backstage at the red-velvet-and-gold Opera-Comique ( where she won her first success 15 years ago ) , the chorus crowded around her with excited greetings . Said Jennie , who began wowing U.S. concert audiences after she got out of France in 1940 : " This is so moving . I remember how I felt the first time I sang Carmen-I did n't know what was going on . This time , I have it under control . " <P> She also had the audience under control . The sell-out house gave her an ovation before she could sing a note . In a Goya-like gown of red brocaded satin , with a red Spanish comb in her black hair , Jennie gave them a Carmen who was fiery and flirtatious . Her voice was no bigger than ever , but it had a new flavor and richness . She took half a dozen curtain calls before the audience would let her go . Backstage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vraie Carmen !
