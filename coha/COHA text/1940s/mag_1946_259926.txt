Peace was a clamor , a quest , a foreboding struggle . But politicians and publicists accounted for nearly all the news . Seldom had the people been quieter than in the months before V-E day , 1946 . Even where " popular " demonstrations occurred ( in Detroit , or Trieste , or Cairo ) they had a manipulated look as of soldiers marshaled for parade . While their leaders made history , what went on among the people for whom ( and ultimately by whom ) history is made ? Their leaders were concerned ( perhaps necessarily ) with remote and technical matters-U.N. procedures , boundaries , interest rates on international loans ; from what was said and done in high places , it was not easy to learn much about the world 's two billion inconspicuous humans . <P> TIME correspondents tried to find how it was with the people in the first year of peace and in the middle of what had been heralded as a century of plenty . The evidence they produced this week ( see below ) indicated that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because they were tired and confused and , above all , hungry . <P> Winston Churchill went to Aberdeen in Scotland last week and spoke of the peace in terms the people understood well and bitterly : <P> " There never was a time when breathing space was more needed , a blessed convalescence , a truce of God and man . " But , he said , " this is a time when hatred is rife in the world , when many branches of the human family , victors or vanquished , innocent or guilty , are plunged in bewilderment , distress or ruin . The world is very ill . . . . Mankind can not in its present plight bear new shocks without descending to altogether cruder and primordial forms . " <P> Peace was the sickly hatred Churchill described , and peace was other things : the Colonel Blimpish British mine owner who looked forward to the return of unemployment as a cure for the contagion of absenteeism ( sometimes 40 percent ) which broke out whenever big sports events nearby attracted his work-weary miners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field on which a tank rusted , near Saint-L , Normandy ( see cut ) ; the profound , silent distrust of eleven-year-old Filomena Carciopoli , of Puzzuoli , Italy , who sullenly concealed her starving seven-month-old sister under a bed so they could not take the baby to a hospital . <P> Amid such concerns the people 's will pressed lightly , if at all , upon the shaping of the new world . But what the people suffered quietly now would in time emerge as history more formidable than the alarms fretting the headlines in the first spring of peace . <P> Less Bread for Britain <P> Day after day the average Briton wakes up to a breakfast of tea and toast with butter or margarine from a seven-day allowance of some six ounces . Once a week he may have an egg . Twice a week , a 1-oz. piece of bacon . Twice a week , porridge . <P> His evening meal ( high tea ) consists of fish ( cod , sardines , herring ) or a bit of cheese , tea and crackers . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's big meal ( Sunday dinner ) a British housewife can pool her family 's meat ration ( 25 worth per person ) for a roast , served with potatoes , limp lettuce , cauliflower or cabbage , and steamed pudding . But dinner for the rest of the week must be leaner . Sample menus :
