RICHARD HALLIBURTON-His Story of His Life 's Adventure-Bobbs-Merrill ( $3.75 ) . <P> When , at the age of 22 , Richard Halliburton lawlessly hid in the shrubbery , watched the Taj Mahal and his chance by moonlight , and swam in the lily-padded pool , he was neither putting on a show nor concocting copy : he was simply a college boy on the loose , a little bit crazy with romantic enthusiasm . <P> When , three years later , he wrote " Monday I was free to climb over the darned walls and spend a night alone in the Parthenon , " a lot of water had gone under the bridge . His Royal Road to Romance was a raving bestseller , and Richard 's whole trip was a professional set piece : a stunt following-out of the wanderings of Ulysses . <P> These episodes and the change of spirit that took place between them may be understood from Halliburton 's letters home , of which this volume is a selection . The stunts , it is obvious , became more &; more staged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the naivete which made it possible for him to invent them was also nearly great enough to exonerate him of their ridiculousness , their frantic commercialism . His last stunt - a voyage across the Pacific in a Chinese junk , which ended somewhere at sea - was of a piece with all the rest . <P> Halliburton was something more than a bad writer , a rather hard-to-take public figure . He was an appealing , confused individual , a U. S. phenomenon , a U. S. symbol . The nice son of a nice U. S. environment , he never entirely either out grew or betrayed it . He was essentially , if mildly , an artist and a rebel , he achieved neither art nor rebellion . He was an innocent sort of Byron-of-his-time . <P> The first half of this book , full of the breathless excitement of a child , is a moving record of this innocence . From there on it toughens and saddens . Richard was crazy for fame , and he became , scarcely realizing it , the captive and corruptive salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It is as easy to laugh off Richard Halliburton as it ever was ; and this book could easily be regarded merely as one last bid to the fans . But as a record of an eager human life , and of the relations of that life to its parents and its planet , it is a touching tale .
