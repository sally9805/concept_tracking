HIGH JUNGLE ( 379 pp. ) - William Beebe-Duell , Sloan &; Pearce ( $4.50 ) . <P> Whether or not William Beebe 's discoveries put him among the great naturalists , his best books have as much charm and descriptive power as anything of the sort since Darwin 's Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle . In Beebe 's career , High Jungle covers the Venezuelan phase , which began in 1945 after Beebe had abandoned his underseas adventures ( during which he had successfully stared sharks out of countenance ) * and returned to the job he loved best , the study of the jungle . <P> In the subtropical mountain rain forest , or " high jungle , " of Venezuela , Beebe 's zoologist-assistant Jocelyn Crane ran across a fantastic concrete hotel building that had been left to molder unfinished after the death , in 1935 , of its builder , Dictator Juan Vicente Gmez . If Rancho Grande was in the jungle , the jungle was also in Rancho Grande-nesting in its crevices , pattering and pullulating in its chambers , making every wall " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Venezuelan government and the support of the New York Zoological Society and the Creole Petroleum Corp. , the Beebe expedition moved in . <P> A gasoline generator gave them light , and drying facilities for their laboratory and clothes . Investigating the riot of fungus , lichens , molds , smuts and mildews that festooned the place , Beebe discovered Protozoa , Coelenterata , Platyhelminthes , Nemathelminthes , and Rotifera , and was certain of the existence of Mollusca , Oligochaeta , Hirundinea and Arthropoda . <P> " Each of the above nine groups , " he tells the reader gently , " under modern scientific classification , are distinct major Phyla , - whereas we , and all our backboned brethren on the earth , from angelfish to apes , are all included in the single Phylum Vertebrata or Chordata . " <P> To get a laugh from Venezuelan vertebrates in the neighborhood , Beebe and company put up a sign reading " LABORATORIO : MANICOMO , " i.e. , bughouse . Some of the natives watched with great interest as Beebe experimented with such insects as the Hercules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smallest mammals and fight with their horns like embittered rhinoceroses . Though ocelots hunted by night in the rooms of the Rancho Grande , and army ants on the march once had to be diverted from the laboratory by 20 gallons of flaming gasoline , Beebe firmly maintains that the jungle was as safe as a church . During the three years , 1945 , 1946 and 1948 , he experienced nothing worse than a broken leg - from a fall off a ladder . <P> For close observation Beebe ( who will be 72 July 29 ) , liked to squat motionless as a stump in the forest or sit for hours on the limb of a tree . For long-range work he used giant binoculars mounted on a tripod ; with these he could make out the scent gland of the hind leg of a butterfly a quarter of a mile away . " I often wondered , " he says , in a sentence of purest Beebe , " what the soaring vultures , looking down , made of this strange creature with great tubular eyes and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often been misquoted about sharks . He respects them , having once found a man 's arm in a shark 's stomach .
