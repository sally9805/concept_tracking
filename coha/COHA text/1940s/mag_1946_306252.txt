When the National Labor Relations Board opened the door to the unionization of foremen a year ago , it timidly kept the night chain on . The foremen , said NLRB , could only join independent unions of their own . NLRB was plainly unwilling to divorce foremen completely from management by permitting them to join rank- &-file; labor unions . <P> Last week NLRB boldly threw the door wide open as it ordered an election to determine whether supervisory employes of Jones &; Laughlin 's Vesta-Shannopin Coal Division should be represented by the United Mine Workers . <P> If the new NLRB ruling stands , against the appeal which coal operators were preparing to make to the courts , the foremen 's unions will have reached their goal . U.S. industry can get ready to be organized by the unions " right up to the vice presidents . "
