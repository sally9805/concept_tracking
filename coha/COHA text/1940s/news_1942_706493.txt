txt Joseph Schmid , 2537 West 50th street , turned ' up at the coast guard recruiting station yesterday looking like a tailor 's nightmare : His . shirt collar was several sizes too large , his coat hung in ' loose folds and his trousers were threatening to become an avalanche . But Schmid was smiling for he tipped the scale at only 160 pounds , which is acceptable for coast guard enlistment standards . Six weeks previously Schmid had stood on the same scale and ember. rassedly watched it point to 198 . When the recruiting officer shook his head . Schmid went to see his doctor . who told ' him to cut out gravy , pastry , sugar , - fat meat , starches , and butter and drink no more than five glasses of liquid a day . . yesterday Schmid reapplied for enlistment at the recruiting office . Medical examiners said he was in good physical condition and he was accepted . He is 26 years old and stands 5 feet 10 inches tall .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
