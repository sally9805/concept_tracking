Stars &; Stripes turned an angry soldier 's eye on " the psychoneurosis fad which is sweeping the country and which is based on the belief that every returning veteran is maladjusted . . . . " <P> Said the G.I. 's newspaper of home-front goings-on : <P> " Every screwball with thick lenses and a long haircut is setting up shop as an expert on the returning veteran . If you wife or sweetheart runs behind a good , solid oak table when you finally go bounding in the front door , do n't say we did n't warn you . " <P> Many men , Stars &; Stripes agreed , will be real psychoneurotic casualties , in need of scientific treatment , but for the great majority : <P> " We will be happy to sit in front of our fireplaces and let our wives and sweethearts fetch us Old-Fashioneds and fried chicken . But not , please God , with the look of a trapped and frightened doe , waiting for the blow to fall . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
