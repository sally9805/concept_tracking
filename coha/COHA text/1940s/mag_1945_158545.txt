Chicagoans have learned to put up with many a civic stench , but by September , 1944 , some of them could no longer stand the smell of their public-school administration . They called on the National Education Association , lumbering but potent watchdog representing some 900,000 U.S. teachers , to investigate . But when N.E.A. 's investigators appeared , they were brusquely told to devote themselves instead " to making some contribution to the war and defense effort . " For the first time anywhere , N.E.A. was barred from public school records and classes . <P> N.E.A. went ahead with its investigation as best it might , last week reported its findings . Although closed doors still hid most of the evidence , the investigators had learned enough to compile the most damning report in N.E.A. 's 75-year history . <P> Teachers Overruled . Chicago 's school system began to go wrong , charged N.E.A. , soon after James B. McCahey , a coal dealer and cog in Mayor Ed Kelly 's machine , was named president of the school board in 1933 . It got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1936 . McCahey and Johnson went to work first on Chicago Teachers College , a public school adjunct which has a monopoly on the training of all the city 's elementary teachers . <P> In 1936 , the pair demoted able , honest Butler Laughlin from the presidency of the college to a high-school job because , the report said , he could not be " controlled " and once refused to falsify a student 's grades at McCahey 's request . Soon McCahey and Johnson began influencing grades without reference to teachers , wangling admissions for incompetent applicants , giving teaching jobs to friends . A city councilman 's daughter who had been asked by her teachers to leave was awarded a teaching certificate after flunking 15 hours of class work . <P> In August 1943 , N.E.A. said , 21 members of the college faculty were summarily fired and 21 others demoted . One of the latter was Raymond M. Cook , a veteran of 20 years of teaching and school administration in Chicago . Turned down for a principal 's certificate six years earlier because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third grade post at $1,500 cut in salary . Last year he quit to go to work in a war plant . <P> Spies &; Terror . In the lower schools , the report found the McCahey-Johnson control even tighter . Superintendent Johnson , whose back porch was dynamited last autumn ( TIME , Oct. 2 ) , was reported to have boasted of his spy system and its 24-hour service . <P> In 1942 , N.E.A. charged , he again demoted Butler Laughlin to make room for one of McCahey 's relatives . On less than a day 's notice , he pushed competent Mrs. Olive P. Bruner out of the top job in a school for crippled children , replaced her with the sister of a Federal judge . In one 75-day period last fall , Johnson transferred over 600 teachers , in many cases as punishment or to make room for friends .
