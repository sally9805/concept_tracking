THE DIARY OF A WRITER ( 1,097 pp. ) - Feodor Dostoevsky-Scribner ( $12.50 ) . <P> <P> One day in 1872 , Feodor Dostoevsky , then 51 and already famous as the author of Crime and Punishment , decided to become a newspaperman again . He had tried it before , without much success . In fact , journalism was a bad choice for a man who needed all the elbow room of the Russian novel for self-expression . But Dostoevsky felt full of miscellaneous ideas and Messianic urges , and besides , he needed the money . When the aristocratic and crotchety Prince Meshchersky offered him a job as editor of The Citizen ( salary : 250 rubles a month ) , Dostoevsky accepted . <P> He soon regretted the decision . He hated the work : getting out the sheet each week , rewriting the prince 's pompous , half-literate articles , churning out copy for his own column , " The Diary of a Writer . " And though The Citizen whooped it up for Czar and Russia , Dostoevsky found himself in several scrapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 48 hours for having violated a bureaucratic regulation . <P> In the summer his job was particularly hateful ; without his family , which was in the country , Dostoevsky felt lost . He suffered from nightmares in which his little girl was flogged to death as she piteously cried , " Mamochka ! Mamochka ! " His only solace was a girl who read proof for The Citizen . They would sit up late , reading galleys over a kerosene lamp and arguing about God and Russia . Sometimes he would explode in fits of rage , pounding the table and shouting " The Antichrist is coming ! . . . The end of the world is near at hand ! . . . " <P> Somehow , Dostoevsky managed to edit The Citizen regularly all through 1873 . Early the following year he quit his job , but in 1876 he decided to launch Diary , an all-Dostoevsky monthly of his own . It appeared irregularly until shortly before his death , in 1881 . He wrote all the copy himself , from memorable criticisms of his contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business manager ; when an issue came out she drafted the family nursemaid or stray visitors to help mail it . <P> Image of a Writer . Next week The Diary of a Writer appears in English for the first time . It is one of those books that is alternately fascinating and dreary , tinglingly exciting and unendurably boring . Journalist Dostoevsky observed none of the rules ; he wrote about whatever he pleased at whatever length he pleased , and he wrote sloppily and badly , seldom troubling to whip his pieces into coherent shape . Diary is a vast jumble of rants , stories , articles , sketches , criticisms , polemics-some completely dated , some as fresh and troubling as The Brothers Karamazov.
