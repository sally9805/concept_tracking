Who is the Walking Man ? Lots of radio listeners thought that they knew , but nobody had even come close to guessing right-on the air . The point of the contest was to identify the mysterious man who walked past the mike each week , but said not a word . <P> By last week the Walking Man had broken some sort of record by passing up Miss Hush and strolling into his tenth week on Ralph Edwards ' Truth or Consequences ( Sat . 8:30 p.m. , NBC ) . The prizes had piled up to $22,500 worth of Cadillacs , home-freeze units , trips to Sun Valley . The American Heart Association was wallowing in contributions from would-be contestants ( last week they topped a million dollars ) , and the mail was terrific : 114,000 letters in one day last week . <P> The likeliest clues were the Walking Man 's hollow , echoing footfalls ( they sounded as though they might be coming from a vault ) , and the jingle : <P> Bing bong bell , It 's ten and only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name quite well . <P> The other clues were n't much help : the strains of Annie Laurie and Auld Lang Syne ; a neighing , galloping horse ( Eddie Cantor was a wrong guess ) ; cat yowls ; a horn tootling . Columnists and rocking-chair dopesters were certain they had it . Some of the " sure things " : Sir Harry Lauder , George Gallup , Mayor O'Dwyer , Jack Benny , Gene Tunney , All-America Fullback Doak Walker . <P> Edwards , who thought up all the clues himself , could n't understand why everybody missed " such easy hints . " He explained : " The original contest was started as a satire , to end all giveaways . " But the skyrocketing Hooperatings of Mrs. Hush ( Clara Bow ) and Miss Hush ( Martha Graham ) changed his thinking . After the Walking Man , he might try a " Walking Lady , a Baby Hush , or a Burping Baby . " The only trouble is " those other quiz shows that glommed on to the idea .
