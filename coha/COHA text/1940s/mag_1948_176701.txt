Red Gloves ( adapted from the French of Jean-Paul Sartre by Daniel Taradash ; produced by Jean Dalrymple ) reached Broadway figuratively picketed by the man who wrote it . Sartre had , on hearsay , denounced the U.S. version as a " vulgar , common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias " ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . Though he might justly complain of a translation and a production that ( except for Charles Beyer 's brilliant acting ) are pretty wooden , Red Gloves itself seems pretty typical Sartre . <P> The setting is a Middle European monarchy during World War II . Most of the play takes place in 1943 when the monarch , feeling that Hitler 's goose is cooked , is ready to talk turkey with the Social Democrats and Communists . Hoederer , the Communist leader ( Charles Boyer ) , believes that for tactical reasons the party should join in a coalition . To the party purists this is treason , and they install an idealistic young convert ( John Dall ) as Hoederer 's secretary , with orders to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife ( Joan Tetzel ) falls in love with Hoederer and informs on her husband . The husband finally kills Hoederer in a spasm of jealousy . <P> There is an ironic epilogue two years later when the Russians are about to take over the country . The coalition that the purists once abhorred they now themselves enter . Hoederer has become a party martyr , and his assassin a marked man . <P> Generally speaking , Red Gloves lacks bias-and takes on a certain breadth-by dealing with political types rather than political tenets , and by suggesting that it takes a good many kinds of people to make up even a Communist world . The essential struggle between idealist and realist , absolutist and compromiser , is indeed common to all movements ; what might be considered " anticommunist " about the play is its picturing a lack of charity that begins at home . <P> As playwriting , Red Gloves again reveals Sartre 's ability to melodramatize ideas , to make a story suddenly flash with " theater " or a speech with intensity . But Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , and never becomes impressive . Between the two extremes of which Sartre is master-the phony thrill and the incisive speech-lies a whole human world he barely grazes ; his situations ring hollow , his people seem paperbacked . Only Hoederer , in Actor Boyer 's fine portrayal , has shape or color ; indeed , the best of Red Gloves is what Boyer brings to it .
