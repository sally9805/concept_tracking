" Now , " said Pablo Picasso , announcing his conversion to Communism , " I have found my true country ! " That was three years ago . Last week , Moscow 's Pravda went out of its way to shout that in his true country Picasso is a prophet without honor-and , in art , a formalist to boot . Said Pravda : " The great October Socialist Revolution saved Russian art from a fate which has overtaken painting and sculpture together with other kinds of art in capitalist countries . There , debasing and formalist art represents man as a monster deprived of feeling and thought . . . and serves the selfish interests of the bourgeoisie , catering to their decadent and perverted tastes . . . . The Paris school of artists , which has long been unable to teach anyone anything ... is a striking example . . . . " <P> Pravda 's purpose : to purge Picasso , and fellow Modern Henri Matisse ( also rumored to be looking leftward ) , from Moscow studios . In Russia , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regiment , and now it seemed some of the younger Muscovite painters were going so far as to neglect their appointed tasks . Instead of Stalin in heroic poses and the Red cavalry charging through the snow , they yearned to paint gutted guitars , vodka bottles and pink , reclining nudes . <P> Pravda 's loud bark wound up with a warning : " Soviet realistic representational art is the most advanced art in the world . . . . Nevertheless , complacency would be a dangerous mistake . . . . Heirs of decayed formalistic bourgeois art of the West still poison the pure air of Soviet art and attempt to influence young Soviet artists . It is entirely inadmissible that alongside the art of Socialist realism there should exist tendencies represented by admirers of bourgeois decadent art who consider their spiritual teachers to be the French formalists , Picasso and Matisse . . . . " <P> Not all Frenchmen take Picasso 's Communism seriously . Said one of Picasso 's aperitif-sipping chums , on the terrace of the Cafe Flore , the other day : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolutionary to be a real Communist . "
