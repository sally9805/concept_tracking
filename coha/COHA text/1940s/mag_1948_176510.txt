Instead of ripping into Harry Truman for I'affaire Vinson , Tom Dewey decided to let the President 's action speak for itself . It was good judgment and good politics . He would gain both votes and stature by refusing to follow Truman 's lead in playing politics with the nation 's foreign policy . <P> For the record , Dewey said simply and reassuringly that the U.S. is solidly behind " the labors of our bipartisan delegation at Paris and specifically its insistence on a prompt lifting of the blockade of Berlin . " Said Dewey : " The nations of the world can rest assured that the American people are in fact united in their foreign policy and will firmly and unshakably uphold the United Nations . . . " <P> Then Dewey was off again for a week 's tour of nine states in the East and Midwest . The one big issue he had not yet touched was labor . Now , in the steel capital of Pittsburgh , he took it up . <P> Newsmen had expected that he might use the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with victory in the air , why should he make any more promises ? " Labor has its special problems , " said Dewey . " But these problems have not been solved . . . by separating labor from the rest of America . " He reminded labor that Republicans had voted for the Wagner Act , voted against Harry Truman 's plan to draft the railroad strikers , that both parties had supported the Taft-Hartley law . <P> He made a few specific promises : an increased minimum wage , broadened and increased social-security benefits , a strengthened Department of Labor , vigorous antitrust enforcement , action to " break the log jam in housing " and to halt " soaring prices . " But he left labor still wondering what Taft-Hartley changes , if any , he would propose . Said Dewey : " The new law is not perfect . No law , or any other human handiwork is perfect . It can always be improved and wherever and whenever it needs change it will be changed . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
