txt It is impossible to foretell , as Congress gathers for its momentous session leading up to the presidential election of 1948 , what the fate of the Marshall Plan will be . The uncertainty is greater on this big program than over any other single issue on foreign affairs which the United States has faced since World War II . In scope and importance the issue equals . in many ways . the decision before America after World War I on the League of Nations . Though there is not today the same passionate political and personal bitterness that existed in 1919-1920 , the present omens against success of the Marshall program as sponsored by the White House are sufficiently forbidding . Analysis of votes in House and Senate taken on the emergency winter relief program for France , Italy , and Austria shows beyond doubt that there is a revival of Midwest isolationism . ? Powerful Republican leader Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , though he does not attack the Marshall Plan point-blank , apparently is bent on whittling it down so as to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tax Tide Running The strongest political tide now running in Congress is for tax reduction , on the theory that that is the best way to get re-elected , and it has the tacit backing of most of America 's editorial voices . Tax reduction , however , in the view of Representative Harold Knutson ( R ) of Minnesota , Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , is apt to be at the expense of foreign relief . The pending Knutson $5,600,000,000 tax-reduction bill will make approval of full amounts for the European Recovery Program that much harder , it would appear . " Instead of fitting tax reduction into foreign relief , " Mr. Knutson said , " we should fit such relief into tax reduction , and this probably will be done . " Furthermore , there is now a new left-wing attack on the Marshall Plan , from the odd political group led by Henry Wallace . Mr. Wallace favors international relief paid by the United States , under the auspices of the United Nations . But since , under the circumstances , foreign aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace alternative is not actually an alternative at all , and becomes a device for killing the Marshall program . Dubious Picture Any plan as huge as the Marshall program is bound to encounter plenty of obstacles , and those which have been raised as Congress meets ultimately may be overcome . Nevertheless , it must be recorded that the picture , as the session starts , seems dubious to ob  --  tervers of the legislative scene . One big preliminary fight is over the administration of the proposed ERP funds . Here the rival proposals are for a one-man administrator , recommended by the State Department , bowing to the State Department on matters of foreign policy , and the eight-man administrative Board , proposed by Representative Christian A. Herter ( R ) of Massachusetts , and supported by many Republican leaders , which would be more responsive to congressional direction . Representative Charles A. Eaton ( R ) of New Jersey , Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , has taken . issue with the Herter plan , thereby running counter to many leaders of his own Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - " I can not conceive of any way in which an independent agency can be established to handle our foreign relations without invading the constitutional duties of the Chief Executive . " Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg ( R ) of Michigan appears to be seeking to turn - the edge of other Republican leaders ' support for the Herter versus White House proposal , by the unusual expedient of submitting the whole matter for guidance to an outside , civilian agency , the Brookings Institution of Washington , which will report on the relative advisability of the two proposals . Senator Taft and others who have hitherto backed the Herter view welcome this proposal . A Democratic view was expressed here by Senator Torn Connally ( D ) of Texas , who said : " Republican efforts to divorce Marshall Plan spending from the State Department would lead only to a Russian victory over President Truman . " Doubt Expressed The dobbt that exists even among the strongest supporters of ERP was voiced , just before Congress met , by Mr. Eaton , in commenting upon the probable timetable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Eaton declared " if we get it through by June we 'll be fortunate . " Basically there is still strong belief that some form of foreign relief will be approved by Congress . The question is , how much , when , and by whom administered . Geographical distribution of the votes against winter relief in Senate and House showed ( 1 ) stronger opposition among Republicans than Democrats ; and ( 2 ) concentration of GOP opposition in the Midwest . For example . the Senate on Nov. 26 defeated , 56 to 30 , the Malone amendment to curtail the amount of interim-aid relief . Of the 30 who voted to diminish foreign aid by cutting the amount , 20 were Republicans , 10 Democrats , and the bulk of the Republicans came from the Midwest . I:hen the interim-aid bill passed the House , 82 votes were cast against i , t , of which 55 came from Midwest Republicans , 40 of the latter from Illinois , Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , and Missouri .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
