" In saying good-by to baseball forever . . . I leave it to the public and to my friends to decide whether I was wrong or the rule was wrong . . . . Good luck and good-by to everyone . . . . " <P> Whether or not they were affected by this affecting farewell , the public and William Drought Cox 's few friends in baseball were virtually unanimous : the ex-owner of the Phillies was wrong ; the rule was right ; organized baseball was harsh but just in barring him from the game forever . Cox 's crime : he had made " a few small and sentimental bets on my team to win . " <P> The Reason . Kicking Owner Cox out of baseball was the most drastic step aging ( 77 ) Kenesaw Mountain Landis had had to take in his 23 years as autocrat of baseball . He declared Cox " permanently ineligible " to hold any office in the major or minor leagues . The lank-haired , obtrusively autocratic old Federal Judge had been put in his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly ruined baseball when the Chicago White ( " Black " ) Sox threw the 1919 World Series for gamblers ' bribes : it was a jarring blow to the public 's confidence in baseball as a sport . <P> The 9-month big-league career that ended last week with the fall of the stick had started like a rocket ( TIME , July 5 ) . <P> Young ( 33 ) , wealthy ( Manhattan lumber companies and marriage ) and blatantly self-confident , Bill Cox had bought the Phillies after they had finished last or next to last for ten years , were all but bankrupt and the joke of the National League . <P> Fatal Firing . With a handful of mediocre ballplayers , one or two stalwarts and ex-Boy Wonder Bucky Harris as manager , he tub-thumped his team until he got the nickname " Rah Rah " Cox . For no apparent reason , the Phillies won some games ; until the end of May they were in the first division and the gate boomed . <P> Suddenly Cox fired Harris - newspapers were notified 24 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League President Ford Frick over two protested games , quadrupled his own salary to $20,000 , and hired " Fat Freddy " Fitzsimmons , spunky , good-natured ex-Dodger pitcher , to manage the Phillies . They ended the season in seventh place , where Bucky Harris had said they belonged all the time . <P> Despite the Phillies ' best season in ten years , with attendance double 1942 's , the record showed many errors for Bill Cox . <P> He alienated fans , players and press . But the error that benched him was firing Bucky Harris . <P> Bucky had stumbled on Cox 's secretary phoning a bookie ; she volunteered the explanation that her boss was making almost daily bets . A week after Harris was sacked , his friends were telling Landis all they knew about the gambling . <P> The Witnesses . Landis listened to Cox 's ready denial , but went on with his investigation . Harris ' friends joyfully cooperated ; some hinted that the bets were not all small and not all on the Phillies . One tried to woo from Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting records . <P> New York Daily News sportswriter Dick McCann volunteered to Landis his knowledge of Cox 's gambling , most of which he got from Harris himself .
