Outside thousands of U.S. banks last week , queues of Americans waited to take part in the biggest war-bond redemption spree of the war . The rush came just before Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced a Sixth War Bond Drive , to start Nov. 20 , and promised a seventh . The queues were caused by the Treasury 's new redemption system , making bonds as easy to cash as Government checks . <P> Some citizens actually took the Treasury 's convenience measure to mean that they had to cash in their bonds . ( One Philadelphia matron called her bank to explain that she could not get down that day and to ask if she could still get her money next day . ) Some felt they need not hang on to their bonds any longer . One woman cashed in $1,000 worth " to bet on a race horse " ; another got $75 to do her Christmas shopping " before the rest of the women pick over everything . " A middle-aged couple cashed in $225 worth of bonds " to have a good time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By week 's end redemptions had leveled off to normal ( 1.04% per month of total holdings ) and it was apparent that the reasoning behind the cash-in-quick plan was sound . Formerly there was a delay of days or weeks before the citizen got his cash . The Treasury decided that if there were no such delay , people of small means would turn in bonds only when they actually needed cash . <P> While redemption-minded bondholders were rushing the banks , Frank Greene Dickinson , 45 , economics professor at the University of Illinois , needled their consciences . He suggested that each individual buy enough bonds to cover his share of the $200,000,000,000 war debt ( Dickinson 's estimate ) . * Then everyone would burn these bonds in a gigantic " bondfire " next July 4 , thereby wiping out the debt . <P> * Ohio 's Senator Robert Taft estimated last week that the U.S. debt will total $300,000,000,000 when the war ends , declared that if the U.S. hewed to a close budget the debt could be paid off ( at the rate of $1,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
