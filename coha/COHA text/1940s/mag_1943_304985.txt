Du Pont is cooking up surprises in nylon . So far nylon has been used mainly as a fiber - for stockings , toothbrushes , parachutes , aircraft tire cords , surgical sutures . But nylon is also a plastic of parts . Last week Du Pont reported some recent experiments with nylon as a solid plastic which would seem to indicate that after the war it may become almost as common and versatile an article as glass . <P> Nylon will have many plastic competitors . But it combines advantages of the two general types of plastics : as a thermoplastic it can be resoftened and reworked , but like thermosetting plastics , it is relatively resistant to heat . Its softening point is 450F. ( most thermoplastics melt at about 160F . ) . Nylon is also exceedingly light and tough , easily machined , impervious to oil , grease and the action of most solvents . <P> Du Pont 's preview of some nylon products : <P> &gt; Outdoor furniture ( it outwears rattan ) , cane seats for subways , trolleys and busses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plush , mohair ) , shower curtains , slip covers , window screens . <P> &gt; ' ' Lace " curtains that will not have to be dried on stretcher frames . <P> &gt; Tennis and badminton racket strings , fishing lines . <P> &gt; Zippers . <P> &gt; Paint brushes ( it lasts three times as long as pig bristles ) . Du Pont believes that nylon will be standard in tooth and hair brushes . <P> &gt; Shoes , handbags , luggage . <P> &gt; Insulating coating for electric wires . <P> &gt; Bearings which need only water for lubrication . <P> &gt; Tubing , for which nylon is extruded like macaroni .
