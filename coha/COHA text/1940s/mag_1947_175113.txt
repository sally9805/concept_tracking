Rudolf Francis Ferdinand Hoess , a stocky , 47-year-old Nazi , stood stolidly in Warsaw 's Supreme Court one day last week to hear his sentence . One of the court 's officials asked him : " How did it feel to run a murder plant which produced 4,000,000 corpses ? " Blandly , Hoess replied : " It was only 2,000,000 . " <P> Even by his own dilution of the blood on his hands , Hoess was history 's top killer , the master of mass atrocity . The number of lives he had taken in Germany 's horror camp at Auschwitz ( Oswiecim ) far exceeded the largest total in any historically accepted account of the world 's bloodiest massacres . The tolls of all the recorded pogroms did not add up to the 2,800,000 Jewish lives which ended at Auschwitz . <P> In his month-long trial Hoess denied none of Auschwitz 's horrors . He offered one sentence of defense : " All my actions resulted from orders which I received . " He was proud of having designed the gas chambers in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was proud of his efficiency . Told of Hermann Gring 's remark at Nrnberg that Hoess could not possibly have taken 2,000,000 lives , the exterminator sputtered : " That shows how little he knows about how we worked . Why , I could have done twice as much . " Hoess 's beady eyes did not flicker as the sentence was read . It was death , by hanging . He got a few days of reprieve . Polish law forbids execution , even of such as Hoess , during Holy Week .
