A thin young major from New York asked if Al Smith was still a political power on the sidewalks of New York . A Texas sergeant asked what " G.I. " meant . A lad from Brooklyn wanted to know all about " Dem Bums . " U.S. soldiers freed from Jap prison camps had a lot to catch up on . <P> But they definitely did not want to do their catching up in the classroom : the Army 's Division of Information and Education soon found that out . The Army 's first halting attempts to lecture the home-bound G.I.s on the back news , while they waited for ships to take them to the U.S. , were met by razzberry-flavored questions : " What are we doing here ? Why are n't we on our way home ? " Last week the Army tried a new way-elaborately casual teaching . <P> In replacement depots in the Philippines , the Army set up come- &-get-it; centers , full of up-to-date maps and recent magazines , and staffed with instructors told not to dismiss any question as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew ( one officer , six enlisted men ) mingled with passengers , encouraging conversations and questions . They were well primed on the workings of the G.I. Bill of Rights . And they toted information kits which included copies of TIME , the World Almanac , and Army orientation pamphlets . <P> Many prisoners , who had heard nothing but Jap propaganda for one to four years , most wanted updating on sports and movies . Some wanted to talk about ways to stop war . One group sighed with relief on learning that , contrary to a report in the Nippon Times , Deanna Durbin is still alive .
