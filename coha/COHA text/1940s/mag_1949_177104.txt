THE HEAT OF THE DAY ( 372 pp. - Elizabeth Bowen-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> <P> For 20 years the literary reputation of 49-year-old Irish-born Novelist Elizabeth Bowen has been based on a polished prose style and a special ability to write about sensitive children and young people in their first discovery of the compromises and dishonesties in the grown-up world . Her best-known novels ( To the North , The House in Paris , The Death of the Heart ) were so skillfully wrought that literary critics ranked them with the work of the late Virginia Woolf . <P> The latest news about Elizabeth Bowen is that , in her new novel ( her first in ten years ) , she has taken in hand a whole new range of novelist 's material ; that this material includes the war and many of the unprecedented goods &; evils , loyalties and disloyalties that emerged into mid-century consciousness in the course of it . It is by all odds her finest book . <P> The Corroding Drop . When war came , Elizabeth Bowen was 40 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to an executive of the BBC . She and her husband , Alan Cameron , had a tall house facing London 's Regent 's Park . There , Novelist Bowen sat down deliberately to restudy her Irish background , her English foreground and the lives she knew as they settled into war . The first result was a long book , Bowen 's Court , on the history of her family and the estate in Cork that they had owned since Cromwell 's day . The second was a book of short stories . The third is The Heat of the Day . <P> <P> The typical scene of the novel is London in the blackout of 1942 ; the relations of human beings to each other have become fragmentary , indefinable and constantly subject to shock . To the apartment of attractive Stella Rodney comes a visitor known to her only as Harrison . He tries to argue her into being seduced and fails . He makes fantastic charges about Stella 's friend and faithful lover , Captain Robert Kelway , and , for a time , fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is that the admirable Captain Kelway is dealing with the enemy . This is incredible in a man like Kelway , who was wounded at Dunkirk and has responsible duties at the War Office . But Harrison is clever ; the drop of suspicion that he injects remains to corrode a happy love affair . <P> The Man of No Class . The terrible human lesson that all three-Harrison , Kelway and Stella Rodney-have to learn is in the peculiar contemporary meanings of treason . Who is to be trusted , and why , and how far ? It is appropriate that each of Miss Bowen 's characters is engaged in secret work , for each is mysterious to the other . But before the end it is clear that each represents an important type of modern personality .
