Does a nation subconsciously reveal itself through the movies it turns out ? An expert who thinks so , and has written a book to prove his point , is German-born Dr. Siegfried Kracauer , who apparently knows a good bit about both psychology and German movies . As sociology , Dr. Kracauer 's From Caligari to Hitler ( Princeton University Press ; $5 ) depends pretty heavily on historical hindsight . As movie lore , it may fascinate cinemagoers who know little about German films except that they gave the world Marlene Dietrich , Peter Lorre , Emil Jannings and Director Fritz Lang . <P> Dr. Kracauer looks at German films for the answer to a hard historical question : Why did the Germans so readily accept Hitler ? " Their strange preparedness for the Nazi creed , " Dr. Kracauer has concluded , " must have originated in psychological dispositions stronger than any ideological scruples . The films of the pre-Hitler period shed no small light on the psychological situation . " <P> Kracauer divides German film history into three main periods . The first ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during those years , the German film attained its highest artistic maturity ( Variety , The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ) , and the screen was a battleground for most of the conflicting anxieties and desires of the German mind . <P> The second period ( 1924-29 ) , thanks to the Dawes plan , was one of relative stabilization . But by the evidence of the films , stabilization meant an avoidance of intellectual and spiritual issues . Movies about adolescence were significantly popular ( Children of No Importance ) ; the Germans looked back nostalgically , Dr. Kracauer says , to an era when the immaturity they had never outgrown was charming and legitimate . <P> The third period began with the crash of 1929 and the return of chaos . The German mind-and the German screen-once more became a battleground . But most of the battling was equivocal , half-blind , halfhearted-or forbidden by censors . And none of it stopped Hitler . <P> The postwar years were the Golden Age of German films , and it is of the wild , queer , charming , sometimes great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kracauer writes most entertainingly . <P> The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ( 1920 ) was originally , a weird , ferocious melodrama about a power-mad hypnotist ( Werner Krauss ) and his tool , a murderous somnambulist ( Conrad Veidt ) . It was intended as an attack on authoritarianism . But the director cooked up a story " frame " ( i.e. , he had the main story told by an asylum inmate ) which made the heroes ( and the authors ) seem mad . Authority emerged as a benign force , and the whole point of the original story was sidetracked . The popular device of the " framing story , " Dr. Kracauer explains , shows the German mind introversively withdrawing into a shell . <P> Caligari was followed by many imitations . The picture 's " basic theme-the soul faced with the seemingly unavoidable alternative of tyranny or chaos-exerted extraordinary fascination . " A long procession of tyrants crossed the screen ; Dr. Kracauer wonders whether their cruelties and excesses were expressions of a premonitory fear of what lay in the depths of the German soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
