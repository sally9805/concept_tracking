In Atlanta last week was completed one of the biggest airline underwritings ever handled by a single investment banker . Courts &; Co. , bossed by smart , wise Richard Winns Courts Jr. , hung the " sold out " sign on 60,000 shares of Delta Air Corp . common , priced at $9.50 a share . To Courts &; Co. this meant $75,000 commissions ( plus $3,000 legal fees ) . To D.A.C. it meant $495,000 with which to bolster working capital , reduce debts , look ahead . <P> Delta started in June 1929 , when gruff , farm-minded Collett Everman Woolman deserted his profitable crop-dusting business ( done with Huff-Daland Dusters and other hedgehoppers ) to ferry passengers between Dallas and Birmingham . For 16 months it looked like a good switch : passengers were more lucrative than insecticides , and safer . But in October 1930 , postal officials pushed him off the airline map , gave a fat mail contract to rival American Airlines . Disgusted , Woolman sold his passenger equipment to American , went back to dusting . <P> But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Woolman saw his chance . With only two planes , 25 employes and more nerve than cash , he snagged the mail contract for the **25;9290;TOOLONG , S.C . run . Meanwhile , 63-year-old ex-Newspaper Publisher Clarence Eugene Faulk , who made $500,000 when he sold his Monroe ( La . ) News-Star and Morning Post , was buying blocks of Delta at $5 a share . Later Delta stock went to $40 ( then split 4-for-1 ) and Faulk went to the president 's chair as finance overseer . Woolman became operating vice president . <P> Now Delta runs 20 flights daily over 1,584 miles between Savannah , Atlanta , Cincinnati and Dallas . In the nine months ending March , its five Douglas DC-3s ( delivered in January ) and four Lockheed Electras carried 39,444 passengers , more than 800% above the whole of 1935 . Delta 's gross from operations was $851,470 in the same period , of which about $50,000 still came from crop-dusting work . But depreciation and personnel-training costs went up so fast the line lost $31,116 , first deficit since 1935 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its new **28;9317;TOOLONG run doing well , it looked as if Delta 's growing pains were over .
