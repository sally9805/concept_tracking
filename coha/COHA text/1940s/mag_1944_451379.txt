DANIEL DIINGLAS Homo was one of the most mystifying Americans of the Victorian era . His parents were Scotch , his father claiming to be the illegitimate son of the tenth Earl of Home . His mother was credited with " second sight . " As an infant , Daniel was adopted by his aunt , Mrs. Cook , who emigrated with him to Norwich , Connecticut . There his wonders began . When at thirteen he began to have " previsions " of his friends ' taking off , the community grew uneasy . So did his aunt , what with the furniture scuttling about and the rapping of spirits at all hours . When Daniel was seventeen , she drove him from the house and threw his clothes after him . For the next thirty-five years Daniel Home lived as a medium , and he lived on the fat of the land . He married twice . N the words of his biographer , Jean Burton , " he became simply , on a lifelong , international , and really magnificent scale , the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his spiritual intercourse , but his visits were extended ? and the bequests which came to him ran as high as ? 50,000 . The Empress Eugenie , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Thackeray , and Ruskin were among his patrons . In these excerpts which are drawn from Jean Burton 's forthcoming biography , Heyday of a Wizard ( to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in April ) we see the impact of this inexplicable American upon the fashionable world of Victoria . ? Tow Barron m : January evening in Paris , in the year 1868 , twelve ladies and gentlemen of quality ranged themselves soothingly beside a confused and nervous hostess as they waited for the guest of honor to make his appearance . Their hostess was Mme Jauvin d'Attainvillo ; among those present were Princess Pauline Metternich and her husband , the Austrian Ambassador ; and the guest whose momentarily expected arrival created such . tension was a Mr. Daniel Dunglas Home , late of the United States . Mr. Home had been in Paris on his present visit for some days , as usual spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Princess Metternich 's graphic account , into " a regular witches ' sabbath " : in his presence massive pieces of furniture , which it would take half a dozen men to lift , rocked violently , untouched by human hands , while armchairs " few from one end of the room to theother as if driven by a hurricane . " As everyone in Paris could testify , Princess Metternich , sharp-tongued , wiry , audacious , and sensation-loving , was not a young woman to be intimidated without due cause . But she made no pretense of being altogether at her ease with Mr. Home . It was over six years since there had first been announced in the capital " the arrival of a noted spiritualist , a man who disdained the parlour tricks performed by ordinary mortals , one who professed to belong to the select company of ' great me-.diums . ' " And from the beginning Parisian hostesses had found him select in another sense . Ile more than matched them in exclusiveness . Indeed Mr. Home was unique . He was neither an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly as an equal ; and one must never , never so far forget oneself as to offer him money . Jewels , clothes , fur coats , trips to fashionable watering-places ? in some respects his tastes were rather like a cocotte 's ? were acceptable ; but money , no . Moreover he would not even consider invitations unless they came through an intermediary well known to him . Tonight this intermediary had been Prince Joachim Murat , one of the Second Empire 's more decorative objects of salvage . On this particular evening , however , Murat 's hostess was surprisingly ungrateful for his efforts . Mme Jauvin d'Attainville was devote , and did not care to encourage wizards . But her guests assured her on their honor that Mr. Home was not only a Christian but a Catholic ? which last had to her knowledge been true for a brief period , and perhaps still was : at least , for the time being neither he nor the Roman Catholic Church wished specifically to deny it . But now voices were hushed and all heads turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at Prince Murat 's side we beheld the mysterious , long-awaited hero of the day , the man who inspired fear and uneasiness alike , Dunglas Home . " As Murat , proudly smiling , led the way to their hostess , Princess Metternich swiftly appraised the newcomer who followed him : " Fairly tall , slim , well-built , in his dress-suit and white tie he looked like a gentleman of the highest social standing . His face was attractive in its expression of gentle melancholy . He was very pale , with light china-blue eyes ? they were not piercing ; rather were they inclined to be sleepy ? reddish hair , thick and abundant , but not inordinately long , no pianist 's or violinist 's mop ; in short , he was of pleasing appearance with nothing striking about him except , perhaps , the pallor of his complexion , which seemed natural from its contrast with his red hair and beard . " Murat introduced him ceremoniously to the other guests and a little polite conversation took place , Home speaking fluent French with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatting , they began to drift towards the table and take their places at or near it . The performance which then took place was reasonably typical of the seances of which Home , during his prime ? he was now just under thirty ? gave literally hundreds a year . There were all together fifteen present ( nearly twice as many as he liked ) and they sat in a large drawing room crowded with gilt and marble furniture in the ornate style of the period . Princess Metternich further mentioned that it was " blazing " with light from chandeliers and lamps , which was probably no ' ! exaggeration . Of cut-glass chandeliers a Second Aspire drawing room could never have enough . Home chose an armchair some three or four yards from the circle , offhandedly calling to their attention that the table was beyond his reach ; and warned , as he usually did by way of preface , that They ( the spirits ) might not come at all . He then leaned back and was observed to grow visibly paler . Then Home spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Sharp raps sounded from the table . " At once the lustres of the chandeliers began to move , and from the back of the room a chair came , as if propelled by an irresistible force , and suddenly stopped in front of us . Home remained in his seat without moving a muscle . Suddenly he exclaimed : ' They are here ! They are all around us ! ' " At the same : nstant , Princess Metternich screamed ? with some excuse : an invisible iron hand had just gripped her by the knuckles . In the confusion , others were heard excitedly proclaiming that they too had felt that harsh iron grasp on their arms , hands , or necks , and could distinguish the pressure of its individual fingers , though strangely none felt pain . " One must have been through the experience to realise what it means . " They were cut short by a new and breath-taking spectacle . The tapestry which covered the table was now seen to be slowly rising , while beneath it something ? a concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Metternich shrank back in her chair. - But her husband , and others of the more skeptical and alert , sprang forward to catch the object ; and each in turn had the same frustrating experience . When seized , it quietly " melted away . " One of the men tore off the cloth ; others hurled themselves beneath the table . All in all , the Attainville drawing room must have presented a curious and unwonted appearance for the next few minutes . But they found nothing , nothing whatever . Home sat motionless , watching them with an expression impossible to read . Presently , annoyed and a little disturbed as well , they scrambled to their feet and resumed their places . Immediately a perfect rain of derisive taps sounded from out of the table . At this Prince Metternich 's diplomatic calm entirely deserted him . The rest could do as they pleased , he announced loudly , but he was going back underneath that table . Hitching up the knees of his elegant trousers , and directing a challenging stare at Home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . There was only an infinitesimal pause , as if to allow him time to settle himself , before the maddening raps resumed at an accelerated tempo . Prince Metternich 's distinguished head shot , out like a turtle 's and he peered indignantly upward . " No jokes , if you please ! " he called testily . The nonplused circle assured him with perfect truth that no one except himself had stirred . But now they began to glance sideways at each other , and at Home , with genuine perturbation . Ilome was by this time in deep trance , white as a sheet , head fallen back , and he cried out again that the spirits were all around them . " One is quite near you . You surely feel it , like a light breath ? " Men and women alike acknowledged shakily that they did . Then , before they had time to recover , Home pointed to a corsage of violets which someone had left on the piano , and asked that it be brought to them . His head sank back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violets began to " glide over the smooth surface , rise , and unsteadily traverse the empty space that lay between the piano and the table . " They fell , by chance or design , directly into Princess Mettemich 's lap , and as they fell her husband bounded forward to seize them and search feverishly for the thread or hair to which they might ? or rather must ? be at ? tached . Again he found nothing . At the end of the seance everyone burst out in animated speculation . Sleight of hand was by far the most popular theory , but there was also much knowledgeable allusion to " electro-biologism , " hallucination , and mass hypnotism . Princess Metternich dealt with the latter briskly : " That he was an unrivalled hypnotist is not impossible ; but what I roundly deny is that any of us had any feeling that we had been hypnotised . " She also reminded her readers that the drawing room was as brightly lit as if it were day and had not at any stage of the proceedings been darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Home , who had never been in the house before that evening , could hardly have set up any paraphernalia in advance . A few days later the Metternichs attended a seance in the Empress 's rooms at the Tuileries , between five and six in the afternoon . This was not , on the whole , successful . " The spirits did not seem to be in the right mood . " irt one point , when the customary tattoo was played by a regiment marching through the gardens , the table accompanied it with muffled raps . Princess Metternich , however , thought this a trifle childish , " though curious . " On the other hand she was very much struck by a phenomenon which had not been included the first evening , though it was a specialty of Home 's , and which fretted minds a great deal more scientific than hers ; namely , that when tables tilted in his presence , at no matter how sharp an angle , objects lying upon them not only did not fall off , but adhered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move them . " On the little table that had just played the drum so prettily , there stood a candlestick with a lighted candle . The table began to move , to rise , to dance , then to lean so far forward that under ordinary circumstances , anything placed upon it would inevitably have fallen off . But what happened ? Not only did the candlestick not fall off , but the flame , instead of continuing to burn perpendicularly ? as of course normally happens when one holds a candle at a slant ? leant over at the same angle as the candle and the table . " One afternoon shortly after these events took place , Home favored Princess Metternich herself with a social call . She happened to be alone when he was announced and , admitting to a moment 's distinct qualm , almost sent word that she was engaged . Then , her justly famous spirit reasserting itself , she ordered him shown in . Home sat opposite her and they exchanged civilities , but herattention soon wandered somewhat . " Close by me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops , began to fall upon my ear . " She tried bravely to ignore it , but the sound grew so loud and insistent that at length she could not resist glancing quickly behind her . At this Home , who had been tranquilly waiting for some notice to be taken of his little divertisement , allowed himself a fleeting smile and murmured that it was nothing ? only one of Them . They followed him everywhere , he told her resignedly . Home added unexpectedly ( and this last touch demoralized her completely ) that when his little son Gricha was around , the manifestations were even more vigorous . Mediumship ran in the family . " If you like , Princess , " he offered politely , " I 'll bring the boy with me one day ; he 's three years old . I 'll let him stay alone with you . You will be astonished and ? convinced . " Princess Metternich thanked him shudderingly , but declined . This tete- ? - the with a wizard of adult years she could just sustain , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 NOWHERE else in the world had the rapping spirits produced louder echoes than in the Anglo-American colony of Florence . " When people gather round a table now it is n't to play whist , " Mrs. Robert Browning observed wisely . Mr. Browning maintained an attitude of virile and ill-concealed impatience . But as " confederate friends ranged with me on the believing side " his wife listed Sir Edward Lytton 's son , then attache of the English Embassy and " visionary enough to suit me , which is saying much " ; Mr. Frederick Tennyson , elder brother of the poet , and a Swedenborgian ; Mr. Hiram Powers , the American sculptor ; and Mr. A. S. Jarves of the Boston Jarveses , a wealthy art critic , a medium in his own right , and what was more important , " perfectly veracious . Even Robert admits this . " Together they were a formidable band and " Robert has to keep us at bay as he best can , " she told her friend Miss Haworth . She herself heard nothing wherever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " flesh and blood human beings floating about rooms in company with tables and lamps , " and mediums speaking in tongues . " The unbelievers writhe under it , " said Mrs. Browning with satisfaction . Daniel Home had not been long in England before Mrs. Browning was again drawn to him as by an ir- resistible magnet . She secured an introduction to the Rymers , with whom Home was staying , after which she wrote her sister in the country : MY BELOVED HENRIETTA , . . . As to Hume , ? we shall see him , and I will tell you . He 's the most interesting person to me in England out of Somersetshire , and 60 Wimpole Street . . . . Your over , ever affectionate BA . England 's foremost poetess then journeyed to Ealing and sat raptly , dark eyes glowing in her small ivory-pale face , through an hour of wonders . But also in attendance was her distinguished husband , handsome , immaculately groomed , and frowning in deep distaste for this intellectual slumming expedition . Consequently her next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAR HENRIETTA ; You . . . want to hear the results of our seeing Hume ? so I will tell you ? on the condition though , that when you write to use you do n't say a word on the subject ? because it 's a tabooed subject in this house ? Robert and I taking completely different views , and he being a good deal irritated by any discussion of it . First she must explain that her friend Mr. Lytton was also in England and had visited Ealing with Isis father two days earlier . " We did not see quite as much as Mr. Lytton did ? but we were touched by the invisible , heard the music and raps , saw the table moved , and had sight of the hands . " Then had occurred the famous garland episode , the recollection of whirls more than everything else kept Browning 's rage simmering through the years . " At the request of the medium , the spiritual hands took from the table a garland which lay there , and placed it upon my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest human size , as white as snow , and very beautiful . It was as near to me as this hand I write with , and I saw it as distinctly .. . . " Robert and I did not touch the hands . Mr. Lytton and Sir Edward both did . The feel was warm and human ? rather warmer in fact than is common with a man 's hand . The music was beautiful . " To turn to Home 's account , it gradually dawned on him that for some reason Mr. Browning " appeared to be very much out of temper " while this was going on . But he was too pleasantly engaged with Mrs. Browning ( " who was so k nd and attentive to me " ) to pay much attentim at first . The wreath whirls caused all the turmoil as of clematis which Home and the Rymer childrei had picked in I This spelling of his name was occasioned Home 's Scottish pronunciation of it as " Boom . " the garden ; and just before the seance it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit hands I do not remember . " There it lay until it was " raised by supernatural power in the presence of us all , and whilst we were watching it , Mr. Browning , who was seated at the opposite side of the table , left his place and came and stood behind his wife , towards whom the wreath was being slowly carried , and upon whose head it was placed in full sight of us all , and whilst he was standing close behind her . Ile expressed no disbelief ; as indeed , it was impossible for any one to have any . . . . Mrs. Browning was much moved . " This was emphatically where Home should have stopped , as , he valued his life . Instead he rashly hinted that Browning had hurried to place himself in the trajectory of the wreath in the hope that it would alight on his brow . ( Chesterton has remarked that it was almost too dreadful to conjecture what the poet 's language would have been if it had taken any such liberty . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unhappy Mrs. Browning assured Henrietta that her husband acquitted the Rymer family of collusion , " believes in their veracity ? but cries out against Hume 's humbugging . " Even she felt constrained to admit that Home , in trance , had talked " a great deal of much such twaddle as may be heard in any fifth-rate conventicle . " To many observers , the most puzzling phenomena were the spirit hands , which later psychists preferred to designate austerely as psychic rods , terminals , extrusions , or " pseudopods " ? literally " false feet . " Home 's spirit hands had been given a searching inspection by no less an anatomical authority than Hiram Powers . Powers in turn introduced him to Baron Seymour Kirkup , noted artist of an earlier day . Kirkup , very ancient , very deaf , living amid decayed grandeur in a state of indescribable mental and physical confusion , had been lost for years in the obscurest mazes of occultism . Even Mrs. Browning smiled a little at some of his revelations . But lie exerted himself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arm materialized by Home , which was more than anyone else had thought to do . " You must be able to show proof , " the old gentleman submitted . To Nathaniel Hawthorne , who had attended Home 's seances in Florence , the spirit messages presented no difficulty : it seemed obvious to him that these had their origin in the subconscious minds of the circle and that some form of telepathy " returned the inquirer 's thoughts and veiled reflections to himself . " He could dismiss everything on this basis , in fact , except the bothersome pseudopods . " The hands are certainly an inexplicable phenomenon . They are impressions of the two senses , sight and touch , but how produced I can not tell . " Browning 's spluttering theory , as advanced to Hawthorne , was that the spirit hands produced by Home were either " the scoundrel 's naked foot " or contrivances attached thereto . As he spoke Mrs. Browning kept putting in little distressed expostulations in her sweet and tiny voice . But Browning forged ahead , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and heard it from other eyewitnesses , melted strangely away in his hearty gripe , and at the sharp touch of his logic , " said Mr. Hawthorne uncomfortably . Here were two clever , likable , witty people , both of whom Hawthorne respected , and as to whose complete intellectual integrity he would h ? e taken his oath . But it was one 's word against the other 's . Browning also fumed to William Allingham that he had never seen so impudent a piece of imposture in his life but that shortly after the s ? ance Home , to his amazement , had called on him in town " with his right hand outstretched in amity . He bore no ill-will ? not he ! " Browning 's response had been to point to the nearest exit with the inhospitable words : " If you are not out of that door in half a minute I 'll fling you down the stairs . " But , he continued , grinding his handsome teeth , " now comes the best of it all . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never guess . He says to everybody , ' How Browning hates me ! ? and how I love him ! ' " Mrs. Browning defiantly wound up her letter to Henrietta : For my own part , I am confirmed in all my opinions . To me it the s ? ance was wonderful and conclusive ; and I believe that the medium present was no more responsible for the things said and done , than I myself was . . . A very little patience , and we shall not speak such things in a whisper : for it is but the beginning . . . . Your ever attached BA. 3 FROM Rome where he had gone to recover from a severe cold Home advised friends in Paris that he went little into society , the spirits thinking a complete rest necessary . But he spent April both pleasantly and profitably , for shortly afterwards Mrs. Browning heard what seemed to her the greatest wonder yet : the medium was engaged to be married . In Rome he had fallen in with a young Cossack nobleman , Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter was the seventeen-year-old Alexandrine ( Sacha ) de Kroll , youngest daughter of the late General Count de Kroll and a goddaughter of the late Tsar Nicholas . She had been educated in Paris , as most girls of good Russian family were , and was just out of her convent ? vivacious , impressionable , charming , and little more than a child . Koucheleff asked Home to come and spend a quiet evening with the family , but when he arrived around ten he found a large rollicking Russian party in full swing . Supper was served at midnight . Home sat at his hostess 's right , and when she introduced him to the pretty , dark-haired little girl on his other side " a strange impression came over me at once , and I knew she was to be my wife . " At the same moment Sacha began to laugh . " Mr. Home , " she teased , " you will be married before the year is ended . " Home asked why . Oh , she said , it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at table between two sisters he had just met . Both omens were /fulfilled . Twelve days later the engagement of Mlle de Kroll and the medium was formally announced . It must be considered entirely a tribute to Home 's social charm , for Sacha had not yet seen him in action . Indeed discussion of his profession was rather carefully avoided . Once his fiancee turned to him as they were sitting out a dance and said lightly , " Do tell me about spirit-rapping , for you know I do n't believe in it . " Home 's diplomatic and gently quelling response was : " Mademoiselle , I trust you will ever bear in mind that I have a mis-sion entrusted to me . It is a great and holy one . I can not speak with you about a thing which you have not seen , and therefore can not understand . " The wedding was to take place in Russia . Sacha went ahead from Marseilles while Home made a hurried trip to Scotland to provide himself with a birth certificate , disappointing friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . " Cer-tainly her taste must be extraordinary , " marveled Mrs. Browning . " How strange the fortunes of that young man are ! . . . My friend Mr. Jarves spent a night with Hume once , " she went on by a not too obscure association of ideas , " and a four-posted bed was carried into the middle of the room ? shadowy figures stood by the pillow , or lay down across the feet of those about to sleep ? nothing threatening , ( everything kind ; but , at best , " she concluded bughtfully , " extremely disturbing . " In June , Home joined Count and Countess esborodka , who were waiting for him in Paris . One night he took them to call on Alexandre Dumas ; they found each other wonderfully congenial , and when someone suggested that Dumas be best man at the wedding he accepted at once with Gargantuan roars of delight . With this last-minute addition to their party they proceeded northward , a trip amusingly described by Dumas in De Paris a Astrakan . Alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baltic be still , but was seasick for the entire voyage . Sacha 's relations were gathered expectantly at Polonstrava , the estate bestowed on Koucheleff 's grandfather by Catherine II . It stood just outside St. Petersburg , with a glorious view of the Neva . There were illuminated fetes and ceremonial dinners , and young and old appeared delighted with the match : to Dumas 's surprise they made no objection whatever to bestowing their lovely Sacha on a young man with no background , no visible means of livelihood , and most visibly in shocking health . One more proof that he was , of course , a sorcerer , a caster of spells . What others thought even more astounding , being utterly without precedent , was the suspension in Home 's case of the ironclad rules governing marriages of the noblesse . But Alexander II had given his permission without question ; the newly crowned Tsar of Freedom was bent on emulating the court of France in all things . There was , at the last , some little difficulty about his birth certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles in the way of my marriage were removed by his most gracious Majesty , who upon this , as upon every occasion , has shown to me the greatest kindness . " Three days before the wedding the Tsar sent a blinding diamond ring ' by his chamberlain , Count Schouvaloff . Until now Sacha had not been allowed to see any of Home 's phenomena , which possibly was wise . " My wife 's first introduction to anything of the kind " came when two apparitions entered their bedroom , and for a moment " her actions betrayed a certain shrinking . " But on the whole she took it well . When the apparitions vanished and raps began to sound , she was soon happily engrossed in putting questions and learning to count the raps which replied . Judged as an artist , Home gave as finished a performance in the home as outside it ; judged as an impostor , he took no one into his confidence . The next landmark in Home 's life was the birth of his son on May 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . Not only did signs and portents attend the birth , but the child had given certain evidences of being a prenatal medium . ( Asan early sign of vocation , it was pointed out , this topped the record even of Jenny Lind , whose first cry on entering the world was a high F. ) The warbling of an invisible bird was heard , and mysterious illuminations glowed through the night over the cradle of the infant , who to a trained eye gave every indication of remarkable occult potentialities . But the proud father , while making this clear , added that he would never encourage the development of such a gift . A medium had too hard a life . The Tsar sent Mme Home a congratulatory emerald brooch set with sixteen diamonds . The baby was christened Gregoire ( Gricha ) . His Aunt Luba ( Countess Koucheleff-Besborodka ) was godmother , and the French Minister , the Marquis de Chtiteaureynard , was godfather . On this occasion he was christened a Roman Catholic . When he was rebaptized in the Greek Church some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Constantine , and the Tsar of All the Russias. 4 WITIIIN a few weeks of his return to England Home had given seances for Lord Stafford , Mrs. Milner Gibson , Elizabeth Lady Dunsany , Baron and Lady Pollock , Lady Compton , Lady Salisbury , Lady Trelawney , Sir Daniel and Lady Cooper , Lady Loftus Otway , Sir Charles Nicholson , Lady Helena Newnham , Lady Palmerston , and Lady Egerton of Tatton . He was taken to perform before Lord Lyndhurst at the aged Chancellor 's residence ; and , more importantly , before the Duchess of Sutherland at Stafford House . The approval of the Duchess , a generous sponsor of high-minded causes , could hardly be overestimated . For a time it seemed that Home would be more or less appropriated by Lady Shelley , a pleasant , lively little woman of inexhaustible energy . But against heavy opposition the victor was Mrs. Thomas Milner Gibson , whose social gifts had made her a well-known figure in more than one European capital . " That impulsive , compassionate , affectionate woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual friend Mrs. Lynn Linton , England 's first woman journalist , " but as to the strength of her head ? ? " ) . Latterly political refugees ? Louis Blanc , Maz --  zini , and Kossuth ? had absorbed her time and attention , but Home was soon the undisputed lion of her " Mondays " at 3 Hyde Park Place . And the only one who was not entirely happy over this arrangement was Mr. Gibson . " I hear from England that the subject is advancing with a large section of the public , " Mrs. Browning wrote from Italy . " Milner Gibson 's dinner table is , in the middle of dinner , lifted up to an angle of forty-five ? he praying ( or rather swearing ) for leave to get his dinner in peace . " Mr. Gibson gave further pain by declining to attend seances in his own home or elsewhere ; and if by chance he opened the door on such gatherings he would pause only to groan , " Well , my dear , at it again ! " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to dissociate himself from his wife 's enthusiasm where the public was concerned . Gibson was one of the great parliamentary triumvirate of Free Trade ( the other two being Cobden and Bright ) , and it happened that about this time he was negotiating a commercial treaty with France . One day , wishing to report to the Commons on exchanges that had passed between the two governments , Mr. Gibson arose and cleared his throat , " I have been a medium ? " he began . But that was all they heard , the rest being drowned in the uncontrollable roar that went up from both sides of the House . Though it was sometimes forgotten , Home had a domestic as well as a public life . He was an exemplary husband ; but some of Mrs. Browning 's premonitions seemed borne out by his account of a little incident that took place in April , 1860 . In Mrs. Gibson 's salon he had often met Louis Blanc , the socialist leader exiled from France under the dictatorship of Napoleon III . Like other distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturer ; and one evening Home and a party of friends ( Bache had gone to bed early suffering from a headache ) went to hear him speak . The lecture proved to deal with Mesmer and Cagliostro , whose hidden contributions to the revolutionary forces of 1789 had , according to Blanc , never been seriously enough appraised . Home 's detractors had frequently likened him in a most unflattering way to the self-styled Count de Cagliostro , the arch-magician whose harsh shadow fell across the French and Russian courts of an earlier day . Accordingly a good many in the audience glanced surreptitiously at Home as the lecture progressed , and they found him wearing an oddly distraught air . For the very good reason , he explained later , that the old magician 's astral body had entered the hall a few minutes after Blanc began to speak of him . When he went back to the hotel and Sacha roused herself to ask how he had enjoyed the lecture , his reply ( hardly soothing to one with migraine ) was : " I have been haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her aching head . " Pray , " she exclaimed faintly , " do not use that word haunted , it sounds so weird-like , and quite frightens me ! " Home meanwhile had blown out the candles ; but now the room was luridly lit up for an instant . Sacha , all at once very wide-awake , asked if this was Cagliostro . Three blue flashes answered in the affirmative . Then footsteps were heard , and in a moment they felt a pressure on the bed which seemed to indicate that their visitant was companionably seating himself beside them . Both his wife and he himself , said Home , were temporarily struck dumb by this a and easy behavior on the part of a spirit who was , as he put it , " in no way related to us . " But presently Cagliostro began to speak " in a distinct Voice audible to both of us " and cleared up some much debated questions . ( " My biographers have ever done me injustice . " ) He appeared to be making an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be harmless ? but at best , as Mrs. Browning had said , disturbing . 5 TAKEN singly , neither Home 's phenomena nor his facile charm , both of which captured sensation seekers , could have quite explained the kind and degree of success he had attained . Taken together they justified the title of an article in Thackeray 's literary monthly , the Cornhill Maga-. sine , in August , 1860 : " Stranger Than Fiction . " The anonymous author was quickly identified as Robert Bell , an Irish journalist and critic previously associated with Lytton . The scene was Mrs. Gibson 's drawing room , and Bell began by describing the bewitching of its furniture . This was fairly stereotyped , except that a table had turned over on one side and traveled about the room with a weaving motion so rapid that they could hardly keep up with it . Finally it had tried to climb an ottoman , succeeded after several attempts , and descended nimbly on the other side , winding up triumphantly poised on one leg like a ballerina . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next that brought his readers up short and staring . To judge the full impact on the Cornirill 's subscribers , the story had best be told in his own words : " Mr. Home was seated next the window . Through the semi-darkness his head was dimly visible against the curtains , and his hands might be seen in a faint white heap before him . " Presently he said , in a quiet voice , ' My chair is moving  --  I am off the ground ? do n't notice me ? talk of something else , ' or words to that effect . . . . In a moment or two more he spoke again . This time his voice was in the air above our heads . He had risen from his chair to a height of four or five feet from the ground . As he ascended higher he described his position , which at first was perpendicular , and afterwards became horizontal . He said he felt as if he had been turned in the gentlest manner , as a child is turned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hard to fad a modern parallel for the furore created by this article . So liberal an education on sense deception and mal-observation did the public all at once receive that if Home achieved nothing else , he severely undermined the prestige of human evidence . Shallow-minded persons were being Hume-bugged right and left , sneered Punch , coming out the next week with a poem entitled " Home , Great Home ! " With a lift from the spirits he 'll rise in the air , ( Though , as lights are put out , we ca n't see him there ) . . . . He can make tables dance , and bid chairs stand on end . ( But , of course , it must be in the house of a friend . ) As for Homo 's converts , the kindest thing said of them was that they were of the class born for no other purpose than to be deluded . Controversies in the sixties were normally abusive ; this one was only a trifle more so than most . Edmund Yates , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly credit his good fortune at seeing his enemy thus delivered into his hands , made it a point to inveigh not so much against Homo as against his " silly dupes , eleven-twelfths of whom are hopeless fools . " A number resented this classification hotly enough to give up their protective anonymity and corroborate the Cornhill article in angry detail . Thackeray had first mot Home during an American tour some years before . On that occasion he had been as excited as a boy ? lowering his plump form to peer beneath the table , getting down on hands and knees to examine the floor , mopping his brow from these unwonted exertions , and keeping up a running fire of questions . Then he hurried back to his hotel to write his friends in England , instructing them exactly how to go about it so that they too might form circles and make tables tilt . " It is the most wonderful thing . . .1 " Now , implored on all sides to wash his hands of the article , Thackeray refused . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , presently , the body being removed , should n't we personally be anywhere at , will ? " he inquired ? and " anywhere " included Mrs. Gibson 's drawingroom . Home could not claim him as a believer , but he was undeniably a friendly advocate . " It pleases me that Thackeray has had the courage to maintain the facts before the public , " approved Mrs. Browning . " I think much the better of him for doing so . " Home traveled to Italy at the end of the year -- in the new and unexpected role of sculptor . This had come as a surprise to his closest intimates , but he explained that he wished to make himself financially independent . It was his plan ultimately to open a studio in Paris . In the meantime Joseph Durham had given him some preliminary lessons in his new art and had given him letters of introduction to leading sculptors in Rome , including William Wetmore Story . When Browning got wind of this last his indignation verged on the apoplectic . He wrote Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome with a letter . . . to Story , asking to become his pupil ; Story refused , but got him a studio , conceiving himself bound to do so much by the letter : Mrs. S. wrote me this : of course Hume immediately wrote to England ( to Dr. Gully a Gull indeed ) that S. had taken him as a pupil it is Story 's own business ? he chooses to take this dung-ball into his hand for a minute , and he will get more and more smeared . Home was saddened by this exhibition of vindictiveness , but hardly surprised . " I happen to know , " he wrote darkly , " that Mr. Browning once remarked of me that I was in the habit of being assisted home drunk by the police nightly . " He settled down quietly in the artist colony , going about his business and conscientiously visiting the art galleries ; but he was not allowed to make much progress in his new career . In January the Papal Government swiftly moved to have him expelled from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would swear to " desist from all communication with the spirit world . " But Home , as always , replied that this was out of his control . The utmost he could promise was this : " I give my word as a gentleman that , during my stay in Rome , I will have no seance , and that I will avoid , as much as possible , all conversations upon spiritualism . Dialim . HU/VGLAS HOME , PalazziPaoli , 4 January , 1864 . " It was not enough , and he was requested with finality to be outside the gates of Rome the next day . 6 FROM the day Browning 's pulverizing " Mr. Sludge " appeared in 1864 , its inspiration was obvious to everyone in England with the exception of Mr. D. D. Home . " No person even slightly acquainted with me could discover one point of resemblance , " Ile protested with his most charming smile . But " I find myself compelled to notice this remarkable poem of Mr. Robert Browning , " he wrote distantly after some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause I have the honour to represent and an insult to the memory of his deceased wife , who lived and died a believer in Spiritualism ? and whose intellect , " said Mr. Home ( becoming human for one moment ) , " was far superior to his own . " Other and more disinterested critics had thought the poem not in the best of taste on this score , for it was known that this was almost the only topic on which the Brownings ever differed . But Mrs. Browning had grown to be a most attractive and exceptional type of spiritist , laughing cheerfully at her own enthusiasm ? ' " I dare say you all set me down as raving mad , " she told her sister ? and keeping family arguments on a resolutely light plane . Nevertheless , to the day of her death in 1861 she had neither recanted nor compromised . " It grows , it grows , " she had exulted at each fresh report of the movement 's progress . Taken at face value Sludge 's hysterical , cringing confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheats , and icy and unfathomable contempt for a race of dupes . To the sole dissenting commentator , Chesterton , its significance , like that of all Browning 's monologues , lay rather in its probing of " a reality tangled almost inextricably with unrealities in a man 's mind . " Moreover , Sludge in his extremity told all ; the formidable thing about Home was that he never relaxed his guard . His life must have been one of perpetual and exhausting wariness , his wits must often have raced against disaster , but the hairbreadth triumphs that constituted the real drama of his existence could never be shared . " A really accomplished impostor , " reflected Chesterton , " is the most wretched of geniuses ; he is a Napoleon on a desert island . " And even for Sludge , he pointed out , Browning had left one door ajar . " When he has nothing left either to gain or to conceal , then he rises up into a perfect bankrupt sublimity , and makes the great avowal which is the whole pivot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ! Will you believe me , though ? You 've heard what I confess : I do n't unsay A single word : I cheated when I could , Rapped with my toe-joints , set sham hands at work , Wrote down names weak in sympathetic ink , Rubbed odic lights with ends of phosphor-match , And all the rest ; believe that : believe this , By the same token , though it seem to set The crooked straight again , unsay the said , Stick up what I 've knocked down ; I ca n't help that It 's truth ! I somehow vomit truth today . This trade of mine ? I do n't know , ca n't be sure But there was something in it , tricks and all ! It is doubtful whether Home would have been grateful for this loophole even if anyone had noticed it at the time , which no one did . But in contrast to Browning there now entered his life John Ruskin , whose attitude was full of balm . Ruskin was introduced to seances by his confidante Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned for him since he announced his loss of faith in revealed religion . Mrs. Temple felt that seances would almost certainly lift him out of his despondency . For her own part , as she wrote Home , " I feel now no interest , except in the spirit-world . " At one seance a poem was dictated to Home by the spirit of Southey , while the table beat time . Mr. Ruskin , who was sitting opposite , then asked diffidently if he might recite a little poem . Pray do , said the spirits . Ruskin 's choice was a religious verse , and the table , rising on two legs , beat time to this with special fervor . The change in him was marked , and friends reacted to it in differing ways . " When we last met , " blurted Holman Hunt , staring , " you declared you had given up all belief in immortality ! " True , true , adinitted Ruskin , wincing at the memory of those desolate days ; but since then he had had unanswerable evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for the States , solemn Mr. Ruskin wrote him a letter which , with all allowances , must be considered peculiar : DENMARK HILL , 5xn September , 1865 DEAR Mn . ROME , It is so nice of you to like me ! I believe you are truly doing me the greatest service and help that one human being can do another in trusting me in this way , and indeed I hope I so far deserve your trust , that I can understand noble and right feeling and affection ? though I have myself little feeling or affection left , being worn out with indignation as far as regards the general world . . Till March is long to wait ? and it really is n't all my fault , . You never told me you were going away before Monday . . . . Well ? do , please , write me a line to say you are safe in America . And come to see me the moment you come back . I shall be in every way , I hope , then more at leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and brought back to us better in health and happier . Ever affectionately yours , J. Rawls . THE climactic levitation took place at Ashley House before Lord Adare , Captain Lindsay , and Charles Wynne . Adare and Lindsay wrote separate accounts ( later microscopically examined for discrepancies ) . Wynne , not a literary type , contented himself with a gruff and general corroboration . First came telekinetic phenomena witnessed by all three , and apparitions visible only to Lindsay . ( He saw one spirit form leaning an arm on Wynne 's shoulder . ) Then Home , who had been in trance for some time , began to walk about uneasily and finally wandered into an adjoining room . At the same moment Lindsay heard a voice whisper in his ear : " He will go out of one window and in at another . " He had barely time to communicate this startling intelligence before they heard a window in the next room being flung up . Lindsay 's account continues : " We heard the window in the next room lifted up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air outside our window . " The moon was shining full into the room . gy back was to the light ; and I saw the shadow on the wall of the windowsill , and Home 's feet about six inches above it . He remained in this position for a few seconds , then raised the window and glided into the room feet foremost , and sat down . " Lord Adare then went into the next room to look at the window from which he had been carried . It was raised about eighteen inches , and he expressed his wonder how Mr. Home had been taken through so narrow an aperture . " Home said ( still in trance ) ' I will show you ' ; and then , with his back to the window , he leaned back and was shot out of the aperture head first , with the body rigid , and then returned quite quietly . " The window is about seventy feet from the ground . I very much doubt whether any skillful rope ? dancer would like to attempt a feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a perilous leap . " The distance between the windows was about seven feet six inches , and there was not more than a twelve-inch projection to each window , which served as a ledge to put flowers on . " From Adare 's version : " When Home awoke , he was much agitated ; he said he felt as if he had gone through some fearful peril , and that he had a most horrible desire to throw himself out of the window . He remained in a very nervous condition for a short time , and then gradually became quiet . Having been ordered not to tell him , we said nothing of what had happened . . . . " Large books could be filled , and in fact have been filled , with the controversy over this seance alone . The most sensible conclusion that emerged was that it would probably remain unexplained until it was repeated under observation ; and this has yet to be done . The late Houdini went on record as being able to duplicate it on the same premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London in 19R0 made plans to do so . But the project fell through , apparently because of some dispute with his assistant . It might be mentioned in passing that Houdini , though convinced that Home was " a hypocrite of the deepest dye , " had a certain respect for him as a performer who worked tirelessly to improve his act . He could think of several ways in which the illusion in question might have been worked , but did not exclude the possibility that " a man of Home 's audacity with levitation feats " might have swung from one window to the other , with a wire placed in readiness below . 8 HOME met and deeply interested William Crookes , the brilliant and ambitious young physicist and chemist . There was only a year 's difference in their ages ; they were soon Dan and William to each other ; and before long Crookes was afire to study Home 's phenomena ' in the laboratory . Crookes 's announced objectives when he began his celebrated tests with Home were , all things considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tells of rooms and houses being shaken , even to injury , by superhuman power . The man of science merely asks for a pendulum to be set vibrating when it is in a glass case . . . . " The Spiritualist tells of heavy articles of furniture moving from one room to another without human agency . But the man of science . . . is justified in doubting the accuracy of the observations , if the same force is powerless to move the index of his instrument one poor degree . " His apparatus ? which seemed an extremely impressive array at the time ? included a galvanometer , a thermometer , an accordion placed in a sort of cage wound with insulated copper wire , a small hand-bell , an electromagnet , two Grove cells , and a spring balance attached to a board , with a self-registering index to record variations in weight .. ( Home could hardly , Crookes pointed out , mesmerize instruments . ) He then issued invitations to a picked list of his colleagues to witness the tests ; but almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the outset he had , however , the jubilant approbation of the press , which , as Mme Home later remarked bitterly , " hastened to confer on him a printed certificate of fitness for his task . " When he brought in his totally unlooked-for verdict , the tone abruptly changed . An enormous literature has grown up around the Crookes tests . It need only be said here that the reaction in scientific circles was sharp , not to say anguished , when they read that Mr. Crookes " affirmed conclusively " the existence of " a new force , in some unknown manner connected with the human organisation , which for convenience may be called the Psychic Force " ; and that of all persons so endowed Mr. Home was the most remarkable . Mr. Home 's power was , indeed , strong enough to withstand even " the antagonistic influence of light . " Consequently , except on two special occasions , " everything which I have witnessed with him has taken place in the light . " " Pray do not hesitate to mention me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crookes told Home . The scientific world was in an Uproar ? Inevitably and lamentably personalities entered into the dispute ; charges of observational bias and experimental error ( to mention only the kindest ) flew ; poor trusting Mr. Crookes , it was jibed , had been taken in by tricks that would not deceive a normally bright child of ten . Crookes , a high-tempered man and a forceful debater , struck back with vigor . For a time Crookes 's well-wishers had feared that a brilliant scientific career was at an end . But he survived an ordeal of merciless ridicule ; and by1898 , when he was elected President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , all was forgiven if not forgotten . On the last night of British Association conventions it was the custom to hold an informal " Red Lion " dinner , the room being decorated with a shield for each President , bearing his name , crest , and a suitable motto . The motto assigned Crookes ( now Sir William ) was : " Ubi Crux , ibi Lux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also made ready , with the motto : " Ubi Crookes , ibi Spooks . " Everyone , including Crookes , laughed a trifle louder and longer than the jest strictly called for , and amity was restored . To this day , if psychical researchers are disposed to make any exceptions whatever to the axiom that every physical medium is fraudulent , the one to whom they give the greatest benefit of the doubt is the enigmatic Mr. Home . In the spring of 1886 Mme Home took her husband to Paris lung specialists , who gave a negative prognosis , and then back to Auteuil by easy stages . He died there on June el , with a Greek Orthodox priest in attendance , and was buried in the Russian cemetery at Saint-Germain-en-Laye . No one could say whether or to what extent Daniel Home believed in his own legend . All that was certain was that he had given a brilliant and marvelously sustained performance ; and sometimes great actors who play one role for many seasons almost forget where the role ends and their own personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
