Atop the stadium at Forest Hills fluttered the flags of the U.S. , Australia , the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association and the West Side Tennis Club . As grave and important as Cabinet ministers , tennis ' venerable scribes and pharisees sat in the marquee . It was a state occasion . On a table at the edge of the spotless carpet of green turf , looking not unlike a pretentious wedding cake , stood the piece of silver that all the excitement was about : the Davis Cup . This was the first challenge round in the U.S. since 1939 . <P> The pairings for the opening singles matches-the U.S. 's Jake Kramer v. Australia 's Dinny Pails , the U.S. 's Ted Schroeder v. Australia 's Jack Bromwich-were the same as for last December 's first day in Melbourne . Champion Kramer set right to work to show that the 5-0 sweep at Melbourne was no fluke . Pails is a picture player with rhythmic , flowing ground strokes ; but against Kramer 's almost flawless all-court attack , he could offer only token resistance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's victory- 6-2 , 6-1 , 6-2-was further support for the arguable thesis that Kramer right now is as good as the best in tennis history . <P> In the match between blond , ambidextrous Jack Bromwich and Ted Schroeder , it was again an all-court player with a " big service " and smashing net game against a baseline hugger . The match was exciting but sloppy . Schroeder 's game lacks the finality of Kramer 's , and last week Bromwich 's hairline drives , particularly his two-fisted baseball swing on his right side , were only occasionally as good as they were in 1939 , when the Australians won the cup . Grimacing and holding their heads at their errors , they split the first two sets ; then temperamental Ted got his savage overhead under control , and blasted out the next two and the match . <P> It looked like the start of another sweep , but the Aussies were not through yet . Next day in the doubles , Bromwich and bespectacled Colin Long , a Davis Cup newcomer , were quick to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sting in Kramer 's service . Encouraged by an underdog-loving crowd that wildly cheered their winners and groaned sympathetically when they missed , Bromwich and Long broke Kramer 's service three times , won the match in four sets : 6-4 , 2-6 , 6-2 , 6-4 . <P> Tennis fans had not forgotten the 1939 challenge round when Bromwich and Adrian Quist were down 2-0 , then won the doubles and the last two singles matches . It might inspire the 1947 challengers to outdo themselves . It was also enough to put the U.S. stars on their mettle . In next day 's opening match , Schroeder beat Pails for the clincher that kept the cup in the U.S.
