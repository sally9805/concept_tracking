txt For the third time we look back to Japan 's day of shame and our own day of consternation . Three years ago the United States had begun to prepare for war in a physical way . Psychologically its people were not ready for war . They had waked up to what was expected to be an ordinary Sunday . The morning newspapers were reassuring . The church bells rang . Pleasure drivers were on the highways . Young men with no warning vision of Guadalcanal , Tarawa , Tunisia , the Berlin anti-aircraft barrage or the coasts of Italy and France had dates with their girls . Then , in an instant , as the flashes came through the air , we passed out of one stage of history and into another . The sleepers waked . Now that peaceful Sunday morning of only three years ago belongs with the golden Nineties . It is just as irrecoverable . This generation has certain rewards . It has taken part in a great world struggle for liberty . The courage and the massive power of democracy have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forward , through its present sorrow and misery , toward better days . But the tranquillity that the Japanese bombers interrupted will not return . We can not look back nor contemplate the present and immediate future without sadness , but we can take a solemn pride in what has been achieved and is being achieved at so great a cost , and we can foresee a certain , though as yet undated , end to our ordeal . Three years ago the free countries were fighting for survival . Now it is the slave nations that stand with their backs against crumbling walls . The Axis Powers acted shrewdly in trying to catch the United States off its guard . They did not act with wisdom . The shrewdness gave them a temporary advantage . The lack of wisdom lay in their inability to understand that a democracy could act with speed and determination . So it was less than a year after Pearl Harbor that the aggressors began to feel an avenging pressure both in the Orient and in Europe . We have seen that pressure grow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungles of Guadalcanal to Leyte Island and over the main islands of Japan . We have seen the liberation of North Africa , the Mediterranean , a great part of Italy , nearly all of France and Belgium , a good portion of the Netherlands , and we now see the Germans fighting on their own soil . Our problem has changed . It is no longer one of defense . It is not even one of winning the war . It is one of winning the war as soon as possible . It Is one of achieving post-war settlements that will be final because they will be just . But these very factors darken our skies today . In winning the war as soon as possible we , as well as our allies , are suffering casualties that , day by day , are the heaviest we have known . In working for a just peace we come up against the chaos of a partially destroyed civilization . Our Government and its citizens will need patience and wisdom as well as courage in the days to come . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dedicate ourselves , facing the facts of battle , honoring in work , prayer and sacrifice as well as words those who bear its brunt . The road is still hard to travel and we do not know its length .
