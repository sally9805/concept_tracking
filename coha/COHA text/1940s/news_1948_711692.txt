txt A three-day embargo on almost all air and rail shipments into and out of the metropolitan area was lifted yesterday by the Railway Express Agency after the end of a slowdown strike by 6,000 terminal employes . A few hours later Supreme Court Justice Morris Eder reported that a formula for settling a fiveday truck strike by members of Local 282 , ' International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL , had been worked out after lengthy conferences between employers and union officials . As a result of the twin developments , prospects were bright last night for a speedy return to normal of New York 's badly hobbled commercial transportation system . Railway Express officials reported that workers , operating at a normal rate , had made a big dent in the mountain of packages and parcels that had piled up in freight stations here and in Long Island and in sections of New Jersey . Justice Eder , who entered the truck tie-up as impartial mediator yesterday morning at the invitation of the counsel for Local 807 of the teamsters , expressed himself as hopeful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispute by Monday morning . That left only the dock strike blocking a complete end to the city 's transportation problems . The express company coupled its announcement of the lifting of the embargo with the statement that it was withdrawing lay-off notices sent to 10,000 inside workers and drivers . Some of these " furlough " letters would have become effective yesterday . Both announcements came out of day-long sessions between officers of the company and of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks , AFL . Later in the evening the conferences produced a third result , when the company said that " several " of the thirteen agency employes who had been discharged for conceal- ing allegedly criminal records when making out applications for employment had been restored to their jobs . It was the dismissal of the thirteen that had led to the slowdown and the subsequent embargo . The compromise formula worked out for settlement of the truck strike provided two alternatives. , The membership of Local . 282 will1 vote on them at a special election , to be held tomorrow at Beethoven Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the city 's division of labor relations , will act as agent for the court in supervising the election , which will begin at 11 A. M. One choice open to the men , Justice Eder said , would be an increase of 173/2 cents an hour plus the welfare benefits won by Local 807 in its strike during September . At that time it was estimated that the welfare plan would cost the employers another 5 cents an hour , but later figures put the cost nearer to 3 cents . The other alternative provides a straight pay rise of 221/2 cents an hour without a welfare plan . The latter is the formula that Local 282 has been using since the start of the strike last Monday to sign individual operators to contracts . John J. O'Rourke , president of the union , said yesterday that all but twenty-seven trucking concerns out of 300 originally struck had accepted those terms . " The alternative that is selected by a majority of the employes who vote shall be adopted and incorporated in the agreement betweenl the parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula will result in a settlement of the current strike and a return to work on Monday morning . " 2 Cases Started in Court Justice Eder entered the truck dispute yesterday morning when he began to hear two legal cases growing out of the tie-up . Hyman N. Glickstein , attorney for Local 807 , requested the court 's services and the justice agreed to serve as unofficial mediator . Conferences were begun in his chambers at 2:20 P. M. and ended five hours later . As for the litigation , Justice Eder said it would remain pending . It included a request by the United States Trucking Corporation for an injunction restraining Local 807 from alleged violation of its contract , and an injunction suit brought against Local 282 by the Motor Haulage Company to restrain that local from causing Local 807 to violate its contract . The complaints filed in both cases allege that pickets of Local 282 were causing members of Local 807 to stay away from their jobs . Justice Eder said that as soon as he was informed of the outcome of the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Justice Eder 's chambers were John E. Strong and Thomas Hickey , president and secretary , respectively , of Local 807 ; Mr. O'Rourke , Joseph M. Adelizzi , chairman of the employers wage scale committee ; Hugh E. Sheridan , president of Sheridan &; Duncan , haulers for the New York Central Railroad , and one of the struck concerns , and Joseph L. Seiler , president of United States Trucking . Despite the announcement of the compromise formula , the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads were maintaining embargoes on less-than-carload shipments of freight into their terminals . It was expected they would lift the embargo when their hauling concerns  --  in the case of the Pennsylvania it is Scott Brothers ? came to terms with Local 282 . The exact number of drivers still out on strike last night was not known . Mr. O'Rourke said that about 550 of 3,800 men were idle . Mr. Adelizzi estimated the number at about 1,000 and said that something less than one-third of the industry locally was tied up . He had no figures on the number of operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brotherhood of Railway Clerks in this district , said that the agreement reached yesterday with the express company provided for the return to their jobs ? at some undisclosed date  --  of five of the discharged thirteen . He said negotiations on the reinstatement of the remaining eight would continue this morning at the company 's offices , 230 Park Avenue . The agency 's employes began normal ' operations at midnight on Thursday after an agreement reached between the union and the company the previous day . By mid-afternoon the company announced that conditions were " fluid , " and later added that operations were proceeding normally and that the backlog of shipments that had accumulated had either been cleared away or was being removed . Conferees in the railway express dispute were Mr. Sullivan , A. M. Hartung , company vice president in charge of personnel ; W. M. Smith , eastern operating vice president ; J.
