MEMOIRS OF HECATE COUNTY-Edmund Wilson-Doubleday ( $2.50 ) . <P> Critic Edmund Wilson 's first book of fiction since I Thought of Daisy ( 1929 ) is the first event of the year which can be described as " literary . " For it is more &; more unusual for U.S. writers to try to produce literature which is serious without solemnity , entertaining without shallowness , intelligent without owlishness , socially observant without being dogmatically vindictive , morally acute without being mealymouthed . <P> Among the six stories in this book are a study of the dead hand of the past on a living person ; a study of the Manichaean heresy ( the notion that the Devil is as powerful as God and that they struggle for supremacy ) ; the galloping putrefaction of American letters ; the galloping putrefaction of moral and political values . Author Wilson has also chosen to write literally ( and incidentally ) about sexual intercourse . As a result , Memoirs of Hecate* County will probably be hailed as an event in gaminess . <P> Housebroken Suburbanites . Wilson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the demi-suburbanites who live amphibiously between heavily housebroken country and a U.S. metropolis ( New York City ) . Unlike pudgy Author Wilson , the nameless narrator is a tall , slim analyst of the influence of social and economic conditions on painting . His neighbors and their doings are also imaginary , despite unmistakable glints and graftings of a well-known U.S. critic , a well-known radio commentator , an up &; coming publishing house , a famed literary magazine and book club . <P> One neighbor , an ex-professor of chemistry , egged on by a boozily mischievous advertising man , acts out a cruel , funny little fable of Good &; Evil when he banishes the ducks he loves and sublimates the duck-killing turtles he abominates into a best-selling soup . " Turtle soup , " chortles the adman , captioning a pallid portrait of a lady in crinolines , " saved the sweethearts and mothers of a proud and gallant race . " Another neighbor , variously known as Blackburn , Malatesta and Swarzkopf , turns out to be the Devil , and delivers some of Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalinism ) in a monologue written entirely in French . <P> All-Fours Romp . The high points in the Memoirs are Mr. Wilson 's soon-to-be-notorious love story , The Princess with the Golden Hair , and The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul . The Milhollands is an uproarious allfours romp through the whole world of U.S. writing , publishing and book-promotion . There is the eager young Yaleman who , after feeling that his " generation " has been " betrayed , " first by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound , then by the Marxists , winds up ballyhooing bellywash on national hookups . There is the Purity League 's investigation of the Booklover when its personal columns sprout a rash of " advertisements by ' gentlemen of robust constitution ' in search of ' non-prudish ladies responsive to the new dance rhythms .
