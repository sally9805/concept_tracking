Both the U.S. and Japan took stock of the war in the Orient . <P> Facing certain defeat , the Japs could only take steps to ward off the final assault as long as possible . Example : the Japs decided that their aluminum industry must be re-geared to the use of low-grade ore found in their own islands and in Korea , Manchuria and north China ; fine bauxite from Malaya and the islands would soon be cut off by the Allied recapture of the southern islands . <P> The U.S. , confident of ultimate victory , saw its progress seriously retarded by defeats in China . Everywhere , the key question was asked : how long will it take to defeat Japan after V-E day ? After picking the best brains in the State , War &; Navy Departments and the Federal Economic Administration , the OWI came up with an answer : " One and a half to two years . . . is considered an absolute minimum . " Other U.S. authorities recalled Vice Admiral Frederick J. Home 's warning of a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient until 1949 if need be . <P> Discounting Future Gains . Why should the U.S. look at the same set of facts as the enemy and also find cause for concern ? Basically , it was because the U.S. had always counted on receiving substantial help from General " Vinegar Joe " Stilwell 's Chinese legions and Major General Claire L. Chennault 's Fourteenth Air Force in reaching the China coast from the east . Now the China coast , and U.S. air bases within 400 miles of it , were being lost , perhaps for the duration . Many a U.S. strategist had taken for granted that soon after General MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines , an entry could be forced into China through a port or ports opposite Luzon ( such as Hong Kong or Swatow ) . <P> Thus the U.S. was concerned over short-term prospects ; Japan was concerned over the long-term outlook . MacArthur 's return to the Philippines had still not been jeopardized . But advances beyond that had been made immeasurably more difficult by Japan 's powerhouse campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly army or air force to give assault forces an assist on the China beaches , it may well be necessary for the U.S. to stage the China coastal operation from Formosa - and Formosa , 225 miles long , mountainous , fortified by the Japs since 1895 , can be captured only by a bloody major campaign . <P> Hirohito 's Hosts . Japan 's Army today is at least as strong as it was on Dec. 7 , 1941 - perhaps stronger . Its 4,000,000 soldiers are organized in 70 combat divisions of about 20,000 men each , plus almost twice as many reserves and service troops . The 70 divisions are distributed : eight in the home islands ; ten in Burma , Thailand , Indo-China and Malaya ; 20 in the Philip pines , the Netherlands Indies and Pacific islands ; 32 in China and Manchuria . In southeast Asia the Japs also have 70,000 quisling troops - Burmese , Malays , Thais and a few Indians . Militarily these are an unknown quantity .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
