Gian-Carlo Menotti has a talent for making small things go over big . He has even been overpraised as a new Puccini . Last year , a pair of his chamber operas , The Telephone and The Medium , were a surprise Broadway hit ( TIME , March 3 , 1947 ) . Last week , Menotti gave New York a look at two of his earlier operas , and proved again that a night at the opera can be almost as much fun as a circus . <P> Amelia Goes to the Ball , which was no crashing success when produced at the Metropolitan Opera ten years ago , is a rambunctious drawing-room farce about a woman who is so anxious to get to a ball that she cracks her husband over the head with a vase , has her lover arrested , and finally sweeps off with the chief of police . Beside The Old Maid and the Thief , the other half of the evening 's bill , it seemed pretty thin . <P> The Old Maid was originally written for the perishable market place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-town spinster who plays hostess to a hobo until he runs off with her maid and car . The libretto is a gag-writer 's dream , filled with skillful swoons ( by Marie Powers , star of The Medium ) , gay tunes , and amateur-theatrical hamming . The audience loved every minute of it , right down to the final clinch and the hero 's preposterous curtain line- " Your mouth is an abyss . " <P> Composer Menotti , who dislikes most modern music ( " Where is the melody ? " ) , is a man who crams his own with things to hum . Critics sometimes complain that his music sounds 19th Century and facile . But audiences take it at its own cheerful level , and eat it up .
