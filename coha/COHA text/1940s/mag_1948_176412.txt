The old grad had gone back to Oxford for a casual visit . Three days later he came away so shaken and distressed that he dashed off an article about it for the New Statesman and Nation . <P> Oxford , he wrote ( signing himself simply " Oxonian " ) , had become a hotbed of fascism . " Rather smart young men " with a taste for " fast cars and camel-hair coats " were displaying the books of Sir Oswald Mosley on their tables . They could be heard saying at their private binges that " soon we shall all have to be fascists , whether we like it or not . " <P> The Greenness of Grass . What had happened to Oxford-or that splinter of it that " Oxonian " had stubbed his toe on ? " Oxonian " thought one man was largely to blame-a wan and wispy philosopher named Alfred Jules ( " Freddie " ) Ayer . Ayer 's book , Language , Truth and Logic , had " acquired almost the status of a philosophic Bible " at Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goodness were , philosophically speaking , nonsense . They were moral sentiments , not facts at all . Such heresies , " Oxonian " thought , left no place for human values , created the moral void fascism required . <P> At once the letters column of the New Statesman bristled with arguments pro &; con Freddie Ayer . Did his philosophy really lead to fascism ? One professional philosophizer who sided with " Oxonian " was bush-bearded C.E.M . Joad . To accept Ayer 's assumptions , wrote Joad , would be to agree " that there is no meaning in the universe . . . that it means nothing to say that Beethoven is a greater musician than Mr. Sinatra . . . that all talk about God ... is twaddle . " <P> All last month the argument went on . Readers argued about Ayer and surrealism , Ayer and mathematics , Ayer and the greenness of grass . One philosopher who paid little heed was Freddie Ayer himself . Last week , far from Oxford and the New Statesman , he was in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Agony of Philosophy . At 37 , and with only two books to his credit , Freddie Ayer has become Britain 's most discussed younger philosopher , the chief apostle of a school which its followers call " Logical Positivism . " Freddie Ayer himself is a man who hates to get up in the morning and finds writing philosophy agony ( " I smoke cigarette after cigarette , twirl my watch chain , and all that sort of thing " ) . The son of a small businessman , he made his way on scholarships through Eton ( " I was n't awfully happy there " ) and Oxford ( " The people were much cleverer than one " ) . He stayed on at Oxford as a lecturer , then ( at 34 ) Fellow and Dean of Wadham College . In 1947 , he left for a professorship at London University . <P> Freddie Ayer thinks that philosophy is scientific in temper , has no business preaching moral or esthetic precepts . There are only two sorts of meaningful statements , he says-those based on observable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ayer 's philosophy , statements like " There is a God " are neither true nor false , since he regards them as unverifiable . It means nothing to say , " That man is good to support his mother . " The fact is that the man supports his mother . Calling him good merely expresses an attitude towards the action .
