txt Reciprocal Pacts Favored They Are Regarded as at Least a Step In the Direction We Should Go To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK , TIMES : Certain news items in the papers today are of vital interest not only because of the war but because it is imperative that we should have a clear comprehension of the nature of international trade . One item refers to the speech of Sir Louis Beale pointing out that prosperous world trade does not consist of one-way traffic . Another item from Washington speaks of the foreign trade of the United States as " maintaining its recent high level . " Both imports and ' exports were up sharply ; but , as is the rule in the United States , exports largely exceeded imports . It has been traditional to speak of a favorable balance of trade , but this meant an excess of exports over imports ; and it does not require the . mind of an Aristotle to deduce that , under such conditions and taking into account all so-called invisible items , the nation which persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash from foreign purchases not balanced by foreign sales . This is the modern form of mercantilism and should need no argument to prove ' its essential unsoundness . Recently-commentators on the present situation have maintained that , through our gold purchases , we are paying for the war . While this is a foolish statement , there is indeed an aspect of our gold purchases which is of critical importance to us . It is not so much the receipt of perhaps eight or ten billions of gold which would not otherwise have come to us through the flight of capital which disturbs us , but it is the continuance of a policy of selling more than we buy , as if it were a virtue . Policy Due to Resources This is part and parcel of the protectionism which has characterized the United States under every kind of administration since about 1812 . The country has been , with notable exceptions , substantially agreed upon this policy , largely because we have had such great resources . Now we might continue to sell our ' natural products and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have any  --  indefinitely ; but , as in the case of mining , an extractive industry is eventually exhausted . Those who point out that our gold is useless are , without question , uninformed about what gold actually does and what it might do . Nevertheless , they are quite right in saying that to exchange our automobiles , our wheat , our oil , our iron , our copper , indefinitely , for a metal whose only important value is in connection with money would be an unprofitable bargain . But that is telescoping a whole series of operations to make a formula . The matter is far more complex and far less reprehensible than such a statement would indicate . Little as I approve the devaluation of the dollar in 1933-34 , foolish as I believe it was to bid up gold so high or at all , I recognize that much of the gold would have come to us under the old valuation . The matter is one of which no summary can be made with justice . Gold , in any case , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural resources of the United States and the production from year to year , the total gold of the world is an insignificant sum . If we shall maintain a policy of giving out more than we get back for the sake of a shibboleth like " favorable balance of trade , " . some day or other we shall find ourselves with nothing to sell . Course of Trade Impeded At present , under war conditions , with all the world wanting our products , we are forced- to continue to export more than we import ; but such a situation should not be looked upon favorably as a permanency . This country will probably continue to be protectionist until something jars us out of that position , as Great Britain was so long free-trader until dire necessity made her change her position . In days of nationalisms , when every country is trying to be self-sufficient and when each nation strives to force upon all who trade with it its own currency , the course of trade is so impeded as to render it much less effective than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My object in writing this letter is simply to point out to all and sundry the immortal truth that one ca n't have one 's cake and eat it too . Secretary Hull 's reciprocal trade agreements may not be the last word in wisdom ; but they are , in my judgment , a distinct step in the direction of a trade which , will be profitable to all nations rather than to one or two . In a day when the farming population is heavily subsidized to compensate it for the greater prosperity of industry , it would certainly be logical to subsidize a particular industry hurt by a freer trade in order to get the advantage of international flow of trade and diminish national jealousies . At present trade is warfare . In some senses it will always be so ; and yet Sir Charles Mallet once said , " Trade is exchange and not a form of burglary . " Mr. Hull 's agreements will be entirely inoperative during the war and probably for some time after its close ; but it is well to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in order that we may have a ' correct starting place when the time comes to try to rebuild international trade . GEORGE CLARKE COX . New York , March 27 , 1940 . Bus Terminals Rouse Complaint To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The location of bus terminals on side streets is an infernal nuisance and the sooner the big interstate and suburban vehicles are made to discharge passengers at points away from the center of the city the better . I refer particularly to the terminal on Forty-third Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue . When it comes time for a bus to start , it starts ; if the street is congested it stops on the sidewalk , blocking all pedestrian traffic . Last night three of these unwieldy vehicles departed , one after the other , and each one blocked the sidewalk ; there was no opportunity for pedestrians to pass between them . - Of course , the buses are a great convenience to a great many people , but their departure on the minute is not so important as to warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the terminal to employ a signalman to give drivers the word to go when the street is clear . It would be better , however , to keep the buses out of midtown ; after all , the convenience and time of pedestrians are fully as important as those of bus passengers . ? L. A. E. New York , April 3 , 1940 . Label Held Inappropriate " Pork Barrel " Called Wrong Tag for River and Harbor Legislation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yon TIMES : Year after year the opponents of river and harbor legislation try to kill it by derision . " Pork barrel , " they say ; meaning that the bill carries appropriations for projects without merit except political . The astounding thing is that so many believe it , despite the fact that river and harbor legislation is entirely free from pork , by reason of the method of its adoption and enactment , and has been so for a generation . In the first place , Congress does not appropriate for particular projects . It appropriates lump sums to be spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means at the selection of the chief of engineers , U. S. A. ) from a list of approved projects . And what are these approved projects ? They are projects that have been certified economically sound after long study by the Corps of Engineers , U. S. A. , made first by the district officer , reviewed by his superior , the division engineer ; then by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors , and finally by the chief of engineers . No part of the study is perfunctory . Many projects are rejected . Having passed that test , they go to the River and Harbor Committee of the House , and if approved by them they are incorporated in the River and Harbor Authorization Bill , which carries no money . When the bill becomes law , they become approved projects , to which the Secretary of War may allot funds when made available by Congress . There is no form of Government expenditure subjected to closer scrutiny as to its worth . Not to use too strong a word , labeling such legislation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impugn the integrity of the Corps of Engineers and its chief , the integrity of the River and Harbor Committee , and the members of the House and Senate . The use of such a weapon suggests a bad cause . DURWARD H. PRIMROSE ! , Editor , Marine Journal . New York , April 3 , 1940 . Subway Plan Amplified TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter in THE TIMES , concerning subway fares , Earnest Flagg neglected to mention one beneficial consideration of great importance which would accrue from its adoption , that is to say the vast increase in capacity of the subways and the consequent decrease in congestion . At present , it is the express trains which carry the bulk of the traffic , but if the fare on them was doubled that situation would almost certainly be reversed , for there can be no doubt that a large proportion of those who now crowd those trains would prefer to ride in the locals at half the cost . This increased pressure on the local trains would doubtless require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for ten cars , but the benefit would be worth many times its cost . Moreover , the plan would add so enormously to the operating revenue of the roads as to quickly offset the cost of all necessary changes . L. J. SMYTH . New York , April 3 , 1940 . Suggestions for Flushing To THE EDITOR OF THE NEvr YORK TIMES : Simultaneously with the flowers that bloom in the Spring , we have with us once again a bargain ticket to the Fair , called the " Family Souvenir Book , " designed especially for the family , permitting Mother , Dad and the youngsters " to see the great Fair together . " Now if the directors want to attract the family and want their slogan , " Bring the Family to the Fair , " to be really effective , they must issue a family season ticket , enabling the family to visit the Fair when and as often as it so desires . I think $15 would be a fair price for a family of four . Also I suggest that intrafair bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , April 2 , 1940 . War Losses Questioned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : When Premier Molotoff places Russia 's losses at 200,000 in the Finnish campaign one may accept that as a minimum . If they were lower we may be sure that he would say so . However , when he places the Finnish losses at 300,000 it is easy to be seen that he indulges ? in wild guesswork . If such a story were true then the Finnish Army would have been wiped out of existence . JOHN J. STRYKER . Madison , N. J .. April 2 , 1940.
