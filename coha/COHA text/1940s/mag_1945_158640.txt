THE THEATER <P> Memphis Bound ( lyrics &; music by Don Walker &; Clay Warnick ; book by Albert Barker &; Sally Benson ; produced by John Wildberg ) was first conceived as a swing H.M.S. Pinafore , later converted into an extravaganza about a Negro troupe who put on Pinafore to get their grounded showboat ( the Calliboga Queen ) off the Mississippi mudflats . But their version proves too much for their lady producer , and she bangs down the curtain on it . <P> She bangs down the curtain on much the best part of the show . Though this jive and boogie-woogie romp may have Gilbert &; Sullivan spinning in their graves , they ca n't be spinning any faster than things do on the stage while Pinafore holds it . Thereafter the show gets grounded , along with the showboat . The plot trails off , without even leaving footprints , in all directions ; the people go through a lot of boisterous but baffling antics ; a dream fantasia nominally involving Gilbert &; Sullivan 's Trial By Jury gets wedged somewhere into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is slaphappy , Memphis Bound adds up to an agreeable evening . For one thing , it has Bill Robinson at 67 tapping superbly , still doing his famous staircase dance effortlessly , and more of a personality than ever , It also has Avon Long ( Porgy &; Bess ) who darts and dances like a salamander with a sense of style . It has attractive girls , gay and colorful sets , brilliantly gaudy costumes , hot dance routines . There is plenty of fizz in Memphis Bound , but it ought to be better bottled .
