Harry Truman 's vacation on the Presidential yacht Williamsburg had been going badly . In Narragansett Bay he had encountered wind , cold and rain . Then he had found himself struggling against the nameless indignities of seasickness . As the yacht rolled southeast on her hunt for the sun he had bribed his queasy stomach with seasick pills . But now , in the harbor of Hamilton , Bermuda , the deck was solid , the water blue , and there were white coral , pastel walls and green foliage ashore . <P> He found himself liking Bermuda better &; better . The crowd that greeted him at the pier was friendly and polite . The formalities were simple . He rode to the Governor 's palace in an open , horse-drawn landau , spent a few minutes , rode back . After that he savored his leisure as he pleased . <P> He sunned himself on the yacht 's fantail , went swimming , loafed , read . One day jovial Crony George Allen persuaded him , against his better judgment , to take a fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else in the party-13 pounds all told . Even better , Major General Harry A. Vaughan got seasick while the President did not feel a qualm . <P> As the hot , sleepy days slipped by the President 's tan deepened ; he toured the island by automobile , took morning walks past semitropical flowers , spent lazy evenings on the yacht . At week 's end he was considering prolonging his visit , returning to Washington by plane at the last possible minute .
