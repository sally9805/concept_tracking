In the Ottawa Evening Citizen , Reader David Forbes told of a chance meeting in a cafe with a Royal Canadian Air Force flyer : <P> He was sitting at the next table when I sat down-a fresh-faced young man . . . . He did not look a day older than 21 , I decided . He just sat there looking at the wall opposite and , after a moment , produced a packet of cigarets and began to fumble in his pocket for a match . I struck my lighter and ... he smiled his thanks . <P> " Have you been over yet ? " I asked . <P> " Yes , since before Dunkirk . " <P> " What was it like ? " <P> " They 'd have been licked if Hitler had invaded . . . . " <P> " They did try it-did n't they ? " <P> " So they say . " <P> " You must have seen a lot of action ? " <P> " Yes , I was in the Battle of Malta , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japs must be really tough fighters , " I said . <P> " They are-better fighters than the Germans . . . . " <P> <P> " Are you home for good ? " I said . <P> " No , on furlough . I 'll be going back in two months . . . . " <P> " You 're going back ! " <P> " Yes , although I 'll be in another department . " His voice was subdued and he stared at the wall opposite . " I love it , " he added . " Up there . " His eyes indicated the strip of blue sky visible through the window . . . . <P> <P> Several people stood before our tables with trays in their hands and we both rose . <P> " Where do you pay ? " the airman asked . <P> " Down at the counter . " <P> And as he put on his coat , I noticed that there were several fingers missing from his left hand . He moved slowly with a slight limp . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his not having become accustomed to his artificial left leg .
