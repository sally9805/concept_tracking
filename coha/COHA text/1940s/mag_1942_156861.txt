( See Cover ) <P> The first year was ending , and it had been a Navy year . The tall , taut man who is both Commander in Chief of the U.S. Fleet ( COMINCH ) and Chief of Naval Operations ( OPNAV ) let his mind go back to the morning of Pearl Harbor , and observed that the Japanese probably had not expected their attack to be so successful . Said Admiral Ernest Joseph King : " If they had it to do over , I think you would probably find them moving in with a tremendous invasion force such as they brought against us at Midway . " <P> He smiled , and his face for a moment was not wholly bleak . <P> " Of course , " he said , " if we had it to do over , we would do differently too . " <P> <P> Had the Japs , then , lost the war by missing their main chance to seize Pearl Harbor and drive the U.S. from the Pacific on the first Dec. 7 ? Admiral King answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor that they are not going to finish . We are going to win this war . " <P> The Admiral . When the Japanese bombs and torpedoes shattered the peace and sleep of Pearl Harbor , Admiral King was on the Navy 's second ocean , directing the Atlantic Fleet 's undeclared war of 1941 . In mid-December , when he was summoned to Washington to be COMINCH of all the fleets , " Betty " Stark was doing his limited best as OPNAV . The Utah and the Arizona gaped from their graves at Oahu , ships slightly more fortunate were being readied for removal and repair , and bombed planes still made ugly piles on the Army fields . The Japs were closing on Manila , hacking away the last Army air forces in the Philippines ; MacArthur was looking to Corregidor and Bataan , and Admiral Hart 's Asiatic " Fleet " of cruisers and destroyers was on its way to glory and futility in the Indies . Guam had fallen ; Wake had a few days of glory left . The Japs were in Malaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Repulse-pillars of British and U.S. sea power in the western Pacific-were gone . People at home were saying that the whole U.S. fleet was at the bottom of the Pacific , and profane Admiral King was saying to his colleagues at the Navy Department : <P> " When they get into trouble , they always send for the sons of bitches . " <P> This remark accurately summarized both Admiral King 's reputation in the prewar Navy and the principal reason for his commanding the wartime Navy . Few men in peace or war have known " Rey " King well enough to find the warm self behind his hard , hazel eyes . Well does he know that others in the Navy hold him to be a brutal and forthright man , savage in his judgments and merciless in his expression of them , uncompromising and often extreme in his demands upon his subordinates , a man who can be as forbidding in family crises as he is on a bridge or at a Navy desk . <P> He takes a certain pride in this reputation . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print ( TIME , June 2 , 1941 ) , his curses roared through the Navy Building . But officers who knew him smiled at each other . " I think he rather liked it , " one of them said .
