txt Before and after enabling Howard Hughes to get a war contract for ' photo reconnaissance planes , Elliott Roosevelt was expensively entertained on both coasts by - Mr. Hughes ' publicity man , the Senate War Investigating Subcommittee brought out today . The press agent himself , John W. Meyer , conceded that this was done because Mr. Roosevelt , the late President 's son , had the power to recommend , and successfully did . recommend over high-ranking War Department objectors , that the job be awarded to Mr. Hughes . It in= volves about $22,000,000 in Government expenditures for three craft , one a static test model and two to fly . The first flying ship crashed last year ; the second hum yet to be delivered to the Government . Photo copies of expense account : items put into the record indicated that Mr. Meyer altogether had spent exactly $5,083.79 of Mr. Hughes ' money under the general heading of " entertainment " for Mr. Roosevelt , an Air Forces colonel and later a brigadier general , from . the summer of 1943 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , now Mr. Roosevelt 's wife , fie , ured largely in these parts . Gifts to Girl Guests Many other guests , however sometimes as many as a dozen at one time , were on Mr. Meyer 's list of affairs , which included dinners , night club evenings and gifts to unidentified girls . The amount spent on Mr. Roosevelt personally and on Miss Emerson , who on one occasion received $132 worth of nylon stockings , thus was not separable from the general bills . Mr. Meyer declared that he had done nothing more than was " done by every aircraft manufacturer in the business " and that Mr. Roosevelt was " one of one thousand and one Army and Navy officers " to whom he had given his hospitality . R. H. Sherwood , assistant con , troller of the Hughes Aircraft Company , asked the subcommittee to " take note " that the Govern ? ment 's arrangement with the company was on a lump sum , rather than a cost-plus basis . He conceded , however , that Mr. Meyer 's expenses were deductible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought before the subcommittee in a three-hour session that broke up , shortly after noon , in a bitter and clamorous row . As Chairman Homer Ferguson , Republican , of Michigan , cried out an adjournment of proceedings un . til Monday , a Republican committee member , Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington . had just demanded a Department of Justice investigation of Mr. Meyer 's wartime draft deferments . Committee Procedure Hit Thomas Slack of Houston , Tex/ a Hughes attorney , in turn was still denouncing the subcommittee as one denying legal rights " recognized for a thousand years , " while Mr. Ferguson beat upon the table to end the hearing . " This is no place to ascertain the truth ! " Mr. Slack shouted above the applause of some spectators . " Your rules ( of procedure ) ' do not even purport to arrive at justice . " In recessing until Monday morning , Senator Ferguson announced his intention to hear both Mr. Meyer and Mr. Roosevelt on that day . He observed that he would " take under advisement " Senator Cain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate Mr. Meyer . Senator Cain had asserted that Mr. Meyer , although actually relations man and " buffer ' for Mr. Hughes , had in fact beer described to his draft board az " assistant to the president of the Hughes Aircraft Company it charge of contract negotiations ' as well as public relations . Mils statement had been made , the Senator contended , by a " Mr. Coxe , " who dealt in selective service matters for the company . " There is sufficient evidence , ' Mr. Cain said in summing up , " te believe that Mr. Meyer on several occasions was unreasonably deferred . I now ask , Mr. Chairman , that Meyer 's draft status and his six deferments be referred to the Department of Justice for what-ever action it may see fit to take . " Senator Cain had begun his preliminary interrogation of the publicity man on this point without at first advising him of his legal right to refuse answers to self-incriminating questions . He shortly told the witness of these rights , as did Senator Ferguson , after Mr. Slack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under the impression , " Mr. Slack broke in from the end of the committee table , " that this was an investigation of the Hughes Aircraft Company . " I have always understood that the Department of Justice was competent to investigate the draft status of private citizens and that this was not a function of the United States Senate . " I am sure the Department of Justice would be glad to make an inquiry , where all the evidence , instead of part of it , could be heard . " Senator Cain , insisting that the nature of his interrogation was proper , asserted that nothing was more germane to an inquiry into the prosecution of the war than to " see that justice is done . " He observed then that he intended to " adopt " Mr. Slack 's suggestion that the Department of Justice go into the matter . Lawyer Quores Brewster Mr. Slack had stated that Senator Owen Brewster , Republican , of Maine , chairman of the full investigating committee , himself had proclaimed the propriety of leaving to the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reference to a statement issued by Mr. Brewster in his long exchange of accusations with Mr. Hughes . Senator Brewster interposed that what he had said was not alone that he would " welcome " an investigation by the Justice Department of Mr. Hughes ' charges against him , but that he also would appear before the subcommittee itself to make his reply . Mr. Slack contended that the positions were not parallel and that non-official persons before the subcommittee were not given the right of cross-examination or the right to hear " both sides of a case . " He was certain , he added , that Mr. Meyer , who was sitting quietly alongside , would be glad to submit to an investigation where he had those rights . " But in reply to you , " he cried out to the subcommittee , and specifically to Senator Cain , " you say you seek the truth . I believe that Senator Ferguson himself , as a former jurist , must admit that it has been recognized for a thousand years that the truth can not be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossexamined . These things are not permitted before this committee . " In the uproar , Mr. Meyer called out that he was offering no objection to answering any question , but that he wanted first to talk to Mr. Slack . The whole matter was put aside by the adjournment . Leaving the committee room then , Mr. Slack issued a supplemental statement in which he asserted in part : " Do the people of the United States realize that this subcommittee of the United States Senate is exercising a supposed power to attempt to blacken the reputation of any private citizen it may choose , by hand-picked ' witnesses ' publicly to defame his character ? and all this without affording to anyone the right to cross-examine any witness who may accuse him ? " Perhaps most of us enjoy sensational headlines at the expense of the other fellow , but do the people realize that what happens to the other fellow in this case may some day happen to them ? " What could be more misleading than Senator Brewster 's offer to ' appear ' under oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call such witnesses as he may choose to testify about Senator Brewster ? Of what avail would Senator Brewster 's testimony be unless Mr. Hughes were permitted to test it from other sources of fact ? " Before all this , Mr. Meyer had been taken , item by item , by Senator Ferguson over his expense accounts . Parties in New York Clubs These showed , among other things , that on the evening of the day that he had made his recommendation to Gen. H. H. Arnold for the award of the Hughes contract , Mr. Roosevelt , along with others , was entertained by Mr. Meyer in New York City at a total cost of $106.50 . This was Aug. 20 , 1943 . The money was spent at the " 21 Club , " the Stork Club and El Morocco Club , and Mr. Meyer at the same time bought $115 worth of liquor for his Ritz Towers apartment , in which Mr. Roosevelt was a visitor . Mr. Meyer said he " believed " he had been told at that time by Mr. Roosevelt , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his official mission to find and recommend a photo-reconnaissance plane , that the official report would favor Mr. Hughes . Senator Ferguson brought out that Mr. Meyer , coming East on Aug. 19 , 1943 , toward what turned put to be seven days of entertainment of Mr. Roosevelt and others at a total cost of about $1,500 , had traveled on an air priority and had Deen accompanied on the plane by Miss Emerson . Miss Emerson 's presence , he asserted , was only a " pleasant coin-idence , " although she was among the guests , with Mr. Roosevelt , at : he subsequent New York parties . Mr. Meyer , who told the subcommittee that it was he who introtined Miss Emerson to Mr. Roosefelt and that he was one of those nvited to President Roosevelt 's 000 , but Mr. Sherwood , as an accountant , said this was " not out of line " for such bills to comparable firms in the war years . The publicity agent , holding a handkerchief and occasionally rubbing his perspiring face , told the subcommittee in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check " and added : " In all my war , nobody else ever picked up one . " Asked repeatedly by Senator Ferguson " What had all this to do with the war effort , " Mr. Meyer always replied in substance simply that he was " acting for Mr. Hughes . " To the question why be bought Miss Emerson a $132 lot of nylon stockings on Aug. 25 , 1943 , and gave her " cash to travel home " to California , he replied : " She had been very charming . The money to go home was $20 . I had taken her to the airport ( in New York ) and she discovered she had no money with her . I gave her $20 . I felt that Was very gracious . " Recommendation in Record The full text of the recommendation made by Mr. Roosevelt to General Arnold for the Hughes photo reconnaissance plane contract was read into the record for the first time by Senator Claude Pepper , Democrat , of Florida , after Senator Ferguson had proposed only to summarize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mean/ time , had audibly protested Mr. Pepper 's request that it all be read , saying this was " a filibuster . " It turned out to be a document of some 3,000 words in. which Mr. Roosevelt took sharp dips at War Department materiel officers in the United States , denouncing some as " incompetent . " After reporting from the viewpoint of an operations officer who had commanded a photo reconnaissance wing overseas , on his objections to the production in some other plants , Mr. Roosevelt " urgently recommended " Mr. Hughes . He did so , he explained to General Arnold , because his survey , had convinced him that " the Hughes plane represents the only possible improvement in sight . " The reconnaissance planes then in flight overseas , he asserted , were too slow , and Mr ; Hughes was the one designer who had spent " a , decade and $5,000,000 of his own money in trying to develop the sort of craft seriously needed . " funeral , identified a single expense account item for $200 as " presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York dinner for the late President 's son . He declared himself unable to recall what these gifts had been . Again , on a summary of the expense account items prepared by the subcommittee was shown an expenditure of $50 for " girls at hotel ( late ) . "
