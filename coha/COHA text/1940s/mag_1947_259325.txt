In Prague last week the inveterate optimism of those who regard international sports as international cure-alls was justified for once . An Austrian ice hockey team accomplished what statesmen had tried in vain-to make the Czechs love their former masters . <P> In the International Amateur Hockey tournament the Austrians won a last-minute victory over Sweden ( whose team was suffering from a group hangover after a pre-game celebration ) . This left Czechoslovakia in top place . <P> Cheering wildly , Czechs in the grandstands threw their silver cigaret lighters to the Austrians . So many gifts of butter , meat , poultry , chocolate and liquor piled in on the Axa Hotel , where the Austrians were staying , that the management turned the lobby into a temporary warehouse . Flags flew in Brno . Pilsen begged the Austrians to visit its best hotel . And in two coal mines of Ostrava , miners promised to work two extra shifts digging coal for Austria . In hockey-happy Czechoslovakia the joke of the week was a cartoon showing a man carrying a bag overflowing with rare food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a black marketeer . " " Oh , no , " comes the answer . " Just an Austrian . "
