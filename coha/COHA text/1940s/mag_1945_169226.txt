Out of the darkness of censorship and isolation , radio waves brought a troubled voice from Russian-occupied Rumania . It was the voice of Premier Nicolai Radescu , a greying professional soldier with scant political experience but a strong executive hand . General Radescu had taken office last December with approval of the Allied Control Commission . His chief task was to forge a Government of " national unity " to carry out Moscow 's armistice terms . Now he complained bitterly that the leftist National Democratic Front ( N.D.F. ) was obstructing his every effort . <P> The Premier had planned to address the country from Scala Hall , a Bucharest movie house . But 1,000 N.D.F. strong-arm men , he said , had barred his entry , shouted : " Down with General Radescu ! " <P> " What was I to do ? " asked the Premier . " The underlying idea of the meeting was to enable me to speak to the people , to the representatives of all classes and all political parties-because I do not belong to any party . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had got there through force and with the definite purpose of preventing others from coming in . " <P> The Premier found another hall for his speech . But all Bucharest printers were ordered by their trade union not to print it . Premier Radescu ordered the Government censor " to censor nothing whatever in . . . the papers enjoying the trade union 's support , even if they were to print insults addressed to me . " He added : " I do not care to stay in the position I am now holding if the country does not wish it . " This seemed to suit the N.D.F. 's apparent purpose : to force out Radescu , force in a leftist Government .
