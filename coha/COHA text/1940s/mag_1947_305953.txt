In a vague sort of way , Arizonans had known for months that Governor Sidney Osborn , 63 , was a sick man . Last week , in the midst of a violence-ridden strike of lettuce packers , they learned how ill he really was . <P> Governor Osborn had summoned strikers and employers to his home for a long , exhaustive conference . His visitors were shocked at his condition ; they could hardly understand a word he said , even though he repeated it five or six times . Next day , he collapsed . His doctor ordered him to bed and broke the news to the public . The governor 's condition , he said , was exceedingly precarious . He was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the creeping paralysis that killed baseball 's Lou Gehrig . A cold , a nervous shock , even a bad sneezing spell might mean the end , at any time . <P> Tough as Mesquite . It was hard to believe . Sidney Osborn seemed as permanent a part of Arizona as mesquite , and as tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes crinkled against the glare of its deserts . His grandfather had owned the land where the Capitol now stood . Sidney himself had had a part in Arizona politics since boyhood . He had been the youngest member of the constitutional convention , and served three terms as secretary of state . In some 16 years as a publisher , he made Dunbar 's Weekly famous throughout the state for tart , pointed political comment . <P> As a schoolboy , he had scrawled in a textbook " Sidney P. Osborn , Governor of Arizona . " After he was elected in 1941 , he declared : " Only the voters or death will take me out of here . " Tall and husky , he worked 15 to 16 hours a day . He drove himself hard , his balky legislature harder . But any citizens who wanted to talk things over just called him up-he always answered the phone himself , at home or at the office . The voters liked that . In the last three elections , he carried every county in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began over a year ago . Once his legs suddenly gave way , and he fell . Once , in the middle of a speech , his voice thickened unaccountably . Through the summer and fall , his condition grew steadily worse . His chauffeur and companion , husky Jack Hirsh , had to lift him from car to wheelchair in the daily trip between home and office , wheel him around the Capitol , carry him to the rest room . Said one friend : " Old Sidney is just too ornery to stay at home and die . " <P> The doctor 's gloomy announcement last week made Old Sidney more ornery than ever . Defiantly , he heaved himself out of bed and summoned newsmen to his office . He issued a typewritten statement announcing that he was calling three special 20-day sessions of the legislature , starting next month . He had quieted the lettuce strike by calling out the National Guard . As long as his mind remained clear , Sidney Osborn intended to remain governor-until the voters or death removed him .
