txt Autographs and War Bonds During the remainder of this baseball season , and next year if necessary , although I hope not , I suggest that an autographed baseball be given to every fan ' purchasing a $25 war bond and also paying the cost of the ball . In this way the club owners will not lose anything and the government will be helped in a big way . I also suggest that the visiting teams , as well as the home clubs , participate in this bond-selling movement . Thus a fan Could have baseballs containing the autographs of members of the sixteen major league teams brought to him without leaving his backyard . JOHN THOMAS TOXICR . Brooklyn , July 3 , 1943 .
