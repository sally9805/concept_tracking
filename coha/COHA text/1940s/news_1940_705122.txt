txt Mr. Fish Elaborates Stand Representative Backs Willkie Principles and Favors Aid to Britain To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I want to thank THE NEW YORK TIMES for publishing my letter in its issue of Oct. 26 , as I was certain it would in accordance with its well-known advocacy of freedom of speech and freedom of the press and its usual spirit of fairness . I do most emphatically endorse all of Mr. Willkie 's recent statements on foreign policies  --  including his charge that we will be at war by April if the thirdterm candidate is elected  --  and his plea for all possible aid for Great Britain short of war . Your editorial footnote implies an answer . I quote from the footnote , signed " Editor , THE TIMES " : " If Mr. Fish , who voted against repeal of the arms embargo a year ago , now favors all possible aid for Great Britain short of war , it would be interesting to know when he was converted to this view and when he announced his conversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a fair answer . Sympathetic to British When the Neutrality Law was amended to permit Great Britain to buy arms and ammunition in the United States , it became the law of the land , and I believe in upholding that law the same as any other statute . I am of English and Holland Dutch origin , and naturally sympathetic to the British , and as long as it does not involve us in war I am glad to have England buy arms , ammunition  --  including 12,000 airplanes ? steel , copper , lead , and anything we produce , and to expedite production for this purpose . The cash-and-carry provision in the law keeps our ships out of the war zones and minimizes the danger of war . We are making all our resources available to the British , and beyond that there is very little else short of war we can do . Great Britain has four billions of gold and a similar amount of securities left , and has not spent over one billion dollars here for war supplies . There is no reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we did in 1917-20 , and as a result of which we are still holding the bag to the tune of twelve billion dollars . There has been a great deal of misunderstanding in this country over help for Great Britain . I repeat , she can buy anything we produce and our entire resources and productive capacity are at her beck and call . The real issue is how much farther can we go short of war . After all , we do not determine what is short of war ; but the governments of Germany , Italy and Japan . I do not believe that even THE NEW YORK TIMES would advocate turning over our fleet or our air pilots to the British as being an act short of war . It is obvious to all Americans , except to those who clamor for blood and war , that it would constitute a cause of war and would actually be considered by all nations as an act of war . For Winkle Principles I expressed these same views in my district and elsewhere months ago regarding help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as Wendell Willkie 's , and has been ever since he made crystal clear his determination to keep the United States out of war except in defense of America and the Monroe Doctrine . The only difference I may have had with Mr. Willkie was on my sixty-day volunteer amendment , which was falsely described as a sixty-day delay amendment by the interventionist press , including THE NEW YORK TIMES , so that many readers honestly believed it would cause a delay of sixty days in the operation of the draft , when it could not have possibly caused one day or one minute 's delay . If my amendment had been adopted and President Roosevelt had issued a call for 400,000 volunteers for one year enlistments at $30 a month , he would probably have obtained most of them within sixty days , whereas it is not planned to induct any draftees before Nov. 18 and not more than 90,000 before Jan. 1 . My amendment specifically contained a provision that nothing in it would interfere with the registration , classification and induction into the service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment would have expedited enlistments and brought hundreds of thousands of American boys into our armed forces long before the draft could operate , and under no circumstances would have caused any delay . I repeat what I said at the time , " Veritas magna est et praevalebit "  --  the truth is mighty and will prevail . Move to Prevent War President Roosevelt in his Madison Square Garden speech quoted me as saying that we had the finest and greatest Navy in the world . That is true . We had a Navy equal to Great Britain when the Great White Father took over the Presidential office in 1933 , and we have comparatively an even more powerful Navy today owing to the war losses sustained by the British , German , Italian and French navies . Our Navy is six times larger than the German Navy and , for the first time since the advent of battleships , greater than the British Navy . I have so stated in the Congress and throughout the nation , to allay the war scare and hysteria purposely created by President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal and to help elect the third-term candidate and allegedly indispensable dictator . In the minds of the American people the Democratic party has become the party of intervention and war and the Republican party that of Americanism , national unity and peace . President Roosevelt 's reckless and provocative statements not only have caused widespread war hysteria but are rapidly driving us down the path to war . The issue is clear-cut  --  the American people have an opportunity in a solemn referendum on election day to stop the march to war by electing Wendell Willkie and a . Republican Congress . HAMILTON FIBS . New York , Oct. 31 , 1940 , Assets of Life Companies Attack on Stability of Insurance Syateni Viewed as Unwarranted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Mazer Letters sent out by the People 's Com ? mittee to Defend Life Insurance and Savings , of Philadelphia , state that the face value of life insurance during the past eight years has diminished by 50 per cent , that life insurance companies are in tottering financial condition and then charge that all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figures obtained from the Insurance Year Book pubs lished by the Spectator Company of Philadelphia , an organization devoted to publishing authenticated insurance statistics , proves conclusively that in 1928 life insurance companies had total assets of about $15,900,000,000 . Today the same companies have assets of $29 , . 000,000,000 . In 1928 approximately seventy life insurance companies had failed . Since 1936 a negligible few small companies caused any loss to policy holders . From 1928 to 1940 the surplus of policy , holders had increased approximately $475,000,000 . An analysis of figures furnished by Louis H. Pink , Insurance Commissioner for the State of New York , under date of Oct. 3 , further refutes the attack on life insurance companies . I quote from his letter to me in which he states that these companies wrote about 85 per cent of all life insurance in this country : " The American people should need no reassurance as to the safety and security of their investments in life insurance . There has not been a year during the depression in which the life insurance companies have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their policy holders . The same companies have also increased their surplus during the depression years . " This increase in assets and surplus has been made despite a substantial writing-off of doubtful investment values during these years . Despite the lower rate of interest earned as companies ' investments during recent years , which has resulted in somewhat reduced dividend scales in most companies , the ability of life insurance companies to fulfill their policy obligations has in no way been impaired . " It will be recalled that a few years ago a very few insurance companies were in need of financial assistance . The Roosevelt Administration came to their aid . The capital structures of ten insurance companies were strengthened to the extent of $34,475,000 . Demands of policy holders and other creditors resulted in a corporation authorizing $104,439,750 in loans to 133 insurance companies . HERMAN A. BAYERN , President , Association of Past Presidents of Insurance Brokers and Agents . New York , Oct. 23 , 1940 . Outlawing War Anticipated To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Concerning your recent editorial note " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ? You are quite right in saying that in the past , for about a century and a quarter , Germany fought all her wars on foreign soil but that " the new weapon which was to give Hitler a Blitz victory  --  namely , the airplane  --  has actually destroyed the immunity which Germany 's home popular tion has enjoyed in all earlier wars . " It is a matter of historical record ? is n't it ? ? that the only time the inhabitants of England fought on their native soil has been when they have been invaded . In every act of aggression ? whether in the New World or in the Old World  --  England has since 1066 fought all her wars and battles on other people 's lands , and mostly with the blood of other mothers ' sons , she herself supplying the gold for the carrying on of those wars . Is it too much to hope that , realizing the nature of war in all its fury , the plain people of both Germany and England will decide to outlaw war forevermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1940 . Our Endurance Not Doubted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEE : Anne O'Hare McCormick 's column of Oct. 28 was excellent , stating as it did the purposes of Hitler in using the peace bloc as an instrument in waging this war . But , inadvertently , I hope , Mrs. McCormick intimated that the people of the United States could not endure the horrors of war as well as the English . She states : " They ithe Europeans , have no faith in Hitler ; they have lost faith in themselves ; intellectually they know that their salvation depends on a British victory , but they think that it is far away , and they have been under intolerable strain longer than England , longer than people in this country could endure without an explosion . " Now it does seem that England is taking an awful shellacking , even worse than France took , but its courage is total against totalitarian ideas . And I think that our own people would rise to the occasion just as the English do . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an Axis which is now beginning to bend in the middle . J. MANN . Jamaica , N.
