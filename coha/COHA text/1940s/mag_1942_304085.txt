Do not despair , brave Norwegians ! Your land shall be cleansed , not only from the invader , but from the filthy quislings who are his tools ! <P> The promise made last summer was Winston Churchill 's . Last week 's reports from German-occupied Norway indicated plainly that it had fallen on fertile ground , for the tough little country was swept by a new wave of sabotage and open defiance . <P> Britain 's Commando raids may have been undertaken partly as morale builders , but Haakon VII 's German-hating subjects seem sold on the theory that Commando forays are preludes to an Allied invasion of Europe . Norse cooperation with the raiding parties is so flagrant that homes of persons identified with these invading shock troops are burned , their male relatives arrested . <P> German occupation authorities recently made wholesale arrests of former Norse military men , fumed impotently over knowledge that the best military brains were already in London with the Free Government-in-Exile , there to plot further Commando raids . In Stavanger eleven Norwegians were executed , including Carl Oftedal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fjellberg , a smith . Said Free Norway 's crack little U.S. news service , which has uncannily accurate underground contacts with the homeland : " The charges are believed to be espionage and sabotage . . . . " <P> One " filthy quisling " - the one with a capital Q - was reported to be a casualty . A Moscow report said that Vidkun Quisling had been wounded by an assassin . A London story held that the Norse renegade was so ill that his duties had been passed on to his Minister of Internal Affairs . From Oslo came an authenticated story which summed up all Norway : Sverre Riisnaes , Vidkun Quisling 's Minister of Justice , who is known to Free Norwegians as " Quisling 's Donald Duck , " informed an un-Nazified Oslo attorney that his license to practice law had been " revoked for life . " The answer was a fish-eyed stare , the bland query : " Whose life ? "
