Fred Sullens , editor of his own paper , can write what he wants to write , and does . Once , when a politician he opposed was scheduled to make a speech , Sullens announced : " There will be a buzzard swarming at Poindexter Park tonight . If you have buzzard appetite , go out and enjoy yourself . But please go home to do your puking . It costs money to clean public parks . . .. " Another time , when Mississippi 's Senator Theodore ( " The Man " ) Bilbo visited Europe after being elected a second term , Sullens wrote : " When Bilbo reached Denmark , the band played ' God Save the Queen ! " <P> Probably no U.S. editor is quite so tough , colorful , eloquent , prolific and unmindful of editorial niceties as 65-year-old , 185-pound Frederick Sullens of the Jackson ( Miss . ) Daily News . His paper is 50 years old this week and for 38 of those 50 years has come wet from the presses bristling with Sullens ' own pugnacious personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **35;1942;TOOLONG school of journalism , whose exponents backed up their words with their fists and divided all office visitors into two classes : 1 ) those without horsewhips ; 2 ) those with . <P> Once , after a fight , Sullens reported that a local politician , whom he named , " came to my office today . I beat hell out of him , his son and his dog . If anyone else is looking for trouble , he 'll find a man well preserved in his middle fifties well able to take care of himself . " <P> When a candidate for Governor of Mississippi threatened to " lick Fred Sullens , editor of the Jackson Daily Liar , " Sullens Page-Oned : " If nothing less than a few buckets of blood from the veins of the editor of Mississippi 's greatest newspaper will quench your thirst for human gore . . . you are cordially invited to come on and spill it if you can . Being the party threatened , the editor , under the traditional rules of the code duello , is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dung and shingles at the respectful distance of 40 paces , standing with his face to the wind . . . . " The " jpbj " was , as all Mississippians knew , Judge Paul B. Johnson ( later Governor ) , Sullens ' bitterest political foe . In May 1940 Johnson attacked Sullens with a cane in a Jackson hotel lobby ; both men were bloodied in the ensuing battle .
