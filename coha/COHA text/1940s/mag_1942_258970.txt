" Mr. Henderson , what makes Congress so mad at you ? " <P> This question , addressed to Price Boss Leon Henderson at a press conference last week , brought forth a belly laugh in the best-natured Henderson manner . ( The Price Boss has a great talent for Falstaffian waggery : he looks good on a Victory bicycle , sounds wonderful on Information , Please . ) It also brought a frank admission : " . . . my lack of politeness . They say you should never get so busy you ca n't be polite . But Shakespeare , I believe it was , divided people into four groups. * I belong to the group with a low boiling point .. . . I 've had plenty of flame applied to me , too . " <P> Leon Henderson well knew that his streak of sheer cussedness , the broadest in all Washington , had got him into lots of trouble . His bullying and ragging had driven Congress into a rage , yet he still exploded at the sight of a Senator . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goaded his critics with the warning of " more red tape " to come . When he took the price control job , he predicted that he would become the most unpopular man in the U.S.-and often it seemed that he had done his best to make his prediction look good . <P> Rumors flew thick &; fast in Washington last week that Leon Henderson was through as Price Boss . The rumors began when he resigned as Director of Civilian Supply and turned the job over to his deputy , Lawyer Joseph L. Weiner . They multiplied when the Truman Committee blasted his administration of fuel-oil rationing . Henderson 's press conference was designed to defend his record and spike the rumors-but it did not quite succeed . <P> Congress is so angry at Henderson now that it may refuse to vote his OPA any more funds so long as he remains director . In that event , neither huffing , puffing nor belly laughter can save Henderson 's job . <P> <P> * Mr. Henderson evidently referred to medieval medicine 's four " humours " - sanguine , choleric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
