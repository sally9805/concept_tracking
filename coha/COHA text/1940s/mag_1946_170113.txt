The harbor of grimy Liverpool , swept by racing tides and shrouded in fog or rain a good part of the year , is a nerve-tester for ship pilots . Last week the test was easier . At seven control stations along the Mersey basin , seven navy-type radars scanned the crowding river traffic . Their electronic eyes could pierce the blackest night , the soupiest fog or rain , spotting every ship , buoy , dock or shoreline . Dock masters could warn a scuttling ferry ( in appropriate nautical language ) that a long , lean liner was fixing to cut her in two . They could guide a blank-blank collier through the blank-blank sandbars . <P> A ship itself needed no radar or other special equipment . When the pilot climbed aboard outside the harbor , he carried a small portable radiotelephone . Over it , he hailed the shrouded shore . The nearest radar operator , watching through his " scope , " told precisely where the ship was , and what it had better do next . <P> Ships can now enter Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mersey 's mouth . Britain 's War Transport Ministry will soon set up radars at London and Southampton . Eventually it hopes to extend the system to all of Britain 's fog-plagued harbors . <P> Most U.S. harbors are not as foggy as Britain 's , but Navy authorities believe that a system like Liverpool 's would be " of definite value " in avoiding delays and collisions in thick weather . Plenty of radars are lying around , left over from the war . The Coast Guard , after a series of experiments in Delaware Bay , hopes soon to put some radar cops to work .
