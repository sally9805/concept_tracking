When scientists send up research rockets to probe the thin upper atmosphere , they generally kiss their instruments goodbye . Few scientific gadgets survive the impact when the spent rocket hits the earth at **27;11146;TOOLONG speed . Ordinary parachutes are no help because they are generally torn to shreds before they can waft the instruments to earth . <P> This week General Electric Co. described something called a " rotochute , " developed by Engineer I. B. Benson , to help bring rocket instruments safely back to the ground . It looks like a stocky arrow with two propeller-like blades hinged to the bulbous head that holds the instruments . <P> The rotochute is carried inside the rocket with the blades folded back . Blown free at the top of the rocket 's trajectory , it falls rapidly in the near-vacuum 60 to 100 miles up . When it reaches the denser atmosphere below , it straightens out and begins to revolve . The blades open . Spinning like a maple seed , the rotochute slows down and lands its load of instruments at a safe 27 m.p.h. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
