Wrong Dough <P> Sirs : <P> Everytime I read a headline , " Doughboys Invade Leyte , " or " Aachen Entered By Doughboys " I see red . Even if we Americans have been the richest nation of the world are we not delusioning ourselves if we accept the term " doughboy " as a synonym for " American " ? . . . <P> RICHARD A. BUFFUM <P> Editor <P> The Wesleyan Argus Wesleyan <P> University <P> Middletown , Conn . <P> Let Reader Buffum fash himself no more ; wherever it came from ( authorities disagree ) , " doughboy " has no money taint . According to H. L. Mencken ( The American Language ) : " Doughboy is an old English Navy term for dumpling ... is said to have originated in the fact that the infantrymen once pipe-clayed parts of their uniforms , with the result that they became covered with a doughy mass when it rained . " Alternative version : Civil War cavalrymen coined it as a term of kindly contempt for infantrymen ; it referred to the doughnut-shaped brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sirs : <P> Do TIME editors go in for New Year 's stock-takings and that sort of thing ? The question occurred to me when I recently read the following confession by the editor of a British magazine called Horizon : <P> " What have we lost or gained intellectually by five years of war ?

" <P> I wondered : Is this only a special mood induced by the special ravages of war in Britain ? Perhaps this British editor is more honest than American editors ? What I especially wondered was whether this British editor 's sentiment is one that TIME 'S editors share , secretly or otherwise . <P> FARLEY SMITH <P> New York City <P> Less fatigued than Horizon 's conscientious Editor Cyril Connolly , TIME editors sanguinely observe that pessimism among editors is not infrequently a sign of editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applauds the shrewd observation of Harvard 's late President Eliot : " Things seem to be going fairly well , now that a spirit of pessimism prevails in all departments .

TIME 'S apologies to Grandson Thaxter for confusing his grandmother , Poet Celia , with Actress Phyllis , a distant relative . In her day Celia Thaxter was famed for her poems for children ( notably The Sandpiper ) , her sketches of the grey New Hampshire coast and her summer garden " salon " on the Isles of Shoals , where her father , an exlighthouse-keeper , kept a popular hotel. - ED . <P> Sure Cure <P> Sirs : <P> Your amusing note on the Anti-Cigaret Alliance 's six methods to use in quitting the smoking habit is hilariously noted ( TIME , Nov. 27 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneysaving way to quit smoking : just stop . <P> GEORGE A.
