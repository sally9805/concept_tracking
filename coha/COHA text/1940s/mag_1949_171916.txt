NBC President Niles Trammell had a job of explaining to do . In recent months , CBS had charmed away five of his top attractions ( Jack Benny , Amos ' n ' Andy , Red Skelton , Frank Sinatra , Edgar Bergen ) , beat him to a big sixth ( Bing Crosby ) . NBC had lost talent to Columbia before , but never in such great clumps . The network 's 164 affiliated stations were uneasy and fidgety . <P> In Chicago 's Stevens Hotel last week-with eleven of his 14 vice presidents nodding approval-suave Niles Trammell soothed the affiliates ' angers and anxieties , sent them home convinced that NBC is still the biggest thing in radio since the invention of the crystal set . <P> NBC was not limiting itself , said Trammell , to buying up a few expensive shows " for this season at the expense of the future . " That other network , he noted , had had to borrow $5,000,000 to bring off its coups . And besides , radio could n't be " satisfied indefinitely with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . " But NBC was nonetheless glad to be keeping some of its own : Fibber McGee &; Molly , Phil Harris &; Alice Faye , Bob Hope , " Duffy 's Tavern . " Trammell had also thrown together , he revealed , 30 fresh programs , which will employ such well-known stars as Cinemactors Charles Boyer , Rosalind Russell , Olivia de Havilland , Gary Grant and James Mason , as well as Comics Dean Martin , Jerry Lewis and Henry Morgan . <P> Then Trammell 's executive vice president , Charles R. Denny , let go with what sounded almost like a declaration of war . NBC was going to stay on top as the nation 's No. 1 network . Said he : " It has the money and the resources to back up its plans . And , above all , it has the resolve to use its money , its experience , and its every effort for that purpose . "
