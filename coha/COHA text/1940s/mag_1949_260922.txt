Old Deacon Greenough of Deerfield , Mass , took one look at the new principal of the town 's academy and snorted . The principal hardly looked big or bright enough to get along with his students . The deacon 's neighbors agreed . " I saw the new principal this morning , " said one . " He 'll really never do . " <P> But 23-year-old Frank Learoyd Boyden of Foxboro , Mass , did do . That fall of 1902 , just out of Amherst himself , he took over the 103-year-old school , then partially town-supported , with its enrollment of 14 students . He taught every thing from Latin to math , coached athletics and served as town librarian on the side . The town soon learned that there was something different about the kindly young schoolmaster in the somber black suit . Fractious kids jumped to obey him ; backward boys seemed to brighten . Even old Deacon Greenough was won over . He started coming over to dinner every Sunday night , bringing free bottles of Green-ough 's Horseradish with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . As the years passed , other gifts and other boys came to the school . Many of the students were boarders from out of town . The little principal who had started 50 simply ( " No one will graduate unless he can set a pane of glass , patch a faucet , and has a year of Latin " ) found himself getting famous . When the town 's contribution to the school 's funds ceased , in 1924 , Boyden went out and raised money to make up the difference . Governors , judges and college presidents began sending their sons there . Though Deerfield children could still come free , the academy became one of the top ten private prep schools in the U.S. ( total charge : $1,600 ) , with a waiting list as long as any . Exeter 's Principal Lewis Perry described the rise of Deerfield under Frank Boyden as " magic . " Yale gave Boyden an honorary degree " for his researches into the minds and hearts of boys . " <P> Last week , hundreds of Boyden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary . The school put on a pageant , complete with oxen , stagecoach , blunderbusses , and a tableau of the Deerfield Massacre of1704. * But the sight most visitors had come to see was Frank Boyden himself . <P> He was more than ever an unusual figure - an educator who never claimed to be learned , seldom had time to read , still spoke with a Yankee twang . Old boys and townspeople remembered him jingling to school on snowy days in his horse-drawn sleigh , or shuffling through the autumn leaves with his worn grey cape blowing behind him . He has long kept office at a big desk in the hallway of the main building , where boys can stop and chat between classes .
