If doctors tackled the social and biological causes of cancer as zealously as its mysterious microscopic origin , they could reduce the U.S. total of 155,000 deaths a year from cancer . <P> Such is the claim of one of the most practical and optimistic cancer articles of recent years , published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Author : Dr. William Cramer of the top-flight Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital in St. Louis . On Dr. Cramer 's list of controllable cancers : <P> Cancer of the Stomach , which accounts for more than 30% of all cancers in the U.S. , and kills at least 150 middle-aged persons every day . Almost half of these victims could be saved by surgery , says Dr. Cramer , if they saw a doctor as soon as their stomachs kicked up . For there are three easily detectable " pre-cancerous " states : 1 ) stomach ulcers , which sometimes become malignant ; 2 ) polyps ( small growths ) in the lining of the stomach ; 3 ) chronic gastritis ( inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning nausea , vomiting , etc . ) . Persons whose relatives have gastric cancer should be doubly vigilant , for susceptibility to the disease tends to run in families . <P> Breast Cancer , which first shows up as tiny lumps in the breast , and can also be cured if removed early . ( The percentage of breast-cancer victims who reach a surgeon in time for operation has risen from 23% in 1920 to 61% in 1935 , because more women are on the lookout for suspicious nodes . ) This type of cancer is apparently caused by abnormal activity of female sex hormones , acting in balance with the pituitary and adrenal glands . Breast cancer definitely runs in families . <P> Occupational Cancers , which are caused by external environmental agents such as X rays , radium rays , ultraviolet rays , certain complex tar and benzine compounds , hundreds of other carcinogenic ( cancer-causing ) chemicals . Farmers and sailors may develop skin cancer through long exposure to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight . Cotton spinners in Britain , who are constantly exposed to the carcinogenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mule spinners ' cancer " of the scrotum . Obviously , said Dr. Cramer , occupational cancer is a " preventable disease . " Social Cancers , an expression coined by Dr. Cramer , which include cancers of the esophagus , stomach , upper digestive tract - all especially common in the lower economic groups . One reason for this prevalence , said the doctor , is the " banal " fact of widespread tooth decay , or " in plain English , a dirty mouth . " Improper chewing and constant swallowing of infected matter produce dangerous physical and chemical irritation of the digestive tract . Prevention of this form of cancer involves a change " in mode and habits of life . " <P> Liver Cancer , rare in the U.S. and Europe , but the most common form of the disease in the Orient and Africa . Reason : the Oriental diet consists chiefly of rice and vegetables . This diet makes the liver susceptible to cancerous destruction by some unknown agent . In Occidental countries , the liver is resistant to the unidentified cancer factor because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat flour . These facts , said Dr. Cramer , show that cancer of the liver , at least , can be prevented by proper food .
