txt PHILADELPHIA , Aug. 14 ? A simple method designed to cut gasoline consumption of almost every type of automobile by as ' much as 40 per cent by shutting off the fuel and ignition supply and valve action of half the cylinders was demonstrated today by engineers of the Sun Oil Company . With three inexpensive steps , the engineers and Joseph N. Pew Jr. , vice president of the company , stated all such models might have the number of their operating cylinders cut in half without harming the car , while still maintaining its service as a satisfactory means of transportation . The demonstration was given in probably one of the last places one would expect to find an automobile engine , an oak-paneled room usually occupied by a board of directors on the topmost floor of a mid-city skyscraper . There , with forty or more newspaper men looking on , engineers showed how , by removing the push rod and cam follower , closing the points of spark plug and adjusting the carburetor , half the cylinders of all except four-cylinder cars could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . Job for Skilled Mechanic " A few dollars for necessary parts and a day 's work for a mechanic will do the trick , " Mr. Pew asserted , warning the novice that the reduction in the number of cylinders should not be attempted by any one except a skilled worker , familiar with the machine on which he was working . Mr. Pew emphasized that what // GAS ' SAYING PLAN AIMS AT 40% CUT // he and the engineers had to offer was nothing new , but simply " forgotten information " made available to the motorists and the automotive industry as a contribution to the war effort . He underscored his remarks with a warning that crude oil shipments to refineries in the rationed area still were only half the required amount . The rationed area , he said , needed 1,800,000 barrels of crude a day , but was getting only 800,000 , almost all coming now by railroad tank cars . He praised the railroads for doing " a magnificent job " in replacing tankers , and added : " Ninety per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank some ; Uncle Sam took others and the activities of submarines have tremendously interfered with the tankers left . " Method Offered to Public Mr. Pew said the Sun Oil Company had set its research engineers to work on all manner of means to conserve petroleum consumption as one part it could play in winning the war . The method for saving gasoline , as explained today , he declared , was offered freely to all , because " every drop of gasoline wasted means some women and children are going to be cold in their oil-heated homes this Winter . " " We offer not an ultimate , completed picture , " Mr. Pew said , " but just a start on something we believe every motorist should agree to . " Mr. Pew said the company expected the full and complete cooperation of Harold L. Ickes , petroleum coordinator , and of the automotive industry in making the method outlined today available as swiftly as possible . Some cars will require no new parts , he asserted , while others will at most need only two small parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us their willingness to put those parts . on the market in mass production as soon as possible . " Engineer Makeg Adjustments John J. Moxey Jr. , assistant chief engineer of automotive research for the company , then took his place alongside the mounted engine of a popular six-cylinder , overhead valve automobile , 1941 model . With deft fingers Mr. Moxey showed first how the pushrods and cam followers of three of the six cylinders  --  every other cylinder ? were removed , thus preventing the valves from opening and closing to admit the carburetor-generated mixture of gas vapor and air . Next , the spark plugs from the three cylinders , to be made powerless , were removed and the points closed so that no gap remained . Closing the gap made a continuous circuit for the spark and prevented any possibility of an explosion in the cylinder , were gas vapors to leak in . The third step was to take apart the carburetor , shortening the stroke of the accelerator pump by 50 per cent , installing a new metering rod in the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle was open wide , and installing a smaller low speed jet to make sure that too much gasoline did not pour in at idling speeds . In six-cylinder cars , every other cylinder would be disconnected , Mr. Moxey said . In V-8 type motors two cylinders on each bomb would be disconnected , while on V-12 motors one whole bank of cylinders would be left useless . Some Operating Differences Speeds up to sixty and sixty-five miles an hour could be obtained with a half-idle motor , Mr. Moxey said , the principal differences being noticed in the get-away speed , hill-climbing ability , and the " chugchug " noise of the motor while idling . Mr. Pew advised that all automatic chokes should be converted to the manual type , " because the automatics are notoriously the worst gas hogs of all . " Following the demonstration in the Sun Building , the newspaper men were taken to the garage in the cellar , where five automobiles so converted were available for more extensive demonstrations . Unless one 's car Is of the type which requires no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be changed over until carburetor manufacturers are able to supply the needed accessories , which should be accomplished within a short time .
