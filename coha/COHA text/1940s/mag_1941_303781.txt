As U.S. citizens this week begin feeling the effects of the nation 's reduced supplies of natural rubber , they will also begin hearing more &; more about synthetic rubbers . Shortage or no shortage , synthetic rubbers will soon be making war news , for in many respects they are better than tree-bled rubber-notably for making the gas-retaining , sun-resisting barrage balloons which soon may be floating over such " air-raided " cities as San Francisco and New York . <P> Strictly speaking , there are no real synthetic rubbers , chemically identical with natural rubber , yet artificially made . Instead there are only 1 ) substitutes , and 2 ) kindred stretchy substances which chemists prefer to call " elastomers . " <P> Natural rubber can be thought of as a long hydrocarbon chain , composed essentially of a cramped-up chain of molecules of methyl butadiene or isoprene . When the rubber is stretched this chain unfolds ; when the rubber contracts , it doubles up again . So the problem of synthesizing rubbers is 1 ) to find basic chain-units similar to methyl butadiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringy , stretchy molecules . Best way of classifying synthetic rubbers is by their basic materials . <P> From almost any vegetable material-molasses , potatoes , scrap wood-but best of all from coal , gas or oil can be derived plain butadiene , a gas which is easily liquefied under pressure to form the basic building-blocks of most synthetic rubbers . Butadiene molecules were first polymerized-or built up into larger molecules-with the help of metallic sodium , making a stretchy substance which its German inventors about 1927 called Buna ( Bu for butadiene , Na for sodium ) . It was not a very satisfactory synthetic : but better than the methyl rubber ( dimethyl butadiene ) of World War I , when it was said German Army trucks often had to be jacked up overnight so that their solid tires would not flatten out permanently under their weight . German chemists soon discovered ways to make superior products by combining butadiene with other substances and co-polymerizing , making a rubber called Buna-N or Perbunan and another called Buna-S , widely used in Germany for auto tires . Both are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that butadiene could be obtained far more cheaply from petroleum than from coal . So , hard up for oil , they exchanged their patents for others to Standard Oil of New Jersey , which licensed them in turn to several U.S. rubber processors . Chemists of the U.S. Rubber Co. discovered that polymerization of butadiene was easier when it was emulsified in soapy water and converted by pressure into a milky , latex-like dispersion . This method is now used in Germany . Goodrich 's Ameripol rubber is made by a similar emulsion process . <P> Whatever their various trade names , these rubbers are all essentially , Bunas . Many of them are not subject to natural rubber 's major drawbacks : deterioration under the influence of 1 ) oils , 2 ) high temperatures , 3 ) sunlight . But some of them still heat up more than natural rubber when subjected to flexing and , though elastic , are less snappy.
