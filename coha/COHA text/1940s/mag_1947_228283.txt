The first big batch of returns came in last week . And U.S. industry found that , despite strikes , shortages and controls in 1946 , actual profits lived up to the great expectations . The big boost came in the final quarter of 1946 . Then , the Department of Commerce estimated , production had increased to such a peak that the national income ( wages , rents , net corporate profits , etc. ) was at a rate of $173 billions annually v. $164 billions for the whole year . <P> To no one 's great surprise , steel , the basic industry that supported this tremendous production , turned in some boxcar profit figures . U.S. Steel Corp. , which shipped more steel ( 4,902,742 tons ) in the last quarter of 1946 than in any peacetime year , ended up with a whopping net of $88,683,530 for the year , more than 50% better than in 1945 . In the last quarter alone , net profit was $31,215,636 v. $13,267,300 in the same period of 1945 . Strikes hurt Big Steel less than expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war . <P> Most of the other big steel companies also did well , with profit boosts ranging as high as 68% over last year . Poorest performer on the books was Bethlehem . Its net profit for the year was only 19% better than in 1945 . But it was still Bethhem 's best showing in six years . <P> Up P. &; G. The oil industry had its best year in over a decade . As first reports came in , Wall Streeters guessed that the industry would net 25% more in 1946 than in 1945-and 1947 earnings are expected to be another 15% better . Outstanding example : the Atlantic Refining Co. reported a net profit of $9,634,000 for 1946 ( $3.26 a share ) compared to only $1,507,148 in 1945 ( 34 a share ) . Returns from the motor industry were not yet in . But most of the big automakers , Wall Street guessed , were at last making tidy profits . <P> Consumer industries , notably those making food and household products , were not far behind the basic producers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Typical was Procter &; Gamble : for the six months ending December 31 it netted $16,300,341 v. $9,456,033 in the same period of 1945 . ( And P. &; G. had laid aside $14,500,000 to take care of any inventory loss if prices dropped . ) <P> Even the troubled railroads , overwhelmed by rising costs and falling traffic , did not do as badly as they had dourly predicted . Most of the 28 roads reporting last week were in the black . Notable exception : for the first time in its 100 years of operation , giant Pennsylvania Railroad wound up with a deficit-about $9.5 million . <P> Up D.J . There were other companies still losing money because of 1 ) low production caused by material shortages or 2 ) rising costs . And with the seller 's market turning into a buyer 's market , manufacturers were afraid to boost prices higher . But even some of the laggards were suddenly doing well . Western Union , which had cried recently that it could not help but go into receivership , turned in a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this good news , the stock market reacted as expected . The Dow-Jones industrial averages rose 5.53 points to 180.88 , highest point since just before the market collapsed in September .
