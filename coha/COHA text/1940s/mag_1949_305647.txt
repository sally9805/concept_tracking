The Sao Francisco River is South America 's fifth longest ; * for more than 1 , 000 miles it winds northward from the quartz-bearing uplands of Minas Gerais through the arid , scrub-covered backlands of Brazil 's northeastern bulge . Then , suddenly , it hurls itself 275 feet down a jagged granite precipice in the spectacular Paulo Afonso Falls . <P> At the falls last week , some 2,000 laborers were at work on a $43 million hydroelectric project designed to serve the power-starved cities of Brazil 's " forgotten corner . " In charge of the job was a corps of young ( average age : 30 ) Brazilian engineers of the Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco . In the ten months since work began , CHESF has put up a city for 4,500 , made a start on a 2-2-mile dam , and is getting ready to carve a huge subterranean power station in solid granite . <P> Half a Million Kilowatts . In 1953 , when the first generators are to be installed , the Paulo Afonso plant will produce 120,000 kw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paraiba , Sergipe and Baia , doubling their present supply . When all nine of the planned generators are in operation , the output will be approximately i times as much as Wilson Dam at Muscle Shoals . <P> CHESF began as a gleam in the eye of Pernambuco 's Senator Apolonio Sales , Minister of Agriculture under the Vargas dictatorship . Sales saw Paulo Afonso as part of a larger , TVA-style plan for development of the whole valley , with irrigation , flood-control and sanitation schemes . He was swept out of office in the avalanche that toppled Vargas , but not before both CHESF and the Sao Francisco Valley Authority ( for which plans are still incomplete ) had been set up . <P> With President Eurico Caspar Dutra 's support , a provision was written into the 1946 constitution setting aside 1% of all national revenues for development of the valley for 20 years . Since then , Dutra 's enthusiasm for the project has become almost an obsession . <P> Twenty Million Dollars . CHESF is capitalized at $20 million . Half of its initial stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn was allowed to sell 49% of its shares to private investors ; the other half was underwritten jointly by four northeastern states , municipalities , private corporations and individuals . For added capital , CHESF is counting on additional government money and is looking to Washington for a $15 million World Bank loan . <P> To CHESF 's engineers , as to most Brazilians , Paulo Afonso 's progress is a matter of national pride . Impatient at the delay in getting heavy earth-moving equipment over back roads , CHESF 's shirtsleeved , roly-poly President Jose Antonio Alves de Souza told his men to go ahead without it . As his barefooted laborers struggled last week to haul rude , four-handled wooden trays of rock from the darn excavations , Alves de Souza said : " Sure , we 've got too many men here now . But we ca n't just sit and wait for the machinery to come . We 're in a hurry . " <P> <P> *The four leaders : the Amazon , the Parana , the Madeira , the Puriis.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
