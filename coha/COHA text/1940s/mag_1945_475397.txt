In this detailed account of an actual recent homicide case the author has altered one name but has otherwise followed the facts precisely. ? The Editors Homicide officers reported : " An- swered call to the 100 block of Haw- orne and found the above deceased ly ng on a vacant lot , 43 feet from the south curb line . . . . The deceased was lying on her back near some shrubbery ; her feet were pointing north and her head south . Her dress was up around her waist and her blouse was turn away on the left side . " Near the body the officers found her purse , three mechanical contraceptive devices , and a wedding band . The ring lay beneath her left knee and it was inscribed with three initials which the police noted . Only a few minutes after the body had been found , a girl identified the body as that of her roommate , Clara Belle Penn . They lived across the street at 112 Hawthorne Street . Clara Belle , who was twenty-six , attractive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thumb marks were plainly visible on her throat . In the very manner of her dying , as well as in the way she spent so many nights , was crystallized a basic social conflict of this war , which has uprooted so many private lives . Homicide detectives found in her purse a snapshot of a soldier , inscribed " Love , Tommy " and mailed from New Guinea ; a winged Army Air Forces shoulder patch , and a small weal-filled address book on thefirst page of which was written her name and " Co ' I ' 3rd Regiment Ft Demoines Iowa . " ( The purse also contained the trinkets which always seem so inexplicably pathetic when their dead owner is surrounded by detectives and photographers : a shoe-repair stub , a bus ticket , a rent receipt for $3.34 , a doctor 's receipted bill , a box of face powder and a powder puff , some bobby pins , lipstick , rouge , and eyebrow tweezers , one " Tussy Cosmetique for eyebrows , " a cinco pesos note on the Banco Central de Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed with . a souvenir photo of the Alamo , the shrine of an old war which sightseeing soldiers visit today in nearby San Antonio . ) C LARA BELLE was murdered in a quiet residential district of Houston , Texas , sometime after midnight on December 14 , 1944 , and her body was discovered at 7:50 A.M. Since the crime occurred in the South , the police were told of a Negro 's attempt , previously unreported , to rape a white girl at this same spot a few weeks earlier . Some neighbors thought they had heard a car and loud voices at the scene about 3 A.M. ; others had heard nothing . Clara Belle 's landlady , Mrs. William Wolman , said her police dog did n't bark during the night . Large oak trees and a few palms lined Hawthorne Street in front of Mrs. Wolman 's big old house . About seventeen young women roomed there ; Clara Belle had moved in about a week previously . In her room detectives found correspondence with servicemen , some of them overseas . In an unmailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own Army discharge paper . Why she was sending the document to him was not explained . She had been a private in the WAC about five months ; enlisted May 19 , 1944 , in Oklahoma City , discharged October 23 , 1944 . The circumstances of her discharge were not made public ; however one detective recalled that the discharge was marked " Not eligible for reenlistment . " It showed she was born August 11 , 1918 , in Kansas City , Missouri , and listed her occupation as waitress . After being discharged she had worked briefly for Douglas Aircraft in Oklahoma City , then had come to Houston . Recently she had been working as a waitress in the Forum Cafeteria downtown on Main Street . Her parents and other relatives still lived in Kansas City . Her father was a stationary engineer . The day before she was killed she had received a letter from her mother , who had planned to visit her and take her back to Kansas City in a few days . Her roommate , Jane McSpadon , who attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get home , Clara Belle is getting dressed and waiting for a call . . . if she did not get the call she would go off and say , ' If I get a call , tell them to meet me at the Lido . ' I do not know any of the men whom she had dates with . I have heard her mention an Eddie ' who is a lieutenant in the Air Corps , and a ' Steve . ' . . . Since Clara Belle has been rooming here she has only spent about two nights at home . " IT WAS to the Lido Club that the detec- tives went next , for Clara Belle , leaving the rooming house about 7 P.M. , had told her roommate , " If anyone calls , I will meet them at the Lido , " and she had told another roomer , " I think I will go to the Lido and see if my lieutenant is there . " The sign at the door on Main Street about a mile and a half from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lido Club had as many windows as an automobile showroom but they were painted an opaque blue and heavily curtained so that from the outside , even at the height of an evening , the place looked deserted except for the pale blue and red light bulbs ringing the marquee . At that time there was an admission charge , termed a " covert charge , " of thirty cents per person . Under Texas law no liquor could be sold over the bar but you could buy a bowl of ice for 60 cents and a bottle of club soda for 60 cents and you could put your own bottle of liquor on the table . Beer cost 25 and 35 cents . Small flags of the United Nations hung over the bar in the front room ; large American flags were draped over the doors marked " Men " and " Women . " In the back room were tables and chairs , a small dance floor , and an enormous red and yellow juke box . Near the bar in the front room was a pinball machine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board when you hit . The walls of the Lido were the same dark blue as the windows ; a few small light bulbs hung unshaded from the checkered ceiling . The Lido , together with a couple of other places , was a favorite spot for servicemen . " If they 're in town more than a day or two they wind up here , " Homer Skeeter , a husky man sometimes referred to as the floor manager , has said . During this war Houston has not been overrun with servicemen in the same sense that , say , Little Rock , Arkansas , or San Antonio , Texas , have been . There has been no huge infantry camp on its outskirts . Moreover , it is so big that there has been room for ordinary civilian life side by side with the liberty life of soldiers and sailors . Nevertheless , it is a rail center of Texas , where enormous numbers of men have been trained and shipped , its busy port has brought many sailors to it , and last December several nearby Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was murdered , you could not go downtown in Houston without seeing , just as you would see in a score of other Army towns , lonely young men in uniform threading the crowds on the streets aimlessly , a peculiar , uncertain , questing expression on their faces as they paused to peer into store windows or barrooms . And you would see their shapeless sleeping faces in bus and railroad stations , you would see them sitting in dives with prostitutes , or jitterbugging ? shockingly young and callow ? at the Lido and the Chinese Duck and at a place advertised as " Roseland Ballroom , Houston 's Only Taxi Dance Hall . " Who were they and what did they want ? To the uncomprehending civilians they all looked alike in their uniforms , but each one was alone , really , each had just come from some particular place and each was on his way to some particular new and equally strange place ; each had but little time to spend , perhaps only a few hours between trains , perhaps overnight shore liberty or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief time allotted . Some drank a good deal and nearly all ate a lot . Sometimes they wound up in a hotel room with a girl , and she was not always a whore , by any means , but a hotel room was in any event bad in Houston , for the MP 's and the SP 's had an arrangement with the hotel clerks ; once a city detective , assigned to raid a room , told the soldier he caught , " Run , boy ? do I have to tell you twice ? " and watched while the GI ran , then took the girl , a nice girl , weeping to the station but there turned her loose . " You 're not going to stop it that way , any more than you can stop drinking with prohibition . " But the vice squad is busy nightly . Who are the girls that the GI 's find ? " Time was , " said the detective , " when you could tell the nice girls from the whores easy : the whores walked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who walk the streets too , for they can no longer sit at home and wait for the phone to ring . It wo n't ring ; all their boy friends are gone away and the boys who have come to town for a night do n't know the phone number . So the girls have gone downtown and into the bars to meet the boys . C LARA BELLE was in here every night of the world , " said Homer Skeeter of the Lido . " She were very lenient with servicemen ? she 'd talk to all of ' em . She had a different one every night . " Usually she drank only beer . " She was a nice girl , " said Skeeter , a tolerant man , and explained : " She never made trouble , never argued , never got drunk and mean . We have some troublemakers . The town was crowded with GI 's then and it was crowded with hustlers . I threw the hustlers out . " ? Skeeter remembers Clara Belle as " silly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rue , just kidding of course . She talked all the time . She moved fast ? she 'd run over here , run over there , run out of the place , run back in . You know the type . Good-natured . " She usually wore suits and a sweater but she kept the coat to her suit on and , Skeeter has said , " She was not what you would call a sweater girl . " She was a chunky girl ? the physician who performed the autopsy reported her height at five feet one and her weight at between 125 and 135 pounds ; " well developed , well nourished , slightly obese . " Her eyes were gray and her hair platinum blonde . She liked to dance , though Skeeter did not consider her a good dancer . ( " Ninety per cent of the girls come in here are not . But you see a lot of servicemen that are really good . " ) " She was strictly Navy ? I never seen her leave but with one soldier , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night with her . Whenever he was here she was with him . " Usually she was with a girl named Vadah Belle Vaughan , who was called Little Bit and who , twenty-three years old , worked at the shipyards . They had met at the Lido . They frequently danced together until sailors cut in . Sometimes they sat with a couple of other girls . This group comprised one of the cliques of regulars at the Lido . " There were several clicks , " Skeeter has said . " Girls from the shipyards , from cafeterias , from theaters ? you know : different little clicks . Sometimes there would be four or five at one table . " The Lido opened at 6 P.M. , and by 8:30 there was a crowd . By then , too , Clara Belle usually was on hand . ON THE night she was murdered she borrowed a dime for bus fare to the Lido . ( A detective recalls that she owed small sums of up to a quarter to many of the roomers . ) But she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between 7:30 and 8:00 o'clock , she was with a civilian . Skeeter was surprised : " I 'd never seen her with a civilian before and I said to the cashier , Look -- she 's with a 4-F tonight . ' " This was only a manner of speaking : the man was about fifty years old . His identity is unknown . He and Clara Belle sat alone for an hour , then left . They were gone about an hour . Where they spent that hour can only be conjectured . When they returned they sat at a center table near the dance floor and ordered two beers . Clara Belle excused herself immediately and went to the women 's room . She was gone about twenty minutes . Skeeter and a waitress saw her in the doorway of the women 's room , surreptitiously watching the civilian . He drank both beers and finally he left , alone . Clara Belle came out at once and sat down with Little Bit at a table near the stove . Little Bit , a small girl , was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table next to them . One of them asked Little Bit to dance . " We dance one dance , " she later told the police , " and he ask if he might join us at our table . And we told him yes . " He and his friend sat down with the girls . Presently another sailor , a friend of these two , came in with a girl and joined the party . They all left together at closing time . Skeeter saw them no more . He was routed out of bed next morning by Lieutenant A. C. Thornton of Homicide and Inspector of Detectives C. V. Kern . He had never seen the sailors before , nor did he know Little Bit 's address . That night he sent a waitress out with the police to look for them but they did not appear on the streets or in the bars . However that night at the Lido another sailor told Skeeter casually that he had taken Little Bit home the preceding Saturday . He led the police to her house . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The detectives took her , Skeeter , and the waitress to the Navy base and the ordnance depot . They found a merchant vessel which had been loading munitions for several days . The captain called his gun crew , about twenty men , on deck . The wanted three were not there . But , under pressure , Little Bit said that the sailor who had taken her home was named Kelinske . They found him below , August Gustave Kelinske , 23 , seaman first class . He named his two companions of the night before ; one was John Edward Bencik and the other we shall here call Ralph J. Lith . His initials corresponded to those on the wedding ring found by the police . Both men were called up on deck , identified , and taken to the police station . Thirty minutes later their ship sailed . By that time , Ralph J. Lith , seaman second class , based with the Armed Guard Center at New Orleans , had confessed that he had choked Clara Belle " until she offered no resistance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , blonde , soft-spoken , with sad blue eyes , good teeth , a ruddy complexion , and a chin cleft by a dimple . " An orphan boy " in a Texas town , he had been adopted when he was five by a local farmer . Ralph Lith was " pretty sure " he had completed the second year of high school ? his foster father said , " I disremember in what grade he quit school " ? and then he went to live on the farm . " I helped my father with the crops , " he said , and his foster father , when asked on the witness stand , " Did Ralph ever give you any trouble ? " replied , " No , sir , none on this earth . " When he was nineteen Ralph Lith went to a neighboring town in Texas , and there he married . ( A few months later Hitler 's troops marched into Poland . ) He took his bride back briefly to the farm but they did not stay long , they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May of 1940 ; France fell soon , and a few months later Lith registered for the draft . In Dallas he went to school for machine-shop training , worked briefly for a transfer and storage company , and then went to work as a mechanic in what still was called a defense plant . This was North American Aviation . About this time their daughter was born . Lith moved his family into a modest cottage in a good neighborhood inhabited by working people . A man who testified that he " could hear his Lith 's conversation and his wife 's conversation through my windows " called Lith " a very good neighbor . " Other witnesses described him as " a quiet , peaceful , law-abiding citizen . " Lith was still working for North American when , on June 30 , 1944 , he entered the U. S. Navy . After his boot training at Great Lakes near Chicago , he went home to his wife and daughter for a week 's leave . He was sent to Gulfport , Mississippi , for more training and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time of his arrest he was in the Armed Guard ; that is , he was a member of a gun crew aboard a merchantman ; sailors consider this " a good deal . " UT is any deal a good deal for a soldier or a sailor who has been obliged to leave his established home and his wife and his child ? Many men in Lith 's position ? lone/y , far from home ? are miserable these days . Some try to keep their homes together ; their wives and children follow them from Army camp to Army camp so long as they remain in the States . " So long as they remain in the States " ? we can read the desperation that phrase holds in the results of the camp-following : restive children crying in railroad stations or romping in the littered aisles of day coaches , dreary , bitter quarrels in OPA offices with rooming-house operators who charge over-the-ceiling rents , harried nights in cheap hotels , missed buses and changed orders and nervous weeping women stranded in strange places . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many do not because they simply can not afford it ( the allotment is $80 with one child ; the rent for a one-room tourist cabin , often the only place which will accept children , is $70 to $100 a month ) . And if there i3 more than one child it is really nearly impossible . So some couples compromise : she leaves the children with her mother and goes to visit him for a few weeks , until their money runs out or he is shipped somewhere else ; then she goes back home , saves her money , and visits him briefly again . But this way he can not see the children , and he and she are strange together in a hall bedroom without them . Besides , each forced parting after these visits means a new readjustment ; and she goes home wondering if it was worth it . If the wives stay at home , what do the husbands do ? One married sergeant spoke unwittingly one of the bitterest lines of the war : " My girl friend 's going to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotment check . " Her husband was overseas . This is what the Jeremiahs mean when they thunder , " What is happening to the American home ? " But do they know that many of the young husbands never hunt women ? When they go to town it is to drink or eat or walk the streets , nothing more . ( Only a very few are able to stay in the benumbing camp or aboard the gray ship every Saturday night . ) In town they telephone their wives far away ? " Say hello to Daddy , honey " ? and they sit in bars and watch the unshaven sailors of seventeen , the infantrymen of eighteen , dancing with the girls , the girls like Clara Belle Penn . " The Army is n't a bad deal for a young kid but it 's no good for us , " said one . Ralph Lith 's attorney said , " I ask you if you had ever been out with another girl since you were married , " and Lith replied , " One time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fun for a girl to be with . But sometimes your married man winds up with a girl , too , almost without wanting her . " A dogface is n't safe on the streets of Little Rock after dark " is strictly a gag ; but the barroom is small and crowded , so small and crowded that it is impossible to avoid catching a girl 's eye , and your married man is lonely just watching from outside . And here is the peculiar thing : often if he does get a girl , your married man will almost hate her all the time he is with her , for she offends his conscience , her very gaiety rebukes him . The Cynaras of this war are numberless . One infantryman said , " I do n't know why I go out with these pigs ? they 're not half the woman my wife is . " If he is lucky the thing does not trouble his conscience , it does not touch his marriage , not really , in his mind . Ralph Lith was not lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a country boy unskilled in the ways of the wicked city . But this story is not really the story of the stripling in uniform beset with perils , so often discussed from the pulpit these days . Lith had six years of marriage behind him ; he had had his own home , had known the responsibility of a family . And neither was Clara Belle a romantic child in bobbysocks , though she might have wished she still were ; she was a young woman of twenty-six , and she was not getting any younger as the war continued to keep the boys away from home . Her problems , and Lith 's , were not those of the very young who are in this war and whose very real agonies have been described frequently , to the neglect of the drab unheroic unhappiness of older men and women also involved . Ill Ed rit 's ship docked at Houston on Wednesday . He got shore liberty and , at 5:30 FA. , he went into town " with another seaman by the name of Kelinske . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's companion ; a serviceman often goes to town with another whose name he does n't even know . ) " We went to shows and visited USO clubs and servicemen 's centers on Main Street . " At the Servicemen 's Center Lith and Kelinske drank coffee . They went to the Coney Island Caf ? , also on Main Street , where they ran into two other seamen from their ship , John Edward Bencik and " a fellow named Shradder , " who had come ashore together . They all drank a bottle of beer together , then Bencik and Shradder left . In a few minutes Lith and Kelinske went to the Crawford Inn ; Bencik was there and they drank some more beer and Bencik bought a bottle of whisky . By this time Shradder was gone . Their restless wandering , their meeting and separating and rejoining each other continued , for this was why they had come to town in the first place , this is why they all come to town ? to meet and wander ? and if they became separated during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started toward the Lido Club , a few blocks down Main Street , and on the way Bencik met a girl he knew . She was Donna Louise Tomlinson , she was twenty-one , and she called Bencik " Junior . " The three of them wanted to take Donna to the Lido with them but she had to get her coat , so Kelinske and Lith went on to the Lido alone . Thus Lith met Clara Belle Penn . She and the girl called Little Bit were still alone at a table , though it was by that time about ten-thirty . The foursome got together " practically when we first got there , " Lith testified . " The tables were close together and we started talking and later they invited us to their table . . . . We started dancing , " and he danced first with " the Penn girl . " " Who danced with Kelinske ? " the attorney wanted to know , and Lith replied , " I do n't know . Kelinske was sitting by her Clara Belle and talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " She appeared impartially interested in both of them , and in Junior Bencik too , when he arrived with his girl Donna , she in her coat . Indeed , one witness described Clara Belle as being " with three sailors . " Kelinske had made the first move to join the girls ; Lith , older , followed . Kelinske had selected Little Bit for the first dance . Thus as matters developed Clara Belle was thrown with Lith . They did not dance much . They were not notably gay ; sometimes they sat while the other two couples danced . Donna and Junior Bencik danced a good deal . Once , about 11:30 , Clara Belle excused herself to make a phone call ; she who , it will be recalled , had already spent the first half of the evening with a middle-aged civilian , now called her roommate to see if anybody had phoned . No one had . Testimony on the drinks varied . One witness said that all six drank beer , another that the girls drank beer and the sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at most " two bottles of beer . None of the six was drunk when they left the Lido . Kelinske and Little Bit went south and the other two couples started toward town . They walked a block or so , then they too separated . Clara Belle and Lith were alone together for the first time . They caught a bus headed for her home . " Did she know your name at that time ? " asked his attorney . " No , sir . " " Did you know her name at that time ? " " No. sir . " They were riding on the late bus together when she asked to see his ring . This ring , a plain wedding band , meant a lot to him . His wife had given it to him six years before , when they were married . His wife had its mate . But Clara Belle wanted to try the ring on , so Lith let her . While they still were on the bus , riding to her home , he asked her to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's description of her as " silly , giggling " ? she refused . She had other souvenirs in her purse ? the picture of the Alamo , the AAF shoulder patch , the photo from New Guinea . She and this man had met so casually , two hours before , and now he was taking her home , as others had . HE bus stopped almost in front of her rooming house . The hour was late ; Hawthorne Street was quiet and dark and deserted . At her house he asked her again for his ring . " She was looking at it and trying it on and she wanted me to come back Thursday night and get it . I told her I could n't come back for it . . . . I was supposed to return to the ship which was due to sail and I could n't tell her that . I kept asking her for my ring and she would n't give it to me and then I asked her where I could catch the bus . She still would n't let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . I tried to get her to go in her apartment first but she said no men were allowed in there and so we went to this vacant lot and had intercourse . . . . She would n't let me have the ring . I tried to get my ring off the finger and she hit me on the side of my face and we started fighting . . I did not want to harm her . . . When I came to myself . . . I heard her trying to holler and I ran . . . I never did recover my ring . . . . " She had not tried to holler ; she was dead . He said he did n't know this . He caught a bus back downtown , met Kelinske and Bencik at the bus station , and went to a restaurant with them ; and at about 5 A.M. they went back to their ship . He told them nothing . The next time he saw his ring was when Lieutenant Thornton of Homicide showed it to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement to the 4 police . He maintained , simply , " I wanted my ring and we got in a fight and I lost my head . " He probably did n't know her name till the police told him ; the chances are she never did learn his . Locked up , he telephoned his wife , who came to him by bus and told him at his cell , according to the newspapers , that he was not to worry . " I 'll stick by you . " He thanked her and said , " How 's the baby , honey ? " She was wearing the mate to his ring . She sat by his side at the counsel table during his trial . The Grand Jury , which had recessed for the Christmas holidays , had been recalled and had indicted him for murder . He went to trial January 15 , 1945 , and a jury was chosen by 2:50 P.M. All the evidence was in three hours later . After an hour 's deliberation the jury found him guilty of murder without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed by Judge Frank Williford , Jr . Lith , freed quickly and without fanfare by Texas ( Houston newspapers played the story down ) , was turned over to Navy authorities ; they made no public announcement of the action they took , but it is said that he was discharged from the Navy and that he has since returned , a civilian , to live with his wife and daughter . For several nights after Clara Belle 's death , her young lieutenant in the Army Air Forces went back to the Lido alone . Homer Skeeter of the Lido said recently , " The lieutenant seemed to hate it very bad that she was killed . " He also said , " There 's a girl that comes in here now and she looks so much like Clara Belle that the first time she came in , it scared the cashier . Her size and makeup and everything . I do n't know her name either . "
