Father Divine set his heavenly hosts a-caroling with a glorious revelation : in order to " propagate virtue " and " give our whole civilization a new birth of freedom " he had taken unto himself a new wife . She was Edna Rose Ritchings , a 21-year-old blonde from Vancouver , but , Father Divine was careful to make clear , she was not " Mrs. God . " <P> In Edna , declared the ancient ( seventyish ) , roly-poly Messiah , was reincarnated the spirit of his first wife , Mother Divine , who died a few years ago . " Trace your thoughts back to what Mother said , " Father urged his sheep . " She wants everybody to love me . . . . " Also , this was a spiritual deal- " not the marriage of a natural man .

" <P> The celebrating began in Philadelphia . " It 's wonderful , " cried the banquet guests , and plunged into fried chicken , roast beef , short ribs , fish , seven vegetables , five kinds of bread , ice cream in three flavors , and two cakes . Edna , half a foot taller than the groom , sat quietly at the head table with two red roses in her hair . The happy couple moved on to Newark for another spell of rejoicing . Edna wore artificial gardenias . Over the banquet board glowed a neon sign : " God 's Holy Communion Table . " <P> Back in Vancouver , Edna 's mother refused to talk to reporters . " Everyone liked her , " said Edna 's father , a fairly well-to-do florist . " She was a fine , healthy girl . . . perfectly normal . . . .

One of the old place 's disadvantages : Pilgrims from the Berkshire music festival had been getting in his hair . <P> Winston Churchill , whose fame exceeds his fortune , sold his country estate in Kent-complete with a series of lakes-to a " group of friends " kept impenetrably anonymous . But he can go right on living there the rest of his life . Then the friends will hand it to the nation as a memorial . <P> Adolf Hitler 's prewar luxury yacht , the 375-ft . Grille , kicked up a bidding war among Britons who saw it as a money-making attraction . One bidder thought he had nabbed it for only $306,660 ; but the Admiralty said the end was not yet .
