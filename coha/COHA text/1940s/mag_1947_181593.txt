After the London Foreign Ministers ' Conference breakup , Ernest Bevin said : " We have no aim . . . to divide the world But we can not go on as we have been going on . . . . We have hoped against hope that four-power collaboration would work . . . . We shall close no doors . " <P> Neither Bevin nor any of the other ministers last week gave a clear indication of what their nations would try to do next . Yet the pattern was fairly clear : 1 ) the U.S. and Britain would try ( with or without French cooperation ) to put their zones of Germany to work ; 2 ) through the Marshall Plan , the U.S. would try to lift distressed Europe out of Communist danger ; 3 ) Russia would try to wreck both these plans . <P> It would take a year , at least , before anyone could be sure which side would win . When that doubt was diminished , another , perhaps a more fruitful , try at writing the peace treaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
