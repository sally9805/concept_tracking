In Moscow , where the first snow of the winter fell , the names of fallen East Prussian towns-Ebenrode , Schlossberg , Grn-weitschen-came sweetly to the ears of Russian civilians . They enjoyed the report of a Red Army correspondent , who described deserted German houses " with doors swinging in the wind to reveal tables set with meals which the escaping owners had no time to eat . " But in East Prussia , the soldiers of young General Ivan Chern-yakhovsky were discovering , as their Allies in the west had already discovered , the almost epileptic ferocity with which the Germans fight for their own soil . <P> Around Gumbinnen , the first sizable town on the rail line to Knigsberg , Chern-yakhovsky ran into progressively stronger defenses-trenches , minefields , barbed wire . Every settlement was a fortress , every house and hillock a gun position . Heinrich Himmler 's Home Army units were easily killed or captured , but the Wehrmacht traded punch for punch . <P> Russia 's new 63-ton " Joseph Stalin " tanks were met by Germany 's new 67-ton " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 24-barreled katushas . Both attackers and defenders had thundering masses of field guns ; one reporter called it " the greatest artillery battle of history . " <P> If the Nazis took too long to tire , General Ivan Bagramyan 's army group , poised on the banks of the Niemen on Chern-yakhovsky 's right flank , could help things along by a breakthrough from the north . On Chernyakhovsky 's left , Colonel General Georgi Zakharov was reported by the Germans to be attacking in the Masurian Lakes region with hundreds of tanks and planes , behind a " drumfire of artillery " ( the usual German phrase indicating a breakthrough assault ) . <P> In this dire emergency , Hitler appointed his tank expert , Chief of Staff Heinz Guderian , to take command of the whole Russian front from the Baltic to Yugoslavia , Guderian conferred in Knigsberg ( according to the Soviet news agency Tass ) with fat Hermann Gring , who had a personal reason for fury . The Russians had seized Gring 's favorite hunting lodge in the East Prussian deer forest of Rominter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They found the lodge 's wine cellar well stocked with French champagne , the study table piled with topographical maps annotated in handwriting believed to be Gring 's own . A meal prepared in the kitchen had never been served .
