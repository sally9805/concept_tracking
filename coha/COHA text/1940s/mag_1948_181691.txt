" Nuts to Gabriel Gonzalez " screamed the posters slapped overnight on the plaster walls of La Serena ( pop . 22,000 ) . In his home town , President Gonzalez looked and blinked in astonishment . What kind of a welcome was this for the man whom Santiago had tumultuously acclaimed only a few days earlier as the conqueror of the Antarctic ( TIME , March 15 ) ? <P> He got a quick answer : La Serena 's Communists were out to get back at Gonzalez Videla for his anti-Communist campaign . They did not stop with posters . At nearby Ovalle , the Communist mayor refused to receive the President , and with his party comrades acted so churlishly that Gonzalez refused to tell afterward exactly what did occur . <P> Gonzalez had not visited La Serena since he began his anti-Commie purge last October . Apparently he had forgotten how strong the party was in his native Norte Chico , a farming region that has long supplied beef , peaches and papayas for the markets of Chile . For over a year , Norte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stunted . Beside the shrinking water holes , skinny cattle mill , weak and hungry . Said Gonzalez as he flew over bone-dry La Serena : " The fields and valleys of my province seem desolate . " <P> For a quick answer to the drought , Gonzalez was stumped . He could not make it rain , and new irrigation projects proposed by farm leaders would at best be a long time coming . But he knew what to do about the Commies who had been thriving on Norte Chico 's hard times . Before flying back to Santiago after last week 's visit , he fired Ovalle 's mayor and Commie officeholders in neighboring cities and towns . Then he proclaimed the whole region an emergency area and put it under military control .
