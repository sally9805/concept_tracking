The U.S. got a small glimpse last week of the unthinkable big cost of World War II , even after all the munitions have been paid for . <P> To date , $9 million has already been paid out to disabled veterans and dependents of the dead . Ahead are the real costs : hospitalization , rehabilitation , vocational training , mustering-out pay , and , finally , pensions . <P> In World War I , mustering-out pay was a flat $60 . When an able-bodied World War II soldier is discharged , he gets the thanks of his country , and his uniform. * To two Congressional committees last week , this did not seem enough . They wrestled with bills calling for pay from $100-$500 . Estimated cost of such legislation : $3 billion . ( Most conservative estimate of the ultimate World War II pension bill : $45 billion . ) <P> Before the House Military Affairs Committee appeared Technical Sergeant Lemuel Hendricks of Council Bluffs , Iowa , whose left leg was blown off by a land mine in Tunisia . Veteran Hendricks told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their future and " what Congress is doing for them " ; unless they are cared for , there will be another bonus march . Leaning on his cane , Veteran Hendricks spoke with emphasis : " The men in the foxholes are beginning to wonder what they are fighting for . " <P> <P> *Dishonorable discharges get a suit of civilian clothes .
