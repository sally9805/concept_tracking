Never Give a Passenger a Break By JAMES 1 . BRENNAN Washington 's haughty cab drivers go where they please , charge what they like , and all but make the poor riders change tires . Here 's a hacker 's lively account of how they keep the customers humble . EVERY time I 'm at a movie and the heroine raises her mitt for a cab , I shudder . I know what 's going to happen . Some mug wearing a cap is going to pull up , wait till she gets inside , then , in a heavy New York accent , ask , " Where to , lady ? " It never fails . Movie directors must he a limited bunch . Like the Post 's short-story writers , they seem to think that New York is the only place with taxicabs . They always have meters in their broken-down old hacks and their crummy drivers always wear caps . Strictly bush league . When it comes to cabs and cab drivers , you have to come down to Washington to get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington . Pound for pound , we 've got it all over New York . Statistics ? In Washington and environs , sir , we have one hack for every 140 citizens . D.C. leads the nation . And drivers ? Boy , when I see those pseudo-tough guys in the movies , I cry , they 're so lousy . Asking a guy where he wants to go ! In D.C. we tell them where we 're going . If it fits in with 1 heir plans , fine , hop in . If it does n't , that 's too bad . We 've got a group-riding system . First passenger in calls the shot . Hence , Washington hackers spend more time turning down fares than they do picking them up . Works beautifully too . Your victim never knows exactly how much the tariff is going to be . I used to get a kick out of watching the expression on the big-city slickers ' faces when they ran up against the system for the first time . A guy would breeze into town in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride over two miles to the Mayflower for only two dimes . Where has this been all my life ? he 'd wonder . Just wait , sucker , I 'd think . We 'll get you later on in the day . Sure enough , I 'd be waiting outside the OPA at lunchtime . Out would come four clerks with Mr. Big Town in tow . When we 'd pull up at the Raleigh , he 'd insist on paying the fare . After all , what 's twenty cents ? Ah , me , the look on his face when I snatched the buck ! Five times twenty is one dollar . Right ? Do n't argue , pal ; I 'm in a hurry . Your friends will explain the setup to you . Five main zones , twenty subiones . One zone thirty cents , if you 're riding alone . Twenty cents if somebody else is along . Twenty cents apiece , that is , and ten cents more for each extra zone . Paying for five people and five zones ? Let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bet it is n't . But just think of the scope it gives a man of initiative and imagination . What opportunity does a hacker have to improvise with a meter posting its figures so that any boob can tell almost immediately how much he owes ? Keep your meters . I 'll take our zones . Of course , there 's a map of the city in every cab showing the divisions and how much you should pay , but Einstein himself could n't figure it out first time around . Why , there 's even one zone whose boundaries shift depending on the way you enter it ! Only I he natives who make a life study of the zone system know exactly how much is legal . It 's easy to tell whether you 've got one of those or some poor trusting visitor . For instance , when they point to the Capitol and ask if it 's the White House , that aomstically doilbh , , the fare . Any guy millet riot ic tough not to kieiw his Capitol should he penalized. of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of punishing erring tourists . A enwhoy thby of my acquaintance met up with one of them wits accidentally one day at the station , This guy Need his suitcase into the cab , followed it in , t hen ointed to the Capitol : old naked , " Washington fonument ? " " Capitol . Where Congress meets . " " Oh . " Nothing to do hut . double the fare . The guy did n't recognize the White House , either ; /Id then in rapid succession missed the PanUnerican Building , Interior Department . and the , inoein Memorial . There was nothing the cabby Quid do but put it to him for three and a half when hey got to the Shoreham . " Pretty steep , is n't it ? " the guy asked . " Not necessarily , " replied my friend . The guy handed over the three-fifty , then said , ' Oh , darn , I forgot something . Run me back to the lotion , will you ? " jg , The Cabby Loses His " Face " inY friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of blocks of the station , his passenger pointed to a building and asked , " See that place over there ? " " Yes , " said the cabby , " that 's the Municipal ? : 1 " I know , " answered the guy . " Know it very well . That 's where the hack inspector has his office . I work for him . See ? " He held out a badge . " Let 's go in and find out when t he fare for one person from the station to the Shoreham went up to three and a half bucks . O.K. ? " The hack inspector gave my friend six months to study the rates again . In order that nothing might distract him , his " face " ? hacker 's license  --  was taken away during this period of concentration . Incidentally , the hack inspector is about the only person a Washington hacker fears . A powerful man . A good guy to stay on the right side of . Still , so individualistic are our boys that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point here and there . It 's like a game . The inspector sets up a rule to give the cab-riding public a break . Immediately nine thousand cab drivers sit up nights figuring out ways to get around it . Take Off Duty signs , for instance . Put up a sign saying Off Duty when you 're on your way home or otherwise unavailable , decides the inspector . Then people wo n't report you for not picking them up . But such a beautiful sign must have other uses , the driver thinks . Take the situation during the rush hour . If you can get started up 14th Street with your first passenger , you 're bound to pick up a load . Then you can make your money fast . Suppose , though , the first guy you stop for wants to go out in the Southeast . No business in that direction . Well , put up the Off Duty sign and you can inquire where a guy is going before you let him in . Now it 's the hack inspector 's turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimatum . No Off Duty signs are to be displayed during rush hours ! Furthermore , do n't try to get around this by putting up an On Call sign unless you 're really on a call . Usually the inspector has the last word , but there are times when the boys do come out on top . Like the day when one of the inspector 's underlings reached into a cab and started to take out the cabby 's card for some infraction of the rules . Now , any hacker could have told him that a man 's cab is just as much his castle as his home . Anyhow . when the inspector 's man withdrew his arm minus the card , he found it had been fractured . " Next time , " said the cabby , as he was carried off on the shoulders of his admiring colleagues , " that guy will ask for a man 's card instead of trying to grab it . " It worked the other way one afternoon during the Lire shortage . A cab pulled up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to drive oil ? , he found he had a flat tire . Mindful of the 0131 " s n rinkoni f ions , he stopped - where he was , ignoring the horns behind him . The law in the per-eon of a terminal guard strolled over . The conversation went something like this : " O.K. , bud . Get it outta here . " " Sorry , officer ; I have a flat tire . " " Get it outta here . You 're blocking traffic . " " Nevertheless , sir , in view of the Office of Defense Transportation 's latest pronunciamento on procedure to he followed in the event of a flat tire , I refuse to move ! " " You 're blocking traffic . Violating the law . " " The Federal law takes precedence , sir . " " You move it or I 'll move you ! " " Never ! " The guard opened the door and started to pull the poor cabby out . The cabby 's leg got , caught in the steering wheel . Suddenly there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cabby waving triumphantly as he lay on the pavement waiting for the ambulance . What matters a broken limb when the fight 's for a principle ? Do n't get the idea that it 's always conflict between the authorities and the hacking profession , Two thugs came to grief one evening through a misapprehension on that score . They held up a guy , wantonly shot down an innocent passer-by , then hopped into a cab and shoved a gun in the cabby 's back . There was a passenger already sitting up front with the driver , and one of the thugs started hitting him on the head with a gun . The guy put up with it for a while , then hopped over into the back seat and did a little walloping himself . Same time , the cab driver stopped the hack , grabbed hold of the other thug and went to work on him . When the yeggs were finally turned over to the police , they were really a battered pair . Naturally , the police were pleased with h such co-operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cash and a Courtesy card . Maybe I should end the tale here , but there 's a sequel . The cab driver was arrested a couple of weeks later for , of all things , assaulting a police officer . He was a trifle inebriated at the time , and probably decided the cop was n't showing him all the courtesy his courtesy card celled for . I have n't been able to find out if he still ' has it . Let all those New York hacker impersonators note that in this tale a passenger was riding up front beside his driver . Not for us those un-American , undemocratic taxis with the single front seat and a glass harrier behind it . Companionship is one of the compensations for hacking in the district . You can even take the girl friend along and lighten the dull hours with a little chitchat . When the boys in charge got anti-romance a while back and said a cabby with his girl friend along would have to charge a single passenger the group rate-cheaper-the drivers just took to riding right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can just take a trolley , wise guys . If the fraternization between the Washington hacker and his public was stopped , it would really work a hardship on the whole country . You 'd be amazed how often the wheels of government finally turn only after a little oil job by a cabby . You think I 'm exaggerating ? Well , listen to this : Notice how little you hear of John L. Lewis these days ? I do n't want to take undue credit , mind you , but one afternoon I picked up a couple of reporters who were on their way to a White House press conference which was to deal with John L. We got talking and I pointed out to them that the boys in the Government had been handling Mr. Lewis all wrong . After a little prodding , I told them how he should be handled . The whole country was amazed next day to find the big boy telling it to a judge . I was n't . Driving a cab in D.C. , you get in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper is to get the race results . Heck , you 've beard tomorrow 's headlines in the cab two nights ago . What big automobile fern was un-able to confirm a steel order a few months ego ? I know , but . I ai n't talking . What ex-congressinan , now doing a little lobbying for a living , lost . 1100 bucks playing poker with h what senator ? Names on request . What . do you want to know about . Pearl Harbor ? I hod one of the star witnesses in the cab right after be finished testifying . Why , I knew t here was a deal brewing between the Cleveland Indiana and the Washington Senators last . year even before the players who were traded did . We really ferry the big I liners around . Show me a New York cabby that ever got clipped for fifteen cents by a Chief Justice of the United States . I did . Justice Vinson was the Economic Stabilizer at the time . I picked him up at a hotel down by the station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wardman Park . A fourth congressman got off downtown . When we got up to the hotel , a dollar and a quarter was pressed into my waiting hand instead of the dollar forty the trip called for . Being a typical diplomatic Washington cabby , I let it pass wit hout argument . After all , he was in charge of wages and prices . He had just allowed a 15-per-cent wage boost , however , and I thought it unfair of him to put the reverse English on me . I seem to have difficulties every time I run across a Supreme Court . Justice . Jimmy Byrnes objected to my wait ing for any more passengers after he got in at the airport one night . Such aloofness seemed out of place in a Democrat , but I gave in and took him home in solitary splendor . Jim turned out to be a pretty good egg . We had a pleasant chat about. , yes , the rising cost . of living . He 's worried about it too . He would n't predict who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chances might be . We did n't have time to get around to Russia . Fifty-cent tip . It was in a Washington cab that Dinah Shore asked her husband -- only George Montgomery  --  to pipe down for a moment. , so she could hear what the cabby was saying , I was the cabby . Very flattering , do n't you think ? But the two stars then joined forces when I told them what the fare was . Fifty-cent tip , though  --  after a little fumbling . Yes , we rub hub caps with the big wheels in D.C. I was trying to make a little time going up Connecticut Avenue one afternoon when this big limousine with a couple of guys on the running board kept cutting me off . The guys kept waving at me to stay back , which was beginning to annoy me , when my passenger spoke up . " That 's the President 's car up ahead , " he said . " I do n't think those Secret Service men want you to pass . " I let it go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they got out of traffic and kept out of my way . Why , President Truman did n't realize he had finally arrived till one of our boys greeted him with a friendly , " Hi , Harry , " as he was taking his constitutional one morning . His bodyguard shuddered , but the President smiled and waved his hand . It is n't everyone that can boast a greeting from a cabby . Especially a Washington cabby . Our boys are n't overly impressed by the big shots and the big talk . They can more than hold their own . After all , about 15 per cent of the elite have attended college at some time or other . I know three of the boys that have law degrees . Two of them have been disbarred , however . There 's one fellow that was studying dentistry , and hacking at night . . . . No , wise guy ! He did most of his chiseling during the day . . . Another lad was in his junior year at medical school . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about sixty of them , and they can show those meter jockeys plenty of angles  --  was once an opera singer and appeared on We the People one night . We even numbered a millionaire among the lads a couple of years ago . I do n't know if he 's still at it . About half the boys own their cabs . They 're beholden to no one but the hack inspector . Those that do n't own hacks rent them . They 're not tied up with any company on a servile 50-50 basis . No , sir . They 're entrepreneurs . They pay a fixed fee of from five to seven bucks a day , and there the obligation ends . What 's more , they have the cab on a twenty-four-hour basis . They can take the family out for a drive or run over to Pimlico if the mood strikes them . Incidentally , owning a fleet of cabs is a proposition that will really age a man fast . No cabby worth his salt has any use for the guy he rents from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since cabs were hard to get , but in ordinary times he can really make the fleet owner 's life miserable . No radio ? Then keep your broken-down old hack ! What do you mean I dented the fender ? If you do n't want to get it straightened out , here 're the keys . Fleet owners used to dread the nighttime . That 's when their phone would ring and the North Carolina atnIc police or maybe I he Pitt Pthurgli J11141 ( 914 would he want ing to know what . I hey inle.nded doing about getting their hack I he hell out of Carolina or Pittsburgh . The fleet owner would sigh , get tip and grab the next . train . Nothing else they could do . They knew one of the boys had taken a I itt le trip , then got temperamental and decided he did n't feel like driving all the way hack to Washington . Blacklist. him as they do in the so-called big town ? Brother , we have at least forty-two cab companies in Washington . Independent ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab doors on Saturday nights , so we could keep out all but juicy fares to t he later-closing joints in Maryland . Things are somewhat duller now , but just give us a little rain or a sudden influx of tourists and off we go carefully selecting our jobs . I 've seen people banging on cab windows , screaming to get in . I know one boy who used to wait impatiently for a rainy day , just so he could ride up and down 14th Street listening to the rabble screaming for a cab . Music to his ears it . was . That lad was a real cab driver 's cab driver . In his eyes , one of the profession could do no wrong . But passengers ! He hated them . His pet peeve was people who stood on the uptown side of the street and stopped him when he had another passenger in the cab to ask if he was going downtown . Usually he let them off with a warning . One day , though , as he was hauling a guy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going near the Navy Building . He got out of the cab , took the bewildered gal by the arm and led her across the street . Now stand here ! " he roared . " And get a cab going that way ! Understand , that way ! " pointing down 12th Street , She nodded faintly , and he went back across the street and drove off . I bet that 's one girl who took a bus that day . Yes , that guy was all hacker . He got away with murder . I was having a casual cup of coffee one night when he dropped into the restaurant and at down . He had a cup , too , and we chatted for about fifteen ininutes  --  about hacking , of course We finally got up and walked outside . " Hey , there 's somebody in your cab , " I said . " Yeah , I know , " he replied . " He wants to go way out in the Southeast . I thought maybe if I stopped for coffee he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another cab . " His passenger seemed glad to see him . I gazed after the cab in humble admiration as he drove away . Bill met his match one afternoon , though . I guess , no matter how good you are , there 's always someone just a little hit faster . It was right after the PUC decided the emergency was over and henceforth hacks could be chartered for hourly trips at two-fifty per . Bill did n't think very much of the idea , as it was possible at the time to take in more money just running ordinary trips . Besides , it gave the passenger a break . As it was supposed to be optional , however , it did n't bother him too much . This particular day he was feeling rather good . He bad just deposited a woman with two pooches at Union Station and had a little argument . She 'd told him she was going to turn him in for overcharging her . He was looking forward to the hack inspector 's verdict . After all , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you could charge the same rate for clogs as you did for human beings ! Bill never did find out , because the very next day he was no longer a cabby . Here 's what happened : He pulled away from the station , then stopped at the next corner to pick up some guy . There was nothing to indicate the guy was unusual , but he must have been . " Baltimore , " he said casually , after they 'd started up Massachusetts Avenue . Bill whipped the cab around and headed up 3rd Street. , his mind clicking like a meter . How much should he clip t he chump for ? He had finally decided on twenty-five bucks when they pulled up before some dive near the Baltimore water front about an hour later . The guy got out , reached into his pocket and , without asking how much , handed over three bills . " Little tip , " he said . He was inside the joint before Bill realized the bills were n't tens , but singles ! My boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , but lost him down a back alley . Bill could n't get over it . Two-fifty an hour , plus a fifty-cent tip . Strictly legal , but he 'd put in two hours and driven eighty miles for it . He turned the cab in the next day . Last I heard of him he was selling books in Jersey . We still have some good boys left , though . Like the fellow who charges people an extra quarter when they take a nip in his cab . Claims it 's a corkage charge . The rate chart does say you can charge an extra quarter for any personal service you render a passenger . That 's a beautiful phrase , " personal service . " One cabby , when questioned by the hack inspector about charging a citizen eighty cents for a thirty-cent job , carefully explained that the extra half buck was for two " personal services . " He had ( 1 ) waited out in the cold while the guy had ducked into a store for a minute , and ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy would n't lose any time . The cabby was the one who lost the time , though . Couple of weeks for overcharging . Then there is the lad who drove some attache or other up to the British Embassy . The toff turned him in for charging three bucks for what was ordinarily a fifty-cent haul . The cabby pointed out to the hack inspector that when he drove into the embassy grounds he was on British soil . Hence he was outside of the inspector 's jurisdiction and could charge whatever he pleased . For once , the big boy was stumped . A favorite of mine is the fellow who , when asked how much he charges for sight-seeing trips , replies , " Four bucks an hour . " When it is pointed out to him that the chart calls for only two-fifty an hour , he says , " Look , bud , for four bucks an hour I drive you around town , I point out all the buildings and monuments , I tell you what they are and give you interesting facts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
