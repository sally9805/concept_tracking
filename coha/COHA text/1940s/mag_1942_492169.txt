THIS spring the Verse of Brooklyn will throw out the first drawl of the baseball season as usual . The Verse is not a stanza from an epic dedicated to that borough of New York . It is merely the phonetic spelling of the title of Walter Lanier Barber , radio sports announcer extraordinary . Rendered from Brooklyn patois into English , Verse means Voice . Barber 's Southern-soft staccato is not only the outlet for thousands of suppressed souls in Brooklyn , it is the release catch for inhibitions all over the world . His canny descriptions make the Dodgers , Brooklyn 's traditionally wacky entry into the National League pennant derby , live , move and glow , complete with halos , in the mind 's eye of every Brooklyn fan . " This is the ol ' Redhead again " is the signal for every loyal Brooklyn man to gather round his radio . On virtually every afternoon this spring and summer , clumps of Brooklyns will listen in avidly . Nor in Flatbush only . Geographical limitations mean nothing to Dodger dervishes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the games will be heard only over Station WHN in New York , which has wangled the Barber-Brooklyn broadcasts away from WOR , the original station to present them , the scores and plays will be picked up and tossed into the ether by amateur short wave , news services and strictly sub-rasa government radio . It is a matter of record that a British destroyer captain , during the evacuation of Crete , barked a historic query at his first mate over the hell roar of diving Stokes and exploding ack-acks . " I say , " he shouted , are the Dodgers playing today ? " That anonymous captain was a Dodger fan . It is also a fact that during the neck-and-neck pennant race between the Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals last year , the Columbia Broadcasting System had trouble getting news out of Moscow on the Nazi-Russian imbroglio . Usually the broadcast began with a query from the home office as to what 's happening over there . But during those hectic times the New York GHQ was invariably thrown into confusion by a faint voice filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " how did the Dodgers make out ? " That radio reporter was a Dodger fan . It came out later that he had a bet with a Russian diplomat . Red Barber is personally responsible for this phenomenon of world-wide attendance . He boosted Dodger stock so that the home following in 1941 at Ebbets Field hit 1,215,770 , an all-time Brooklyn record . If the park had been larger , say the experts , the Dodger take might have been doubled , His exciting pictures , phrase-painted , of the Dodger battles  --  Red calls them " rhubarbs " ? get the credit for making the Brooklyn team very nearly an international favorite . In crass recognition of this talent , sponsors paid a round $113,500 for the Barber broadcasts in 1941 at a time when few of the other teams in either league could beg , borrow or steal a sponsor , and probably will be paying more in 1942 . Letters pour in to the Brooklyn ball club at the honest , nonpublicity rate of 500 a week regularly during the season . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the description of the World Series by Red and Bob Elson , ace Chicago sports announcer . It is a safe bet that a majority were hanging onto their sets because the Dodgers had won their first pennant in twenty-one years and were fighting the great New York Yankees to a standstill . Red and Eisen told them about it via a special 320-station hookup in the United States . But their words , fraught with as much drama as a revival of East Lynne , went out as well on a special short-wave hookup to South America , China , the Philippines , Iceland , Hawaii , Alaska and virtually every other far-flung outpost of the world . Even Dartmouth College got permission to pick it up on their dormitory hookup . That five-game airing cost a sponsor about $100,000 plus $75,000 for radio time . Neither Red nor Elson got much of that . Even the players , who got between $400 and $600 of the money paid for radio rights , topped the announcers . Red 's share amounted to about $575 , minute potatoes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth the physical output . But both Red and Elson did the stint gladly for love and because it settled them firmly in the king seat of sports announcing . It was Red 's seventh World Series chore  --  Elson has covered every series since ' 1929 . Last year was also Red 's heaviest working year . All during 1941 he put on a triple-threat series of programs . After doing the Dodger baseball doings all spring and summer , he switched to the play-by-play of the Dodger pro-football team . After the first game , however , he got into a fuss with Dan Topping , the Dodger owner . It seems that Dan wanted Red to broadcast games away from New York and Red refused . He said they would tie him up on other commitments . So Red switched again to covering the Princeton football games , and Bill Slater took up the Dodger broadcasting . Interpreting the Dodgers F IVE nights a week Red concocted and broadcast a sports review . Twice a week he went the route for Pathe News on the sports screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his family down to Florida and sopped up sun . But as the ball teams of the National and American leagues began to filter south for spring training , Red was riding again to scrape together form dope , statistics and home-grown anecdotes , rustling up enough data to build his picture of 1942 baseball . Now he 's ready to give out again . He made about $35,000 for his total labors last year , and it is likely he will top $40,000 this year . Before explaining how Red does it , a legend must be punctured . Red is not red . He has a thinning , lemon-colored thatch of curly hair without a tinge of red . His eyelashes and brows are blond . The exposed parts of his anatomy are covered with a coating of long blond hair . He has cool , baby-blue eyes . " I used to have brick-red hair until my middle twenties , " says Red sadly . " Then everything began fading and falling . " That famous hair got him into a curious sort of going-over last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Central Station in New York was bulging to the beams with frenetic Brooklyns . They tore down advertisements of Whit Wyatt , the Brooklyn star pitcher , swung from the clocks , invaded the ticket booths and raised merry hob with serious commuters . Red was on hand with his trusty microphone . As the grinning Dodger players came into the station , he tried to get a statement from each one . Most of them hurled slightly ribald or profane comments over the air and Red was put to it to maintain the purity of the ether . Finally he took the microphone down alongside the train . A detachment of Brooklyns saw him and shrieked with delight . Red was as much a hero to them as any Brooklyn player . They captured him and paraded him on their shoulders . Tiring of that , they put him down and started tearing out his hair for souvenirs . Somewhat scalped , Red escaped and corralled some of the spectators for a word or two . He got a Brooklyn landlord . " Say , " cried the exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollering for toilet seats . Now that the Dodgers have won , they can have ten thousand toilet seats ! " Red gave up and went home . The ordeal exhausted him so much that he was unable to broadcast the next day . This was quite unusual for him . Red is built on the general plan of an under-slung whippet tank . Wiry and strong , he is under five feet four inches , but he has the endurance to stand up day in and day out before his statistic-laden music rack during every minute of his broadcasts . One of these airings lasted twenty-three innings , Brooklyn against Boston in 1939 . Red stuck it out grimly , on his feet for five hours and forty-five minutes . Last year the Dodgers again persisted in going fifteen innings with Boston , which town seems inextricably tangled with Brooklyn 's destiny . During this endurance marathon Red finally broke his record . The game was being played in Boston and Red was describing it via a wire summary when suddenly he had to leave the studio . He broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unavoidably delayed , " he said curtly , and ran out the door and down the hall . Phones in the control room began to rattle . What had happened to Red , demanded the agitated sponsors . The station bigwigs wanted to know too . But in less than a minute , about $100 worth of commercial time , Red was back and the program ran off smoothly . The Dodgers tied . For this single-minded devotion to his work , Red has been voted the best baseball commentator in the United States for the past three years . He has received sundry awards from the Brooklyn fans and management as well as the players . Tokens from abroad are not uncommon . But Red 's dearest possession is a medal awarded by the Brooklyn Young Men 's Chamber of Commerce for being " that young man who has made the largest civic contribution for the betterment of Brooklyn . " " That , " says Red proudly , " is something . You can hock it any time . " The rise of Red Barber from a University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing is a rambunctious-to-riches story . He was born in Columbus , Mississippi , on February 17 , 1908 , the offspring of a locomotive engineer and a schoolteacher . The name of Lanier was wedged into the middle of his name by his father , an indirect descendant of the Southern poet , Sidney Lanier . The family moved to the truck-garden region of Florida , around Sanford , when Red was ten years old . There he went through high school and helped pick celery , worked as a truck driver , roustabout and road worker . " Not in the chain gang , either , " says Red . Shortly after his twenty-first birthday , he got the first of a series of boltfrom-the-blue notions that were to change his whole career . This one was a yen to go to the University of Florida . Red had $100 saved up . He bought a pair of shoes , hung them around his neck and hitchhiked off for Gainesville and the university . Once there he entered and then looked around for a job to stay entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railsplitter , tennis-court attendant . Finally he got the job of part-time janitor at the campus University Club . Here occurred the second bolt from the blue that put Red en route to fame and a modest fortune in radio . He was placidly making up beds one day in January , 1930 , whistling to himself and soft-shoeing a bit between changing the sheets , when an emergency call came down the corridor . The university station , WRUF , was in difficulties . It was one of the best in the state and had pride in its educational record on the air . Now , it seemed , that record was about to be broken . A university professor had been Scheduled to read a paper over the air . But be had absent-mindedly promised to stroll off to Georgia to look at some interesting specimens of erosion . The professor desperately wanted a substitute to read his paper over the air and rushed down the halls of the University Club in search of a script-teasing Samaritan . Around the corner , in answer to the professor 's literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the damned radio , " said the . WRUF professor feverishly . He thrust a sheaf of papers into Red 's hand . " I 'll buy your dinner if you do . " " What do I do ? " inquired Red interestedly . " Just stand in front of that microphone dingus , " said the professor . " When the red light goes on , you go ahead . " Red stood in the designated place and cleared his throat . The red light went on . Red looked at the title of the paper . It was Certain Aspects of Bovine Obstetrics . Red gulped and read . He was a smash success as a radio " professor . " The station offered him a job . But Red was reluctant to accept . His ambition had always been to be a touring endman in a minstrel show . He had bought a Joe Miller joke book and had learned how to play the trombone for just that purpose . He had a job promised , too , with the famous J. A. Coburn blackface troupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That summer he got a wire . The Coburn troupe was financially no more . Red had seen the last of the blackface balladiers , so he entered radio , mourning his lost ambition to be a Bruclder Bones . There was some haggling about his salary . The station offered fifty dollars a month . Red refused . " Tell you what , " he compromised . " I 'll take thirty-five cents an hour . " The WRUF manager suppressed a grin and nodded . But by the end of a month that grin had curdled . Red had run his earnings up to ninety dollars . Thereafter the station nailed him down to a fiat rate of seventy-five dollars a month . Red was satisfied . He went into radio work with his customary kettle of energy and was soon drawing down $135 a month as director and chief announcer . He wrote and produced plays and programs , broadcast all kinds of sport from baseball to polo and , probably as a providential preparation for the Dodgers , got a reputation for mild lunacy as the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His studies did n't suffer . He was never out of the first ten student listings during his two years at the university . While working at WRUF , Red managed to perfect some of his better sayings for the microphone . He still uses them in Brooklyn broadcasts , and all of them assay a high percentage of Southern slang . His favorites are " The boys are tearing up the pea patch , " meaning that a rally is in progress . " Tied up in a crocus sack , " means that the game is in the bag . If a runner takes another player out of a threatened double play by thundering into him , Red reports that " he swung the gate on him . " The ornithological phrase , " sitting in the catbird seat , " means sitting pretty . At the end of his sophomore year Red decided to do a piece of celebrating . Out with a party of friends near Gainesville , the car in which they were riding " just naturally turned over " and dumped the lot into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accident came his third bolt from the blue . He had just got comfortably bedded down in the university hospital when the door of his room opened and an angel walked in . That 's how Red tells it . Anyway it was a pert , black-haired little nurse of twenty-two named Lylah Scarborough . She was a Southern product herself , from Jacksonville . But Red did n't know that . Or maybe he did . He shut his eyes and groaned . " This is heaven , sure ' nough , " he whispered in pain-freighted tones . Lylah understood what he was getting at as well as Red did . By the time he was well , his adroit blending of expert groaning and woo-pitching had brought about an understanding between them . Radio Odyssey Now Red had a goal . He sat down and thought up a way to achieve it . He outlined a circuit for himself to travel each summer when he got his vacation from his chief-announcer job at WRUF . For several years he visited Atlanta , Charlotte , Cincinnati , Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew I was n't good enough for New York , " he says . " I figured that when I was ready I 'd get the call and go to New York with my job in my pocket . And that 's just what happened . " While hunting , Red persuaded Lylah to drop her ambition to be an instructor of nurses at the university . They were married in 1931 . For four years Red was top announcer for WRUF . Then he got a call to Cincinnati . Powel Crosley had just bought the Reds baseball team and he wanted the stations he owned ? WSAI and WLW  --  to air the games . So Red went north and stuck there for five years . " I do n't like to talk about how much I got when I first went there , " says Red , " but by the time I left I was hitting fifteen thousand dollars a year . " In 1935 Red met Al Helfer . If Red could be described as a whippet tank , Brother Al , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monster of a man , weighing 254 pounds of muscle and standing a foot over Red , even in his sheer-silk socks . He had played football and basketball at Washington and Jefferson and owned a low , mellifluous voice . He had come through the knockabout days of early radio with a first job just outside Pittsburgh at a coolie wage of five dollars a week . He had been transferred to Pittsburgh a year later and had gone on to WLW . Red and Al hit it off from the start . They began collaborating on the coverage of sports events and found that their talents blended perfectly . It was the beginning of one of the famous partnerships in radio . But it was broken up in jig time . Brother Al was called to New York to do a spell for the Columbia Broadcasting Company , later for WOR and the Mutual Broadcasting System . Red was left at his post in Cincinnati . But when the Dodgers became suddenly resuscitated under Larrupin ' Larry MacPhail , the Brooklyn promoter , Red was brought on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow redhead , had sold the air rights for $1000 a game and he wanted Red and no other to air the play . Helfer came in from the WOR staff on Red 's request as the principal assistant . All this began in 1939 . From that date to this the triumvirate of Barber , MacPhail and Helfer has made the Brooklyn Dodgers increasingly the outstanding personality of the air . Not even Cantor or McCarthy can surpass the color , comedy and character of the cavorting Dodgers on the homestretch as built up by the voice power of these three . Not that the dependability of the broadcasts has been stretched in the interests of color . There is no program to compare with the Dodger airings in accuracy . As a matter of fact , the programs ' fairness is a cause of discontent among the Flatbush faithful . Last season a hunch of the Brooklyns were draped over a taxi in New York listening to the broadcast of a double-header in which the lowly Phillies were shellacking the Dodgers . Red 's voice flowed smoothly on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been shoved out of the league lead , four points behind the rampaging Cardinals . The radio snapped off . A gloomy silence prevailed . " That redhead , " came a bitter voice , " he 's too fair ! " Red wants it that way . " I have to be impartial , " he says defensively . " I have to stay in the middle or I ca n't see both ends . " But when he talks about the Dodgers in his comfortable house in Scarsdale with Lylah and his little daughter , Red 's countenance assumes the beatific expression that is characteristic of guileless children and Dodger fans . " Those Brooks , " says Red dreamily , " they 're champions . First team to win one hundred games for Brooklyn in the history of baseball . " Batter Up The game broadcasts follow a regular routine . Red and Brother Al usually drop in about a half hour before the game . Red loosens his tie , hums Dixie or Carry Me Back to Old Virginny or Oh , Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hums he rolls up his sleeves two turns . Al stretches and yawns . They check their statistics , get their special books ready  --  Al carries yellow pads for recording changing batting averages , play by innings , scores of other ball clubs , and commercial announcements . Red keeps a play-by-play record and pitching averages . Every fifth inning Brother Al takes over . Occasionally , Red and Al harmonize in off-mike barbershop . By five minutes before game time they are relaxed and ready to go . There is one taboo on the game . If a pitcher is pumping up a no-hit game to the fifth inning , neither Red nor Al will mention the fact thereafter , lest it get around and rattle him . Nor will they ride any player or team , give too-technical details or let the game get dull . They just go spieling along . Red has learned to ride the air waves in the same easy , balanced fashion that a Waikiki surfboarder might take a comber . His unaffected gabbing sometimes wins unexpected adherents . During the 1941 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood because he insisted on keeping a corner radio booming with the accents of Red 's voice all afternoon . When the case came into court , the magistrate frowned and looked down at the culprit . " What game was that ? " he demanded . The newsdealer told him . " H'm'm 'm , " said the judge reflectively . " I remember that game very well . I was playing golf and I hired a caddie just to carry a portable radio around so that I could listen to the broadcast . Good game too . Case dismissed . " When the Dodgers play away , Red usually broadcasts the game from the WOR studios . A wire operator at the field transmits a complete skeleton of the play and Red fills in from quires of statistics at his elbow and his own personal knowledge of the players . He keeps about three balls behind the play , so that he can take up air slack , and catches up at the end of each inning . Drama is put into the broadcast by Red naturally , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raises his voice on a long hit , comments on some idiosyncrasy of a player at bat or pauses just before a fly ball is caught . Trick sound effects are never used . The tapping of the telegraph key is undisguised . These remote-control broadcasts once caused a furor in a Brooklyn tavern . According to Daff Parker , a sports writer , a mysterious listener butted in on Red 's announcing . He would cock an ear , and before Red could speak , would prophesy the play . The Barber buddies gathered around menacingly , but to their amazement the stranger was always right . Did he say a bunt , Red reported a bunt a moment later . He always foretold the hits and errors , the workings of the plays in some strange psychic manner . The Brooklyn watched him , fascinated . Finally the stranger turned to go . A brass object tumbled out of his pocket  --  a telegraph key . He was an operator and got his weird tip-offs by listening to the clacking of the key over the air while Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be far from a low-brow trade for Red . Last year he collaborated on a high-brow symphony program . He read and edited the script for Russell Bennett 's Symphony in D for the Dodgers . This , a jerry-built , semiserious work by one of America 's most colloquial composers , was played by the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and managed to dub Red " the Barberolli of the air . " Matinee Idol The four movements read respectively : The Dodgers Win , The Dodgers Lose , Larry MacPhail Looks for a Pitcher , and The Giants Come to Town . A program note said : " MacPhail tries to trade Prospect Park to Cleveland for Bob Feller . " Red went through the ordeal with flying colors . Red works at his baseball job . Usually he is out on the field with the Dodgers bef ore every home game , talking and boning up on his personal dope . He collates this with the data in the Spalding Guide Book , which he is supposed to have memorized back to 1899 . He also quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What team spent most days in the league lead from June to September last year ? " Red covers the sports pages of the newspapers at breakfast , revises his records before he has lunch . He then confers with advertising agencies on commercials and finally gets ready for the game . He is a ladies ' favorite . Before he came to Ebbets Field , the games generally resembled a For Men Only preview . But last year 15,000 women stormed the gates for one game , and Brooklyn authorities say that the come-hither tones of Red are responsible . His favorite fan letter concerns a woman fan . " My wife , " the letter reads , " was a semi-invalid . She enjoyed your broadcasts . Yesterday she began to , sink but she heard the last out . She died happy . " Red does n't remember whether the Dodgers won or lost that day . Occasionally Red introduces free-swinging , nonpro substitutes . His favorite radio feature is Raymond Gram Swing 's news programs . That makes it even , as Swing is nuts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day . He also advanced the same favor to Larry MacPhail  --  the radio broadcasts are one thing in Brooklyn that MacPhail keeps shy of ? who also reeled off one inning . Both were good , but not startling . So far , the favors have not been returned . Red has neither broadcast a news crisis nor traded a pitcher . Red gets hundreds of good-luck charms to keep the sacks FOB  --  full of Brooklyns . Among them are rabbits ' feet , four-leaf clovers , fish bones and coins . Red 's own charm is a heavy gold ring with a reversed crystal cameo . " It belonged to an uncle of mine , " says Red , " and I liked it . When he died , he left it to me . It used to be amethyst , but it faded like my hair . Lot of luck in that ring . " Red likes to play golf , and right now is trying to break the Duffer 's Hundred . He collects rare sports books and sporting prints . He lives outside New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he talks shop most of the time anyway . Near the end of the 1941 season he got a phrase which is now one of his pets : " assuming the ballistic burden . " It means that a new pitcher has come in . He 's as happy as a bird dog in a covey and thinks his customers  --  the Brooklynfans  --  are the beet ever . " By my mail I guess ninety-nine per cent of Brooklyn likes my stuff , " says Red , who reads every letter . " I did get razzed once , though . " That was when about 200 of Red 's personal rooters went to the ball game at Ebbets Field with their portable radios and tuned in their hero . The proximity of the sets to the broadcasting booth caused a feedback squeal on the air . Red broadcast an appeal to the fans to shut off their sets . But all he got in return was the well-known conversational riposte of the die-hard Dodger fan . The bird .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
