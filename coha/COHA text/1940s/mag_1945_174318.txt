From a black sedan , skidding around a slushy Minneapolis corner one midnight last week , gunfire blazed . From a parked car , the gunners ' target , jumped a man and woman , running for their lives . The man , obviously hurt , shouted : " Do n't shoot , for God 's sake , do n't shoot . . . . " As if he recognized the killer , he called out a name . Then he toppled over into the snow . Next day , his companion , a prostitute , told police she could n't make out what name her friend had cried out . <P> Thus last week a dog 's death came to Arthur Kasherman , 43 , publisher of an unsavory Minneapolis one-man tabloid , the Public Press . He died as he said he would : " Just like they got Guilford and Liggett . " In 1934 gunfire from a passing automobile had brought down another Minneapolis publisher , Howard Guilford , who circulated two scandal sheets , the Saturday Press and Pink Sheet ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest American , got his . Liggett , a former editor of Plain Talk ( a magazine ) , and Guilford , a veteran St. Paul newspaperman , once had some legitimacy as journalists . Kasherman had none . <P> To his acquaintances , who had developed a studied indifference to his talk of crusades , " expo-ZAYS " and threats , the wonder was that anyone had wasted a bullet on Kasherman . He was a man of thin face and slickly pompadoured black hair , a police station hanger-on , petty racketeer and blackmailer , who once did a two-year penitentiary stretch for a $25 shakedown of a whoremistress . His Public Press was a newspaper only by the utmost professional courtesy : it came out intermittently , whenever Kasherman could find someone to smear and someone to pay him for it ; it was full of black-inked diatribes against the cops , the mayor and the gangsters , and promises of a detailed " lowdown " which would come in the next issue but never did . In his cheap rooming house , police found almost an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , still undistributed to the few Loop newsstands that would sell it . <P> Police confessed themselves as baffled by Kasherman 's murder as by Guilford 's and Liggett 's , still officially listed as unsolved . Minneapolis ' legitimate newspapers cluck-clucked properly over Kasherman 's death , hoped that the latest killing would do what police and city officials had failed to do : put a stop to blackmail parading as journalism .
