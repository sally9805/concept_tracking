Last week Test Pilot John Derry was flying De Havilland 's experimental DH-108 at 40,000 feet over southern England . The weather was clear , the " machometer " ( speed indicator in fractions of the speed of sound ) showed Mach .86 . Derry felt just right , so he opened the throttle and turned the nose down . <P> As the speed of the dive increased , the machometer needle crept up to Mach 1 , the speed of sound . Then it went on up to Mach 1.1 . The controls felt heavy , but nothing really unpleasant happened . Derry checked the speed and leveled off . He had traveled faster than sound in an engine-driven plane ( the DH-108 is no rocket-ship like the U.S. Bell S-1 ) , and was none the worse . His top speed was probably just under 700 m.p.h . <P> The DH-108 has swept-back wings with controls on their tips ( see cut ) . This design may account for the fact that Pilot Derry felt none of the " compressibility " effects when flying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements that are secret . A similar plane came apart in the air and killed Geoffrey de Havilland in 1946 . <P> Exceeding the speed of sound in a brief power dive is not the same thing as flying continuously faster than sound in level flight . U.S. planes are rumored to have done it too . But if they have , the military has chosen to keep mum .
