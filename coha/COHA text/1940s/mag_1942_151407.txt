The fragrance of incense , the throb of Russian choir music , a dazzle of peacock blues , flaming reds and gold filled the Baltimore Museum . It was also filled with socialite art tasters and leather-jacketed shipyard workers who had come to see " The Golden Age of the Russian Icon " - sacred pictures from the ancient towns of Holy Russia ( Kiev , Novgorod , Moscow ) in the religious setting that alone gives them meaning . <P> Against a tremendous improvised iconostasis ( a screen built to hold icons when cathedral walls were full ) , visitors saw the tall spare figures of saints and Virgins , mournful of mien , with inclining haloed heads and slim-fingered hands . These paintings represented the oldest and most continuous art tradition of Europe-a tradition whose source was Byzantium ( " icon " is from the Greek eikon , " image " ) . Icon painters of the 11th to 17th Centuries , " humble and mild and pious " ( as a 16th Century Church Council enjoined them to be ) , painted as reverently as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the best models . " Only in the last dozen years have Westerners appreciated the splendor of Holy Russia 's painting . It was the Soviet Government , despoiler of churches , which fostered that appreciation-and last week 's show was thus indirectly , though in no sense officially , indebted to the U.S.S.R. <P> Before the Revolution , icons were still gathering soot in dim church recesses . Many were repainted six or seven times , defaced with plaster , chalk and glue relief . Their artistic worth escaped even most Russians . The few attempts made at restoration were restricted to dubbing in missing hands and faces . One of the Soviet Government 's first acts was to set up the National Central Restoration Workshops , which are still busy cleaning off the accumulation of centuries . Occasionally a bearded prophet , scraped off , becomes a sweet-faced Virgin . <P> Except to neutralize white scars , the Soviet workshops will not retouch . What time has destroyed is gone .                 @ @ @ @
