This week , each in his own way , the people of the U.S. would celebrate Christmas . <P> For many a man , as for a tanned National Park Ranger named Bill Butler , it would be a rare day of rest , warmth and comfort . The odds had favored Bill Butler 's spending Christmas high on glacier-scarred Mount Rainier . For four days he had been battling Arctic cold , avalanches and the dead-white swirl of alpine blizzards in a search for a lost Marine Corps transport plane . But a fall on rock-fanged ice had finally sent him skiing painfully back to his snug cottage in a timber-bordered Government camp . With his torn ribs healing he would idle before a snapping log fire , listen to the faint roar of the Nisqually River , and watch his pretty wife , Martie , cooking a 19-pound turkey . <P> Things would be much , much more complicated for Hollywood 's Lana Turner . She was giving away 500 presents . There were the two dozen cashmere sweaters ( at $35 apiece ) for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Eddie from Lana " ) for her older men friends . There were jackets , purses , gloves and jewelry for her women friends . There was a diamond and sapphire clip for her mother , an ermine coat for her 3 year-old daughter . There were cases of bonded bourbon ( at $120 a case ) for the boys on the lot . The whole thing would simply be a production . <P> Banana Pie . To husky , 17-year-old Richard C. Rowe of Denver , as to thousands of other U.S. college freshmen , the holiday held the feel of freedom , the warmth and excitement of homecoming . His mother had waited tip the night he got home from Park College at Parkville , Mo. , and fed him banana cream pie . He had slept late , hurried off to meet other malted-milk topers at the Purity Creamery , and angle for holiday dates . On Christmas he would go to church , plough through a huge dinner , drive to a mountain cabin with his family to toast marshmallows over an open fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed , glittering Florida resorts . To Cartoonist Ham Fisher , creator of Joe Palooka , Christmas in Miami Beach would be sun-kissed and expensive . He would sleep late in his Roney Plaza room , golf at the swank La Gorce Country Club , be host at an eggnog party at the Lord Tarleton Hotel . In the evening he would invite a crowd of cronies to a dinner party at the Copacabana Club . <P> It would also be a big day , though in a different way , for redheaded Walter Reuther , the combustible president of the C.I.O. 's United Automobile Workers . He had a huge surprise for his four-year-old daughter Linda-a tiny electric phonograph with two albums of miniature records . And he was due for a surprise himself . His wife , May , would have sour cream pancakes for breakfast in their neat , white Detroit home .
