In London last week the British Admiralty announced the loss of one of the crack warships of World War II , the 5,270-ton light cruiser Penelope . She was sunk with another cruiser and two destroyers off Anzio . <P> Penelope was a ship of many nicknames . In 14 days of continuous air attack at Malta she was pierced with some 2,000 bomb fragments ; her admiring crew promptly dubbed her " H.M.S. Pepperpot . " After the worst holes were plugged with planks , they added another : " H.M.S. Porcupine . " While she was alongside a Malta dock , bomb hits on shore threw so much debris around her decks that for a time she became " H.M.S. Rockgarden . " <P> But under any nickname , Penelope* never took an enemy attack lying down . In 24 days of action her own guns fired 35,000 6-in. shells , 6,500 4-in. , 20,000 two-pounders and 8,000 20-mm . Oerlikon shells . <P> * The ship in C.S. Forester 's The Ship              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
