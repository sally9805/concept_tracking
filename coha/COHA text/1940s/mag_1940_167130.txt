Last week was Moral Re-Armament Week in San Francisco . MRA ( or the Oxford Group or Buchmanism ) seemed to have found in California its appropriate spiritual home . A hit- &-run; sect which had done better at raiding than remaining , MRA and its guiding " Soul Surgeon " Frank Buchman had now been comfortably operating in California for eleven months . Something about its free- &-easy; panacea appealed to the West Coast : " It 's a world movement designed to build a world free from intolerance , greed , hatred and fear . You do n't join anything , you do n't pay anything , the idea is that you begin living the MRA standards . . . . " Leader Buchman , who last week celebrated his 62nd birthday , told the press that he found no objection to " 50,000 airplanes for America , " felt that " America may be God 's last chance to save the world , " vowed that he was " no peace-at-any-price man . " MRA , he added firmly , was " above party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like electric light , it goes everywhere . " Following the usual Buchmanite technique , MRA headquarters issued a list of current MRA " endorsers. " - Among them : President Roosevelt , Admiral Byrd , Secretary of War Woodring , Secretary of the Navy Edison , Speaker Bankhead , David Dubinsky ( International Ladies Garment Workers ) , Dan J. Tobin ( International Brotherhood of Teamsters ) , Paul E. X. <P> Brown ( Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association ) , Dave Beck ( Teamsters ' Union tsar , and force-extraordinary in Seattle politics ) . Said one hopeful MRA missionary : " If MRA can convince a man like Beck , it may do the same for Hitler . " <P> - Dropped from the list : Mae West . Publicity-wise MRAers concluded that she was just looking for a little publicity .
