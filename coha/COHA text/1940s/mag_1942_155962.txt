The sense of crisis was staggering . The Australians had seen it coming-Singapore 's fall and the inevitable sequel , the Japanese air attack on the Australian mainland ( see p. 16 ) . But it had happened dizzily fast . Seeing it coming and feeling the crunch of its presence were two different things . Sweat poured from the national pores ; and beneath the sweat there was a sudden profound shift in the nation 's war thinking , a lurching adjustment to the fact that the waking nightmare was no dream . <P> Ill with gastritis , Prime Minister John Curtin got up from a hospital bed to address a rally in Sydney . The cool , pedagogic Laborite , who has never been avid for public office , said quietly : " Our honeymoon is finished . ... A new way of life is forced upon us . ... The time for controversy has ended . ... I am not going to waste time arguing about past mistakes . ... I will order and direct . . . . There is only one shield against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end it . ... Brains and brawn are better than bets and beer . " <P> In Australia bickering is as much of a national pastime as bets and beer . Since 1940 Australia has bickered about how , how much and where to help the Empire . Last week there was still bickering , but only about one thing : how to keep the Jap off the country 's neck . <P> With invasion so close , a good many important people thought that every available defense force ought to be kept on the mainland , that men and material should even be snatched back from war fronts abroad . Quite different was the opinion of The Dutch East Indies ' Lieut . Governor General Dr. Hubertus van Mook , who was in Sydney last week . Throw everything possible to Java , urged Hubertus van Mook , and Java can be saved from capture . <P> The boss of Australia 's biggest newspaper chain , Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch , spoke of an Australian counteroffensive " that will surprise the Japanese . " The War Cabinet conferred with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Prime Minister threatened to punish any member who blabbed . " I am a man or a mouse , " said Mr. Curtin , " and if I 'm a mouse they can throw me out of office . " <P> While roundly slating the Motherland for its handling of the war , while turning ever more hopeful eyes to Washington , Australia has nevertheless bent her back to the Empire effort , making guns , mortars , howitzers , shells , planes , engines , parachutes , corvettes and destroyers in quantity surprising for a wool-growing country of 7,000,000 . Yet , as always when the storm breaks at home , there was still more slack to be taken up , and Australia gave a mighty heave-ho : <P> A $113,000,000 war loan boomed toward total subscription a few days after it was opened . <P> Prices and wages were pegged ; industrial profits were limited to 4% ; trading in securities other than Government issues was stopped . <P> Married men up to 35 , single men up to 45 were made subject to military call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens not interned , became subject to call for war work . Employes on war jobs were forbidden to quit or be absent from work without good reason . <P> Herdsmen started driving a million dairy cattle , followed by milk trucks , from the menaced east coast to scantier but safer pastures inland .
