against that evil . " His heart soared with the strangest exhilaration at his own words . " We blunder , we go astray , but if we have faith that evil can be destroyed , we shall win . Perhaps not now , not in five hundred gears . But sometime . Please God . " Angus was quieter . Stuart resumed . " But let me get on with my story . It is almost night now , and this damned wind is getting stronger . Pull up your collar , Angus . " So the people in Sam 's country turned against his people , in their pain and hunger and blindness , and the rich men sat back , smiling , smug and safe in their warm houses and before their fires , and eating from their silver dishes . The wrath of the people had been turned away from the real murderers and thieves . So  --  Sam left his country , and came here , penniless , with only his hands and his faith " In God ! " cried Angus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , if you must . I really meant : his faith that somewhere in the world there was safety for the oppressed . He thought he had found it in America , where we believe , or profess to believe , that all men are equal . Except the Negroes , of course . And Sam came to Grandeville . " One day , he looked out at River Island , down there , and had a wonderfulidea . It was quite mad , of course , but it was beautiful . Why could n't that big and unsettled island be made into a colony for others of his people who must leave their own countries to get away from the suffering mobs and the cruel masters ? For , Angus , you must know that what happened in Sam 's country has happened before in many other countries , and is happening now , and will probably happen again . " Sam was quite taken with his idea . It became a dream to him , a wonderful dream . He talked to me and to Father Houlihan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sam went to the Mayor , and talked about it to him . You see , that island is American land , and is owned by a handful of people who would be only too willing to sell it at a reasonable price . Sam and Father Houlihan went to these people , after talking to the Mayor , and they have named a price . And so Sam is working very hard to get this money . And one of these days , he hopes , he can give it to has people for their home . " It was so dark now that he could see the children 's faces only as dim blurs in the heavy purple dusk . But he felt Angus ' trembling intensity and eagerness . " Mr. Berkowitz is a Jew , is n't he , Cousin Stuart ? " " Yes . " P101Angus was silent , but his emotions appeared to grow , and vibrate . Then he heaved a deep sigh , and said the strangest thing , in a shaking voice : " Thank you , Cousin Stuart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite know why . He pressed his hand on Angus ' shoulder . The boy strained his eyes in the darkness towards the river . He said : " But why does Mr. Berkowitz want that island , Cousin Stuart ? America is free for all men , is n't it ? He is safe here , he and his people ? " Stuart said with loud irony : " Oh , yes , indeed . Land of the free and home of the brave . We do n't hate anyone here , except the Catholics and the Jews and the poor slaving blackamoors . America is free for all men , provided they are exactly the kind that is already here . Father Houlihan could tell you a pretty story . " He was sorry that he had had to shatter the last hope of this poor boy . But truth was necessary . Oh , damn truth ! exclaimed Stuart , inwardly . He said : " Let 's go back to the house . " He felt enormously tired and heavy and depressed . He wanted nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening by the fire , drowsing and planning . He hesitated . Then he said : " Wo n't you and little Laurie have supper with me , Angus ? " IT wAS a very cosy supper , and Stuart , after his first fears that Laurie might spill her milk on the Aubusson rug or stain the fine damask , felt quite happy in the presence of these children . Something childlike , vehement and simple in himself was satisfied , and warmed . Laurie ate like a perfect little lady , minding her manners , and sitting straight and quiet and dimpling and smiling in her chair , her golden hair framing her exquisite little face . When Stuart spoke , or her adored brother , she would turn the sparkling blue of her eyes upon him , and listen intently , whether she understood or not . As for poor Angus , his gray pinched expression was gone , and even his thin cheeks seemed rounder , and there was an eager light on his face . His eyes were quite wide and luminous , and he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A queer lad , thought Stuart , of Angus , with pity and wonder . He had half believed Janie 's stories , in spite of himself , that Angus was dull and stupid , crafty and sly , whining and psalm-singing , and an incorrigibleliar . He had not taken the trouble to investigate her tales , for he had not been interested in Angus , or the other children , except to speed their going from his precious house . Now he began to doubt , and to hate Janie with fresh ardor . And then , to his horror and indignation , he began to learn that Angus was blindly , frightfully and incredibly devoted to Janie . At first , Stuart could not believe this revolting fact . Surely , a lad of Angus ' wit and penetration must know what Janie was ! He had his own experience of her , of her malevolence and slyness and cruelty , and lies . Yet , Angus spoke of her simply and fondly , with the most touching shadow on his face . He loved his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her ? Throughout the supper Stuart tried to fathom this puzzle . Then , slowly , he gathered that the boy was blind in many ways . He remembered only Janie 's rare kindnesses , her laughter , her wit and gaiety . He remembered her frivolity , which must have appeared to him a dear thing . Her sins he did not see . When she was cruel to him and his sister , he believed that it was in some way his own fault , his own sin , or that she did not understand . What she said was infallible , all her opinions and prejudices . Stuart was more and more revolted , as he listened to Angus , and more and more saddened . He saw , with a flash of intuition , that some day Janie would inevitably corrupt this simple boy , with his integrity and innocence , and that the corruption would be a most terrible thing . Yet what could he , Stuart , do ? He perceived that should he begin to enlightenAngus he would only inspire distrust in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must believe , and love , and who when his beliefand love were betrayed would be forever shattered , and perhaps made evil , also . Besides , Janie was all he had . Stuart had no illusions that Angus must inevitably impress his mother with his nobility and high integrity of spirit . Rather , she would pollute and ruin him , as she must , because of her greater and harder strength and her knowledge of wickedness . Angus did not know that his mother hated him . He would know some day , but not yet . As he talked to Stuart , quite volubly , in his new trust and confidence , he expressed his interest in the shops . Nothing was more agree/able to Stuart than to talk of his darling enterprises . He elaborated at great length , while Angus listened , fascinated . Finally the lad remarked , wistfully : " You must be a very rich man , Cousin Stuart . " Stuart paused . For some reason , he frowned . He did not like Angus ' wistful references to money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that matter ? " he asked , carelessly . " Do you like money , Angus ? " Angus hesitated . He looked down at his blanc mange , which a servanthad placed before him . " I do n't know , " he murmured , distressfully . " I never had much of it , or needed it . But mama said when someone says that money is nothing it is either because he has never felt the need of it , or never hopes to have it . " Stuart frowned again . " Your mama has a very high regard for money , has n't she ? " Angus looked up and smiled radiantly . " Yes . Mama says you might as well be dead and buried if you have n't it . And that you must work very hard to see that you have it , lots of it . Or other people will hate you , and not let you in their houses , and that even God despises a man who has n't the gumption to work and get money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus was quite illuminated . " There is the story of the talents , you remember , Cousin Stuart . One man had four talents , and buried them , another had two or three , and returned them without increase to his master , and another had only one , and made it produce more . God loved that man , and threw the others into the outer darkness , because they had n't made them increase . " Stuart was highly irritated . " I do n't think those talents ' meant money at all ! " he exclaimed , irately . " I do n't recall that God was ever in the banking business . " Angus shook his head , humbly . " Yes , they were , Cousin Stuart . They were a Hebrew coin . " Stuart had an inspiration . Suddenly it seemed very necessary to him to set this boy right , to keep him from the path of destruction . He said : " Well , then , it was used as a parable , that story of the talents . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant gifts of God , such as ability and goodness and faith and charity . " But Angus was very literal in interpreting the Bible . " Talents were Hebrew coins , Cousin Stuart . " Stuart was baffled . He was also very confused . He had the highest regard for money , himself , and thought it Heaven 's supreme blessing and benediction on men . He had long ago determined that nothing should prevent him from getting it , in any way possible , and he had adhered to that determination . Nevertheless , there was something in him which was revolted and enraged at the spectacle of this boy 's incipientcorruption . He said , darkly , feeling himself very puerile : " Money is an explosive , Angus . It can do the most awful things . It can devastate and destroy . " Angus smiled at him , and Stuart was confirmed in his own suspicion that he was puerile . For that smile was singularly adult and indulgent . Stuart was angered , and got up abruptly from the table , quite disliking Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not bargained for this . He felt very tired . But he could not rudely dismissthem . They hungered after him as those who are chilled hunger for a fire . Laurie , in fact , came beside him , and took his hand trustingly . He sighed . He sat down in his chair . Then , after a look into the little girl 's lovely and shining face , he impulsively took her on his knee and began to twine her golden curls over his fingers . He kissed her . " You will be a heartbreaker one of these days , darling , " he said . Angus sat near him on the hearth , on a footstool . The warm and ruddy firelight fell on them comfortably . Fingers of red light danced and glided over the edges of exquisite sofas and chairs , and formed deep shining pools on the polished tables . The draperies had been drawn over the windows , and their folds glistened . The wind of the early evening had risen to a deep and minatory roar , shouting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . His Celtish soul was made restless and vaguely enormous . He saw the wind sweeping over the sea , roaring westwards , and his ancient blood was stirred . It was this that made him say to Laurie , with great tenderness , looking into her eyes : " Would you like me to tell you a story , my love ? " " Oh , yes , yes ! " she whispered , with shy eagerness , adoring him . Stuart , coming to consciousness , was annoyed . The wind , for an instant , became only a disturbance at the windows and among the bare trees . Then its voice penetrated , again , every tumultuous cell of his body . Stuart pondered . What was that strange story his grandmother had once told him , when he was scarcely older than Laurie ? It was only the ghost , the mood of a tale , but he had not completely forgotten it , and THE GETTING OF TREASURES " I05p105it had strange meanings hidden in it somewhere . Stuart did not rightly know the meanings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent , looked at him , waiting . Stuart , with sudden inner clarity , saw his grandmother in her warm chimney corner , her shawl over her shoulders , her smoking pipe in her sunken mouth . He saw the dark and glimmering firelight on the red tile floors , the stained darkness of wooden walls , the gleam of polished brass andirons . He saw how the tiny diamond-panes of the high sunken windows trembled in the wind outside , and how , at times , the candlelightflickered as it was disturbed on each pane , so that it momentarily shone like a small dark mirror . It was a wild night outside , that old dead night , and there was a turbulent wailing in the trees so that they groaned mysteriously . To Stuart 's memory , that room with its ancient woman by the fire had taken on an occult agelessness , so that it all seemed more of a fairytalethan any real remembrance . So it was that as he told Laurie the tale , his eye was wide and dim , seeing his grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was really nothing , after all , but moods and dreams . There was a small girl , homeless and wandering , who after many footsore days of travel , and much hunger and loneliness and sadness , came to the high wall of a strange garden . Over the top of that wall she could see the branches of the oddest trees , each leaf shining and polishedlike metal , and bearing among them round and golden fruit of the most uncommon kind . Birds sat among the leaves , motionless and dreaming , plumaged in yellow and red and blue and purple . The little girl longed for the fruit , and looked about her for a gate . She found it , sunken in the stones , and with fear , pushed it open . It made no sound . She entered the garden . There was no sound in it at all , and here the sunlight had a faint and gauzy light , as in a dream . Not a leaf fluttered . There was no breeze . The birds sat in the trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim but mysteriously clear radiance , which was like that hour just before dusk . The little girl saw roses , with rich hanging heads , and rosemary , and phlox and forget-me-nots and pansies , and great lilies with open striped yellow throats , and hang- ' ing leaves . Paths wound among the flowers , paths of scattered stones , between which the thick green moss was growing . The air , drowsy and dreaming , was filled with the most entrancing odors of flowers and shrubs , so heavy that the little girl could hardly breathe . There was the old and bewitched perfume of elderberry blos- some too , sweeter and more swooning than all the others . The little girl wandered down the paths , and looked at the sundials , and was vaguely surprised that , though the light was both soft and transparent , the sundials did not show the time . There was no shadow on them . Indeed , there were no shadows at all in this garden . Everything stood , soundless and breathless , in this garden without time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderberry scent came and went in long sweet puffs as if disturbed . Not a bird uttered a cry , or broke the silencewith the rustle of a wing . The little girl came to a pond , sunken in the thick green moss . It was like a round shield of glimmering pewter , and nothing disturbed it , not a ripple or the shadow of a fish or the flight of an insect . Two swans , white and still , slept on its surface , which reflected the pale blue sky . Beyond the pond , the trees were thick and dark and ancient , bending their heads and showing their golden fruit , which shone like little yellow suns in the half-light . And then the little girl was very frightened . She knew that she must leave this spellbound garden at once , and find her way back to the sunken gate and the highway . Perhaps her guardian angel had whispered to her urgently . And then she cried out that she was very tired and thirsty and hungry , and must eat of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would resume her journey , and look for a home . She climbed the branches of the nearest tree and plucked the fruit , and sank her little white teeth into it . She sat there in the branches , while the strange and beautifully-hued birds slept motionless near her , like fruit , themselves . The fruit was very sweet and juicy and delicious . It tasted like honey and wine , and its flesh was as satisfying as bread . And below the little girl lay the wide garden of flowers and pond and swans and trees , drifting in a faint and luminous mist like pearl and last sunlight , with the odor of elderberry sweet and swooning on the warm air . The little girl , satisfied and rested , climbed down the tree and stood beneath it . " I must go , " she said , aloud . She hardly heard her voice , which seemed to drown on the air . And then she became very sleepy , as if overpowered . She sank down on the warm thick moss and slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come , for when she awoke , the garden was just the same as she remembered . She arose . She looked about her , dreamily . But she had forgotten who she was , and from whence she had come , and where she was going . Shep129is no telling what your income will be ! I 've told you how we intend to expand ! You have seen for yourself ! " He watched her , his eyes kindling , his face dark with congested blood . " Janie ! Do you understand ? Do you see what I am offering you , who must be protected ? " Janie twined a red curl about one trembling finger . She was very white . He plunged down beside her again , laughing silently , and with evident joy . " I think I can persuade Sam , Janie ! I think he will understand how I can do no less , you being my cousin ! I will have the papers drawn up tomorrow , my darling ! And then you will have no worries , and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch your income grow , and anticipate larger and larger profits as we expand ! " Janie spoke hoarsely : " But Stuart , you did say that you were compelled to borrow ten thousand dollars from Mr. Allstairs , for your house . Why did you not withdraw the money from your business ? " At this shrewd query , Stuart was taken aback . His brow wrinkled . He cursed himself for his loose tongue . I never think ! he thought , hatinghimself . He forced himself to laugh boyishly , to look sheepish . He rubbed his cheek with the knuckles of his right hand . He chuckled , as if embarrassed . " My pet , I spoke too loosely . You must n't breathe that to a soul . You see , most of my money is in the business . Sam and I put back our profits into it . I suppose it is a little complicated to a female mind , but I will try to explain . If I had withdrawnthat ten thousand dollars from my business , I should have cut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want anything to interfere with that . " He put on a knowing air , and winked at her in an engagingfashion . " I do n't want anything to interfere with the expansion . It was a private loan from Allstairs . It has nothing to do with the shops at all . " He spoke his lies with so artless a manner , with such a boyish air of simple confession , that Janie , the astute , was completely deceived . In a way , also , she was seduced by her opinion of her own acumen . Stuart could never " come over " so shrewd a baggage as Janie Cauder ! " I see , " she murmured , with a clever air . She shook her red curls at him chidingly . " My love , you are very bad . Well , no matter . " She drew a deep breath . Her eyes gleamed again . " You will draw the papers tomorrow , Stuart ? " He was almost beside himself with his triumph . Tomorrow , then ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his devilishface . Then a quick marriage to Marvina , and her fortune . His mind whirled .

He would rage awhile , and threaten . But there was nothing he could do . Later he would be reconciled . The mighty fortune , in due course , would then fall into Stuart 's hands . He could hardly contain himself in his exultation and delirium . He had not dreamt it would be so easy . His opinion of himself rose to rapturous heights . What a devilishly clever dog he was ! What a brilliantblackguard ! He saw visions that made his senses swim . He caught Janie in his arms and kissed her with violence . She clung to him . Her mouth was hungry and tumultuous .

Miss Marvina inherits quite a fortune in her own name when she is twenty-one , from her late deceased grandfather , her mother 's father , from Pittsburgh . I believe it is nearly one hundred thousand dollars . You and I , Sam , could manage very well for three more years , even if things went badly with us , which they wo n't .

But you understand me , Sam , do n't you ? I would n't hurt you for the world . It is all my damned hasty tongue . I know what you are , in my heart . Sam , damn it , I love you . " Sam put his cold knotted fingers over Stuart 's warm hand . He said nothing . " Sam , you forgive me , do n't you ? " Sam rose . He put his hand over his face for a moment . " There is nothing to forgive , Stuart . " He dropped his hand . His haggard face was ravaged . " You will wait for me ? And then , we shall go to the banks , and our lawyer . "  |p136But  again , after all negotiations , the exuberant Stuart was frustrated , at least for the time being , in his plan to march boldly to Joshua and deliver him the cheque for ten thousand dollars . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza , and immediately upon making recovery , went for three weeks to a mountain inn to recuperate in airs higher and sweeter than those that blew with hard cold strength in Grandeville . While in the mountains , Joshua perfected his plans to take his daughterto England that summer and leave her there , a suitable chaperone and sponsor having been obtained . Stuart was glad of the reprieve , though momentarily disappointed . He , too , laid his plans , and they were bold ones indeed . Janie Cauder was now a silent partner in the Grandeville Supreme Emporium , and considered herself fortunate . She no longer had doubts that Stuart would marry her . He was all gallantry and affection . He was kind to her children , who apparently were very fond of him , except Robbie , who privately considered Stuart a simpleton . When Stuart suggested that the three boys attend the " gentleman 's school " which he himself had attended , Janie was pleased . It was so kind and civil of dear Stuart to be interested in her children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked with her in the late afternoons along the river , and from her windows Janie could see the pair of them , the tall and dashing Stuart in his tall hat and furred collar , and the child , in her cape and bonnet , walking hand in hand along the banks of the turbulent water . ANGUS looked about Father Houlihan 's house with shy curiosity and uncertain wariness . It was not at all the " den of iniquity " he had been led to believe all priests ' homes were , according to his grandfather , who had had a dour hatred of " Popery . " It was , rather , a mild little white cottage with a picket fence about it , which enclosed a small lawn , turningsteadily green now in the brisk May weather . Close to the house were flourishing rose bushes , already in full leaf . The small windows were brightly polished , and the draperies framing them were of some heavy cheap cloth the color of oatmeal . The white door boasted a brilliantlypolished brass knocker in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door to the beautiful little white church , and seemed to bask gently in its protection . The inside was as simple , bright and unpretentious as its exterior . A Turkey-red rug stretched over polished broad boards , and the furniture was all of solid oak and leather , with here and there a small good holy picture on the oaken walls . There was even a small organ , and some oaken tables , and a bright little fire on a blue-tiled hearth . ( Stuart had presented practically all the furniture in the house . ) On some of the tables were blue bowls of narcissi and tulips , the pride of Father Houlihan 's garden , which he cultivated himself , muddying his cassock and getting quite apoplectic in the process . Over the mantel was a large crucifix ( also a present from Stuart ) all of ebony and ivory , and beautifully carved . Angus glanced at the crucifix , startled , then , to Stuart 's irritation , averted his eyes as from somethingindecent . But the boy was very polite , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of it , his hat on his knees . Stuart regarded Angus with an attempt at sternness . But in truth he was really worrying how he was to impress the lad with the necessity of keeping this visit a secret from Janie . This was Sunday evening , and Stuart was to meet his friend Sam Berkowitz here , for the usual card game after Vespers . There would be beer waiting , and some of Mrs. O'Keefe 's good baked ham , and crusty bread . Now that he had brought Angus here Stuart , as usual , cursed himself for his impulsiveness . That afternoon he had seen Angus languishing wistfully , and with a tragic face , near the river , and had impetuously asked him if he would like to go visiting a friend that evening with his cousin . The boy had eagerly and gratefully accepted . Stuart had not revealed the identity of the friend until almost at the door of the cottage . Now he almost forgot what impulse had moved him to bring Angus here , except that some faint instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct had recognizedthat Angus needed a friend , someone compassionate and simple and good , and as usual , when thinking of these virtues , Stuart thought of the priest . He smiled irrepressibly . Perhaps , some day , he would tell Angus how he had come to know Father Houlihan . But that must be years from now . The meeting had occurred under disgraceful circumstances . It seemed that two of Father Houlihan 's flock were fairly wealthy men , a surprisingcircumstance . These two families had each a favorite and only son , handsome lads in their late teens , coddled and pampered byp138their parents and given entirely too much ready cash . As a result the lads were headstrong and wilful , and very extravagant . They had found their way , one Saturday evening , to the house of the town 's most expensive and luxurious brothel ( owned , of course , by Joshua Allstairs ) . Stuart had met them there . The ladies were very sparsely clad , and very young and gay , and the lads had begun to enjoy themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knee and a glass of whiskey in his hand . Stuart was in a similar position . Someone must have informed the fathers of the lads of this nocturnal excursion into the realms of illegal Venus . As , apparently , the fathers themselves were too well known in this house , they had appealed to the priest , obviously unwilling to go to the police for assistance . Father Houlihan , that doughty soul , had invaded the brothel armed with nothing more than his indignation and regret . He had had no intention of upbraiding either the madam or her girls , but only of rescuing the misguidedboys . Had he thought for a moment or two , Stuart reflected later , he might have acted less impulsively , and with a regard for his cloth . But Celt as he was , he acted first and regretted later . How he was able to force his way past the gargoyle that guarded the brothel , no one ever rightly knew , least of all the inflamed Father Houlihan . At any rate , he had exploded vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face from embarrassment and anger . The lads had with a crash to the floor . Father Houlihan , more and more embarrassed , and very enraged now , had struck each lad violently on the cheek , had stamped and shouted some more , and ordered them out of the house , uttering imprecations in a thick brogue . During the ensuing confusion , one of the young ladies had shrieked : " Who is that , in the name of God ? " Stuart , laughing uncontrollably , had glanced at the long black cassock that swirled energetically about Father Houlihan 's legs , and shouted : " Why , damn it , it 's Mrs. Grundy ! " As Father Houlihan , overcome by his embarrassment and his anger , was exhibiting symptoms of even more complete mayhem on the lads who had caused him to come here , Stuart rushed to the rescue , almost beside himself with mirth . Father Houlihan 's lusty vocabulary had aroused Stuart 's intense admiration , and the priest 's vigor , his shame , his utter blustering confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dexterously pushed the boys from the house , and hadp139returned to the priest who was panting hoarsely , and wiping his face with a huge white kerchief . Stuart took his arm . The priest resisted , and in a quite unclerical flow of language , had consigned him to hell . The two left the house together . Once on the sidewalk , the priest had turned to him fiercely . " It 's ashamed you should be before your God , leadin ' young spalpeens like that to their doom and damnation ! " he had exclaimed . " I did n't lead them there . " Stuart , still laughing , explained what had actually led the miscreants ' steps to that house . The priest had stared , horrified , and then had begun to laugh helplessly , despite himself . Besides , Stuart pointed out to him , it was very unseemly for a priest to go roaring into a brothel , even for the rescue of misguided youth . " I never think , " confessed Father Houlihan , ruefully . He stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? " " No doubt , " Stuart comforted him . He loved Father Houlihan immediately . " I never think " had a very familiar sound . Stuart walked to the priest 's cottage with his new friend . It was not white then , but a miserable bleak little shack with broken clapboarded walls . During that walk Father Houlihan bewailed his temper , and declared that he would have much to confess because of it . His manner was so earnest , so robust , and so childlike , that Stuart was more and more delighted . As they stood before the sad little cottage , Father Houlihan looked up at Stuart , and sighed . " A fine young feller like you ! And why should ye be going into a pit of hell like that ? With a wife and all , eh ? " " I have no wife , and no all , ' " Stuart assured him . Father Houlihan was slightly relieved , but he shook his head , sighing again . " A fine upstandingman ! " That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their lives , a lovely friendship with frequent riotous quarrels and rages only enhancing it . At least once a month Stuart left the priest 's house in a rage , advising him to go to the nether regions , and accompaniedto the door by Father Houlihan 's lusty voice using many sacred words but in a distinctly unsacred way . Then they would write each other a series of notes , abjectly apologizing , and meet the next Sunday . Stuart was still trying to find words with which to warn Angus , when Father Houlihan entered , beaming , filling the warm little room with vitality , health and enthusiasm . He was always enthusiastic , and was rarely dampened in his simple buoyancy , for he devoutly believed in the innate goodness of mankind despite all his knowledge to the contrary . " Well , well , well ! " he exclaimed , in a rich deep voice , and lookedp140at Angus with friendly sympathy and curiosity . Stuart had already told him of this young lad , and he was prepared , as was always his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose diffidently , clutching the brim of his hat . His pale thin face flushed . He could not look directly at the priest , and his heart was beating hard . He had expected some dark , lean and subtle Jesuit with an evil glinting face , with whom he must be on rigorous guard . But this very short , very fat , immensely broad and completely bald man of forty years resembled Friar Tuck far more than he did any Latin dialectician of subtle machinations . He hardly came to Stuart 's shoulder , and his cassock gleamed over his large belly and massive shoulders , so tight was it stretched . He had short fat hands , excessively white and well-kept  --  his one vanity  --  and very expressive . Everything about him was expressiveand volatile , and full of zest . He exuded joy in living , and ardent affection for everything , even when he was sad , which was very often . He had a great round head , the scalp polished , damp and shining , and very pink . Only above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were there a few golden hairs , the last of a once very handsome gilded mane . He had immense rosy ears , which stood out from his head in an attitude of pleased surprise , alert and listening . His face was very round and broad , pink and clean , with a series of chins . His corpulence was a source of great despair , and the object of much sorrowful meditation , but he could not resist good food and beer , in spite of all his prayers for assistance and mortification of the flesh . He had thick golden eyebrows over strenuous blue eyes , which shone restlessly and with huge humor . He also had a large bulbous nose . But he had the sweetest mouth , full and pink , with touching dimples always flashing , and a smile always trembling at the corners . He was a simple soul . But he was also extremely intellectual , a fact which did not becloud his simple faith . Once he had told Stuart that he did not believe in much knowledge . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and silences the heart 's intuition . Nevertheless , his own wisdom had not stupefied nor blinded him , and his heart 's intuition was as pristine in its clarity and prescience and loving kindness as though he had been newly born . He distrusted all subtle men , all dialecticians , all realists , all sophists , whether of his cloth or of the world , and this , in part , probably accounted for the fact that he was no favorite of his bishop 's , and remained a lowly priest all his life . Perhaps he was too honest , too forthright , too vigorous andp141single-hearted , too pragmatic , ever to rise to high ecclesiastical heights . Ile was beyond hypocrisy . He spoke of that vice often , but could never really understand it , and was always appalled and dumfounded when lie encountered it in others . He was also a bad businessman , and vague about his accounts , another thing which damned him in the eyes of his bishop . And he never set out to proselytize , for which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest bewilderment , that he loved God , and that other men doubtless also loved God , in their own peculiar ways . But he never got anywhere in his arguments with his severe bishop , and though he remained humble in the presence of that august man , he would leave the bishopric more confused than ever , his mouth moving dumbly with new arguments , his head shaking helplessly . Sometimes he would remain on the walk outside the noble house , staring at it vehemently for a long time , and then would leave in a very abased and confused state of mind , resolving to do better , though what the better was he had not the slightest idea . His love for his God gave him a great and beautiful dignity , which his corpulence could not diminish , nor his lustiness and enjoyment in living . His faith was like a light on his huge pink face and in his lively blue eyes . He also had a wild and uproarious bad temper when aroused , and an unbridled and lusty tongue , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty . Because he was so unaffected and sincere , the priest always looked steadfastly and directly at everyone , but with such kindness that he rarely offended . He looked now at young Angus , very earnestly , but the boy , blushing and ill-at-ease , only peeped at him shyly , and kept dropping his eyes . There was a little silence in the room . Stuart stood apart , and watched , smiling a little . Father Houlihan continued to study Angus with his simple and open directness , and , then , very slowly but clearly , a shadow of sadness and affection came over the priest 's face , and a dim sorrow clouded his violent blue eyes for a moment or two . Because there was no beam in his spiritual vision , he saw without distortion . " Well , well , well , " he said again , but in a gentle murmur this time . I le was suddenly abstracted . The warm May twilight was darkening . Father Houlihan took a wax taper from the mantelpiece , applied it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps , turningthem up carefully so that their mellow bloom soon flooded every corner . Stuart was annoyed at Angus . The boy had murmured an inarticu- late greeting , and then had remained standing like this , frightened and stiff and uneasy , with God only knew what thoughts in his mind . Stuart had warned him he must address the priest as " Father , " and he well understood how the word must stick in that young Presbyterian throat . Was it a mistake to have brought the young jackanapes here , to embarrassGrundy ? Angus furtively watched the priest moving lightly about the room , ambling comfortably from one lamp to the other . He seemed confused , himself . His picture was all awry . Father Houlihan , approaching the last lamp , complained that his sister had neglected to fill it . He bent over it , frowning and pursing his lips . He lit it . " And how would ye be today , Stuart ? " he asked . He smiled . There was still enough oil . He beamed at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you ? " " Oh , wonderful , wonderful ! I am always wonderful ! " He stood up , the taper in his hand , and the clear golden light fell on his face as he turned to Angus . It was a beautiful face , for all its pinknessand big fat features and its peasant heartiness . He smiled at Angus ; it was the loveliest smile of kindness and gentleness and warmth . He blew out the taper , and waved it gently back and forth in his hand . " So this is our Angus , eh ? This is the lad who would be a fine doctor ? " Angus colored deeply . But he managed an uncertain smile , and shifted on the balls of his feet . Father Houlihan neatly replaced the taper , pinched its blackened tip . He returned to Angus , and sighed enviously . " It was a doctor I dreamed of being , myself , in the old country . " He shook his head . He moved towards Angus very slowly and looked at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so short , their eyes were almost on a level . The priest looked into those young blinking eyes , so fearful , yet so hungry , and he saw their apprehension and their distrust of him . " It 's eyes like gray Scotch mist he has , " said the priest gently . " I spent many years in Scotland , near Inverness , where I had a cousin . He had sheep . I well remember it . And the Scotch mornings , just before dawn , and the morning star over the hills . " His strong rich voice was very tender . Angus lifted his head suddenly , and gazed at the priest without fear , and with excitement . " My dada sang a song about the morning star ! " he exclaimed , then colored again , more deeply than ever . His eyes filled with tears , and hep143jerked aside his head . The priest was silent . He looked at the lad , and his face was very sorrowful . " Perhaps , " he said , softly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus was silent . His throat worked . Father Houlihan put his arm about the lad 's shoulders , not quickly , so as to alarm him , but very slowly and comfortingly . " I shall say a prayer for your dada , tomorrow , " he promised . Angus moved restlessly , then , at the warmth of the loving arm about him , which he could not resist in his heart 's hunger , he was still . But he looked at Father Houlihan with uncertain sternness . " We ca n't pray for the dead  --  sir , " he said , with piping resolution . " They are in God 's hands . They have no further care for our prayers , which can not help or hinder them . " The tears were bright in his eyes . Father Houlihan was quiet a moment , then he patted Angus ' shoulder . " I should like to know that my friends remember me , and send their greetings to me in the form of prayers , and that God listens to them in my behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but believe that they know , and that God lends us His ear when we pray in love and sorrow . " " But we ca n't change their fate , which was fixed when they were born , " whispered Angus , obstinately . " And even before they were born . Predestination . " Father Houlihan was not one to argue dogma with anyone , and especially not a hurt and suffering child . But he said , his voice ringing warmly and tenderly : " Ah , that would be cruel of God , I would be thinking , to condemn a man from his mother 's womb . I can not believe that God is less merciful than men . Ah , well , " he added , his tone dropping , and sighing , " it is not for us to know yet , for sure . But we can t rust in His eternal kindness and love . That is all we can know . " He pressed Angus ' shoulder again , then removed his hand . He smiled brightly . " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And a fine one , no doubt . Good doctors are born , as priests are born , with their vocation in their souls . " Angus was still obstinate , but his resolution was fading . He regarded lather Houlihan with less sternness now , and less shyness . Something warm and sweet was pervading him , something like consolation . Then he remembered that his grandfather had often told him that the servantsof Rome were like serpents , insinuating and soft of movement , seeking whom they might devour with seductive words and tender gestures . " Thank you , Mr.  --  " he began , stiffly , then caught Stuart 's hard look upon him . " Reverend , " he amended , through dry lips . The poorp144lad hoped this would satisfy his mother 's cousin . Priests were reverends , too , were n't they ? Father Houlihan beamed at him . " And how would you be liking our America , Angus ? " " Very well , thank you , " replied Angus , politely . His fingers ached from their tight clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houlihan removed it from the lad 's clutch , and laid it beside Stuart 's on a table . Angus stared at his hat , vaguely affrighted and uncertain , but there was nothing he could do . The priest turned to Stuart . " Sam is already here , in the back room , with the shades drawn . You 'll be liking a game , as usual ? " " What the hell do you think I came for , Grundy ? " said Stuart , boisterously . He could feel Angus ' shocked and frightened eyes on him , and he had a momentary impulse to smack the lad heartily and put some sense into him . But he avoided looking at him . Father Houlihan hesitated . He glanced at Angus . " And what will the boy be doing while we play ? " he murmured . Angus tugged at his pocket with trembling fingers . " I always carry my Testament with me on Sunday , " he said , almost incoherently . He produced a small , black-bound book and held it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect it . " Good , good ! " exclaimed Father Houlihan . He hesitated again . Stuart wore an expression of violent patience , and nodded at the priest emphatically . Father Houlihan shrugged . He left the room , Stuart followinghim , and Angus bringing up the rear with the fearful step of one entering catacombs where all kinds of blasphemous horrors could be found . Father Houlihan fell back a moment . He touched Stuart 's arm . " Ah , the poor , poor child ! " he whispered , and there was a plea in his voice . They walked down a dark little passage to a door that opened on a very comfortable little sitting-room , crowded , warm and lit with fire . Two dogs rose inquiringly on their entrance , and began to bark a welcome . They were curly black spaniels with impudent faces , and they rushed at the priest and pretended to devour him with love . They then turned their ministrations upon Stuart , who scratched the backs of their necks . Next , they turned , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had brightened shyly . Recognizing a friend , the dogs fell upon him with squeals of delight . He picked one up in his arms , and began to laugh . That laugh was reluctant and feeble , as if seldom used , but very childish . The dog kissed him heartily , while hisp145mate tried to climb Angus ' leg in an access of jealousy . Angus struggled with the dog he held , trying to escape the kisses , and trying to retain hold upon the fat and ecstatic little body . He laughed again , eagerly . le looked over the dog 's lively head at Father Houlihan , who was watching with compassionate and smiling intentness . " I 'd love a dog ! " said Angus , with unaffected longing . " But mama will not have it . " There was no strain in his voice now , no wariness . He put the dog down , and it joined its mate in attempting to scale Angus ' long thin legs . He looked down at them , loving their liquid and lively eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room now , someone who was rising slowly from behind a small green-baize table near the fire , on which were two decks of cards and a wooden box . Angus was startled , and immediately shy and reserved again . This , t hen , must be Mr. Sam Berkowitz , of whom Stuart had told him . Angus was full of distrust and reticence once more . He had never seen a Jew in his life , and from the stories he had heard of the Hebraic race , he was prepared to see someone closely resembling Fagin , from Mr. Dickens ' famous story . But this was no Fagin , the boy observed confusedly . This was a tall , very thin stooped man , with thick and premature white hair and a long gentle face full of wisdom . The eyes looked at Angus with his own shyness and reserve , and faintly smiling . Apparently Mr. Berkowitz had no fashion , for his long dun-colored coat sagged from his thin shoulders , and his pantaloons were wrinkled . He held a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My young cousin , Angus , " said Stuart , carelessly , going to the fire and rubbing his hands . " Angus , this is Mr. Berkowitz . " Sam bowed his shoulders slightly , and smiled at the boy . " Good riming , " he said , courteously , in his accented deep voice . He gazed at Angus thoughtfully . " Good evening , " muttered Angus . He was again ill at ease , and frightened . But Father Houlihan was bustling at the fire , and had drawn up a chair near the friendly warmth . Angus sat down with a murmured thanks . The dogs fell on him again , and both attempted to jump into his lap . He forgot his fear , and assisted them . They stood on his knees on their hind legs , and kissed him with enthusiasm . He began to smile , hugging them pathetically to him . Father Houlihan went to the table , where Stuart had already seated himself , and took his place . I le winked at Stuart . His broad black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed , " and who will be winning tonight , do you think ? " " We , as usual , as we always do on Sundays , you blackguard , " said Stuart , darkly . " There 's a law against card cheats , you know . I could shoot you and be exonerated . " He tapped the wooden box , which had a wide slit in its locked cover . On the side were printed the words : " Poor Box . " " I 'd like to know how much you filch from it after Sam and I are gone . " Father Houlihan laughed with a rollicking sound . " Now , then , that 's very bad of you , Stuart . I only open it once a month , for the poor . There were one hundred ninety dollars in it last time , " he hinted , wistfully . It was the custom for the friends to come here on Wednesday and Sunday evenings to play cards . But the winner was obliged to put all his winnings into the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " observed Stuart , still darkly , as he dexterously shuffled the cards , and began to deal them , " but you have a strange way of winning on Wednesdays , while Sam and I almost invariably win on Sundays . That would be due to your prayers , no doubt ? " " God always rewards those who help the poor , " said Father Houlihan , with a chuckle . He picked up the five cards that Stuart had dealt him , and sighed . " Now , then , you will accuse me of cheating again , but these cards are remarkably bad . " " Oh , of course , " said Stuart , with vicious emphasis . " Not even a little pair , I presume ? " " Not openers , at any rate , " admitted the priest , laying the cards face down on the table . He looked at Stuart and Sam expectantly . " I vill open , " said Sam , tossing two blue chips on the table . " Damn it . I will raise you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sadly and had thrown aside his cards with an expressive gesture of his hands . " It 's up to us two , as usual , " said Stuart . " Grundy 's out of it  --  as usual . " Father Houlihan leaned his black fat arms on the table and watched the betting with sparkling interest . In a moment there were five dollars in chips between the two men . " Three kings , " said Stuart , fatally . Sam raised his eloquent eyebrows , smiled , shrugged , and shook his head . " You haf me beat , Stuart , " he admitted . In the meantime Angus had become aware of what sinfulness was transpiring near him , in the ruddy warmth of the firelight . His faceTHE GETTING OF TREASURES " 147p147became white and rigid with shock . His eyes were distended . The caresses of the dogs went unheeded . He had been right , then . This was a den of iniquity , in which his godless relative , Stuart , violated the Holy Sabbath with a black and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cast into the outer darkness . He felt appalled pity and terror for Stuart , Stuart who was too innocent and too kind to realize the fiendish nature of those who were seducing him into damnation . He wanted to cry out , to implore Stuart to flee from this fiendish place before it was too late . His agitation was so extreme that his mouth shook and tears of complete terror flooded his eyes . The sensitive dogs , feeling his emotion , crouched on his knees and gazed at him with their liquid eyes . They whimpered a little . Automatically , his trembling cold hand soothed them . They cowered under it , bewildered . " Grand-da was right , " said Angus to himself , his heart quivering with fear . He looked at the gleaming black back of the priest , at the back of the huge rosy skull , which glinted in the firelight , at Sam 's mysterious quiet face and gentle smile . They would devour poor Stuart , these two , and drag him into the pit with them . Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witchery of demons . His legs felt cold and paralysed . His throat and mouth were as dry as cloth . Stuart had forgotten him . He was absorbed in his game , his handsome and mercurial face frowning and intent . He swore softly and obscenely under his breath . " God damn it ! You 've never seen such cards ! " he cried . He suddenly picked up Father Houlihan 's discarded cards , and glared at them suspiciously , after exclaiming : " I 'll bet you 've got better , you scoundrel ! " I le added , with grudging surprise : " No , by God , you have n't ! The devil 's in it ! " " You will think I cheat , wo n't you ? " remarked the priest , complacently . " I do n't understand it ! If you are n't lying in your teeth , the only time you get decent cards is on Wednesday . The devil 's in it ! " The priest was smug . He said , piously : " God protects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed . Sam laid down his cards . " A royal flush ! " wept Stuart . " The first time in my life , and probablythe last ! And it has to happen on a Sunday ! " The others burst out laughing . Father Houlihan leaned forward to gaze at the miracle , with reverence . He then looked at the pot . " Twenty dollars ! "  |p148But  Stuart was beside himself , now that he realized the full extent of the calamity . He pounded on the table with his fists . " A royal flush ! A royal flush ! The first time in a thousand years ! What I could have done with that at Mrs. Sheldon 's ! I 'd have made a fortune ! And it has to happen in this den of vice on a Sunday , for the poor box ! " The chips and cards danced . Sam and the priest rocked with mirth at this wild-eyed grief . They clutched each other , as they were in danger of falling from their chairs . Tears spurted from the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into fresh paroxysms . Even the silent Jew was overcome . He laid his head on the table and sobbed weakly . Stuart continued to keen over his ghastly luck , and with his fresh lamentations the agonies of laughter of the others increased . The dogs began to bark . They jumped from Angus ' lap and began to cavort around , in the wildest excitement . It was some time before the game could continue . COMPARATIVE quietness prevailed after a while , though Stuart wailed at intervals , and cursed . They had all forgotten , in the excitement , the silent white-faced boy staring at them with his distended eyes from the corner of the fireplace . A soft spring rain had begun to fall . It whispered against the windows . The fire sung to itself on the hearth , and the light winked off the andirons . The little dogs slept on the hearthrug , and whimpered in their dreams . The lamplight burned with a merry glow . The comfortablelittle sitting-room was cloudy with smoke which poured from Stuart 's and the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall were several shelves of books , whose crimson and blue backs bulged from much handling . It was pleasant and full of friendliness and comfort for all in the room except Angus . A long time had passed , filled with the sound of spring rain , fire , the little whimperings of the dogs , and the slap of cards and clink of chips , and Stuart 's colorful curses and the laughter of the others . Angus had sat for nearly an hour in a tense and rigid state , as if in a catalepsy , his fingers like iron about his Testament . He never looked away from thep149players . His eyelids stung and turned red with smoke and strain . At intervals , long cold rigors ran over his emaciated young body . Then at last , nature came to his rescue with a loud protest at the constrictionof his muscles , and he was forced to relax . Sharp and aching pains invaded his legs and arms . His back felt broken . Against his will , he leaned against the back of his comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the warmth of the fire . But his heart was trembling , and there was a pounding in his head . His vision dimmed , and he closed his eyes . Long slow tears ran under his shut eyelids . He was hardly more than a flat shadow in the chair , one hand hanging vulnerablyover the arm , and its whiteness was like the whiteness of death . He was no longer frightened . He could not have told what his emo-t ions were . He only knew that he felt lost and most frightfully lonely , even more lonely than usual . And agonizingly weary . The Testament lay shut on his knee . Another hour ticked away . There was a brisk bustle at the door , and Angus , half asleep in his exhaustion , started up . The nicest little short fat woman was entering , with silvery hair and cheeks like pomegranates and a white apron over her black bombazine . She shouted : " Are you sinners ready for your supper , then ? " " One moment , O'Keefe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and bowed to the woman courteously . Father Houlihan was engrossed in his hand . " One moment , Sarah . Ah , no , Stuart , it 's all yours , I am afraid . " " It 's hotter than the bad place itself , in here , " said Mrs. O'Keefe , removingher glasses and polishing them . " And no air , by all the Saints ! You 'll be smothering , that you will . " She went purposefully towards the window , and , as she passed Angus , she started and stared at him . " Well , well . What have we here ? " Angus rose , though all his limbs creaked and ached . He peeped at her , prepared to be frightened again , but this little hearty woman with the wide smile and little twinkling blue eyes was no alarming spectacle tie returned her smile , and gave her his short stiff bow . Stuart glanced over his shoulder , and stared at Angus as if he were an apparition . He had completely forgotten about him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my cousin 's boy . Angus . Angus Cauder . This is Mrs. O'Keefe , Angus , Father Houlihan 's sister . " His voice was apologetic and somewhat sheepish . He rose , pushing back a lock of black hair from his damp forehead . " Whew ! " he ex/claimed . " I 'm running with sweat . Angus , I 'm sorry I neglected you so long . " But Angus and Mrs. O'Keefe were regarding each other in silence . The poor lamb , thought the woman , it 's feeding he needs , and a lot of it . She put her hand on the thin arm and patted it . She cocked her head and mumbled reprovingly between her lips , then said : " Well , now , it 's ashamed they should be for leaving you like this , and me dying for a bit of company upstairs alone . They should have brought you up to me . " Angus tried to remind himself coldly that here was another Papist , and one inevitably doomed to hideous eternal torments . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such warm kindness and affectionateaffability . " Thank you , ma'am , " he murmured . " I  --  it did n't matter , truly . I  --  I was just resting . " ' Mrs. O'Keefe studied him shrewdly . " It 's not resting you should be at your age , Angus , but laughing and playing . " Father Houlihan , feeling much distressed that he had been so remiss towards his young guest , wondered what to say . He was much afraid of his sister , and respected her tongue . He began to clear his throat . But Mrs. O'Keefe firmly ignored him , and said to Angus : " And would you like to stretch your legs a bit and help me bring in the supper for the sinners ? " Angus , in an agony of renewed shyness , wandered behind Mrs. O'Keefe into the brightest warmest kitchen he had ever seen , all redtileand copper , and broad window-seats full of plants , and a black range fuming against the wall . There were platters of cold baked ham , spiced apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold beer waiting . " There , now , the platter , my lovey , first , and yes ! the cloth for the table , and the silver , and those big napkins , the one in the ring for the Father , the one folded across for Mr. Coleman , and the square one for Mr. Berkowitz . They 'd be liking clean napkins every time , but that 's an extravagance . Here , lovey , another plate for you . To think they never told me , the wretches ! You like ham ? " " Very much , thank you , " said Angus , weakly . He sighed . The warmth and brightness invaded his cold limbs . He looked at the back of Mrs. O'Keefe 's broad and active body , and for some reason the way the white apron was tied , in a huge starched bow , made him want to cry again . He winked back the tears . He swallowed . He almost whispered : " Do they play cards  --  every Sunday , Mrs. O'Keefe ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed , fondly . Then something in the boy 's voice caught her belated attention . She turned about , quickly , and again her shrewd little blue eyes dwelt on him . " Why , lovey ? " Angus turned crimson . The plates almost fell from his hands . " Nothing . Only , in Scotland we do n't do those things . The Sabbath is a day rest " " That it is , Angus ! This is their rest , the poor darlings . " She still watched him , with growing sympathy . " You do n't like it , eh ? " " It  --  it 's just that it 's strange to me , " he faltered . Mrs. O'Keefe observed him with kind silence . Then , in a very gentle and maternal voice , she said : " My lovey , there is something everyone should learn , very early . It is only what a man has in his heart that 's either good or bad . And if it 's bad , and wicked , and malicious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and all the praying , and the observing of the holidays is nothing . Nothing . And that 's the God 's solemn truth , child . " Her tone took on strength and quietness , and her blue eyes were piercing . Angus gazed at her , blinking his eyelids , trying to reconcile what he had heard with what he had been taught . He stammered : " You mean that they  --  they are good men , and God will forgive them for desecrating the Sabbath ? " " Desecrating the Sabbath ! " repeated Mrs. O'Keefe , roundly . " By all the Saints ! They 're doing nothing to the Sabbath except be a little happy ! And that 's what God wanted us to be on the Sabbath , and every et her day , my poor lamb ! " She added : " Did you think God wanted us to be miserable ? " Angus stared at her . Then a curious flash passed over his face , and he said , almost incoherently : " Yes . Yes , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that is what I thought ! " Mrs. O'Keefe , an impulsive woman , came to him then and kissed bun soundly , and hugged him in her short fat arms , which were so comforting and safe . He submitted , holding the plates out of her way , and enduring the most curious sensation of sweetness and consolation . I le was blinded by his pathetic emotion ; he felt his Grandmother Driscull'sarms about him , and smelled the same nostalgic odor of clean pin ! gentle warm flesh , motherly and substantial , a help in trouble , a tenderness in pain . There was in him such a passionate hunger for love that he could hardly endure this great pang and swelling in his chest . He carried in the plates , then returned to the kitchen quickly . He watched Mrs. O'Keefe cutting seed-cake . He said , stammeringly : " Mrs. O'Keefe , do Catholics hate Protestants ? " She looked at him quickly , and smiled . " I have no doubts that many of them do ! " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way with silly people . We all have to hate something , it seems , do n't it ? Why , I do n't know . It 's original sin , I 'll be thinking . It 's one of those things that one 's got to accept , like sickness and worry and accidents and death . " Angus ' mind was all chaotic . He moved closer to Mrs. O'Keefe , and alertly understanding his terrible need , she paused in her work and regardedhim with compassionate gentleness . She knew the tumult in that unlearned young heart , and felt humble that it was given her to alleviate it in a measure . " You see , " he said timidly , his pale thin face quite scarlet and desperatelyearnest , " I 've heard so many things . It  --  it all seemed simple to me . Good on one side , bad on the other " And the good side , of course , " said Mrs. O'Keefe , with gentle satire , " was the side of your papa and mama , and granddaddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , yes , in a way , " he said slowly , fumbling with his words as though they were unfamiliar objects , and very strange . " And it never seemed necessary to me to ask questions about it . It 's very hard , asking questions , and very sad , too , seeing that perhaps your side was n't right at all , and there was something to be said for the other . It  --  it makes things not so simple . I  --  I like it to be simple , you see . " He gazed at her with a desperate intensity . " Mrs. O'Keefe , I 've read the books , too , how the Catholics burned and hanged the Protestants , and the Massacre of St. Bartholomew , and the persecutions of the Huguenots , in France . How does  --  Reverend Houlihan explain that ? They are n't lies , you know . And what Philip of Spain did to the Dutch , with the priests behind him . " Mrs. O'Keefe laid down her knife , and slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very grave . She said , slowly : " It 's true , perhaps , what you say , poor lad . But the Protestants did that to the Catholics , too , you see . They did it to each other , in their hateful ignorance and folly . What does the Father say ? He knows all these things , what the Church has done , and its cruel old priests . But the priests were human . They are n't above other men , in spite of their frocks and collars . " She drew a deep , sorrowful breath ; her bright blue eyes were stern and quiet.  | " The Father knows it all . But he has his faith , not only in God , but in all mankind , that someday it will be kind and gentle and full of love and pity . It was only last week that he said to dear Stuart : I 've been asked why I am a priest in a Church that has so bad a history for blood and persecution and intolerance . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are now a citizen of the United States . Is the Republican Party without fault ? Are the hands of America clean of all aggression and conquest and war , and other ugliness ? If a man will not join a Party , or a Church , or a country unless it be without fault and without stain , then that man will join none of them , and he will stand alone in the world ! No , we can not be such fools . We can not doubt the good in a Church , a Party or a nation because it has had its dark histories , and its wickedness . We can only try to help it develop its good , and overcome its evil . By our faith , and our daily acts , we can make a sweeter history , and a force that will help in the liberation of mankind through the long ages to come . " Angus was silent . He looked into the good woman 's tender eyes . His hand slowly warmed in hers . They stood like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Angus said , softly : " Father  --  Houlihan  --  he is a very good man . I 'm glad Stuart brought me tonight , Mrs. O'Keefe . I 'm glad I know you , too . " An expression of light and peace came into the poor boy 's face . He smiled again , and sighed . He carried more food into the other room , moving as if in a dream . Mrs. O'Keefe watched him go , with tears in her eyes . Stuart was ruefully putting his winnings into the poor box , and makingloud and bitter protests . But among them he dropped several gold pieces , surreptitiously . He said , darkly : " Grundy , I 'm going to watch what you do with all this money , some day . I believe you put it in yourirts , and smack your chops over it . " " Never mind , " said the priest , soothingly . " Perhaps your inordinate tick will be excellent next Wednesday , my Stuart . Perhaps another iracle , eh ? " They all sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the silver and fresh whiteness of the cloth . Sam Berkowitz helped himself 4 ) the cold beef . Father Houlihan winked at Stuart , then said to Sam : Now , then , why be intolerant , my dear Sam ? Why do you not tastethis delicious ham , which Sarah has so kindly baked for us ? "  | Sam smiled slowly . A look of dark humor came over his features . " I shall no longer be intolerant , Father . Next Friday evening I shall join you over a plate of ham , and we shall eat it together . " Father Houlihan laughed uproariously , beating his fork handle on the table . " You have me there , Sam , you divil , you ! It is worth a special dispensation , by all the Saints ! " The chatter became loud , sometimes acrimonious , sometimes violent , sometimes punctuated with bursts of laughter , sometimes turning serious and somber . Angus listened in a daze . He had entered a strange , warm Never-Never Land , which was bewildering but oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Keefe , drinking their beer on this Sabbath evening , and it no longer seemed sinful to him , but kind and harmless . He listened to political arguments , and when slavery was discussed he stopped his eating , and was all painful attention . Father Houlihan pointed his knife at Stuart , who had just vociferously disagreed with him . " I tell you , Stuart , we shall have a frightful war over this question . I know it , like a seer . Nothing can avert it . The tempers of men are too high and too violent . There are large interests in the North which can not compete in the labor markets against the South , with its slave labor . The cause of abolition is holy . Then , though the war will be fought , not as a holy crusade ( though the people will believe that ) , but actually in the cause of economics , slavery will be abolished . Out of the greed of men a great wrong is often righted . I must disagree with Holy Writ in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stones can become bread . " " I still do n't think we shall fight for the sake of benighted blackamoors , " said Stuart , thinking again , with regret , that he might have made a fortune in the Underground . " I , for one , shall not fight to free niggers . I shall mind my own business . " Father Houlihan shook his head , smiling . " I doubt that you could resist a fight , my boy . " A peculiar expression came over Stuart 's face . He glanced furtively at Sam . There had been something bothering him lately . He cleared his throat , and said brightly : " Oh , by the way , Sam , I forgot to tell you something . It will interest you . " Sam looked at him with doubtful distrust . When Stuart assumed this air of boyish pleasure , this air of openness , skulduggery was well under way . " What is it this time , Stuart ? " he asked , uneasily . Stuart frowned at him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GETTING OF TREASURES " 155 " I , " said Father Houlihan blandly , " am also suspicious . You see , dear boy , you do n't deceive your old friends . " Stuart flung himself back in his chair with an air of angry exaspera-t ion . He looked about the table with ire . " I 've never known friends to have so little faith in a man ! I 'd best keep this to myself , it seems . " But Sam was disturbed . He said , quietly : " Tell me , Stuart . " " It 's nothing at all , I tell you ! Only a chance for an excellent profit . " Ile leaned towards them , angrily . " You know , Sam , how I had the idea of advertising all over the damn country for large job lots of goods that were refused by retailers for one reason or another , including bankruptcy . It was a blasted good idea , you admitted yourself . That is how we got that consignment of china which was refused in Utica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consignments , and bought them for a song . The news must have got around , and there is a lot of envy among retailers that they had n't thought of it , themselves . They 're rectifying their mistakes now , of course , after we showed the way . " Sam nodded . " Yes , this I know . Go on , Stuart . " Father Houlihan was listening with shrewd interest . Stuart was speaking quickly now , with irritation . " Well , then , though we are having more imitators all the time , we are still ahead of all the others . We offer reasonably fair prices . Our advertisements are better written , and draw more offers of refused consignments , or overstock . People have faith in us . " Well , three days ago I had a visitor , at home . Two weeks before that I had received a letter from a certain growing arms and powder concernin Pennsylvania , a place called Windsor . I was requested to grant an interview to a certain member of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . Now what , ' I said to myself , have I to do with this firm , called Barbour &; Bouchard ? ' It is true we sell powder and firearms and rifles , when we can buy them in large lots , and make a tidy profit , but why should this concern , who manufacture these things themselves , wish to discuss a very confidential matter with me  --  us ? I know that they use an excellent brand of steel , called Sessions . Remember , Sam ? We bought a consignment of their firearms for cash , which was shipped to Syracuse , the retailer having just gone into bankruptcy ? They were fine articles , you remember . We made a pretty penny on them . So , said I to myself , why does Mr. Bouchard crave this interview with me , in secrecy ? " Sam was silent . His long hands closed tightly over the edge of thep156table . His brown eyes were narrowed and fearful . Stuart avoided looking at him , directly . He waved his hand with a careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago . A damned grinning Frenchman , with curly black hair and eyes like a happy devil 's . He brought with him a letter from the president of his firm , an Ernest Barbour . He made me promise that the matter would not be discussed outside of our own concern . Naturally , I gave him that promise , and I 'm keeping it . " Father Houlihan smiled irrepressibly . But he said nothing . His expressionbecame grave and thoughtful once more . Stuart was more and more careless . His voice became enthusiastic , and bold . " Mr. Bouchard made me a very interesting , and overwhelmingproposition . I am to advertise , discreetly , for large lots of rifles , any kind , and obtain them . Ten thousand rifles . " " Ten thousand rifles ! " cried Sam involuntarily . " But why does this gentleman need ten thousand rifles ! And why do they not manufacture them , themselves , with their excellent steel of which you haf told us ? " Stuart was embarrassed . He reddened . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they want a lot of cheap rifles , immediately , to sell cheaply , and as they have a certain prestige they do n't want these rifles to bear their trade-mark . Nor , for the sake of their prestige , perhaps , do they wish to advertise themselves . It is apparent they do not wish their name connected with this transaction . No one must know , " added Stuart , unguardedly , " that Barbour &; Bouchard are involved in this . " Sam and the priest exchanged a long disturbed look . Then said Sam : " Mr. Bouchard , perhaps , told you all these things , very openly , of course ? " " Yes , he did ! What does it matter ? They want these rifles , bought discreetly . They want me to consign them , after purchase , to a certain border city , in Kentucky , not in one large lot , but in a number of small consignments . They have given me a certain name . Wherever I buy these rifles , I am to send directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will never see the rifles , of course ; they will never be sent to Grandeville . My part is the advertising , the buying , the consignment . That is all . " He patted a pocket . " I have the name of the man , and the station , to whom the rifles are to be consigned . I have never heard of him . It is all very confidential . And  --  " he paused , impressively , " I am to receive exactly twice the cost of the rifles as my profit . " " THE GETTING OF TREASURES " 157p157But Sam was looking with dark and heavy alarm at Father Houlihan . " Ten thousand rifles , consigned to an obscure man in an obscure Southerncity . Why ? That is what I must know . " " Good God ! " shouted Stuart , banging the table with his fist , " do n't you suppose the Southerners wish rifles for hunting , too , and other things ? " But Sam was not intimidated . He looked at Stuart directly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these rifles , themselves , which they can do so much more cheaply , and keep the profits for themselves ? 1 haf heard of them . They manufacture much . Unless , " he added , gravely , " these are needed quickly  --  at once . " " That 's it , of course . " Stuart was relieved , though he was still flushed . " But why all this secrecy , this confidence , this swearing to silence ? " " I do n't know , I tell you ! What does that matter to me ? I am interestedonly in the profits ! " Sam looked at the priest . " Secrecy  --  arms  --  obscure consignments . I do not like this . I do not like this Barbour &; Bouchard . They are evil men . Their odor reaches the nostrils of men everywhere . Ten thousand rifles , shipped in the deepest secrecy . It has a bad sound . And I think I know why all this is . " Stuart cursed himself , as usual , for his loose tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to advertise , to buy , to reconsign . " But Sam ignored him . He said to the priest : " It was only three weeks ago that I read in the papers that this firm has received an order from the Federal Government for twenty-five thousand new rifles , to be manufacturedimmediately . Yet it is apparent they do not wish these ten thousand rifles for the United States Government . They wish all secrecy . The rifles are to be consigned to a Southern city . What , my dear friend , is your conjecture on this ? " " The obvious one , my dear Sam , the obvious one , " replied the priest , in great distress . He looked at Stuart , steadfastly . " You see , do you not , my son ? " " No ! " shouted Stuart , violently . " I do not ! I do n't use my imagination ! I take men 's words for things ! I do n't pry and question into something which is none of my business ! " But Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Stuart ? These men can not involve themselves in this . They would disclaim any connection , in the event of a Governmental investigation . Yours will be the danger , as well as the profits . Should you , in your danger , declare that they were the instigators , that you had this visitor and the proposi- tion , they would explain that they had merely approached you , as a retailer , in order to sell you their rifles . Yours would be the name of the consigner , the instigator . They have power and prestige . They will be believed . " Stuart was momentarily nonplussed . Then he said , violently thrustingback his chair : " I need that money . I need the profits . I intend to do it . " " I am your partner , " said Sam , in a strong voice . " I can not permit it . " " Then I shall use my own money ! I shall borrow it ! I know I can borrow it , with ease ! " His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering . " You lend yourself to murder , to war between brethren ? " asked the priest , sternly . Stuart smiled at him darkly . He was breathless . " Did you not say that the cause of Abolition is a holy one ? I 'm willing to help in such a holy cause ! " The priest was silent . His pink face was now very pale . His eyes were earnest . Then he said : " The arming of the South is no holy cause . " Sam had no " loose " tongue . He rarely discussed the affairs of the shops with others than Stuart . But he was too distracted now for reticence . He said , and in a voice that Stuart had never heard before : " You speak of your need for money , Stuart . I know you need it  --  always do you need it . You will not live modestly , until you acquire a fortune . You live recklessly  --  for the day . When men are reckless , they need large sums , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no greed in you that desires this ; it is necessity . I haf urged you to save , to guard , until it is safe to spend so , in your way . But you will not . Men like you are driven to evil things because of their need , because of their extravagance . " " Stuart , you are determined on this thing ? " asked Father Houlihan , with great anxiety . " I could not endure it , Stuart , if I thought that what you have done for me has so indebted you to others that you must needs engage in a nefarious traffic to recover your losses . " Stuart , the mercurial , was touched by this simple distress . He pressed the priest 's hand . He said airily , ignoring Sam and his unpleasant remarks : " Do n't worry , Grundy . What I did for you cost me very little . No , I need a lot of money . I always need it , damn it ! And I 'm not going to wait until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p159before  I can buy what I wish . I 'm afraid I would n't want it , then . Frankly , I 'm in difficulties . I see a way to turn a pretty penny . I 'd be a fool to refuse it . I do n't know what the rifles are needed for ; I do not care . If I refuse the offer , others will accept . I shall have nothing but a moral conscience if I refuse , and moral consciences never paid off mortgages nor bought a man a woman , nor feathered a nest , nor , at the last , even bought bread . " Sam said nothing . He shook his head over and over , in the most somber dread and grief . Stuart , recovering his spirits , laughed at him . " You 'll pay my bail , eh , Sam , if I am hauled in ? You 'll visit the poor prisoner with a basket , and , perhaps , a saw and a rope ? " His full handsome face was flushed heavily . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment and fear . Mrs. O'Keefe , unconcerned with the arguments of men , had been filling beer glasses , and had brought Stuart his extra glass of whiskey , which he always demanded . Sam and the priest regarded him in silence . They loved him deeply . They saw him as a foolhardy child , not as a malefactor . If he had been naturally evil and rapacious he would not have been their friend ; they would not have loved him . To them he was the perpetual boy , heedless and violent , who must be protected from his own unthinking predicaments . " I shall pray that you will not do this thing , " said Father Houlihan at last , in a weary voice . " For the sake of your soul . " Stuart laughed boisterously . " My soul , by God ! I have no soul ! But thank you kindly just the same , Grundy . If I feel any stirrings in my breast I 'll run to you at once , shouting Eureka ! ' " He became ostentatiously aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put his hand on the lad 's shoulder . " Almost done , Angus ? We 'll soon be off , then . It is getting late , and your dear mama will be worrying about you . " " We will talk about all this , tomorrow , " said Sam , heavily . Stuart waved his hand airily , but did not look at the other man . " No se , Sam . I 've already accepted , and spent , an advance . I have agreed to the contract . " He pushed back his chair . With an effort , and a sad face which tried to smile , Father Houlihan looked gently at the pale Angus . He said : " So it is a doctor you 'd be , : Hy child . And why ? " Angus looked at him eagerly . " I 've always felt so  --  Father Houlihan !  |p16o  It is so terrible to see people suffer . I do n't want to make money , sir , believe me . I only want to help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease their pain . " Stuart laughed coarsely . " Are n't you the little feller who tried to persuade me recently that money was everything ? " he asked , in a rallyingvoice . Angus turned to him in confusion . " If I can not be a doctor , then 1 shall want a lot of money , " he said , with simplicity . " But if I am a doctor , then I shall not want it . " Stuart laughed loudly . But the priest was gazing at the boy with grave intensity . " I see , " he said softly , " I see . If one can not have his soul , he must have money . " And in the depths of his heart , he murmured a prayer . " What a damned sophistry ! " cried Stuart , gaily . " I confess I do n't follow the brat 's reasoning . " But the priest put his hand firmly on Angus ' shoulder . He turned his grave look upon Stuart . " Much will be forgiven you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him his opportunity to be a physician . " Stuart stared , uncomfortably . " That 's his mama 's business , Grundy . I have an idea that she wo n't allow me to interfere . Besides , why a doctor ? There 's no money in it . And from what he told me , himself , he wants money , the damned greedy little Scot ! " But the priest said : " You will help him , Stuart ? I charge you with it . " Stuart , annoyed , said : " Do n't charge me with anything ! I 've got enough to do with myself , God knows . " He added , more calmly : " I 'll do what I can . But it 's a lot of nonsense . " He pointed a derisive finger at Sam , with whom he was much enraged . " Look at Sam , here . Saves every penny . For what ? " Sam lifted his bowed head , and looked at him , directly .

I haf that dream in my heart , Stuart . I must help make that dream true . " Stuart laughed , much too loudly . " Look at the three of us ! You , Sam , are dedicated to a dream , Grundy to his God , and I to my house ! At the last , it comes to the same thing . " " THE GETTING OF TREASURES " 161p161Sam said softly : " God has blessed this land . It will be great , greater than any land before , if it has its dream .

I have plans for expansion , which will be under way this summer . I shall soon control all the main retail business in Grandeville . There will be a branch of the railroad extended to this city within a few months . I can buy much more quickly , extend the field of my merchandising , when that happens .

Again , what more do you want ? " Joshua sighed , but continued to grin under his vulture 's nose . " Stuart , " he said with fond mildness , " if you were related to the Royal House of England , if you were a millionaire , I should still refuse to allow my daughter to marry a blackguard Irishman . " And you are a blackguard , you know , my dear Stuart . You are faithess , churchless . You are impious , and blasphemous . God is an unknown word to you .

His face was a death's-head . " You come into my house and assault and insult me , because I refuse you my daughter . Go . Go , before I send for the police . " But Stuart was too insanely excited and enraged to hear this . He stood over Joshua with knotted fists , and his eyes leapt in their sockets . " There is no one who knows you that does not curse you ! You are an abomination ! You call me a blasphemer . Every breath that you draw is a blasphemy , you foul bastard ! " Look you , were I less of a man than I am , and more of your kidney , it 's seducing your daughter I 'd be doing , instead of coming to you like a gentleman , and praying for her hand . And , by God ! I may do it yet , as a lesson to ye , ye scum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fury , then continued , shouting wildly : " D'ye think it is a comfort to me to think that my sons might be like ye , with your blood in their veins ? Or my daughter a trollop , with your soul ? " The brogue , so carefully long absent from his speech , came back thickly , and it was a savage Irishman , indeed , who looked down on the bent and emaciated Joshua . Joshua tugged the bell-rope with so much terror that it was torn down in his hand . But the butler , a tall gaunt man with a sly and lip-licking face appeared , smirking . Joshua saw him with mighty relief ; he was trembling visibly . He pointed to Stuart . " Show this fop , this blackguard , this popinjay , to the door ! " he squeaked , struggling for breath . " And never let him enter again . "  |p163Stuart  flung back his head and laughed raucously and furiously . " Enteragain , this den of thieves ? This ante-room to a brothel ? This usurer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now his dark and swollen face gleamed . He bent over Joshua and thrust his fist under the shrinkingold man 's nose . Fascinated with terror , Joshua stared at him . " But you 've not seen the last of me , I swear ! You and I have a reckoning to make . " Fortified by the presence of his butler , and his hatred , Joshua squealed : " I ' 11 have you in Court , I 'll have you in bankruptcy , you puppy ! " Suddenly Stuart relaxed . His rage was gone , leaving only his laughter and contempt . " That is easier said than done , thief though you are . There is still law in America . The tale is n't finished yet . There is anotherchapter . " He looked down at Joshua as though he were an unspeakable obscenity , then swung away , arrogant and confident in his contemptuous strength and wholeness of body and handsomeness . He was exhilarated by his fury , as with whiskey . Never had he felt so buoyant and invulnerable . The butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectral hall , where the most pallid of light drifted . The man gave Stuart his hat and cane and gloves , peeping at him from under granulatedlids , and bowing stiffly . There was something in his manner which made Stuart pause and scrutinize him narrowly . Now he was more sober , though his emotions were still elated . He remembered that " Like master , like man , " and recalledthat thieves are always supremely devoted to their masters , with a devotion far beyond that given by a decent man to an honorable master . This butler , doubtless , continued the old tradition . Nevertheless , Stuart decided that he , himself , had nothing to lose , and decided to chance a broaching of the man 's defenses . Stuart glanced swiftly at the door beyond which Joshua crouched . Then he returned to the butler , who was watching him with his covert grin . Meeting Stuart 's look , the man expressed silent tentativeness and watchful interest . Stuart , loathing him , bent towards him and whispered : " I am at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The man said nothing . He only bowed again , and smirked , and opened the door . Stuart stepped out into the cold brisk May air , and looked back . The door closed promptly behind him . Now his assurance suddenly faded . He walked away , with his usual swagger . But he had sobered . The fumes of rage and triumph be- ; an to leave him . For years , he had ached to strike at Joshua Allstairs ;  | his loathing had been like a festering poison in him . It had been a release . But now that it was over he was enormously depressed and sunken . However , he reflected , had he continued to be all respect and deference to Joshua , it would have brought him nothing but continued oily and benign insults . The old man would not countenance him for his daughter . Stuart 's respectful importunities , his controlled pleadings , would only have increased Joshua 's malevolence , and he would have enjoyed himself . Stuart , then , had lost nothing at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His depression was very dark . But his natural ebullience of spirits would not let him fall too low this time . He proceeded to the shops , and by the time he had arrived there he was smiling again , and greetingthe ladies with the utmost deference and affability . They adored him , condescended to him pleasantly , and the older ladies looked at his broad shoulders and narrow waist with wistful affection . But Sam Berkowitz , subtle and sensitive always , soon discerned that there was something disorderly and pent about Stuart today , despite all his amiable chatter and eagerness with the customers . Stuart had once complained that one could have no secrets from his old friend , that he was a " witch , " and knew all things by " divination . " At any rate , Sam studied Stuart with careful earnestness , and after a little he was less disturbed . It was not money , this time , apparently . Stuart , when pressed for money , or in financial difficulties after some hideous extravagance , wore a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , and confused . He was none of these , today . To be sure , he seemed to be thinking deeply , was restless , and had a way of pursinghis lips . He was scheming , doubtless , meditated Sam , with relief . It was not money , then . What was it ? Sam speculated . It was a woman . Only money and women could so turn Stuart 's attention away from his beloved shops . Then Sam knew . Stuart had apparently spoken for Miss Marvina , and had been refused . Sam 's relief increased tremendously . Some chronic tightness in him relaxed . It was a good thing ! A very good thing , thank God . At five o'clock that evening , Janie appeared , luxuriously arrayed , and in Stuart 's most formal carriage . She minced into the main shop , her downcast lashes brushing her cheeks , and gowned in rich purple velvet and ermine . At the sight of her , Stuart colored , but he came forward gallantly and seated his cousin in an empty chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pathetic little widow , and smiledp165at her amiably . So far , Janie had been a great social success , and she had managed to ingratiate herself even with those with whom Stuart was no social favorite , and who had only grudgingly accepted him . Her meekness , her amiability , her professed gratitude for the kindness of new friends in this " strange land , " her admiration for everything , her fascinating conversation and careful diction , had impressed all very favorably . Moreover , it was evident that she was a lady of fortune , and had the most remarkable jewels , and the most elegant of Continental airs . Sam had retired to the office behind the shop , and had begun to look over the day 's accounts . He was surprised when Stuart suddenly entered , shutting the door abruptly behind him . " Look here , " whispered the young man urgently , " come out into the shop and tell me in front of Janie that I must not forget our dinner together tonight . " " But we haf no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , damn you ! Who said we have ? " Stuart glared at him with ire . " But I 'm not in the mood to dine tete-a-tete with the strumpet tonight . If I do , there 'll be fireworks , I vow . I ca n't afford that , just yet . I 'm in a bad state . Besides , your mama can give me a bite or two , if I appear . If you think not , I 'll go to the tavern . " " I see , " said Sam , thoughtfully . It was very sad , this good Stuart constantlyinvolving himself with women . Sam remembered how one distraughtand hysterical married lady had haunted the shop every day for several months , merely to see Stuart , and how there had been many distressing scenes in this very office , behind closed doors . Stuart left the office , and returned to his dwindling customers , for it was approaching the dinner hour . Janie decorously awaited him , all modesty and tremblings . He ignored her , putting all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled under her long nose , and bit her lips vigorously to increase their color . Sam 's door remained obdurately shut , though Stuart kept glancing at it with fury . The last customer was now preparing to leave . Stuart coughed loudly . The male clerks , folding up the silks and velvets , and murmuring among themselves , were relaxing at the end of a long hard day . Stuart conducted the last lady to her carriage , and lingered on the walk with her . His anger increased . Damn Sam , anyway ! Finally , there was nothing to do but to re-enter the shops , and to say to Janie : " Well , my love , shall we leave now ? " Janie rose , simpering coyly . Just at that exasperating moment , Sam 's door opened , and he entered the shop . Stuart glared at him , with re- lief . Sam was apparently surprised to see Janie there . He bowed to her . " Good efening , Mrs. Cauder , " he murmured . Janie regarded him with haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . She laid her mittened hand on Stuart 's arm . " It is late , my dear . Shall we go now ? " Sam cleared his throat diffidently . He pretended to regard Stuart with confusion . His unhappiness , however , was sincere . He said , in a low and hesitating voice : " But , my Stuart , haf we not a dinner together , tonight , to discuss some financial matters in quietness ? " Stuart , happy , affected to start . He frowned . " Damn it , yes ! But Sam , ca n't it wait until tomorrow night ? Janie 's come for me , and I had something in mind for the evening . " Sam , unused to duplicity , stared unaffectedly at him , wondering . But Stuart winked impatiently . Sam cleared his throat again . He shook his head , sadly . " The banks  --  they haf the auditors tomorrow , and will consider those matters , Stuart . It can not be delayed . " " 0 hell , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , I must . " He turned to his cousin , and took her hand . " My love , you can see how it is . Businessaffairs . Always business affairs . Sam is very obdurate . But he is right , of course . " Janie turned her green eyes upon Sam with hatred . He was more and more confused . He murmured something very feebly , and made an expressive motion with his hands . He was afraid of Janie , as he was afraid of all heartless and crud people . Janie spoke with hoarse loudness : " There is nothing to be done , it seems . But I do deplore that you are at the beck and call of the most unfeeling persons , my darling Stuart . " Stuart flushed . He regarded Sam sheepishly . But Sam betrayed no reaction . " Ma'am , " said Stuart , with formality , " there are matters which are beyond female comprehension . Shall I conduct you to your carriage now ? " He led Janie with ceremony to the street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sunlight . The cold North air rushed through the streets , like a wall of fresh water . Stuart assisted Janie into the carriage . She was enraged and disappointed . But she managed a seductive smile , as she looked down at Stuart . " Early ? " she whispered , languishing at him . He smiled at her gallantly . " If possible , " he whispered in return . He watched the carriage as it rolled down the cobbled street . She wavedp167her kerchief coquettishly to him . He waved back . He felt , sick and hot when he returned to the shops . He was already tired of Janie , and her knowledgeable ways , and some fundamental decency in him was revolted . He slammed the door angrily behind him . The clerks had slipped away . Sam was waiting in the warm dusk , and Stuart could see the clear brown shining of his eyes . They were like a dumb but wise reproach . " I thought I 'd never rid myself of her , " Stuart fumed , setting a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into such abominable scrapes ? What do I do ? Nothing ! Nothing , I swear to you ! But the women hang about like damned fainting sheep , smothering a man until he ca n't breathe for the likes of ' em . " Sam smiled faintly . Stuart did not look at him . Then Sam said , gently : " You are to marry Mrs. Cauder ? " At this revolting suggestion Stuart forgot his embarrassment , and swung on his friend . He burst into violent laughter . " Marry her ? For Christ 's sake , Sam ! Am I an idiot ? Do I impress you as an idiot , an im-becile ? " " Yes , " said Sam , firmly . Stuart stared at him , astounded . Sam continued , with more gentleness : " In your affairs with women , my Stuart , you exhibit no intelligence at all . You do not learn . Every man may haf one bad time , but more than one bad time a wise man does not . This lady , Mrs. Cauder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , in your house ? " Stuart 's face was crimson . He laughed abruptly . He glanced at his watch . " It was n't such a bad time . On the contrary . But enough is enough . That is the hell with women : they never have enough . They gather the rosebuds where they may , but insist on embalming the damned dried leaves forever , and push them into a man 's face on all occasions . I 'm finished with them . " Sam sighed . He said , tentatively : " You haf promised Father Houlihanto look favorably upon his niece , whom he loves so much . Marriage might be excellent for you , my friend . " Stuart still scrutinized his watch . " I think you are right , Sam . " He turned to Sam , and his mercurial face now expressed nothing but blandness and innocence . " Shall we go ? Thanks for extricating me . " " Tonight , there was the extrication . But am I to invite you to supperevery night , without end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who knows ? " he said , affectionately . " Sam , what would I do without you ? " He took his friend 's arm . But Sam resisted . His face was now grave . " You haf not forgotten that Mrs. Cauder is now our partner ? Embarrassmentswill not cease . " " 0 hell , let the future take care of itself . In the meantime , I have things to do . Shall we go ? " He whistled gaily as they left the shops , and locked the doors behind them . All at once Sam was ill with uneasiness . AT HALF past nine that evening Stuart let himself softly and furtively into his house . It was most horrible , he fumed , that he must creep into his own darling house as though he had no right to be there , and all because of a strumpet with lascivious green eyes . He tiptoed up the stairs , and peered down the hallway . Janie 's door was open a mere crack , but a light shone out into the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a servant . " I may have a visitor tonight , " he said curtly . " I wish you to stand by the door , and watch , until half past ten at least . I do not wish a bell to ring . It  --  it is a matter of importance and privacy . " The servant immediately suspected the coming of a woman , which was not unusual . He nodded silently , and withdrew , grinning to himself in the hall . Now Stuart cursed himself for his indiscretion . He ought not to have suggested that Allstairs ' butler come to the house . Janie would eavesdrop , if she heard voices . I never think ! thought Stuart , fuming at himself . He went into the great white hallway , where the servant had taken up his vigil . Stuart glanced up the stairs , then whispered , frowning haughtily : " It is a gentleman I expect . You will conduct him quietly to the sun-room , where I will await him . " He marched away , and then cursed himself again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well . The rumor would get about that Mr. Allstairs ' man had visited Mr. Coleman that evening , on a secret matter . There was nothing to do now but work fast . The sun-room was cold and brilliantly empty . Stuart sat down and glared at his watch . Fifteen minutes to ten . He folded his arms acrossp169his chest , and frowned . All at once he felt certain that Allstairs ' man would not come tonight . Or on any other night . He had been a fool to think so . His gorge rose . He crossed his knees and swung a long leg , Its suave outlines , under the strained fawn broadcloth , pleased him with their symmetry . He cocked his head , the better to observe the silken flow of strong muscles shimmering under the crystal chandelier . Then he was despondent again . There were other ways , of course , through which to approach Marvina . But in a week or less she would he gone from Grandeville . His volatile despair rose to a high pitch . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been balked in his life . I Ie would not be so now . He heard whispering footsteps on the rich rugs outside the room . His heart began to beat . His servant entered with Joshua 's man , lank and gaunt in black broadcloth , his hat clutched in his two hands against his lean breast , his bald head gleaming in the candlelight . He was smirking respectfully . He bowed to Stuart . Stuart , sweating with relief , dismissed his servant . He sat down again , with languid grace , and surveyed the Kotler with a haughty smile . What a vulture it was , fit servant for a fit master ! The cadaverous lace was long and sunken and livid , the nose a curving thin hook , the eyes the eyes of a weasel , without conscience or faith , and lit only with the avid light of greed . " What is your name , my man ? " Stuart asked , condescendingly . He very well knew what it was , but when the man murmured : " Grimshaw , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head regally . " Excellent , excellent , " he said . He hesitated , then with a royal gesture indicated a chair . " You may sit down , Grimshaw . " Grimshaw was only amused by this elegant show of imperialism . He sat down on the edge of a rose-damask little chair , holding his hat on his bony knees . His attitude was all humility . There was a little silence . Stuart began to feel uncomfortable . The man was not looking at him , but Stuart was uneasily aware that all his affectations had not in the least impressed the slinking cur . Stuart stared at the floor . The black-and-white stone was exquisitely polished , so that , i11 objects were reflected in it . The dim rose of the draperies stirred at the windows as the night wind rose strongly . " You are probably conjecturing why I suggested you come to me tonight ? " said Stuart . The man coughed deprecatingly . " I considered perhaps , sir , you wished to make a change ? "  | Stuart scowled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own man , Grimshaw . It was not that . It was something more important . Somethingthat would benefit you in the extreme , beyond mere wages . " " Indeed , sir ? How kind of you , sir . " The man 's face expressed nothing but respectful bewilderment . But he sucked in his lips with an ugly sound , and his tiny brown eyes gleamed . Damn you , thought Stuart , you know very well why you came ! But he smiled condescendingly , and continued : " How would a thousand dollars suit you , Grimshaw ? " The man was shaken . But he recovered himself . " A thousand dollars , sir ? " He shook his head , gently . " That is not enough , sir . " Stuart stared at him , paling furiously . Then he said , in a low voice : " Then you do know why I sent for you ? " The man smirked , and clipped his head . " In a way , sir . But it is worth more than a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have another position in Grandeville , if the matter is ever revealed . A man must guard his livelihood . " Stuart 's heart swelled in his chest with loathing and fury . But he said , with hoarse mildness : " I assure you that I shall protect your interests . Nothing shall be learned from me . No one shall ever know . " The man sighed . " But Mr. Allstairs , sir , is a very astute gentleman . Nothing escapes him . He will put two and two together . He is a dangerousgentleman , begging your pardon , sir . I should leave Grandeville immediately , for fear of his wrath . Therefore , sir , you will understand one thousand dollars is not near enough . I have thought of setting up a small shop , myself , sir , in a distant city . " The man grinned at him slyly . Suddenly Stuart 's rage got almost , but not quite , beyond control . The filthy dog , with his insinuation about a shop ! It was that , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fists clench . But there was too much at stake now for an outbreak , and he swallowed the thick salty bulk which had risen in his throat . He said , and his voice had dwindled , though his eyes were on fire : " I offer you one thousand two hundred dollars . " The man sighed again , sorrowfully , and moved on his chair as if to rise . " What then , damn you ? " cried Stuart , turning scarlet . " Three thousand dollars , sir . " Stuart started to his feet , maddened . " Three thousand dollars ! Why , you unspeakable cur ! You reprobate ! You stinking dog ! " pI71The man rose slowly , in one swift movement , and retreated a step . I Lis face was ghastly with fear . He looked at the infuriated Stuart , and licked his lips . He backed away , still farther . " May I leave , sir ? " he whispered . " Leave ? " shouted Stuart . " Get out of my house before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that fiend ! " He advanced on the man with doubled fists . The man backed away still another step or two . But he was shrewd . I le reached the shelter of the doorway , and paused . " Miss Marvina is well guarded , sir , " he suggested , in a piping tone . " You will never see her again , sir . She will be extraordinarily well guarded , here-after . " Stuart , in the very midst of rushing upon him , halted . Everything was lost now . He began to pant . His rage made everything dim before him . And in that dimness , Grimshaw was a floating black shadow , hovering in the doorway . Stuart groped for a chair . He fell into it . He looked at Grimshaw with malignancy . " Sit down , " he said , stifled . The man , not looking away from him , fumbled for another chair , and again lowered himself on the edge . In the midst of the noise of his pounding pulses , Stuart 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on three thousand dollars now ? He had less than three thousand in his private account . He would have to borrow from Sam , to make the payments on the ten thousand he had borrowed back from the shops . But he thought of this only briefly . With a shaking hand he withdrew a sheaf of banknotes from an inner pocket . His damp fingers trembled as he counted out five hundred dollars . He flung the bills at Grimshaw , who avidly bent and picked them up . The man counted them , making sucking sounds with his lips . Then he folded them and put them inside his coat . " Five hundred dollars , sir , " he murmured , reproachfully . " You will receive one hundred dollars more each time you bring me a note from Miss Marvina , written in her own writing , with which I am well acquainted , " said Stuart . " And on the day that Miss Marvina heaves with me to marry me , you will receive the rest . " The man was silent . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , and an agreement to that effect , sir ? Tomorrow ? " Stuart suddenly felt quite ill . The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " If I may be allowed to say so , sir , the young lady weeps in her room each night . I have it on the authority of her maid , sir . She pines for you , sir . " Stuart did not speak . His face blackened . But he listened . " I would suggest nothing of this , sir , no hope , if I did not know that the young lady would be amenable . She vows , in tears , that she will marry no other but you . She has said this to her respected father , in my own hearing . You can not fail , with my help , sir . " Still Stuart did not speak . The man murmured deprecatingly : " I know of a small minister , sir , in La Grange , who will marry you at the drop of a hat , sir . " Stuart found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will accompanyus as a witness ? " The man appeared simply surprised . " But certainly , sir . I shall leave Mr. Allstairs on that day . " " When you appear with Miss Marvina , I shall give you the rest . An agreement will be delivered to you tomorrow , to that effect . " He could no longer sit in his chair . He looked down at Grimshaw with murderous eyes . " Do not think to diddle me , you dog . If you fail me , or betray me , you shall not escape me . I swear to that . Do you understand ? " Later , he crept up to his room , his boots in his hand . The light still shone from under Janie 's door . He heard the rustling of the pages of a book . When he finally closed his door silently after him , and locked it , he was trembling . THE HARD and nimble air of the Northern early night blew strongly through the streets of Grandeville , gushing in from the Lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Street lamps burned vividly . As there was still a hint of frost in the evenings , though it was May , the stars glittered like white fire , and the slow white crescent of a burning moon rose with majesty . The streets were quiet and full of peace . And now carriage wheels echoed in the evening hush , the horses ' hoofs striking sparks from the cobbles . The carriage made its way down the hard mud slope towards the river , and approached Stuart 's house . It stormed at the front door . Stuart leant out . and extended his h:in**p173to a lady within the carriage . She took his hand and alighted . She was tall and slender , heavily cloaked , and wore a bonnet with a thick veil . St ill holding her hand , Stuart led her to the door , and pulled the bell . The carriage rolled back to the stables . The day had been febrile and exciting . Stuart was exhausted and very nervous . He was not one to brood on the future , however immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had that evil moment now . In a few seconds , he would be inside his house , and confronting Janie with his new wife . The girl beside him was very calm and docile . Since the marriage this afternoon she had said little , only smiling sweetly and placidly , her hand in Stuart 's . He was profoundly grateful for this . In his infatuationhe believed her serenity was strength and wisdom , and he wished to live up to her opinion of him , which was doubtless excellent . He did not as yet know that she never possessed any opinions at all . The thing to do , he meditated , waiting for the door to open , was to consummate the marriage without delay . A daughter who was no longer a maid was not worth rescuing . Only if that daughter could be rescued from her marriage bed with her virginity intact was the expeditionsensible . Stuart resolved to obviate that possibility at the first feasible moment . The thought exhilarated him . He turned to the girl with a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned his look with serene fondness . The door opened , and his man stood there . When he saw the young lady his mouth gaped , for he had often seen Miss Marvina on the streets . The man stepped back and Stuart and Miss Marvina entered , she moving like a dream of beauty , full of floating grace , her tawny eyes shining . She waited like an exquisite statue for the next command of her master , her Pygmalion , her gloved hands clasped before her . Stuart gallantly removed her cloak . She gave him her bonnet . Then he took her hand again and led her into the magnificent drawing-room , and gilled his man , who had been following them , bemused . " Briggs , " said Stuart , in a tone of authority , " this is your new mistress , Mrs. Coleman . " In a louder and more genial voice , he said : " Is Mrs. Cauder at home ? Please convey my regards to her , and ask her if she will grant me a moment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " Before the man could recover , Stuart turned to Marvina . " My love , will you be seated near the fire ? It is chilly tonight . "  | " Yes  --  Stuart , " she murmured , seating herself with a rustle of rich brown silk . Her black hair shone in the firelight . Her ivory face and golden eyes were expressionless . Even when she smiled , the smile was empty . She obeyed . Had he told her to stand up and dance , she would have done it without surprise , and with calm . Her mouth , so like a dark gleaming plum , released its smile automatically . It was lovely to have a quiet wife , reflected Stuart , abstractedly . Not one of these horrible chatterers . But he was not really thinking of this actively . He was listening for Janie 's step on the stairs . And now his heart began to beat most unpleasantly . What would Janie say ? He had some slight idea , and this was the cause of the disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden dampness along his spine . He prayed to his profane gods that she would at least retain some rags of civilized behavior . He did not want this innocent child to be terrified , this girl of eighteen who , though of a mature woman 's age , had been so immured . He did not want her maiden ears to be assaulted by blasphemies shrieked by the rowdy and vulgar Janie , who was the foulest thing when aroused . He heard the opening of Janie 's door , and her light swift tread upstairs . He rose and stood beside his wife , his hand on her shoulder . " My love , " he said hurriedly , meeting the golden beam of her obedient eyes , " my cousin , as I have told you , is a little strange sometimes , and not quite herself . You will not be alarmed , ma'am ? " " Oh , no , " she said softly . And now , odd to say , her eyes were filled with a brilliance which he had never seen before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart , and I thought her very civil . " Most damnable phrase ! thought Stuart . " Very civil , " the chit had said . So she disposed of hurricanes and tempests and ravening beasts . All at once he wanted to laugh , quite insanely . But Janie was entering , in white foulard scattered with vivid pansies , her shoulders bare , her red curls painfully and carefully disposed on her little bony shoulders over which she had thrown a white lace shawl . She bounced into the room , all vitality and gaiety , shrieking : " Stuart , you dog ! Where have you been ! And dinner cooling the while ! " And then she stopped short , frozen , and stared at Marvina : Her small and narrow face turned quite pale , and the freckles on her big bony nose sprang out . Marvina , all brown silk and demure white lace collar and smooth black chignon , rose with a stately movement , smiled , and waited . Nothingcould have been more composed . The bad moment had arrived . Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step or two , involuntarily putting himself between his wife and his cousin . He tried to speak , but his thickened throat would not permit a sound . As for Janie , she stood there , petrified , and now her face had become as ugly as sin , and as vicious , and as malevolent . She must have had some prescience . Her shoulders bent a little , her back curved , as if she were about to spring . When Stuart , in anguish , cleared his throat , she turned upon him swiftly , arching more than ever , and her eyes were savage . " Well ? " she said , her voice cracking , " well ? What is she doing here ? " With a tremendous struggle , Stuart found his speech , and tried to bluster : " How dare you speak to me in such a peremptory tone , ma'am , as if this were not my house ? " " Curse you , Stuart ! " she cried , with furious scorn , " stop this nonsense , and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house which you have as much as promised me will always be my own ? " She stamped her foot . Her cry had risen to a shriek . She knew , now . A girl like Miss Marvina would never have come to this house , unchaperoned , unless the incredible , the impossible , the frightful , had happened . She screamed : " Why do , you bring your women to this house , Stuart Coleman , this house which I have presumed to be respectable and sacred , the roof under which my helpless children live ? " One part of Stuart 's mind was thankful for this appalling outbreak . It gave him an opportunity to return in kind , and with similar ferocity . Ile had , that afternoon , had a disagreeable vision of Janie swooning , of Janie in agony , of Janie in tears , weeping out her reproaches , of Janie broken . He could not have coped successfully with such a Janie . The whole thing would have degenerated into a wallowing mess . But a Janie enraged and shrieking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spared no pity , no embarrassment , and no remorse . So now he shouted , lifting his fists : " Mind your tongue , ma'am , or I shall mind it for you ! This is my wife , ma'am , the mistress of my house , and I demand that you treat her with the respect and civility and courtesy due her ! " Janie 's pale face immediately became livid . She looked at Stuart , and despite his fury , despite his shame , he quailed before that look , so insanewas it , so malignant. t " Your wife ? " she repeated , and now her voice had fallen , but was all the more terrible for its quieter tone . " This  --  this creature is your wife ? " " Yes , ma'am , my wife . We were married this afternoon , in La Grange ,  | a small village some ten miles from here . It may be a surprise to you , but we had planned it for some time . " Afraid to look at his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not in the least disturbed . Her fixed smile had not passed . She might have been alone , so aloof , so detached , was she . She regarded Janie with the wide and empty gaze of a smug child , who has not yet learned to feel much emotion . It was apparent that she was not horrified or frightened . In the sudden hiatus which followed Stuart 's words , Marvina 's honeyrichvoice entered with tranquillity : " Good evening , ma'am . " And she curtseyed gracefully . Stuart and Janie stared at her , their faces becoming idiotically blank , incredulously robbed of all expression . " Good evening , ma'am , " in the face of chaos and excitement and shrieks and threats ! All at once Stuart began to laugh . He could not control himself . He bent double , almost collapsing in his mirth . He laughed until he wept , until tears rolled down his cheeks . He slapped his knees ; he choked ; he whimpered ; he struggled for breath . And each time that he glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , and at Janie 's blank staring face , he went off into fresh paroxysrns . Finally he staggered weakly backwards near the wall , and fell against it , speechless with agonies of laughter . He could not endure to look at the women ; he swung himself face to the wall , and gave himself up to convulsions . " My God ! " he groaned between times , when he could catch his breath . " My dear , dear God ! " Janie recovered herself . But she was silent . She was clever enough to know that any word she could say just now would only throw Stuart into new hysterics of hilarity , which would render her more and more ridiculous . She turned , instead , to Marvina , who looked at her with courteous and faintly smiling attention , as if all this were nothing at all , but happened in the normal course of events . " So , " she said , in a vitriolic voice , " you 've married my cousin , eh ? You strumpet ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and impassive calm , she was mistaken . Marvina smiled at her radiantly , though again that odd brilliance shone in her eyes . " Indeed , yes , " she said , mildly . " This afternoon . So precipitous of dear Stuart , was it not ? We ought to have invited you , and so I mentioned to Stuart , but he declined , as you had been indisposed . " She smiled even wider . " The minister was " THE GETTING OF TREASURES 177p177kind , though I should have preferred Mr. Hawkins , of our own dear little church . " Janie stared at her , her face becoming rigid and completely evil with hatred and malignancy . " Were you aware , ma'am , " asked Janie , " that my cousin promised me marriage , after taking advantage of my helpless state and giving me VOWS of his intention ? " For the first time , a puzzled gleam touched Marvina 's eyes . She , , lanced at Stuart , then returned with equanimity to Janie . " I do not 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress . " I only know that Stuart spoke of you most kindly . Are you certain you were not mistaken , ma'am ? " " Mistaken ? " screamed Janie , beside herself again . " You fool , do you lot know what I mean when I say that he took advantage of my helplessstate ? Do you understand , you zany , that he slept with me , after his promises ? " She caught her breath on a deep gasp of rage , then waited for the girl to cry out in horror , to hide her face with her hands , to retreat . tit Marvina merely gazed at her tranquilly , and said : " How very reprehensible . " There was not even revulsion of the slightest kind in her voice , or disbelief . Having said her say , she waited most politely for Janie to speak again . But Janie , confounded , was beyond speech . She looked at Marvina with distended eyes , disbelieving what she saw , as if she faced a nightmare . She looked at that beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which surveyed her with the utmost detached friendliness . She could not believe it ! And then all her frustrated hatred , her wrath , her disappointment , I i r lust , her wild and real anguish , were too much to be borne . Sherang upon Marvina , her fingers dangerously flexed , like talons , herth bare and glistening , her eyes mad . She uttered horrible sounds. h r movements were swift , but Marvina instinctively recoiled beforeis fury , and flung up her arm to protect her face at which Janie'socious attack was directed . The claws fell impotently on the thick 1,1 own silk of the rounded arm , and though the fabric was torn , the . I. in was not even scratched . Nevertheless , the girl staggered backwards under the assault , and cried out , feebly , like a kitten . Stuart , drawing deep gulping breaths , heard that cry , and turned . shout . He saw Janie preparing to attack again . He saw Marvina 's torn sleeve , and her bewilderment . In an instant he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . He lifted his hand and struck her savagely on the cheek , first one side and then the other , with the back of his hand . And she turned upon him , fiercely , like an untamable cat from the jungles , trying to tear at his eyes , his cheeks . Once her nails actually reached his cheek , and a long bleeding gash appeared . She was tiny and he was big , but she had the strength of a dozen devils . She slipped out of his grasp again and again , twisting sinuously , trying to dodge about him to get at Marvina , who was now really pale and frightened , and who was actually whimpering . The girl 's chignon had become loosened ; her long black hair began to uncoil on her shoulders . " Stuart ! Stuart ! " she cried faintly . But Stuart , cursing between his teeth , was too busy to heed her just yet . He tried to grasp Janie 's arms , to pin them to her sides . He shook her violently when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost too much for him . A kind of horror overwhelmed him ; her face floated beneath his own , the face of a demon , flashing white and wild , and full of insensate madness . Never had he seen or confronted a thing like this in all his life . It was as if he had become entangled with an obsceneloathesomeness , which threw his senses into appalled abhorrence . He could not endure it that she touched him . His cheek smarted as though venom had been poured into it . His very soul sickened , and became frenzied . He retched , through his curses , through his panting cries : " Now then , you she-devil , now then ! " He hated her , abominated her . Finally he was able to catch both of her flaying arms and pin them together before him . Even then she wrenched and tore , turned one hand inwards and raked his wrist . He could not bear to look at her face , so distorted was it . " Oh , you bitch ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to insanity by his horror of her . He wanted to kill her . He twisted her arms until she screeched , and the servants crowded at the doorway , trembling . She flung back her head and screamed like a demon out of hell . Her children , who ate their dinners in the servants ' dining-room , heard , and huddled together on the stairs . Even the composed Robbie was weeping . Angus held his little sister in his arms , and tried to cover her ears with his hands . Then Stuart , his horror mounting , his eyes dazed with faintness , clapped his hand on Janie 's mouth . She gurgled and choked under it ; she tried to bite it . But he was inexorable . He wanted only to still that ghastly noise of hers . It made him frantic . Shuddering though he was ,  |p179he  dragged her tightly against him , and increased the pressure on her mouth with his other hand . Only her legs were free now ; with one sharp toe she kicked his shins over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes ; only the blubbering sound she made against his smothering hand filled the room . It was on this pleasant scene that Joshua entered , accompanied by the Sheriff . He saw the servants , who had not heard his furious ringing , who had not opened the door . He saw the huddled children on the stairs . i le saw Stuart struggling with the maddened woman ; he saw his ( laughter standing at a distance from them , her eyes wide in her white confused face , her hair on her shoulders , her gown torn . He looked at them all , incredulously . He stood there , leaning on his cane . Only the Sheriff moved . Stuart was an old friend of his , and the tall stout man was greatly embarrassed . But he knew what to do in the face of violence . He put his hand strongly on Stuart 's arm , and caught at Janie with the other . He wrenched them apart . Janie , free , gulping , saw only another antagonist , and turned upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dexterously sent her whirling in a billowing of petticoats , She fell into a chair . " Now then , what 's all this , eh ? " he growled . " What is the meaning of it ? Come now , man , speak up . " But Stuart could not speak . He pulled his kerchief from his pocket . I le dabbed at his bleeding cheek . Janie , in her chair , sensing what had happened now , was weeping noisily . She pointed a shaking finger at her cousin . " He tried to kill me ! He tried to strangle me to death ! " White and mute as a ghost , Stuart continued to wipe his cheek . The Sheriff , understanding not a little , looked at him compassionately . Then lie turned to the servants . " Bring some whiskey , you fools , " he ordered , in a tone of authority . He turned back to Stuart . " Come , man , sit clown . Take hold of yourself . That 's right . Here 's a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bent his head on his hand , his arm supported by his knee . The Sheriff sighed . " I 've got a warrant for you , Stuart , for kidnapping . Have you anything to say ? " Stuart found his voice . " Tell that woman to cease her screeching , " he implored , dully . Janie 's wails were increasing in strength . The Sheriff turned on her abruptly . " Stop that ! " he bellowed . " What 's going on here , anyway ? "  | The servant returned with a glass of whiskey . The Sheriff pressed it upon Stuart . " Drink this , " he ordered . " You need it . " In the meantime Joshua had edged and crept towards his daughter . He looked at her expressionlessly . " Come home at once , my dear , " he said . " This is no place for you . Where is your cloak and bonnet ? Come , my dear , Papa will take you home . " But Marvina did not appear even to be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking the whiskey . Mechanically , she put up her hands and rewound her hair neatly . " You do n't want him arrested , do you , my love ? " Joshua said softly . " He will spend the night in jail if you do n't come home at once . " He chortled evilly . He pointed to Stuart , and the sobbing dishevelled Janie . " Do you want to live here , with them , with these dreadful creatures ? Come at once , lovey , and Papa shall not mention this again . Papa and his little girl shall go away , far away , and forget all this . " He , too , understood what had happened . He squinted at Janie , and chortled again . Lady Vere de Vere and Sir Angus Fraser , indeed ! He was voluptuously delighted . Nothing could have gone better for him . " That is his fancy woman there , my little love . That is what innocencehas led my darling child into , this abominable house . This is the scoundrel who persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iniquity . But Papa has rescued you . We shall forget all this . It never happened . In the meantime , he will get his deserts . " Stuart handed the glass back to the Sheriff , who still regarded him with compassionate regret . " Thanks , Bob . " He breathed deeply , over and over . " I was n't about to kill her , Bob , though I wanted to . She attackedmy wife . " The Sheriff moved a little . " You married Miss Marvina , Stuart ? " " Yes , this afternoon . " Stuart became aware of his wife now . He stood up , weakly . He turned to the girl and held out his hand . His stiff face broke into a feeble smile . She left her father immediately , and came to him without hesitation . Her serenity had returned . She put her hand in his , trustfully , and smiled up at him . The Sheriff stared at them both . Then he scowled . He looked at Joshua . " You said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , Mr. Allstairs . " Joshua grimaced at him , malevolently . " The girl is under age ! " he exclaimed . " I do n't believe he married her ! He only wanted to bring her to this house ! " " You can prove this , Stuart ? " asked the Sheriff , sternly . " THE GETTING OF TREASURES " 18i " Certainly . I have my marriage lines here . " Stuart fumbled at his pocket . " We were married today by a Methodist minister in La Grange . Here are the names of the witnesses . The girl is not under age . She is nearly nineteen . She is a woman , not a child . " The Sheriff examined the paper closely . His embarrassment grew . He looked at Stuart , standing there with his young wife . There was a quiet dignity about him , despite his disordered array and bleeding cheek , a kind of splendor which was one of his strongest physical characteristics , and very magnetic . There was a sudden silence in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to the Almighty for justice . " This seems correct , Mr. Allstairs , " said the Sheriff . He was an honest man , and he hated Joshua . His voice took on roughness . " Your daughter is past eighteen . She is of age ; the law permits her to marry . She was not kidnapped , but came with Stuart of her own free will . You could not have restrained her . She has married Stuart , and I am afraid there is nothing we can do . " Joshua hobbled up to the Sheriff and Stuart , shaking as if with a palsy . He looked slowly from his daughter to Stuart , and then at the Sheriff . Then he cried : " Is there no justice for this seduction of my daughter , *ho has been guarded in her innocence and protected from such scoundrels ? Is there no redress for a man entering another 's house and stealing his treasure ? Had the girl not been so guarded , so innocent , this would never have happened . She may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mind is still the mind of a child ! I demand justice ! " The Sheriff made a wry face . " Mr. Allstairs , the law does not consider it kidnapping when a young female is of age , physically , and consents to marry her suitor , and is not concerned with what her male parent considers her correct mental age . You are not inferring that your daughteris an imbecile , and incompetent under the law ? " Joshua ground his teeth . His daughter gazed at him with that pleasantlysmiling emptiness with which she surveyed all things . " Dear Papa , " she murmured fondly , as though everything were natural , and her father had just delivered himself of commonplace remarks . Joshua lifted his cane , swayed , shook his cane in the air , and cried out furiously : " I demand justice ! There is a moral law as well as that written on the books ! This man is a thief and a scoundrel , a lecherous roue whose name is a byword in detestable places , a mendacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune . He is in dire financial straits , and has used this innocent child to obtain money from me ! That was his sole purpose in seducing and carrying her away ! " " Careful , careful , " said the Sheriff sternly . " It will be Stuart who may have redress under the law for these remarks , and I give him this information freely . " But Joshua was beside himself with frustration and hatred and grief . " He suborned my employee ! He induced , with his wiles , this man to deliver my daughter into his hands , my daughter who knows nothing of men ! He bribed this man ! This I learned only two hours ago , from a maid in the confidence of the wretch . Is there no justice for a robbed father , for a violated house , for a ruined child ? " He thumped his cane on the floor with uncontrollable rage . Tears ran over his withered cheeks . He lifted his cane and pointed to the sobbing Janie . " Look at that woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attackedher feloniously , with homicidal intent ! This took place when he brought my daughter to this iniquitous house . Ask her why this attack upon her person , a defenseless female , a widow with helpless children ! " The Sheriff automatically turned to Janie at Joshua 's command . He muttered : " This does not change the matter . " In a louder tone , he said : " Mrs. Cauder ! A charge has been made . Will you kindly cease your weeping for a moment , and reply to a question or two ? " Janie had been well aware of what had been taking place , though she had continued to wail and beseech Heaven . Now she went off into fresh paroxysms of anguish , flinging herself back into her chair , covering her face with her hands , and praying in long thin screams . The Sheriff , very harassed , scowled at a staring maid and demanded that she bring smelling salts , and while efforts were made to calm Janie , the poor man turned to Stuart and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapes , Stuart , " he said in a low , regretful voice . Stuart grinned . But he was uneasy , and extremely embarrassed . He put his arm about his wife . He said : " Though it may appear ungallant , truth compels me to say that my cousin , Mrs. Cauder , is not always truthful in her allegations . I ask you , Bob , to bear this in mind when she recovers her delicate breath and can curse and lie with her usual dexterity . " Janie , having decided that she had displayed enough agony , flung back her tangled curls , wiped her cheeks , bowed her head , and was suddenly the silent picture of shame and distraught sorrow , all bereft and defenseless . The Sheriff took a step or two towards her.  | " Mrs. Cauder , I beg of you to maintain your composure and answer a question or two . You have declared that Mr. Coleman made an attemptupon your life . Why was this ? " Janie 's head bowed lower . Her breast heaved. " 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to come to a strange land , without a natural protector , for this ! I am only a poor widow with four helpless children , and I listened , with all faith , to my cousin 's importunities that I join him in America . " The Sheriff interrupted . " He promised you marriage , Mrs. Cauder ? " Ile asked , incredulously . Janie lifted her head . She was an excellent actress . She revealed a brave white face , quivering , pure , wet with tears . She looked at the Sheriff , humbly . She made her eyelids tremble , her lips shake . Very quietly she said : " Yes , he did that . He has promised me marriage several times , and as I am alone and defenseless and unaccustomed to the ways of the world , having always been protected by my dear papa and mama , I believed him . " She allowed fresh tears to run down her cheeks . " I believed him , sir ! I believed him to such an extent that I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear mama gave me when I left England ! " " Oh , the rascal , the unprincipled creature , the monster ! " groaned Joshua . " The thief and murderer ! This robber of helpless widows and children , this seducer of pure young females ! " " Twenty thousand dollars ! " exclaimed the Sheriff , in distress . He looked at Stuart , who had flushed heavily . " Let me explain , Bob . She did not give ' me the money . She knew that her fortune of approximately seventy-five thousand dollars would not last long in America , with four children to sustain . I offered her a share in my shops , though my partner was very reluctant . I was moved by only the highest motives , as she is my cousin , and I am her only male relative in America . An agreement was drawn up in proper terms , of which she is possessed . A copy is in our bank , where it may Ise examined at any time . " He continued , with rising anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , that is a lie , and she knows it is ! I made no promises to her ! " He paused . A cunning look narrowed his eyes . " Ask her under what stress she claims I gave her these promises ! Was it under seduction ? Is she ready to confess that she cohabited with me in this house ? Is she so ready to foreswear her good name  --  for a lie ? For an advan/tage , is she prepared to make her name a byword in this city , her positionuntenable ? " Janie opened her mouth to scream , and then suddenly met Stuart 's narrowed and gleaming eye , his nasty smile . His words rang in her ears . The unpleasant expression increased on Stuart 's face . He chuckled . " You can see , Bob , that my cousin is a virtuous woman , and though somewhat disturbed that her secret plans have gone awry , she can not , for her own sake , falsely declare that she has been seduced by me in my own house , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free will and desire . However excited she may be at this time , and disap pointed , you will readily discern that she is all virtue and modesty , and that she spoke only under the stress of a vehement and hysterical emotion . " The Sheriff regarded Stuart suspiciously . He understood . He frowned . He shook his head , saying under his breath : " You should he more careful ! Someday there will be a reckoning . " Triumphant now , filled with the toxins of excitement , Stuart turned to Joshua , who stood , blinking his eyes , confounded : " As for you , you old dog , only the fact that you are now my fatherin-lawrestrains me from decisive action against you . Thank your God for that . You have called me a thief . I can bring you to account for that , and sue you for a pretty sum . You have made false accusations against me , for which I could shoot you with impunity . " He made a grandiose gesture , and smiled disagreeably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindness of my nature , I shall refrain from prosecuting you , and giving you your deserts . " Janie was so filled with hatred , with insensate madness and frustration , that she could only cower in her chair and look at Stuart with an expression that resembled lightning in its menace and balefulness . It was a look that might have killed . Stuart was rising very rapidly to the occasion . He continued , to Joshua : " I owe you very little , now . Within four weeks I shall receive a large sum resulting from a certain business transaction . I shall repay you all my just debts . You declared that I married your daughter for her fortune . Why , you gray old dog , I shall soon be able to buy and sell you half a dozen times over ! " " Oh , the odious wretch ! Oh , the liar and the rascal ! " moaned Janie , wringing her hands . But Joshua looked in silence at Stuart . He began to speak , almostp185whisperingly : " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There will come a day when there shall be a reckoning , and with God 's help , I shall speed that day . " He turned to his daughter , and his voice was sincerely broken . " My love , you have seen what has taken place in this house . I am an old man , and you are my treasure , that I have loved and guarded . You have deserted me , not of your own will , but because of your innocence . I ask you , for the last time , to leave this villain , who will destroy and ruin you , and return with me to your own dear home , where you will be protected against him . " In strangled tones , he continued : " Come home with your papa , my darling ! " Stuart tightened his arm about Marvina . She leaned against him . She smiled fondly at her father . " Dear Papa , " she said , in her honeyed voice . " Good night , dear Papa . " Joshua gazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart in his wicked eyes . Then he bowed his head and turned away . Stuart , glowing like the sun at midday , saluted the Sheriff . " Now , Bob , will you be kind enough to clear this house for me ? I am weary , and I must put some medicine upon this hell-cat 's scratches , or I shall surely die of the hydrophobia . " He paused . " As for this woman , my cousin , and her children , they may stay in this house for twenty-four hours longer . Then they must leave . That is my order , which I can enforce . " He took Marvina 's hand and led her from the room , past the servants and the Sheriff , and Joshua and Janie . They watched him lead her , watched the silken grace of her flowing garments , her dazzling smile , her look of adoration for her husband . She did not glance backwards , not even at her father , who groaned as if death had suddenly seized him . The children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb and stricken silence , as Stuart and Marvina ascended slowly . They looked at Stuart with pale young faces and wide eyes . He smiled at them benignly , and with indifference . He reached the stair where Angus and Laurie were standing , their arms about each other . The little girl 's face was streaming with tears . But her blue eyes regarded Stuart steadfastly , shining in the warm dusk . He never knew what made him pause there , beside the child . He only knew that something held him , made him stand there looking down at her , with the most curious plunging of his careless heart . And then he bent gently , and kissed her white cheek . " Good night , my love , " he said , softly , touching her golden hair.  | As for Marvina , she stood looking at the children with her amiable and meaningless smile , nodded to them agreeably , and went on , Stuart following her . They reached the door of Stuart 's apartment . Stuart , his pulses throbbing , stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . He looked at her with intense significance and passion . She smiled at him , placidly . " What nice little children , Stuart . I am sure I shall love them , " she said . Stuart could not speak . For the first time it dawned on him , faintly and disagreeably , that his wife was stupid . Abysmally stupid . Book Two " His children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them . "  --  Job 5 , Verse 4.  |p189ANGUS  CAUDER picked up his medical books from under the counter and laid them on top of it . He passed his thin hands over his face , and sighed . All the juice and life were squeezed out of him , so that he felt dry and brittle and flaxlike . Even his mind was dry and dusty , laid over with the grime of old despair and hopelessness and acquiescence . He moved his tongue in his mouth , to alleviate the parched sensation which came from his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long ago closed the door behind them . Angus ran his finger over the top of his books , and sighed again . Then , with a tragic gesture , he pushed the books aside , and went into the back room which served as the offices of the shops . He walked with a slight stoop , for he was not strong , and he was too tall and thin . Nor were his movements full of the vitality and sprightlinessof youth . He walked like an old man , heavy with years and stiff with ancient dejection . Stuart , frowning over the ledgers , looked up and saw the youth . He smiled slightly , leaning back in his chair . He , too , was very tired . He smoothed his hair with both hands ; there were a few wiry streaks of gray in its heavy long blackness with the curling ends . " Finished , Angus ? But , of course , it 's nearly seven . What are you doing here so late ? " " There were some bolts to rewind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desk threw its pallid light over the ledgers , and over the new panelled walls , for even here Stuart must have his elegance , his reassurance of luxury . In that wan circle of illumination Angus stood in silence , his gray eyes hidden , his pale and suffering face , lined even now though he was still so young , full of chronic reticence and pride . I its mouth , always reserved and thin , was now a wide tight line with rigid corners , as if it was an iron gate forever barred against the spirit within and the joy without . His fine brown hair , sleek and longish , lay flaccidly on his narrow skull , and two or three strands streaked across his forehead with its noble contours and strong protuberances . Stuart peered at him with furtive uneasiness . He lit a cheroot , and frowned at the panelled ceiling.  | " You 've been here six months now , Angus . How d' you like it , eh ? The shops and all ? " " Very well , Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Is it ? You find it interesting , Angus ? " Angus hesitated . He moved on his long thin feet . He wore the black broadcloth and white linen of the other clerks , and they gave his emaciated body a funereal look . Against that blackness his hands , so slender and tapered , appeared waxen and lifeless . He spoke formally : " People are always interesting , Stuart . " " Are they ? " replied Stuart , wryly . He examined the end of his cheroot . " I think they 're a damned nuisance , most of them . However , I 'm glad you are n't dissatisfied . " He knew that the young man had come to him for a specific purpose , and he wondered what it was . Angus never volunteered any communicationbetween them ; his attitude was entirely withdrawn and negative , as a rule , in his dealings with Stuart . When Angus remained silent , Stuart looked at him directly . " You are satisfied , are n't you , Angus ? " Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm not . You see , Mama thinks I should have a little increase . " " Ah . She does , eh ? And what does Mama suggest ? " At the note of irony in Stuart 's voice , Angus flushed . He lifted his head and looked at Stuart arrogantly , though there was a faint quiveringover his thin features . He said , and his voice trembled defensively , and with a pale affrighted anger : " Mama says that as she is a partner in the shops , and that as I work here , I ought to receive more than the other clerks . " He hesitated . " She thinks I should receive at least three dollars more a week . " Stuart studied him curiously . " And what do you think , Angus ? " The youth was resolute , however . His gray eyes suddenly gleamed in the lamplight . " I think it should be five more , Stuart . " Stuart suddenly turned his attention again to his cheroot . He scowled , and cursed inaudibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the damn thing ! " He removed the chimney of the lamp and applied the tip of the cheroot to the flame , which wavered and darkened . " You have to have a conflagration to light cheroots now . " He replaced the chimney , and puffed vigorously for a few moments . Angus watched him . A slight grim smile deepened , rather than alleviated , the hard straight corners of his young mouth . All at once he was complete steely hardness , and it was Stuart now who was on the defensive.  |p191Stuart  smiled on his young relative brilliantly . " Very well , then , I think I prefer your opinion  --  to your mama 's . We shall make it five , beginningSaturday . How is that ? " " Thank you , Stuart , " said Angus , coldly . He moved , preparing to leave . But Stuart turned to him fully , in his chair . As always , his movements were impetuous . Yet as he met Angus ' hard gray eyes he was suddenly silent . He frowned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment . " Angus , will you sit down a moment ? I want to talk to you . " But Angus stiffened . " I am late now , Stuart . We dine at half past seven , you know . Mama will be annoyed if I delay her . " " Oh , we must n't annoy Mama , of course ! But I am expecting my carriage , and I 'll drive you home . In about five minutes . You could n't walk it so fast . I wo n't keep you long . " Angus did not speak for a moment , and then into his voice , neutral and indifferent , there crept a proud note . " Very well . " He sat down stiffly on the edge of a chair near by , and waited , looking at Stuart with a dimly inimical expression . Stuart saw it . His embarrassment increased . But also his pity . " You 'll think it none of my business , certainly , Angus . But you and I were friends , once , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that , do n't you ? " Angus was silent . But the harsh corners of his mouth moved in a repudiating smile , cynical and cold . Stuart colored . He struck his palm on the desk . " You 've listened to false tales , Angus ! That is evident . You must believe me that I 've always been fond of you . " The lad moved , as if affronted , and appeared to be about to rise . But he said nothing . His eyes were like pale and polished stone as he regarded Stuart , and waited . Stuart was becoming excited . That was bad for his liver , he recalled angrily . Well , to hell with his liver just now ! He would make one try only , to rescue this young fool , to break down his ridiculous defenses . " When you were fourteen , Angus , you confided in me that you wished to be a physician . A  --  friend , urged me to look after you ; he charged me with encouraging and helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sake I remembered it  --  and for yours . Last June you were graduated from your school . I was surprised when your mama requested that you be admitted to the shops . " He paused . His low forehead wrinkled uneasily . Angus had listened ,  | in wary silence , and while Stuart had been speaking , his young face had hardened , become like shining steel . He still waited , his eyes fixed on Stuart . " You 've done good work in the shops , Angus . You have a keen mind , and an understanding one . You 've helped me with the books , and I look forward to turning more and more of them over to you . I find them onerous . Sam usually attends to them , but as you know , he has n't been well since his lung fever last March . It will be some time before he can do a full day 's work on the ledgers . " Yes , you are doing well . You will eventually do excellently . But that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've left school now , and I fully expected that you would go to study with some good doctor . Like Dr. Dexter . I spoke to him last Spring , and he agreed to take you . You know that . What changed your mind ? Are n't you interested in medicine any longer ? " Angus was still . But Stuart saw with what a convulsion his hands suddenly clasped themselves together in a movement as if he were wringing them . And then his hands were still , also , though still rigidly clasped together . He said , in a voice without intonation : " It does n't matter whether I am interested or not , or what I had wanted , or planned , Stuart . Mama ca n't afford to keep me in idleness any longer , and it is my duty to assist her . " " Damned nonsense ! " cried Stuart , with his quick rage . " Your mama is receiving nearly six thousand dollars a year from her investment ! Why , last year , if I remember correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal at all . Then , two years ago , when her father died , she received ten thousand dollars as her legacy . She has tucked that away , too , in her damned strong boxes . She can very well afford to let you do what you had always dreamt of doing . " Angus had straightened in his chair . His eyes sparkled with bitter affront . " Stuart , you do n't know all my mother 's affairs , and I  --  I considerit presumptuous of you to criticize her . You have forgotten there are three other children . She ca n't afford to pamper me . Bertie is only seventeen , Robbie is not yet sixteen , and there is Laurie , who is only eleven . The boys are n't finished with their school . Mama is sometimes very pressed . I must help her . It is my duty . To complain would be immoral . We must each put aside our hopes when they conflict with duty . We can not ask others to suffer for us , and to deny themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full face was dark with congested blood . " You mean you consider it sinful and cruel to oppose the unfeeling and insensible demandsof a rapacious woman ? Just because she is your mother ? " Angus rose . He had begun to breathe in short breaths . " Good night , Cousin Stuart . " But Stuart rose also , and stood before the door . " Angus , by God ! This is the last time I shall appeal to you , and try to make you see what your mother is doing to you . I will have my say , and then you can go , and be damned to you ! " Your mother has always disliked you . You 've never admitted it , in your fatuous devotion to her . She intends to ruin your life . She has already made you a dirty little money-grubber . Look at you ! You 're sick to death , to the very depths of you , you puppy ! I 've watched you in the shops , from this door . I 've probed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are dying on your feet . It would n't matter so much if it were only your damned miserable flesh . But you 're dying inside , Angus . And you 're letting a woman who hates you , who enjoys thwartingand murdering you , do this thing to you . To the idiot thing you call your soul . She is using your best instincts , your devotion and honesty and sense of duty , to destroy you . " He stopped , running out of breath . His treacherous heart was poundingin his chest , with great pain . Now , curse it , he would have to forego his whiskey tonight . He put his hand to his chest , and pushed it there , with instinctive pressure . Angus had retreated from him , to the other side of the desk , and now only the lower part of his body was in the light . His face was in shadow . But out of that shadow the gray steel of his eyes flashed with scorn and cold outrage . Stuart was trembling with violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake to control the vehemence of his voice , and said : " You speak of duty . Damn it , you would agree with me that a man has only one soul . He must guard and protect it , lest he die . You will agree with me , there ? And to guard and protect it , he must yield to its instincts . He must never step aside . You have always wanted to be a physician . You have the emotions of a devoted man , self-sacrificing and dedicated . That is the temper of your soul . " Yet you are allowing this woman to destroy your soul , to , make a grasping and greedy animal of you , an avaricious miser . I 've seen you fondle the gold pieces that passed over the counter to you ! I 've seen you jingle them in your hands , and smile . You 've put them away , lovingly.  | I 've watched you . But they did n't put any light in your miserable face . They put ugliness there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop . His breath failed him again . But his black and restlesseyes , usually so careless and selfish , were bright with earnestness now , and impatient anger , and pleading . Angus looked at him in silence . Stuart could hardly see his face . But he felt the boy 's implacability and contempt . Then he heard Angus ' voice , thin but firm , and harsh . " Cousin Stuart , you speak to me of souls . ' But you do n't believe in souls , or in God . You are a bad man , and you know that in your heart , Cousin Stuart . I ca n't listen to you . Your words mean nothing to me . " He paused , while Stuart stared at him with incredulous hopelessness and fury . " I 've done my duty here , Cousin Stuart . I 'll continue to do it , if you allow me to stay after this . You can always trust me . I want to learn the business , as my mother is one of your partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it that way . That is all I want . And I ca n't listen to anyone , least of all you , who would lead me astray , away from God and what I know is my duty . Holy exhortations never came from a faithless instrument . I ca n't believe that from you would ever come any sound advice or righteous guidance . What your motive is I do not rightly know , but I do sense that you are advising me to repudiateand defy my poor mother , who has devoted her life to her orphaned children . You are advising me to turn aside from my duty , and selfishly to pursue my own frivolous and unsanctified desires . " At this imbecility , Stuart was not freshly angered , but only sick with despair . He lifted his hand , as if to brush aside a swarm of gnats that meaninglessly buzzed and stung . He said , with passionate quietness : " Angus , if your mother should refuse to allow you to study medicine , and you are afraid you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can come to me , with pleasure . I will help you . You can live in my house , and study with Dr. Dexter . " I am your friend . I have never urged good deeds on anyone else but you . It is distasteful to me . A man should choose his own life . But you are so badgered , so confused , so fatuous , that you need help . I am offering you this help , from my heart . " But Angus cried , in a thin and shaking voice : " You have no heart , Stuart ! You are a bad and faithless man ! It is a sin to listen to you ! " He caught up his hat , and plunged towards Stuart , who instinctivelymoved aside , aghast . The boy seized the door handle , wrenched openp195the door , and fled . Stuart , standing there in the office , heard his wild and retreating footsteps running through the empty shops . He heard one last cry , as the outer door opened and shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . His face was damp . He wiped it . Then he began to curse aloud , viciously , to curse himself and his folly . He felt weak and sick , after this encounter with this blinded young man , whom he had tried to help . He opened a drawer in his desk , and recklessly produced a bottle of whiskey . He drank long and copiously . He needed it . He put the bottle away , and cursed aloud again , with richness and despair and rage . Oh , the damned young idiot , the cursed imbecile ! Damn him to hell , and his mother with him ! He deserved nothing better . He locked up the desk . It infuriated him that his hand was shaking . STUART went out into the dead and ashen quiet of the November evening . A faint fog had drifted in from the Lakes , and every street-lamp floated in a rainbowed aura . The board walks were slippery and dark with moisture ; the cobbled streets gleamed with a wet black luster . Every house showed rectangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled faintly , and with dim echoes . Not a soul could be seen . Stuart , locking up the doors , glanced at his full block of shops with that swelling rich satisfaction which never failed him . During the past five years or so , he had torn down the uneven line of chaotic little shops and rebuilt them on an even height of three stories , so that they appearedone long shining establishment . Indeed , he had cut doors in the walls so that one could travel from the main shop to the last on the street , without stepping outside . One could pass from the ladies ' luxuriousestablishment into the boot shop , where ladies , choosing their own fine leathers , could be fitted for excellent boots by expert shoemakers and where their husbands and children could also be fitted ; and from the boot shop to a fine millinery shop , a wonderful innovation for Grandeville ladies , who were accustomed to patronizing a pet dressmaker , who usually starved between hats . Stuart had employed these impecunious females , and had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now marvelous bonnets stood on stands in the windows , surrounded by lengths of gleaming velvets and heaps of artificial flowers and ribbons and feathers . Beyond these effete shops were hardware establishments , harness makers , furniture emporiums , feed shops , pantry staples , and even a meat shop . One of the larger shops was in the nature of a " general store , " where the farmer could find almosteverything , and could order anything from careful catalogs compiledby Stuart and Sam Berkowitz . In short , a family could enter the first shop and come out of the last , completely surfeited and supplied , and laden with bundles . In a conspicuous spot , framed in a thick golden frame , were excerpts from large newspapers sent Stuart from several distant metropolitan centers , all praising him for his innovations and merchandising genius . These hung on the brocaded walls of the Ladies ' Shop . Stuart now employed twenty clerks , female as well as male , an innovationthat had made Grandeville gasp . All were well-trained and elegant , and aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful shop . They conducted themselves with the hauteur of nobility . To work for Stuart was not only to receive wages beyond the dreams of avarice , but to have a certain exclusive socialpatina bestowed upon them . They were not " degraded " by their employment . Nor was their love for Stuart the result only of his wages . They found him kind and understanding , tolerant and sympathetic . When he passed through the shops , he was followed by their adoring glances . He knew them all , and their families . He was never too busy to inquire about a sick member of these families , to send regards , to listen with concerned interest . It was natural , therefore , that Stuart should be hated , justifiably , by other employers of labor . He was a " revolutionary , a Whig , " a traitor to his class . He gave the working people , born only by the grace of a wise God to serve their masters , a false idea of their importance in the social scheme . Some ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week , an incredible sum , when the usual just wage was about six or seven . He was making his employees stiff-necked , giving them strange ideas , and implanting in them sentiments unbefittingtheir station . But despite these condemnations , and threatened boycotts , Stuart prospered . He had introduced another strange idea into merchandising : the Customer is Always Right . Heretofore , in Grandeville , among other merchants , and among merchants everywhere , the prevailing religionwas caveat em ptor  --  let the customer beware . But Stuart had an/other idea entirely . He sold sound merchandise at a sound price , and received a sound if modest profit . Should the merchandise prove faulty he exchanged it cheerfully , and with apologies , or refunded the money . The people of Grandeville , stupefied at first , came to trust him implicitly . But Stuart was also very shrewd . He sold for cash only . No matter how high-born and wealthy the lady , she paid on the counter as did the small laborer or farmer . No credit was extended . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had they not known that the lady in ermine , bowling along in her carriage , was compelled to open her reticule and disgorge as quickly as themselves . " No bills , no arguments , no lost customers , " said Stuart . " Besides , as they know , a man who sells for cash can sell cheaper , taking a smaller profit , and giving better goods . " At Sam 's suggestion he started another innovation . A farmer , after harvesting , could deposit with Stuart a certain sum which he believed would cover his purchases for the year . ( This cash-account idea was also extended to other urban customers . ) At the end of the year the accountswere settled , and any surplus moved over to the next year , or refunded . The great expansion of the Grandeville Supreme Emporium had , in the main , come from the one hundred thousand dollars which Mrs. Coleman had inherited on her twenty-first birthday . Stuart was now a rich man . And , in proportion to his income , his expenses increased inordinately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sum of ready cash . The profits went back into the shops , and a considerableproportion was spent in his own peculiar fashion . The railroad had been built to Grandeville , and Stuart used it at least twice a year to visit New York , there to arrange for shipments of new goods , to tour the shops for new ideas , and to amuse himself . The latteractivity often cost him a small fortune . He was much esteemed by the lighter and more luxurious ladies of New York . Chicago , that great fulminating city on the Lakes , also knew him , as did Saratoga and the horses , of which he was very fond . New Orleans had seen him , too , and other Southern cities . One summer , not accompanied by Mrs. Coleman , he had gone to Paris . He lived lavishly , with his wife and his one child , little Mary Rose , almost five years old now , whom he adored . He spared himself nothing . Therefore at thirty-four his girth had considerably thickened , his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry indica- tions of its outraged existence , and he had had one or two bouts of gout . Always a " fine figure of a man , " he was now very imposing in his new weight and extremely flamboyant wardrobe , and the splendor of manner and appearance which had always distinguished him had now become lavish and overemphasized , much to the amusement of his enemies , of whom he had very many . Also , his generosity , his magnanimity , his reckless extravagance , did nothing to endear him to the conservativeand the pious . Stuart had built the compact and comfortable little convent behind the church of Our Lady of Hope , and had established a parochial school adjoining the convent . Here the children of the poor could be adequatelyeducated , taught trades and needle-work , other revolutionary ideas which shocked the community for a long time . Stuart had offered to build a similar school for the Protestant poor children , and it was only after three long angry years that his offer was accepted , and then only after exhausting pleas on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools for niggers , next , " said many of the people , bitterly . He had ideas for a public hospital , but this innovation had aroused so much opposition and horror that he had temporarily refrained . However , he discussed it often with Father Houlihan , who was enthusiastic . The nuns would nurse in the hospital , the priest had promised him , and Stuart had doubtfully considered the idea . Nevertheless , he studied plans for the hospital , and his determination grew . No one but Father Houlihan and Sam Berkowitz understood this wild and contradictory man , this man of large and colorful inconsistenciesand rages and blasphemies , of mercies and kindnesses and furies , of selfishnesses and obtusenesses and brutalities . They knew that his huge faults came from the excess of his virtues , that he could not endure to see suffering , so that for his own peace of mind he must alleviate it . With it all , he was an eternal child . It was this childlikeness that made him stand , as he did now , this November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never tiring in his admiration for his own accomplishments . He had momentarily forgotten Angus . But when he saw his carriage waiting , he swore under his breath , and moved towards it , viciously striking the walk with his gold-headed cane . His temper was not soothed by the fact that he was having difficulty in fastening the middle buttons of his many-taped coat . Damn it , he had refrained from much drinking , and too much food , lately , yet his girth was not decreasing. pI99Ile felt , with apprehension , the heat under his stock , and the wave of heat that ran down his back . It was that copious whiskey he had just taken , of course , and it was all that cursed young puppy 's fault . I Lis face , as he passed under a street-lamp , was very florid and sullen . I n the folds of his cheeks the crimson was almost purple , as was the thickened roll of flesh under his chin . It was an over-full and dissipated face , reckless and violent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to spring with the old lightness into his carriage , and his anger against himself and Angus increased . There had been an ominous throbbing in his right , and gouty , foot . Now it was subsiding . As the carriage rolled through the empty streets he became conscious of a healthy hunger . He must really begin to walk a few miles every night , as his doctor had ordered . He would begin tomorrow . He would drink nothing more tonight . He would have but one helping of good roast beef at dinner . He felt very virtuous , all at once . It was a villainous way for a full-blooded man to live , he meditatedgloomily , especially that prohibition against too much dallying with the ladies . However , after leading the life of a monk for about six months , his doctor had assured him , he might resume a more normal way of living . He had a visit to make before going home . The carriage turned down one modest street after another , in the south side of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty white cottage of Father Houlihan . The priest had been ill recently of an intestinal complaint , which had much exhausted him . There had been considerable typhoid fever in the city that summer . The priest was convalescent now , but his duties for some time had been taken over by his young assistant , one Father Billingsley , who also lived in the cottage . Stuart did not like Father Billingsley , who was young , intolerant , bigoted , overly zealous in making converts , and very severe and pious . In his turn , Father Billingsley did not like Stuart , though he was overawed by him , and afraid of him . " A damned budding Jesuit if there ever was one ! " Stuart had called him , and in his presence . He rarely addressed the young priest directly , hut always referred to him in the third person and with rudeness and brutality . Father Billingsley was tall and emaciated in his black robes , with a long thin white face burning with religious ardor , and toobrilliantblack eyes as fiery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage tonight , not at all in a happy framep200of mind , he took no pains to hide his black scowl of annoyance at seeingFather Billingsley beside Father Houlihan , before the parlor fire . The older priest , in dressing gown , shawl and slippers , was still very pale and flabby , and revealed , in his tired but still strenuous blue eyes , the effects of his recent illness . He was apparently weary . He greeted Stuart with simple pleasure , holding out both his hands . Father Billingsley , with a censorious expression on his white young face , silently testified that he had been " annoying " his senior , to use Stuart 's expression . Stuart never understood the nature of the " annoying . " He only knew that when he came Father Houlihan would sometimes appearweary and exhausted , but patient and sweet as always . Now Stuart scowled at the younger priest , ignored his formal greeting , and angrily demanded why his friend should resemble a damned skinned turnip again . " My dear Stuart , " said the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of his own hot palms , " I am really doing excellently . I gain strength every day . Perhaps I did too much reading this afternoon , " and he rubbed his eyes apologetically . " You look , " said the rude Stuart , with a darkling glance at Father Billingsley , " like the underside of a flounder dead for a week . Has n't Dr. Malone been in to see you again , as I ordered ? He promised to be here every day , the cut-belly ! " " Now , Stuart , you know that 's no name to call Dr. Malone , just because he insists that surgery can be extended to the abdomen , in defianceof medical opinion , " said the priest , with an irrepressible smile . " Cut-belly , indeed ! And it 's you that was the lad that suggested that Dr. Malone shall head your hospital . " " He 'll head nothing but the workhouse if he does n't take better cart of you ! " exclaimed Stuart . " I 'll be damned if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or harass you in any way , whoever he is ! " And again , his ireful eye glittered on Father Billingsley , who , frightened , drew himself up to his tall thin height and looked dignified and severe . In gentle pity , Father Houlihan touched his junior 's hand , and smiled at him . " No one can annoy me , as you say , Stuart , or neglect me , with this lad about . " Stuart , shrugging rudely , glared at the fire . The whole attitude of his big body suggested that he would prefer Father Billingsley 's absence just now . But the younger priest , who for his conscience 's sake could never forego an opportunity to sway Stuart 's soul , would not leave ,  |p201des|pite  his own passionate desire to do so . He seated himself slowly , and his youth was suddenly revealed in his look of uncertain distress and melancholy . But his pale mouth set severely , and with dedication . In an effort to restore the precarious peace , Father Houlihan said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use your carriage , beginning tomorrow , if it is no imposition , Stuart . " " It shall be here promptly at two , " Stuart replied , pleased at the verdict . He sat down , and suddenly beamed on his friend . " God bless you , you old pirate ! It 'll be good to see you about again . And the Sunday and Wednesday games , too . " As Father Billingsley most decidedly did not approve of the Sunday card games , and had been horrified at them , Father Houlihan peeped at him apologetically . " The pool box could be filled again , " he suggested , " and with benefit . " There are men who can insult delicately . Stuart was not of this exaltedclass . His way of insulting Father Billingsley was to ignore him entirely , to speak over and about and around him . He did so now . He glared again at the fire . " Well , it might soothe you to know you 've given me the gout again , and set my blasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Father Houlihan was deeply concerned . He sat up in his chair , dislodging his shawl , which Father Billingsley , who really deeply laved him , adjusted with a sigh . " What have I done , my dear Stuart ? " " Oh , do n't look like a startled corpse , " said Stuart , with a short laugh . IIe reached over , took Father Houlihan 's knee in his hand , and shook it gently . " I should n't have said that , you innocent . I only mean that I look your advice , and spoke to that puppy of an Angus . " " Yes ? " said the priest eagerly , dropping the shawl again , and giving his junior another opportunity to readjust it . " And what did he say ? " Stuart began to laugh unpleasantly . " He practically consigned me to hell . Oh , I gave him all the arguments you had so carefully rehearsed to me . It did no good . I was a bad and godless ' man . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in suggesting he disobey his darling mama , Cod damn the bitch ! He 's as proud as Lucifer , the insolent popinjay , and as dull and dead as ditch-water . I tell you , he 's done with all of us , and it 's that strumpet 's doing . She hates me like sin , though we 've had an armed truce for the past few years , and everything is sweet and affable between us again . She had to do that , of course , or she 'd never ave had one invitation to dinner in the city again , or been accepted among my friends . "  |p202Father  Houlihan lifted his hand with a pleading and painful gesture . Father Billingsley looked aghast at this coarseness and vulgarity and sinful talk . " Stuart , please tell me all about Angus . " So Stuart told the whole disagreeable story , with gestures and profanity . Father Houlihan watched him . And then the priest knew that Stuart was deeply hurt , much more hurt than he would ever confess , even to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grundy , you know I did . He and that poor darling little Laurie . I loved the little lass . I saw her with her mama in the shops , a week ago , a love of a child . Ah , what a beauty she will be , what a belle , what a heartbreaker ! It 's no use , Grundy . Janie 's poisoned the children against me . I ca n't help them again . " " The children in the gate , " murmured the priest , with deep sorrow . He wrung his hand in the shawL " Eh ? " " Never mind , my boy . It  --  it is very sad . You can not keep after him , then ? " " No . I 'm convinced that if I try it he will leave the shops , in spite of the increase in wages . He 's that sort . Proud , stiff-necked , stupid and righteous . I 'm afraid his soul 's gone to damnation , Grundy . " He grinned , wryly . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own look of gloating . " Father Billingsley cleared his throat timidly . " One must n't desist in the saving of souls , " he muttered , looking at Stuart . But Stuart looked only at the older priest , and said with brutal sarcasm : " I think , Grundy , the saving of souls should be left to those competent to do it . " Father Billingsley flushed . He dropped his eyes ; his mouth drooped . Father Houlihan said , pleadingly : " I wish you could do more for the lad , Stuart . I know I 'm not competent enough to tell you how to do it . You know all the circumstances better than I. I can only pray . And some day , I feel , my prayer will be answered . In the meantime , ( 10 what you can , if it is only a little . " Stuart stood up . He said , with brutal insinuation : " I 'm no busybody . Let a man save or lose his soul in his own good time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's his own affair . Any man who tries to interfere is a  --  in skirts . In skirts , " he repeated , with heavy emphasis . Father Houlihan saw , with compassion , that his junior 's pale youngp203lip was actually quivering , that he was trembling . He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes . " Ah , well , " he sighed . " We shall see what prayer can do . In spite of what you say , Stuart , I know you wo n't neglect the lad . " And now , Stuart , that other matter . Have you found out anything about this organization which call itself the Know-Nothings ' ? " Stuart was aroused by the previous conversation to new heights of insult . " I 've talked about it with other men , and done some questioning . All I know so far is that it is , as you have said , an anti-Catholic , an anti-foreign , organization . And a nasty , disgusting , brutal organization of cut-throats , liars , ignoramuses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our clergy . There have been some inflammatory sermons in the churches , even in Grandeville . " He continued : " I know nothing about it . I know only that when the country 's seething , as this one is seething about the slavery question , lunatics try to divert the national temper by finding it an easy victim , one that can be murdered and hung and beaten without any bloodshedon the part of the attackers , and without danger of the law . The country 's getting roiled up about slavery , and there 'll be hell to pay very soon , I 'm thinking . The powerful fellers know this ; they do n't want war , or any other trouble , with the South . So they 've thought up the Catholics to divert the people , and give both North and South something on which they can vent their rising tempers with impunity . Intolerance , as you told me , is like a leech on a bad bruise ; it sucks out the blood . The powerful fellers have thought up the Know-Nothings as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackamoors . " " Yes , yes , of course , " said the priest , in anguish . " It is an old device of the oppressors , this diverting of the people 's righteous indignation into harmless if bloody paths , this finding of a victim whose sufferings will not matter . It is done in Russia . " He smiled up sadly at his friend . I le patted one of the hands on his shoulder . " Stuart , you are a good man . I know . God bless you . Do what you can . " When Stuart had gone , he turned to Father Billingsley , who was now at the exploding point , and he said sternly : " Our hands are not clean , Father . God knows , they are not clean . There was much in what St uart said . Let us take it to our hearts . For the sake of our souls . For the sake , perhaps , of our very lives . " He added , in a suddenly clear and passionate voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us here , all men with good will in their hearts , all the oppressed and the sufferglLet us not hate each other , and incite one against the other , be/cause we differ in our gods and our ways of life . Who is so presumptuousas to say who is right , and who is wrong ? Let us beware of hatred , lest it turn and rend us who give it birth ! " IT WAS not in Stuart 's nature to be meddlesome . He detested those who were continually anxious about the welfare of others . To him , that was presumption . Further , he believed that those who can not help themselvesare in some way contemptible and weak . To aid them was to increase their irresponsibility . But Father Houlihan 's gentle , or angry and bellowing importunities ( returned in furious kind by Stuart ) finally reduced him to the point where he decided that he would call upon Janie to desist from her pressureupon her son . After he had made this decision , he was so enraged that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , financial and private . Was he not married to humanity 's worst example of congenital idiocy ? Did he not have a darling child whose health did not improve despite the waters of Saratoga and long sojourns in the mountains ? Were not women hell 's own brew , exigent and bottomlessand inexhaustibly rapacious ? Had he not his own liver to contendwith , and a damned partner who was always going over ledgers and meanly advising less borrowing and less extravagance ? It was the devil 's own life . His plans were all awry . Joshua Allstairs had not relented . Stuart seldom saw him , and then only at a great distance . He heard no ominous rumors of him , but Stuart could see him , like a gray spider , crouched in his horrible house , biding his time , plotting the hour of vengeance when he could hurl Stuart down forever . It was nerve-wracking to think of him in that house , silent , watching , waiting , and sometimes the suspenseful vision was intolerable so that Stuart had wild dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , speak now , do what he would , and God damn him , anyway ! " You haf only to be calm , to be careful , not to spend foolishly , conserveand watch , " urged Sam . " Nothing can hurt you then , my Stuart . " It was useless to explain to anyone , and especially to Sam with his disciplined dream , that for one like Stuart to " conserve , to be careful , " to be thrifty and provident , was worse than dying , that he would choke in the atmosphere of penny-watching , that he would stifle should hep205have to guard his expenditures . When he merely considered that a diamondbracelet for a favorite lady might be an extravagance , or a lovely piece of French glass or an ancient rug might better not be purchased just at this time , he was thrown into a veritable frenzy of melancholy and despondency , so that he became frantic and life seemed one vast prisonhouse of crusts and water and drabness . He filled his house with gorgeous and beautiful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture high against an oaken door , to prevent his pursuersfrom breaking in and seizing him . Only Father Houlihan and Sam knew that these were the frantic gestures of a man terribly afraid of poverty and of life , most terribly afraid of other men . He was often completely and artlessly surprised to discover that there were other things to fear besides poverty and starvation . Incredulously , he almost believed it when it was explained to him that some men feared the loss of prestige , of love , of health , of family , of friends , of positionand of power . Some men , he was hugely amused to learn , even feared the loss of the love of God ! He hated those who had no money , for they subtly threatened him , said to him silently : " So is it possible for you to be , without dignity , hope , pride or salvation , the prey of the foulest man with gold in his pockets . " And out of this hatred was born his compassion , and not paradoxically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew his extravagances , for he needed constant assurance of his invulnerability . With this drunkard 's need upon him , and his mystic terror of Joshua , and the imbecility of his wife , and the frailty of his little daughter , and Sam 's constant and anxious cautioning , Stuart could irately , and with truth , declare that he had " enough troubles of his own , curse it , withoutmeddling with the lives of others . " Nevertheless , one pewter-bright December Sunday he went to Janie 's house . He had set out calmly enough , in his carriage , grumbling and cursing under his breath , gnawing his lip and glowering about him , but able , at moments , to bow to some passing acquaintance , and to wink at some properly chaperoned young girl bowling along in her own carriage with her oblivious mama . But the closer he came to Janie 's house , the more ireful he became , the more embarrassed . Finally he passed a favorite saloon . It was closed on Sundays , of course . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was early , hardly four o'clock , and Stuart had grimly followed his doctor 's advice that there was to be no drinking until the evening dinner had been eaten . However , when he saw the saloon he recklessly decided that he needed a drink , several of them , before approaching Janie . He left his carriage , went through the back alley to the rear door , knocked on it three times with his cane . It opened immediately , and he was admitted to the rear room . It was already filled with his particular cronies , who hailed him with delight . Soothed , happy and flattered , as only a simple man can be soothed at the signs of favor of his contemporaries , Stuart seated himself at a large round table and lavishly ordered drinks for himself and the five other men about him . A violent political argument was in progress , and Stuart soon , and exuberantly , found himself participating . He , himself , had been an ardent Whig , but had joined the new RepublicanParty after its formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate , who had been defeated a month ago by James Buchanan , Democrat , and fifteenth President of the United States . Stuart felt personally affronted and outraged by the elections , and now he darkly hinted that he was privy to some secret confidenceabout them . " Mind my words , " he said , glowering about him , " there was dirty work there . I 'm not at liberty to reveal what was told me by an exalted personage of high importance , but I was given to understand that the South had much to do , and not honestly , with the election of a Democrat . The pro-slavery clique . That is n't the worst of it , either . This personage , this close friend of mine , always in touch with Wall Street , earnestly assured me that next year we shall have a financial panic . We always have ' em when a Democrat is elected . " " You mean , " said a friend , cynically , " that the Democrats just come into a depression caused by your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The argument became hot . This Buchanan , with his love for the Southerners , would stimulate the already inflamed ill-feeling between the Southern States and the North . Had n't pro-slavery men just sacked Lawrence , Kansas ? Had n't John Brown , that madman , recently massacredfive pro-slavery men by Pottawatomie Creek ? How much more of this could go on without the whole country bursting into flames ? It was all the doing of the Democrats of course . " It 's your nigger-loving Republicans that 're causing all the trouble , " disagreed another man . " I do n't love niggers ! " cried Stuart , after a fiery gulp of whiskey.  | " But I do n't want any goddam war , and unless we keep our heads we shall have it ! " Another man nodded gloomily . " What about this here Dred Scott decision ? Throw the whole damn country into turmoil . You 'll all see . " " All I want is to make money , fairly , and in peace ! " bellowed Stuart , banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to get embroiled in any sanctimonious sentimentality about the Rights of Man , and slavery , and high principles ! Damn it , there 's trouble enough in the world without going out with swords and banners to find it , and all in the name of God and justice , too ! " But a young man , with a serious and lighted face , cried : " That is the credo of all the bloated and selfish men in the world ! Am I my brother 's keeper ? ' they asked , elbow-deep in money . Go away ; do n't bother me . I have my business , my shop , my factory , my mibl , to attend to , and my notes to meet . God ? Justice ? Mercy ? Decency ? What are they ? Will they bring me money , increase my bank account , my property ? No ? Then I 'll have none of them . ' " He looked at them all , somberly , at Stuart , who was grinning sardonically , and at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " comes the chaos , the ruin and the death , the just punishment for such selfishnessand greed . Do not think for a moment , my friends , that when the day of reckoning comes , as it will , you will escape . " The thought was so depressing that Stuart ordered another round of drinks . He reiterated : " I do n't want war . Who does ? Why ca n't fools shut their mouths ? I 'm not interested in slavery . I 've never thought much about it , except as a bone of contention . I have an idea ! Why do n't the sanctimonious anti-slavery fools pay every planter for his slave , a decent price , and then free the blackamoors ? After all , the planters have a huge investment in their slaves . It 's wrong , and inredible , that anyone should suggest they free their slaves without just ecompense . It  --  it 's un-Constitutional , by God ! " " Listen to the foursquare American patriot ! " jeered another man . " I low long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you know about America ? You , an Irishman ! " At this insinuation as to his Americanism , Stuart started from his chair ith clenched fists , his face suffused . Two of his friends rose with him , nd grasped his arms . Others in the room , delightedly smelling a vioitfight , stared and turned their chairs about . That Coleman ! That risliman ! He could n't remain in a room five minutes without explod- ing . It was very diverting . One of the barkeeps hurried out of the room to call reinforcements . Stuart , struggling with his captors , who exhorted him to calm himself , let his furious eyes dart about the room . And then , all at once , he was rigidly still . At a far table , oblivious , sunken into a drunkard 's stupor , sat a very young man , his head bowed , an empty bottle and glass before him . The glimmering lamplight shone on his head of thick , light auburn curls , and on his slack and ruddy young face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the height of fashion in fawn-colored pantaloons and darker coat and elaborate ruffles . He sat there , in his stupor , unaware of the riot which had suddenly started at Stuart 's table . Beside the bottlelay his tall beaver hat , his cane and gloves . On his finger a rich jewel glittered . Stuart stood and stared at him , paling , while his friends loosened their grasp on him , uneasily , and then followed his eyes . One of them began to laugh , uncomfortably . " He 's here all the time , soaking it up , " he said . " A damn young drunkard . Spends a fortune ; always alone , too . Have n't you seen him here before , Stuart ? But Stuart flung off the arms of those who held him , and went over to the table of the young man . The others in the room , sensing his great consternation , and seeing his grim silence , watched with intense interest . Stuart was unaware of any of them . He stood by the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janie 's darling , sleepingthe sodden and drivelling sleep of drunkenness . Stuart pulled out a chair and sat down . He felt sick . He had very rarely noticed Bertie , but on his infrequent encounters with the youth he had liked his debonair air , his merriment , his constantly twinkling blue eyes , his attitude that life was an extremely good joke , and very enjoyable . Nothing ever seemed to disturb him ; Stuart had never seen him without a wide smile , and a laugh . He was very popular in his school ; he had many friends . His ways were winning and charming , and he softened everyone , even the most suspicious and dour . Ile laughed at his mother 's rages ; he laughed at Angus , with his solemnity , his bitter pride and silences . He laughed at his favorite brother , Robbie , and the " black one 's ambitions . " He laughed at everything . He was like a smooth silver mirror dancing in sunlight . And now he was here , in his drunken sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to be wondered at , thought Stuart , bitterly  |p209I  le had no other occupation ; he had no ambitions . He was a weakling , and a sot , like many charming , laughing people , whom everyone loved . Nevertheless , Stuart 's violent heart was stricken , for some nameless reason . He felt angered , and full of pity and disgust . He picked up the empty bottle , and flung it from him , with a crash . I lc looked at the drooling , half-smiling mouth of Bertie Cauder , at the reddened and flabby cheeks . Yet all at once he was no longer angered . It was such a young face there , unconscious , fallen into a drunkard 's dream , a vulnerable face , and tragic . He laid his hand on Bertie 's shoulder , and said in a low voice : " Come on , come on now , Bertie ! Let me take you home . " But Bertie merely tilted gently on his seat and would have fallen to the dirty floor had not Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested against Stuart 's ruffles , like the head of a sleeping child . Stuart looked down at the moist bright curls , and he cursed inwardly , almost with a sob . He saw the shadow of someone else beside him , and he looked up , blinking the dimness from his eyes . Bertie 's brother , " the black one , " Robbie , stood there , composed and reticent , and with such damnable and indifferent assurance . Robbie was still undersized , though he was nearly seventeen , with a mature if small dark lean face and with wise and cynical black eyes which saw everything and were disturbed by nothing . Everything in that face was delicate and attenuated , full of a peculiar aristocracy , a carved refinement . His expression was reserved , but without Angus ' harsh pride and melancholy , and his delitemouth , mobile and thin , smiled slightly . He did not follow the prevailing mode of longish hair ; his own black sleek head was croppedry short , and gleamed like a seal 's . One saw every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chin . His nose was fragile , excellently cut . In his garb , also , there was reserve and aristocracy ; his pantaloons and coat were all of the best black broadcloth , his linen severe and white , without ruffles , his folded black stock without S inn . " So , " he said , " he 's at it again . I often come here for him . There is room at the side , Stuart , where he  --  ' rests '  --  until I can take him home . N ' It h your help I 'll take him there , if you please . " A dark flush of hatred suffused Stuart 's hot face . Robbie , as always , made him feel clumsy , too large , stupid and heavy , and very , very gaudy d absurd. if this has been going on , why has n't your blessed mama done some/I0 thing about it ? " he shouted , oblivious of the interested audience . " And you , you popinjay ! I thought he was your pet brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him with indifferent gravity . " That is what I am trying to do , Stuart , " he said quietly , with a note of reproof in his toneless voice . " If you please ! " He took one of Bertie 's arms ; Stuart seized the other roughly . They hauled the unconscious Bertie to his feet . Half dragging , half carrying him , they opened a door and entered a chill dark little room in which there were a number of chairs , a table , and a sagging sofa . Robbie was all calm . He did not so much as glance once at their audience , who craned after them as they entered the outer room . His manner consigned them to the limbo of creatures who do not matter , who have no existence unless it is granted to them by those who might acknowledge it . He closed the door quietly behind him . His gestures were all authority and composure . They sat Bertie on the sofa , his sagging back against the wall . From him came gusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and sighed . His hands hung down limply beside him , large white hands , jewelled and well-kept , like a woman 's . Stuart stood helplessly beside the sofa , his disgust and rage rising . He was still burning from the hated small Robbie 's manner . Quite viciously , then , he lifted his hand and struck Bertie smartly on first one cheek then the other . " You dirty sot ! " he exclaimed . " You miserable , worthless young jackanapes ! You puppy ! Wake up , you young dog , and be ashamed of yourself ! " Robbie seated himself on a stiff chair near by and studied Stuart with a faint dark smile . One of his little hands played with the chain of his watch , which stretched across his waistcoat of flowered black silk . " He wakes up quite soon , Stuart , " he said , composedly . " Do n't agitateyourself , I beg of you . If you will sit down for a little while , unless , of course , you have other and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hear you . " Savagely , Stuart tore a chair away from the table , thumped it down at a considerable distance from Robbie , and stared at the youth with fury . " Your pet brother ! He is so much your pet that you can not watch him ! " Robbie glanced at his brother quietly . For an instant , only , his keen black eyes softened , and his smile faded . Then he said , still looking atp211Bet-tie : " I am indeed very fond of him . He is happy . Who am I to interfere with his happiness ? " " You can say that ? " said Stuart , aghast , fulminating . " You think a drunken stupor is happiness ? You think if a man makes a spectacle of himself , and degenerates into such degradation , no one should try to prevent it ? " Slowly , calmly , Robbie looked at him . He studied him in silence . He appeared all meditation . Then he said : " It is apparent that you do not understand , Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be aroused to shame , that exhortations can save him . I tell you , nothing can be done . " Again he studied Stuart , who stared at him stupidly . " For example , Stuart , " he continued , his hand delicately playing with his chain , " you drink . But you are no drunkard , in spite of the undoubtedly large quantity of spirituous liquors you consume . You see , then , there is a difference between you and Bertie : you , who drink , and Bertie , who is a drunkard . Is the distinction too fine ? " " You talk like a conceited young ass , " said Stuart rudely . Robbie smiled , and shook his head in polite denial . " Perhaps I have not made myself clear , Cousin Stuart . I have made a study of such matters . I have talked long with our physician , Dr. Gibson . There is a literature of sorts on the subject , which I have closely inspected . " For instance , as I have said  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you always have a reason for drinking . You are angered : you drink a few glasses . You are depressed , and always for a good and sufficient reason : you drink a certain amount . Whiskey is an anodyne for you , numbing the too sharp sensations which afflict you . When they re numbed , you no longer drink . You drink with friends , for joviality and good-fellowship . In short , you drink , but always for some react . " He paused . " But Bertie needs no reason , no reason at all . That isby he is a drunkard . " Stuart continued to stare at Robbie intimidatingly , but also with confusionnow . He felt his whole big body awkward and too cumbersome , ( he presence of that small and precise elegance , which was too wise . Robbie continued calmly : " There is another distinction between you I Bertie , not too subtle a one . You like the taste ; you enjoy it , not ly for the effect when you are disturbed or in good company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gag him . A man who joys his drinks is always in control of himself . But a man who drinks , I drinks alone , for no discernible reason , is a man who can not stop . "  |p2I2This  was all too much for the simple Stuart . His head whirled . Ile glowered at Robbie . " I suppose , " he said with elaborate and futile sarcasm , " that none of you has ever exhorted this young fool to be a man ? " Robbie 's smile was gently thoughtful . " There you have it , Stuart . Bertie does not want to be a man . " " Eh ? " " Exactly , Cousin Stuart . He does not want to be a man . At intervals , he feels the pressure upon him to be a man , the pressure within himself . He resists . His resistance is drink . When he drinks he becomes utterly irresponsible , incapable of being a man , freed from the necessity . I-Ic becomes a child again , one who must be cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects him to stand on his own feet . ' He becomes again the heedless child . " Now he folded his hands slowly on his lap and contemplated Stuart with detached reflection . " Who can make Bertie strong ? He was born with that soft core of weakness in him . Nothing can strengthen him . Nothing can harden that cheesy core . We are impotent to help him . He alone can help himself . And I doubt even that . The inherently weak man has no will . He does not want a will . He does not want to face the hardships and adversities and duties and responsibilities of adulthood . Nothing can make him want to face them . It is useless . We can only keep him happy until he dies of his affliction . " " You are a cold-blooded young devil ! " exclaimed Stuart . Robbie shook his head in gentle denial . " I am a realist , Cousin Stuart . I am not insensible to the misery of our poor flawed Bertie . But there is nothing I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when his childishnessleads him into such predicaments . " Stuart stared at Robbie in silence , with something like humble fear , and with much helpless hatred . Robbie looked at his brother with a cool anxiety . " He must have drunk a great deal , this time . He has been away from home since morning . This bout began four days ago . Usually four days are enough . Yet this is the fifth day , and he is still drinking . I suppose I shall simply have to wait until he is able to walk . " Stuart stood up . His depression was heavy upon him . " I have my car  --  riage near by . I was going to call upon your mother , anyway . We can take Bertie . " " Why , thank you , Stuart , " said Robbie , composedly . " That is a re  --  lief . Will you assist me ? I think we can carry him out , between us. "  |p213He  stood up , also . Stuart hesitated , scowling . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? " Robbie shrugged , delicately . " Sometimes she thinks he is a braw laddie . ' That is when she is in a good temper . She admires a man who drinks ; it is manly , I believe is her opinion . Then when she is not in . t good temper she berates him , even strikes him . I have seen her beat him with her slipper , and have heard her curse him . That is because site does not understand . " " She gives him too much money ! " Robbie smiled , as at some absurd remark from a child . " I assure you that if Bertie were not given money , he would sell anything , or rob anyone , for the money with which to drink . Mama has some regard for my opinion . I have persuaded her that withholding money will do no good , so , for the family name , and for Bertie himself , it would not be wise to limit his allowance , or completely deprive him of money . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . No , it is better for him to be able to buy what whiskey he needs . And I assure you , St uart , he desperately needs it . After such bouts , I always take home a bottle for him , or he would surely die , or go mad . " " Have you had your minister talk to him ? " demanded Stuart , fuming , Unwilling to accept the cold and terrible verdict which Robbie had propouncedon his brother . Robbie compressed his lips , to keep from smiling again . WAS Angus ' custom to read to his mother every Sunday afternoon . He id not approve of her choice of literature , but he had the gift of resotelyclosing his very consciousness to that which he did not desire or ish to acknowledge . He could read aloud for hours , in a grave , wellodulatedand excellent voice , and not have a single conception or cmory of the thing he had read . The voluptuous scenes narrated in e yellow-backed " French " novels passed over his awareness like unticedclouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his pale and virgin cheek . Sparkling and witty diagucleft him immune from humor . Janie would sometimes watch him ith wry and amused interest as he read , and was always baffled at theof disconcerted embarrassment or discomfort . She would lie onp2I4 her chaise-longue , her lacy scarf or shawl over her thin shoulders , and help herself to a plate of bon-bons , or sip tea , and listen attentively and with enjoyment . She was nearly forty now , and needed spectacles to assist her lengtheningsight , her inability to read small print . But her vanity , her hatred and fear of age , would not submit to this need . So she would half-recline comfortably , and have Angus read to her . He did not find it onerous , though a few times he had gently suggested passages from the Bible and decorous books suitable to the Sabbath . Janie 's prompt , and very rowdy and very blasphemous , rejection had made him wince , and he never mentioned the subject now . She would sometimes study him idly or with cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff armless chair , his hands holding the book high , his somber young face expressionless through all the tawdry or passionate text . On this particular Sunday Janie was in quite good humor . Outside , the sky was like polished pewter , brilliant with diffused sunlight . The black and sinewy arms of trees formed an intricate pattern on the shiningpanes of window glass near which she lay on her chaise-longue . She could glance down at the Sabbath silence of the street below , and bemusedlywatch the glittering carriages that occasionally rumbled over the cobbles . In the distance , the cross on the steeple of a church flashed in reflected light . Soft bells announced Vespers . A fire crackled on the marble hearth , and threw long rosy spears on the solid black furniture , which was all comfort and pleasant ugliness . Her canopied bed was white , covered with lace flounces and little pillows . The draperies at the windows were rose-strewn silk , and very rich and heavy , in accordance with Janie 's taste . By her elbow stood a little table on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her cook the art of making scones . ) There was marmalade there , a pitcher of thick cream , hot tea in a Limoges teapot , the scones , a plate of seed-cake , and a round silver bowl of sugar . The tea steamed ; the fire chuckled ; the pewter sky brightened ; the bells filled the air with a sweet murmuring ; the house was quiet . Only Angus ' voice went on , fluid , eloquent , and very clear . It took only a little imagining to make her half-believe that she was home in England , and not in an alien land at all . She had bought this tall narrow brick house shortly after leaving Stuart 's fabulous mansion . In a spirit of contrition ( for he was warm . hearted ) , he had been able to purchase this house for her at a sub  --  stantial saving over the original price . It was ugly , three stories in height ,  |p215with  narrow dark halls and unexpected thin staircases , and tall box-like rooms . But it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for Grandeville , amazingly dry . Gloomy , dull , blank-faced , with a wooden verandah , high slit-like windows , carved fretwork and little stone excrescences at those windows called balconies , it was properlyrespectable and stood on the second-best fashionable street , surrounded by almost identical neighbors . The lawn before it was narrow , enclosed in privet hedges ( brown now , in December ) , and surrounded by huge dank trees . But there was considerable ground , and a garden in the rear , and a good stable and other buildings . The street was called Porter Avenue , and was quite near the river . It was also near The Front , where a garrison of soldiers was maintained , suspiciously aware of Canada , and Janie could hear the evening taps very clearly , and sometimes the morning reveille . This never failed to excite and interest her . Quite often the garrison would march through the river streets , very rigid and stern , with drums beating and fifes playing and flags fluttering , and the officers very handsome indeed on their black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black mustaches and excellent shoulders , who always saluted her when he pranced by , as she leaned from her tipper window to watch . It was very romantic . She had only two servants , and did much work herself , polishing the many silver articles , mending , embroidering and doing considerable creation in needle-point with her skilled needle . She loved order and cleanliness , and was not in the least averse to assisting in obtaining this desirable state . Her natural vigor , which had not abated with the years , found a happy outlet in this work . All in all , she was quite content . She had the happy faculty of adjustingherself to circumstance , and enjoying herself wherever she was . She was much admired in Grandeville , especially by the gentlemen , and as she was hospitable , amusing and gay , invitations to dine with her were eagerly accepted . For the first time in her life she had been careful to cultivate female friendship , and had many sincerely devoted friends , and practically no enemies . Janie was not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the goblet of her environment , and sparkled invitingly in it . At first she had thought she might marry . But none had pleased her among these beefy merchants , tanners , horse-traders , butchers , bankers and manipulators of land . Moreover , Grandeville air seemed conducive to longevity among Grandeville females , so there were few widowers.  | She carried off her old humiliation very well . After a short interval she had invited Stuart and his new wife to dine , and gave a party for them . During that dinner she had been a most perfect and engaging hostess , showering beaming looks of affection on " dear Marvina , " chidingStuart affectionately for having neglected his " family " during the period of his ecstatic honeymoon , gently forgiving him with an arch look , imploring her guests to love and pardon him , with glances that were very touching . All in all , she carried it off excellently , and Stuart , red-faced and confused , was grateful to her . She even deceived Stuart , so that he invited her alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been received with abuse , upbraidings and curses . He had vowed never to come again . But Janie , with a crafty narrowing of her evil green eyes , had burst into laughter , and had shouted : " You would not dare , you blackguard ! " However , though he did visit her alone , for the sake of appearances his visits were few and far between . Later , a precarious peace prevailed between them , and then Janie began to enjoy his company . With him she could be natural . She knew he was afraid of her , that he hated her . But she also knew she could amuse him . She visited him and Marvina , and was openly affectionate with the girl , so that Marvina quite adored her . And always she brought one of her children , sometimes more . The prosperity of the shops assured her quite a respectable income , which she administered shrewdly , for she had a natural business acumen . The rest of her money reposed in one of Joshua 's banks , and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , on Stuart 's advice , and had sold it at a profit . There was much reason for her contentment , then . If her mind continuallyschemed and plotted , the evidence was not yet . Her great health and vitality made her enjoy life , enjoy every day , as no " truly virtuous " woman would have enjoyed it . She enjoyed these Sunday afternoons when Angus read  --  to her for hours after an enormous , well-served , well-cooked dinner . Sometimes she drowsed ; she would lean her red head back on the pillows , and smile softly in her half-dreams . She was mistress of every situation . She did not drowse today . The novel was too exciting , and the in congruity of Angus reading the purple passages too amusing . She watched him , grinning , as he read : " And now , attired for the night in a loose white silken robe , which revealed all the pearly and innocent wantonness of her limbs , Lady Iso/belle moved to her casement and looked down upon the moonlit gardens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ebony . She flung open the casement , and the moonlight streamed in silver fire over the gentle roundness of her half-concealed breasts . She raised her eyes to the stars , and implored aloud : Let him not come to me tonight , dear loved ones who guard my purity and my honor , for surely I can not resist him further ! ' " But , alas , there was a quick and furtive knock upon her chamber door , and instantly it was flung open , for this lovely and unsuspecting creature had neglected to lock the last barrier which protected her from the lustfulness of her suitor , who , despising her defenseless state , and knowing that no cry of hers would arouse her sleeping sister , and understandingthat never , never , would she allow that sister to suspect that her adored husband was in licentious pursuit of the gentle and unprotectedLady Isobelle , had audaciously taken advantage of all these things . He saw her as she cowered in the draperies of the moonlit casement , palpitating like a fawn at bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single garment , her head thrown back , her lovely breast revealed , her face as white as snow . With a single savage moan , he was upon her , pressing his hot lips deeply into her lips , her throat , her bosom , while she lay in his arms , fainting and sobbing under her breath , unable to resist him . When he lifted her in one sweep , and moved towards the bed , she knew no more . " Angus paused , to turn a page . His movements were quiet and abstracted . He cleared his throat , automatically , for he had been reading for hours of the pursuit and seduction of the desperate and defenseless Lady Isobelle . His pale and austere countenance was like a statue 's , changelessly reserved and dignified , his regard unhurried . His long thin figure , in its funereal black broadcloth , aroused Janie 's risibilities . She began to chuckle . He glanced at her with cool surprise . " That is the end of the chapter , Mama . Shall I begin another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung back her head and screamed . Angus watched her , bewildered . " Was it amusing , Mama ? " he asked , with a slight ruffling of his thick dark brows . He glanced down at the book , uncertainly , and with disapproval . Janie 's convulsions increased . She looked almost young as she laughed without restraint . The years had sharpened her features , made them more lividly vicious in color and contour . But her eyes were still vivaciously green and restless andp2I8 glittering , her hair still undimmed ( though secretly assisted ) , her airs and graces still lively . She wore a dark green velvet peignoir , with a white lacy shawl over her shoulders , and her throat and hands sparkled with many jewels . " Oh , go on with you , Angus , you stone of a man ! " she cried at last , when she could get her breath . " My God , you are past nineteen , and you know no more than a chick in its shell ! Good heavens , lad , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Angus , bewildered , brought her the jewelled vial of smelling salts from her dressing table . He removed the stopper , gravely , and courteouslyhanded the bottle to his mother . She sniffed , strangled on the strong perfumed fumes , sniffed again , laughed , shook her head , and replaced the stopper . She sank back against her cushions , exhausted with her merriment , and stared at him with bright hard speculation . She said , in a suddenly quiet and ominous voice : " Sit down , Angus . " He sat down obediently , for obedience was his cardinal sin . He looked at his mother attentively . His inexplicable devotion and passion for her had increased rather than decreased , with the years , His stern and austere egotism made it still impossible for him to believeill of those on whom he had cast his love like a glittering mantle . He knew all about " sin , " did this poor and wretched youth , but he knew nothing about the world of men , and their immortal wickedness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great villain . It was Janie 's intention that he become this villain , in order that he might serve her . She was very clever . She knew his devotion to her , and though it amused her , filled her with loathing derision , she understood what a weapon it was to be used against Angus , against those she hated . What a booby it was , to be sure ! She smiled at him , and her pale and sallow cheeks wrinkled like canvas , in the afternoon sunlight . " How are the shops , my love ? " she purred , with a sudden change of tone . He moved on his stiff chair , and answered her eagerly : " Splendid , Mama . We can hardly take care of the orders . " And then his thin tongue licked his lips , furtively , and his gray eyes glimmered . Janie smiled to herself , satisfied . " You were quite right to speak as you did to Stuart , my pet , " she said , in a considering manner . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To think that he dared try to persuade you to disobey your poor mama , who has suffered so all these years ! But let 's not speak of that . I hold no grudge against him . My own papa always said that itp219was impossible for me to hold a grudge . " She laughed a little . " It is so tedious , Angus . And one must have the most prodigious memory , you know ! " Let it be , then . You know my own secret little plans for you , that some day you shall be the owner of the shops . We must leave the way in God 's hands . One of these days , I hope , I shall be able to buy a larger share in the shops , and the shares , of course , will belong to my chil-dren . " She sighed . Angus was rigid on his chair . He gazed at her with passionateintensity . Janie was silent a moment . Then , in a firm and resolute tone , she said : " My love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this wicked old world . You believe your mama , do n't you , your mama who has lived so much longer than you , and who has had experience of life ? Thank you , my love . I see that you understand . " And that is why I must , even though perhaps accused of indelicacy , come to the subject of Miss Gretchen Schnitzel . " It was then that Angus turned quite white , and he looked aside , even his lips pale . He said , in a strained faint voice : " But Mama , Miss Schnitzel , though no doubt very exemplary and worthy , does not appeal to me . " Janie , shocked at this folly , lifted herself upright on her lounge and glared at him , the shawl slipping from her shoulders . She cried , with hoarse outrage : " Does not appeal to you , ' you puppy ! How odious of you , how indelicate , how improper ! What do you mean by it ? Answer me at once , you fool ! " Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His long white hands trembled , those hands which bore the fingers of a surgeon . He moistened his parched lips , and whispered : " Please , Mama . Your heart , you must remember . Mama , I do n't like Miss Gretchen . She  --  she is repulsive to me . She  --  she is fat and white , like lard , and short , like a keg . Her hair  --  it 's like coarse flax , and her little hard blue eyes are like a pig 's . She  --  she is a German , Mama . You never liked Germans , you know . " Janie , still glaring at him , slowly lowered herself again . A muscle twitched in her dry cheek . Her eyes were vicious . But she said , quietly and brutally : " I like everyone who has money . I lave you so easily forgotten my lessons ? I 've looked , with you , into the Bible , which assures us that God loves the man of wealth and property , and despises the poor . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German ,  | who has money , is respected both by God and the world . I shall not repeat all that to you . You know it , and you are a fool if you 've forgotten it . She laughed abruptly , and the sound was ugly . " Miss Gretchen is her father 's heir , the heir to his tanneries , his bank accounts , and his property . She is the catch of Grandeville . God knows why she ever looked with favor at you , Angus ! And God knows why her respected papa and mama have not turned you out of doors whenever you called upon the family ! I am not one , however , to quarrel with the smiles of fortune . Miss Gretchen favors you ; her papa and mama favor you . That is enough , it seems . " All at once she uttered a loud sob , and covered her face with her jewelled and corded hands . Angus started to his feet , and took a step towards her . She flung aside her hands . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat upon a cushion with it . She cried out , savagely : " You would destroy all my hopes , you , my son ! Is money to be plucked out of the air ? Is the sustenance of a poor mother to be denied ? Are your brothers , and and your sister , to starve ? Are we to be the butt of the laughter of idiots and scoundrels ? How are we to rise above our enemies , without money ? " Do n't you understand , you young blackguard , that if my ambitions for my children are to be accomplished we must have money , not a niggardly few pounds , but thousands of them ? The shops ! How are we to inherit them , to make them our own , unless we have money ? And the money is there for you , in the person of Miss Gretchen Schnitzel , and you have the audacity to tell me that she does not appeal ' to you ! " " Mama ! " he cried . But she regarded him with noble detestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touch me , Angus ! You , my undutiful son , whom I have brought up in tenderness and love , building all my hopes upon you , praying for the day when you will avenge the slights put upon us ! Go away , Angus . Go from the sight of your afflicted mother ; spurn her love and devotion . Laugh at her sorrows and her dreams . Turn your back on Miss Gretchen , and her money , which could save us ! " He gazed at her with the hopeless and awful despair which would have stricken a less resolute woman . But she , seeing it , looked at him only with righteous anger and inconsolable grief . She cowered on her lounge , as if very cold and completely abandoned . She shook her head , sighed , leaned back , and closed her eyes.  | " Go , Angus , I implore you , " she said , in a fainting voice . " Send Daisy to me . No , send Laurie , my daughter , my little daughter . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sufferings . " But Angus sat down on the edge of his chair . His hands were spread open on his knees . He shivered , quite violently . His head was bent . Suddenly he thought of Miss Gretchen Schnitzel , and a vast retching sickness filled him . But he subdued it with fanatical sternness . He swallowed the salt water that oozed into his mouth . And then , all at once , for the strangest and most mysterious of reasons , he heard the far echo of a heroic song , and for one blinding instant he saw the wild white face and glowing black eyes of a young man he had been taught for many years to hate . It had been years since he had heard that song , had seen that face , and his heart suddenly rose and expanded in him involuntarily , like a bird rising from a dark pit into the light . And then , so twisted had he become , so lost , so bedevilled and distorted , it seemed to him that that face and voice were evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be so , he thought . There was no other explanation . The last time he had seen and heard them with his mystic inner eye and ear was when , at the age of fourteen , he had made his final plea to his mother to be allowed to study medicine . How loud the voice had been then , how wicked and triumphant ! He had fled from his raging mother to his minister , who had solemnly assured him that his first duty was obedience to his poor mama , who was wiser than he , who had " sacrificed " so much for him . It was God 's command that parents were to be honored , and obeyed . Whatsoever , or whosoever , seduced a child into contrary behavior had been visited of the devil . That old rising and expanding of his heart , then , had been subdued and crushed by him , in righteous exaltation . It had never come again , until this day . He straightened himself in his chair . The face and the voice faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo , sinking back into the abysses of despairing forgetfulness . He had conquered his own inner sinful self again . He was whitely exultant . " Mama , " he said , clearly , " please , please listen to me . You are right . I was wrong . Forgive me . " But Janie did not stir . She lay , as if broken and lost . But , slowly , her eyes opened . She looked at Angus . She saw his strained and ghastly ace , his feverishly burning gray eyes . She saw his humility , his exaltation , his love for her , his conquest of his deepest and most profound instincts , his violation of himself . She saw his innocence , which  --  strangely for Janie  --  now seemed to her a terrible and pathetic thing . She had no conscience . But there was a sick and curious churning in her , which for several moments she could not control . She had never loved Angus . She had always despised and derided him . Nevertheless , as she stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a choking in her throat . She had the most ridiculous impulse to shout at him : " Oh , go away from me , you fool ! Go away , but never look at that fat white tub of lard again , and be damned to you ! " But fortunately , as these incredible words trembled on her shakingmouth , her reason and her commonsense returned . She forced a tender and forgiving smile to her face . She held out her languid hand to him . " My darling lad , " she murmured , feebly . " Do forgive your mama if she was too stern , and too stricken by her emotions . I should have known that my love would always see his duty . " She was trembling , and for the first time this trembling was not assumedfor effect . It was genuine . How close she had been to ruin , then ! How grateful she was that she had been silenced before the foolish and dreadful words had left her lips ! What had possessed her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her hand . He looked down at her , smilingtremulously . " Oh , Mama . It is I who should ask forgiveness , not you . " He drew a deep breath , and said , strongly : " Tomorrow I shall ask Mr.  --  Schnitzel  --  if I may press my suit with Miss Gretchen . " She smiled at him with that liveliness and animation of hers which was so fascinating , all her white teeth sparkling , her eyes dancing vivaciously . She patted his hand , and said with anticipatory joy : " We shall see ! We shall make them bow down to us ! They 'll rue the day they made fools of us We 'll show them ! " She sprang quickly to her feet , moving like a young girl . She walked quickly up and down the room , chuckling gleefully , throwing back her spirals of reddish hair . She was all vitality and life , her skirts swirlingabout the low heelless black sandals which covered her tiny feet , and sometimes , as they swirled and tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were fully revealed . She appeared quite pretty in hu gay vehemence , and Angus watched her . She had forgotten him . But when she finally did see him , she almost loved him for the triumph he was about to give her . She stopped beforep223him , and patted the arm in the black broadcloth sleeve , and laughed aloud . If she was aware of the thinness of the arm in that sleeve , she ( lid not show it . " You are a good lad , my love , " she said fondly , and sighed . " What should I do , a lone and abandoned widow , if I did not have such a man ; shout the house ? " Then her face became pinched and uneasy . She glanced about , as if looking for something . " Where is Bertie ? Where has he been these lays ? I never see him . " Angus hesitated ; his expression darkened . He had become quite adept in protecting his mother from knowledge of his brother 's drinking bouts , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was that Janie was still unaware that this collapse was the finale to days of drinking . Incredible though it seems , she as yet believed that the day of collapse was the first day , and that Bertie , though a " toper , " could not carry his liquor like a man . When Angus still hesitated , picking his painful way between truth and evasiveness , she glared at him . " Where is he ? " she demanded , in a loud hectoring voice . " He is n't drinking again , is he ? " Angus said , weakly : " I believe he spoke of visiting Miss Alice Cumflingsthis afternoon , Mama . " The glare faded from Janie 's eyes . She smiled . " So that is it , eh ? Well , then . But it is only a chit , still . How old is the lass , Angus ? " He turned away . He said faintly : " I believe she is fifteen , Mama . " " Yes , yes , so her mama told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a chit , after all . Bertie could go far and do worse , it is true . There is money there . " She chuckled again . " Trust Bertie to use his head , the rascal ! " She mused on her Benjamin , and a look almost of sweetness softened I , ( . r eyes . " He does well in his classes , too , I am told . And with ease , t 1 ough the wretch never studies . Mr. Braithe assures me he has never had a cleverer lad . " " He does well , " said Angus , mechanically . " Next year , " said Janie happily , " he will go into the shops , also . No nonsense about Bertie . " Angus glanced down at his hands . He said nothing . Janie stared at him impatiently . She made a dismissing gesture . " My head aches , Angus. ' , ( nc1 Laurie to me to brush my hair . She never remembers , the little he som , until reminded . What it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus turned and walked slowly to the door , erect , almost emaciated in his black broadcloth . " Like a damned undertaker , " thought Janie , viciously , and with nasty amusement . Perhaps she should have apprenticed him to the grave-diggers , after all . Her Bertie , and even that disgusting " black one , " Robbie , would have served her betterin the shops . But no , she reflected , neither of her younger sons had that inherent rapacity and greed which stirred so strongly under Angus ' pious and dutiful and gentle exterior . What was it that that damned Stuart had said to her about Angus , which had so surprised her with its unexpected subtlety ? " He has substituted duty for the love of God and man . " His Scots rigidity of character was still unshaken , though Stuart had called it " terribleness . " Yes , the lad was dour , but he was weak . Janie , watching him leave the room with his noiseless and stiff tread , laughed in herself . Trust the virtuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She threw herself again on her couch , and gave herself up to pleasantmeditations . The December afternoon was paling and darkening . The firelight was more vivid in the room . She could feel its warmth on her feet . She hummed a little , hoarsely , under her breath . She had done well for herself . That she knew . She had come far , in a strange land , with no help from anybody . She was enjoying herself , and she had vivacious plans for the future . She felt in herself a sense of power and invincibility , very agreeable sensations . Angus made his way down the narrow slit-like corridor towards his sister 's room . It was very dark and dank here , smelling of wax and chill airlessness . The servants were sleeping in their quarters on the third floor , after the arduous labors of the big Sunday dinner . In an hour they would arise and prepare the evening tea . But now the house was silent except when gloomy hollow echoes reverberated through it , like echoes coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disembodied echoes , that roamed through all the corridors and rooms seemingly without human origin . They boomed and dwindled , enhancing the dark , cold and crepuscular melon. choly of the day and the house . Angus stopped suddenly , and his hand reached out and leaned against the wall . He felt the paper dampness of it , its chill . Its very texture impinged itself with a curious intensity onp225his palm , so that , as he stood there in the semi-dusk of the hall , he felt himself surrounded by living entities that gazed at him with immobility . It had always been this way with him : from his earliest childhoodhe had been suddenly seized , at intervals , by the strangest and most affrighting sense of awareness in the most ordinary objects about him , and his heart had risen on an arc of confused terror and dread . A slight shift of plane had come to him , and with it a sensation of disorientation , of nameless fear , of lostness , and he would look about him with the eyes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible despondency which would come to him then , the hopelessness , the iron weight which would replace the slow quiet heat of his heart . Now he slowly rubbed his thin palm on the paper , and looked about him , too burdened even to sigh . He could not see the design of dull red roses on the wallpaper , or their coiling green leaves . He could see nothing but the dim shallow light that filtered through the small window at the end of the corridor , where it made a bend at right angles to the part in which he stood . He could hear nothing but those long running echoes that traversed the corridors of the house like drifting ghosts . Ile could feel nothing but the agony of his despondency and dread and unidentified anguish , and the texture of the wall under his chilled hand . But all at once he wished for death with an overwhelming intensity . This desire , too , was a familiar one to him . It had in it a black urgency , a will to flight . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs to whoring . For , by then , terror would take him , though his despondency Was none the less . A battle would rage in him , with hopelessness nd despair and grief on one side , and fear and the will-to-live on the at her . During all this time , he stood as silent and motionless as a ghost himself , there in the dusky hall with the little window a rectangle of pile light in the gloom . He looked steadfastly at the window ; its wanlumination lay on his features , which were rigid and white , and in his yes , which were empty and distended . He could not move . His stiff arm , with the hand pressing against the wall , upheld him . He waspetrifled with his suffering . Finally , as if breaking free of chains , he stirred , and said simply , and aloud : " Oh God . " In the past this had been the word to free him rom the horrible enchantment . It did not free him now . It was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it sankwithout a trace , with not even an echo of its passage . He said it again ,  |p226over  and over , and again it was like falling stones , cold and shapeless and without meaning . It seemed to him that an hour or more passed as he stood there , washed over by the darkest waves of anguish on which no star shed any light at all . But it could have been only a few moments . When he could resume his walk down the corridor , he felt as weak and broken as though he had just risen from a sick-bed , and the huge pain that pervadedhim was a low fire all through his tired body . He ached as if stricken by an endless sorrow . He reached the little window , and stopped involuntarily . He looked down at the blasted gardens two stories below . He saw the wet bricks of the winding walks , over which bent the cold and iron branches of empty trees . He saw the white walls beyond , the ruined flower-beds . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death itself . Not even a sparrow twittered over the brown grass , or swung on a limb . There was no wind at all , though this was a land of almost constantwind . Everything stood frigid and without movement and life . He stood with his hands grasping the window-frames , and said aloud , and very simply again : " I can not endure it . " He said it over and over , with a dull and heavy vehemence which was yet without passion or meaning . He did not ask himself : What is it I can not endure ? Instinctivelyhe knew that to know the answer would be too terrible , would make life impossible for him . He only listened to the sound of his voice , and its dogged rising and increasing swiftness , and the very sound of it , while expressing his enormous agony , also dulled it . It was an incantation . After a few moments of listening to his own words , his own cold and meaningless frenzy , he could straighten up and go on again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had been before . Nevertheless , his face was wizened , dried into the planes and wrinkles of voiceless torment . He tapped on Laurie 's door , and at the sound of her clear young voice he opened the door , and peered within . Ile smiled . It was the smile of an old man . Laurie sat crouched on the hearth , reading by its red and uncertain light . Her little room was in gathering shadow . The firelight was like a pool on the thick shagginess of the hearthrug . The andirons and t be fender glittered with bright brazen reflections . Laurie wore a bl ; irk woolen frock over which was tied her ruffled pinafore of white muslin . Her long golden hair , which reached far below her waist , was heldp227back from her face by a band of crimson ribbon . She looked up at her brother , smiling faintly ; her small face was serene and full of dignity . She stood up , tossing back the lengths of her hair , and her smile grew brighter . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an air of calm and gentle authority about her , and a maturity greater than her years . " Is it time for tea , Angus ? " she asked . But he stood on the threshold and only gazed at her with a poignant acuteness which was the aftermath of his enormous despondency . She was warm and young and alive . She was the denial of his melancholy and his despair . She was the normal voice calling over the blackness which had almost drowned him ; she was the voice awakening him from nightmare . He could feel the nightmare retreat to a great distance from him , held at bay by her very existence . He shivered . He came into the room , feeling that he had just returned from an age-long journey . He rubbed his hands together ! " It is cold , " he said . He stood on the hearth and bent to the fire eagerly , urgently . She watched him in silence , and now her face , daily growing more beautiful , more closed , more dignified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of mature pain . Angus lifted the coal scuttle and threw more coals upon the crimson embers . Now the fire leapt and spluttered , throwing off radiant sparks ; it roared up the chimney . Angus stared at it , with his urgency hot upon him . It was like a fever in him , like the febrile fire that races after a deathlike chill . He turned to his sister , and smiled upon her . " What were you reading , Laurie ? " he asked , and his voice was tender and deep , as it always was when he spoke to her . She did not move , but there was a curious restlessness about her , which showed itself in the sudden flicker of her golden lashes and the half movement of her red young mouth . She said , almost coldly : " I was reading Bleak House . By Mr. Dickens . " And now Angus ' look matched her voice in coldness . " A novel , Laurie ! On the Sabbath ! Where are your Sunday-school books , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone which he could not overcome . Laurie shrugged slightly . " I have studied my lesson , Angus . I 've read to texts . " " But you have n't meditated upon them , " he said , and it seemed to im that his words were thick and heavy in his throat.  | She shrugged again . " Enough . I ca n't meditate ' on them all day . " " It 's little enough to give -- God  --  one day out of seven , " he rebuked her . But she was silent . Finally , he glanced about the room and looked at her bedside table . There lay the lessons and the Bible . He said in the . dull and abstracted voice of complete listlessness : " Would you like me to hear your lesson , Laurie ? " " No , thank you . " If there was irony in the quickness of her response , he felt rather than heard it . He regarded her with distressed dourness . She smoothed back her hair calmly with the palms of her lovely large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return his regard impassively . " Where did you get that novel , Laurie ? " he asked , not understanding the pain in his heart . The faintest of smiles passed over her lips , a smile of cool irony and disinterest . " Cousin Stuart gave it to me for Christmas . It is one of four of Mr. Dickens ' books which he gave me . They 're very interesting . Angus . You should read them . " " I have no time for nonsense , " he said , with proud severity . " Nor should you , Laurie . The world is a grave and serious place , and there is no room in it for frivolity . " The girl was about to reply tartly ; the first forewarning of her words was already quick and unusually vivid in her large dark-blue eyes . But she held them back even when they had risen to her lips . Instead , a gentle look , tender , even maternal , replaced the first hard sparkle between her lashes . She came to her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Angus . I promise you I 've got my lessons . Is that enough ? " He made a movement as if to withdraw his hand ; he tried to let her see his displeasure . But he could do neither , for her expression was so gentle and loving , and her young hand so warm . Against his will he smiled at her . With his free hand he stroked her smooth and shining hair . He said , irrelevantly : " It is so pretty , your hair , Laurie . " That reminded him . He added : " By the way , Mama wants you to go to her and brush her hair for her . Her head aches . " Instantly , and intangibly , her features hardened , became aloof and impregnable again . But she said indifferently : " I had forgotten . I 'll go to her at once . " She smoothed down her pinafore , straightened the ruffles at her neck , and went out of the room quickly , walking with a steady effortlessp229gliding motion which was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . When the door closed behind her it seemed to him that the room was suddenly invaded by a deathly coldness and emptiness , which not even the renewed fire could dissipate . He looked about the little room , which quivered with silent crimson . The corners were lost in shadow . The dark ceiling moved in the firelight . The furniture was plain , but good and somber mahogany . The harrow little canopied bed was white and nebulous . The draperies at the tall thin windows stirred in a rising wind . All about were scatteredLaurie 's school-books , and other books . Angus frowned sadly . He looked down at the hearth where the maligned novel lay , open and face down . He picked it up , and distastefully , holding it as far from him as possible , he scanned a page or two . He read : " She is like the morning . With that golden hair , those blue eyes , and that fresh bloom on her cheek , she is like the summer morning . The birds here will mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes from the book and stared at the door through which his sister had gone . There was the strangest rising in his heart , like a voluptuous pain , almost a pain of joy and overwhelmingtenderness . He forgot that this was the Sabbath , and this the reprehensiblebook of Mr. Dickens . " She is like the morning " ! The lovely words were a dazzle of light before his dimmed eyes . Little golden Laurie , his darling . The book shook in his hands . Who cared for Laurie , but himself ? Who loved her , but him ? She was his treasure , his responsibility ; she was all he had . He sat down on the stool near the fire , feeling a weight behind his eyelids like tears . His sorrow was on him again , formless and huge . He knew Laurie loved him . But she was changing in these days . She had always been scant of words , but she had always smiled . Until lately , until hardly a few weeks ago . What had happened to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , hardly ever broken , a chill surface , impervious and silent . Her mother called her " a self-satisfied and selfish minx , with no heart in her . " Angus recalled those words . " With no heart in her . " But no , he almost cried aloud , there is a heart in Laurie , but it is dying , it is being killed ! What was killing the sweetness , and the heart , in Laurie ? What was making her as smooth and featureless as a stone ? Laurie 's heart , that heart of a child ! He could not endure it . He was wild with his pain . She rarely sang now . The pianoforte down in the lofty parlor hardly ever filled the house with its sweet notes , accompanying Laurie as she sang . He could hear the echoes of her full and beautiful voice , that voice which was too strong , too clear , too majestic , to be the voice of a young girl . It had suffered some training at her young ladies ' school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not changed its fullness and life and roundness . It had broken away from them like a full flood over a feeble barrier of little stones , a golden flood that could not be restrained . How it had filled the house when she sang ; it was the voice of an angel , tranquil but triumphant , sounding effortlessly like a trumpet in all the rooms . She could sing the most inane ballad , and it was a celestial rhapsody . She could trill a few exercises , and they were the movement of a symphony . Every room would seem to listen , breathless , as the strong rapture invaded it . Even the servants would listen , halting in their work and freezing into statue-like attitudes . How long had it been since Laurie had sung ? Angus , in his desperate intentness , could not remember . But it had been a long time . With the freezing and dying of Laurie 's heart , her voice was dying also . It had become silent , like bounding waters frozen by quick and gathering ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , and Mr. Dickens ' maligned book slipped from his knees with a crash . He stood up , quite wildly . He looked about him . He walked up and down the narrow little room . What had happened to Laurie ? Why had he been so blind and so deaf ? How had he been insensible to her silence , to the freezing of her face , to her stillness ? It had been a long time since he and she had walked together , of a Sunday afternoon . How had it happened ? He could not remember . He could not tell . He only knew that in his own black blindness of voiceless despair he had wandered away from his sister , had forgotten her . Her voice had been powerless to follow him . Or perhaps she had just remained behind , of her own will . And then he remembered that last Sunday when they had walked together near the river . The memory came back on a rush of light , poignant and clear . It had been a cold spring Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bright , polished and chill , typical of the northland , and though the wind was like a wall of invisible ice , strongly pressing against cheek and breast , the memory of the seven months of bitter winter , black and bound , made this day seem festive and brilliant and gay . It was a release from months of endless snow and blizzards , and gales that rushed through the dark air like thousands of cutting scimitars . The banks of the river were wet and brown , shining with half-liquid mud ; the trees were only half-leafed ; the grass , while green.  |p231ing  slowly , was still short and uncertain . But the sky was pure and immense , filled with radiant light , and the rushing river waters were almost indigo in their intensity of color . So clear and pellucid was this north air that one could see the farm-houses and the little white cottageson the Canadian shore , and the faint greenness of the trees . Here and there a rotting cake of ice drifted swiftly with the current , tilting , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wideness and a promise in the air , a murmur of brief but fervent life , and though the wind turned Laurie 's cheeks to crimson , and though she must clutch her big beaver bonnet with her gloved hand or hold down her whirling skirts , she laughed with pleasure that the winter had gone . She stood beside Angus , and though he was tall , and nearly eight years older than she , the top of her head reached to his eyes . A cloud of white gulls circled against the sky , catching sunlight on their wings . Their melancholy calling echoed in the clear silence , mingling with the voice of the constant strong wind . They blew down on the water , a swirl of giant snowflakes , and then rose again with small fish in their beaks . Wide flat rocks , bleached by the winter , shone in the sunlight , their edges lapped by restless green waves . Angus and Laurie picked their way carefully over these stones , and stood near the water , their bright eyes looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind them were thick woods , full of the cries of busy birds . They could hear the many churchbells of the late Sabbath morning . It was very peaceful , very brilliant , and very cold . Angus had found some violets in the wet woods , where the spring light had been white and misty . These were now fastened to the collar of Laurie 's billowing brown beaver cloak . The sweet color was hardly less vivid than her eyes ; her mouth was warm and living scarlet . And then she had begun to sing , very softly , meditatively , as if she were alone and singing only to herself . Her voice seemed part of this bright and rushing desolation of wind and river and stone and blazing cold sky . Angus had listened reverently . How her strong voice rose , bell-like , powerful , yet pure and leisurely as flowing gold , so that all the air seemed filled with it ! It was their father 's song , so long forgotten by him , " 0 Morning Star ! " And Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed by a sudden and overwhelming anguish . He wanted to cry out to her that she must not sing that song , which was an agony to him , an amorphous despair . It was the song of a man whose memory he was convinced was a power of evil for him , turning his thoughts to the most joyful and pagan of things , seducing him from what he knew was his duty . But he could not speak . He could only listen . He did not know when she stopped her singing . Only slowly he becameconscious that she was silent , that now the voices of the wind and the river and the gulls had returned with overpowering intensity , as if awakened by the rapture of that song . Angus was very cold ; his whole body was petrified with chill . He shivered . He looked at Laurie , his lips numb , his eyes smarting . And she was looking up at him , so gravely , so intently , that he was startled . Her blue eyes shone in the cataract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , even a little hard , and very sad . " Dada 's song , " he stammered . He could not look away from her , from that strange watchfulness of her eyes , and the hard sadness of her young mouth . She seemed to accuse him , not with anger , or disdain , but with sorrow and sternness . " Yes , " she said softly . " Dada 's song . You remember it , Angus ? " But he could not speak . He could only loosen his hand from hers , and half turn away . Now he saw nothing of the sunlight but its desolation , nothing of the river but its threat of bitter green death . " Angus , " said Laurie , " you never go to the kirk with me any more . " He looked at the icy waters almost at his feet . He saw their emeraldreflections , their bubbling foam . And then he said quietly : " No . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems nothing for me there , any more . Besides , Mama needs me on Sunday . " Laurie said nothing . When he glanced at her furtively he saw that she was smiling with a new grimness , and that her eyes glinted through her lashes . She said : " There never was anything there , for anybody , in the kirk . God ca n't be as bitter and as harsh as the minister says . When I am old enough , and my own mistress , I shall not go , either . " " Oh Laurie , that is a fair wicked thing to say ! " he exclaimed , dully . " You are only a little girl , yet . You can not judge . " She regarded him shrewdly . " You have judged , have n't you , Angus ? " But he did not answer that . He looked at the river . " But you have n't forgotten your Presbyterianism , though , have you ? " Her voice was soft , and a little derisive . " Laurie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? You are so young . Why Laurie , you are only a child . "  |p233She  shrugged , indifferently . " Grand-da 's mama was only two years older than I when she was married , " she remarked idly . " I am not so young . " She pulled her blowing cloak about her tightly , and stared grimly at the river . " Angus , when I was little you talked to me about being a doctor . I have n't heard you mention it lately . Why not ? " He became rigid in an iron silence , then he said , very coldly : " That was all nonsense , Laurie . I am in the shops now . Mama convinced me it was ridiculous , and that she needed me there , to protect her invest-ment . " He was startled when he heard her laugh . It was a soft laugh , yet it was derisive , and not pleasant to hear . " Everything is ridiculous when Mama does n't want it , " she said . " She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lawyer . She wants Bertie to go into the shops , with you . But Bertie will not have the shops . You wanted to be a doctor . But you have gone into the shops . " " Laurie ! " he said , and his voice was full of pain and anger . But she shook her head at him , scornfully . " She wants nothing of me but to be a fine young lady and make a good marriage . I am not a fine young lady , and I shall not make a good marriage . ' I shall do what I wish . Only you are a bowl of porridge , Angus . " She had turned away from him abruptly , and had begun to pick her way over the stones , holding her skirts high , before he followed her . Now his face was dark and tight , his gray eyes flashing . He reached her . He took her elbow . " Laurie , you are cruel . You do n't know what you say . " She pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with glitteringdisdain . But she only said : " I can make my way alone , Angus . " And now , as he stood there before the fire he remembered that Sunay , and Laurie 's words . They seemed enormously significant to him . e said aloud : " But I do not understand . " Yet , when he tried to unerstand , he was filled with fear and complete desolation . He turnedsway from the memory , sick and trembling . Laurie had not sung again , he remembered . Nor had she walked with im , or even talked with him for long . The cold hard imperviousness had slipped over her . Had she been avoiding him ? He believed it now . But he was not concerned with himself now , nor with the pain he was suffering at the memory of Laurie 's words . He was thinking only of curie , Laurie who had been his darling , his little sister . All at once , heas terribly afraid . He was filled with a nameless conviction of guilt.  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phrase was full of grim significance , of sorrow , of repudiation . He listened to the echoing gloomy silence of the day . It was evening now . The wind had risen strongly . It muttered restlessly at the windows . He lit a candle and put it on the mantelpiece . He looked about the room . It was strange and empty and alien to him , and unfamiliar . He walked about the room , looking at Laurie 's few possessions . But it was the room of a stranger , which disliked him , which willed him to leave . One of her ribbons lay on the bed . He picked it up , absently . It slithered softly through his fingers , as if to escape him . But he wound it through his fingers , feeling its silken texture , its warmth , as if it remembered what long lengths of gold it had tied . Without knowing why he did it , he put the ribbon in his pocket , thrusting it in with fingers that seemed too aware , every nerve exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the room , half-running back to his mother 's apartments . " BE CAREFUL ! " said Janie , vindictively , pulling her head away from the brush which Laurie wielded . " You are an uncommonly awkward besom , Laurie . And careless as the devil . Have n't you remembered yet that you must take a strand smoothly from my head and brush it gently ? Go away with you ! Give me that brush . " Laurie surrendered the brush calmly . And , calmly , she lit the lamps about the room , going from table to fireplace with unmoved serenity and dignity . Then she pinched the tip of the wax taper , and replaced it in the vase with the others on the mantelpiece . She yawned , brushed her pinafore free of her mother 's loose red hairs . Janie watched her . " You are completely worthless , Laurie , " she said , with viciousness . " You are n't even clever at your school . God knows why I pay one hundredpounds a year for you there ! You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They tell me you will never be graceful in the dance , it you practise for a thousand years . You have no deportment . You resist all the efforts of your teachers . Your French is abominable . I had hopes for you at the pianoforte , but Miss Humphreys tells me now that you show no more interest , and are very dull . Nor is your singing improving . They tell me your voice is rusty for lack of conscientious training . Asp235for your needlework , it is the work of an infant . You are disinterested i n charades . Your exercises with the backboard do nothing to improve your carriage , for you are a great stupid girl , like an ox . Wherever did you get that gigantic height ? The women of my family were all petite and full of grace . You are as graceful as a cow , Laurie , and I am ashamed of you . " I realize , " continued Janie , with gathering excitement , " that you are not to blame for your deficiencies of appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overgrown size . You will never be attractive to gentlemen , for gentlemen do not admire young ladies who top them by a head , and must wear enormous boots , like a stableman . But you could at least make some small effort to be proficient at your studies . I understand that you are not to leave your form this year , but must remain with the little girls several years younger than yourself . I can not believe that a child of mine is by nature stupid ! If you would but make an effort you could be as proficient as any other girl of your age with the globes , and in languages and music , and could at least learn to walk like a lady . " Unmoved , her face as expressionless as tinted wax , Laurie stood on the hearthrug and stared at her mother . Her feet were apart in a somewhatungraceful position , her hands clasped behind her back . Janie could see the girl 's strong and sturdy ankles , her Scots virility and health , and impassiveness . Janie 's rowdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There you stand , like an ox , utterly without grace or ladylikeness ! A great stupid girl ! Your only occupation is novel-reading and day-dreaming . You walk about this house with your heavy and lumbering tread , and do not even deign to keep your room in order . Are you popular with the other girls of the proper society , miss ? No , they are too milk-and-watery for you , you have said ! Do you invite them to tea , as I have urged upon you ? No , indeed , they are too dull and young ' for my grand and elderly minx ! You prefer the horses in the stable , and the stable boys , and your novels , and your long rambling walks along the river , stumbling and climbing over the stones like a lad too big for his britches . Do you take an interest in your wardrobe ? No , my lovely daughter must chaff and stamp and fume before the dressmakers and cause them to give up in despair . You would refer linsey-woolsey , I presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long s it covered your nakedness . " My God ! " resumed Janie , flinging the brush from her into a corner where it crashed loudly . " To have a daughter like this , utterly withoutp236style , with enormous feet and big clacking boots and a dull and lightless face ! Whatever is to become of you ? Who will want you ? The only proper ambition of a girl is to make a good marriage , to repay her parents by doing them proud . By setting up her own establishment and taking her place in the world of fashion and style and accomplishment . But it seems that I must be saddled for life with your ugliness and obstinacy and lumbering feet and uselessness . " Then Laurie spoke , calmly , without perturbation : " You are right , Mama . I shall never make a good marriage . I know that . The lads do not admire me . It is annoying , but it is a fact . I do not know yet what I shall do , but I shall choose my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Choose your own way , ' did you say , miss ? What way ? What is there for you to do ? " Laurie smiled . " I suppose there could be less pleasant ways than managinga household for one 's mother . " At this absurdity , Janie burst into raucous laughter . She flung herself back on her couch . Her mirth was ugly , full of hate . She shouted : " You 'll manage no household for me , you daft fool ! You are incapable of it , if nothing else . Do you visit the kitchen to inspect the cooking pots ? Do you show any interest in the marketing ? Do you call the attention of the housemaid to dust under the beds ? Do you count the linen and the silver ? God knows you are old enough for all this , but you do not do it , skulking in your dirty room with a novel on your big bony knees . You do not even watch over your own cambrics and laces and ribbons and frocks . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a household for me ! " " It seems that I am entirely useless , " agreed Laurie . But this only further infuriated Janie , who jerked upright on the couch as if to rise and smack her daughter soundly . Laurie regarded her serenely . There was a wicked glint in her blue eyes . " Of course I can always be a governess , or a schoolma'am , Mama . " Outrage stupefied Janie . Laurie remainded tranquil and apparently unaware . She mused . " But , no , as you said , Mama , I am no scholar , and can be neither a governess nor a schoolma'am . I am afraid that I can see no hope for me . " Janie let out her pent breath on a gust of rage . " Well , let me tell you now , miss , you shall not live the rest of your life on my bounty ! I do not intend to keep a buxom young female in idleness the rest of her life ! You can well look about you in a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have you , though not as an ornament , God help you !  |p237Gentlemen  of fashion and position demand females of fortune or comelinessto grace their homes , and not louts and japes and numskulls . " Laurie was silent , and undisturbed . Her impassivity was one of the most hateful things about her , to her mother . She looked indifferently across the room , and regarded her reflection in the opposite mirror with unconcern . She saw her strong and beautiful face , with its brilliant and intelligent eyes and stoical bright mouth . She saw the breadth of her young shoulders , which were square , and not sloping in the admired fashion , and the Grecian column of her throat with its creamy skin . Idly she admitted that everything about her was on too majestic a scale , too large , but she was not regretful . Once , in a moment of rare affection , Janie had called her a " braw lassie . " She was indeed very " braw , " she acknowledged . Health was too ruddy in her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blue eyes ; even her nose , well-formed and straight and white , was too big , for all its classical outlines . She was one for heath and hill , for mountains and crags , for the roaring seas . She would never learn the gentle art of swooning , of the frail fainting voice , of graceful vapors . She thought of all this with her usual cold nonchalance . She lifted her child 's arms , and felt the smooth flowing of good muscles . Her flesh tingled with strength . She dropped her arms , and again clasped her hands behind her back . She spread her feet a little farther apart . Angus opened the door . He was breathless and flushed . Laurie glanced at him ; there was an imperceptible tightening of her features , and she turned away her head . Angus looked at his mother , her face dark with malevolent rage . In his usual abrupt fashion , which knew no tact , he said to Janie : " Mama , it has just occurred to me that Laurie does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he daft , this ninny ? She uttered a rough oath , and threw herself with fury back against the cushions of her lounge . As for Laurie , she turned her head very slowly and gazed at her brother with icy inattention . But Angus , excited , still under the spell of his misery and pain , approachedJanie , and said with stammering eagerness : " All her teachers have said they never heard such a voice , Mama . There  --  there is a fortune in it . " God knew what subtlety lay behind his trembling words , end his manner , but he was successful in causing Janie to cease her profanity and to stare at him , licking her lips . He stood at the foot of her lounge , and spread out his hands helplessly.  | " It is true , Mama . Laurie can be a great singer . She can go everywhere . There is a fortune in it . It is wicked of her to neglect such a talent . " " What is all this ? " asked Janie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama , you must have heard of the great female singers , who are famous in New York , in Paris and London . " He paused . " Mama , you 've told me how you heard Jenny Lind in London , in 1847 , and how prodigious was the applause . You remember , you said she was Alice in Meyerbeer 's Robert le Diable , and that later she appeared in operas in Manchester and Liverpool . Then she was in Berlin , and Paris , and all over Europe , and everywhere she travelled and sang she was greeted with adulation by all the crowned heads . Did n't I also hear that she sang in America , too , superbly ? She made a fortune , Mama , you remember , and lives most luxuriously . " But Janie burst into a great shaking roar of laughter , ribald and hating . She pointed a finger at the immobile Laurie , standing there on the hearthrug , with a peculiar gleam upon her face . " Are you trying to tell me , you ninny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Jenny Lind ? " cried Janie , when she could get her breath . " Look at her ! Like a cow in pasture ! You are out of your wits , lad ! " But Angus was stubborn , afire with cold flame . He looked at his mother steadfastly . " Mama , you know I am right . You 've heard her teachers . You 've heard her sing . I 've watched you . You  --  you were entranced . We all were : Mama , " and he clenched his damp hands tightly together in his terrible earnestness , " I beg of you to listen to me . Take her to a clever teacher . Take her to New York . Let others be the judge . " Janie laughed uproariously again . And then she stopped , abruptly . Her eyes slid about to fix themselves on her daughter . She was silent . Again she licked her lips . " What do your teachers at that damn school say about your voice these days , you obstinate wench ? " she demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell your daft brother . " Derision was crude and violent in her tone . But Laurie did not speak . She was still looking at Angus , and the look was hard and watchful . " I can tell you what they said ! " Janie continued , with harsh excitement . " They said she never sings , that when she is finally forced to do so she makes havoc of the sweet ballads , that her voice is like a roaring calf 's under the moon . That is what they said , you zany . " Angus turned and regarded his sister somberly . He said , almost re- !  |p239flectively  : " What can they know , those female chirpers , who have never heard a real voice ? They think a girl 's voice should be sweet and inane , like little bells . How can they judge a voice like Laurie 's , so pure and strong and rich ? Have they ever heard an opera ? Have they ever heard Jenny Lind , as you have done , Mama ? What do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice has the volume , the greatness , the purity . She has the presence for the boards " " Are you suggesting I make my daughter an actress ? An actress ? " exclaimed Janie , grinning with her contempt . But her eyes were cunninglythoughtful . " I am suggesting that you allow some competent authority to hear Laurie , and that if they agree that she has a great voice that you will send her to the best music schools in New York " And with what , my fine planner and spinner of dreams ? " screamed Janie , infuriated as always whenever it was suggested that she spendmoney . Angus slowly fixed his eyes upon her . He said , with dignity : " Then I would be willing to pay for it , Mama . " Again , Janie shrieked with laughter . She rolled her head on her cushions , with her lewd mirth . Angus , very white , waited , until the noisy laughter abated a little . Then he said very quietly : " I have enough to take her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in your hands . Later , perhaps , I can help . But it might be too late . " It was then that Laurie stirred . Her voice , slow , quiet , rich and full of resonance , filled the room . She said : " Mama is right , Angus . It is very foolish of you . I have no voice at all , though I thank you for the compliment . " She paused . Her tone became louder , firmer , but more hurried : " I tell you , I never sing now . I shall never sing again ! " " The besom has more sense than you , Angus , " said Janie , sourly . But rr eyes were still narrowed , still thoughtful , and she still licked the corners of her lips . Her imagination was powerful enough to allow her to hear again Jenny Lind 's magnificent voice , echoing through His Majesty 's Theatre , in London . And now her heart , her wizened nugget ' of a heart , began to beat heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she had been so obstinately rooted . She took a step or two towards Angus . Her young face was fluid again , beautifully violent and moved . Her blue eyes flashed like flame . She said : " I 'll thank you to mind your own business , sir , and keep your silly opinions to yourself . " For a moment he was petrified by her look , by her manner , by her vehemence . He felt a sick pounding in himself . Never had he seen Laurie like this , his gentle silent sister whom he loved so deeply . It was a stranger , an inimical stranger , who repudiated him now , looked at him with bitter scorn and detestation , with accusation and contempt . " Laurie , " he began , holding out his hands , in fear . But she turned away from him with a loathing gesture . She had just reached the hearthrug when they all heard the confused mutter of men below , the opening and shutting of doors , the sound of dragging footsteps , a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " began Janie . She swung her little feet to the floor . She caught up her shawl . She ran to the door and flung it open . She called down angrily : " What is this ? What is the matter ? " And now Stuart 's voice , sullen but loud , came up the well of the dark stairway : " We 've brought home your son , ma'am . Your drunken son . And will you come down and give him a look ? " JANIE flew down the stairs , her skirts sailing behind her . She clutched the bosom of her peignoir . Stuart watched her come . On the lower steps Bertie lay sprawled , with a foolish sleepy grin on his suffused face , his ruddy hair damp and disordered . Robbie stood over him , with a detached expression . A servant had lighted the lamp on the newel post , and its bronze light hovered over the tableau on the stairs . But Janie saw no one but her Benjamin . She rushed to him , then stopped just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furious words began to move Stuart 's tongue , and then he could not speak . For never had he seen such a look on Janie 's face , wizened , still , and full of stark tragedy . She stood there , in her disarray , her slippered feet on the same step that held the lolling head of the grinning Bertie , and was as motionless as a carved figure . Her lips worked ; her thin and freckled throat pulsed ; the hands that held her velvet garments trembled . Now she was an old woman , with red hair that flaunted itself over her stricken eyes . Stuart 's warm heart , so treacherously always at the edge , of melting , now betrayed his anger into pity . He mumbled : " We 've brought him home , Janie . Do n't mind , ma'am . He 's only a lad . Lads do foolish things . "  |p241He  turned to Robbie , and said irritably : " Stop staring like a dolt . Give me a hand with the lad . Under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got legs , not gristle ; you can stand . Put your arm around my shoulder . " He saw Angus at the top of the stairs , and shouted furiously at him : " Come down here , you ! Give us a hand with your brother . Get him to his room . " Angus came slowly down the stairs , proud and silent . He looked at his brother , dangling between Stuart and Robbie . He saw the lolling head , the drooling grimacing lips , the half-closed eyes of drunkenness . lie shuddered . Then he turned to his mother , and his face changed . He put his arm about her stiff but trembling shoulders . " Mama , " he said , " please go upstairs , to Laurie . She must n't see him like this . Mama , it does n't matter . You know what you 've always said : it is just his high spirits . " But Janie , apparently , did not hear him . However , she pushed his rm from her with rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her hands silently over her face . Stuart , with irate eyes sparkling , looked at her , then at Angus . He exclaimed : " Come on , you ! Take his legs . He ca n't stand up , and I 'm damned if I 'm going to sprain my back hauling him up these stairs ! Take his legs ; that 's it . Slowly , now . Up we go . " Struggling , sweating , bumping , staggering , they got Bertie upstairs . alfway up he began to sing , incoherently and with stammerings . It as a gay and ribald song . Once or twice he became aware of his arriers , and he kissed Stuart , and then Robbie , with grateful enthusiasm . Stout feller , " he would mutter , approvingly . " Bit of trouble with the you see . Not responsible . " And then he would burst into loud and rollicking song again , throwing back his head and bawling lustily . He as heavy , well-fed , and seemed all flesh , boneless . His legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished boots glimmering gaily in the lamplight . Just before they reached the top he appeared to recognize Angus , and he burst into huge laughter , which exercise almost unbalanced Stuart rul Robbie who , for a moment , hung precariously , and with teeterings , over the long flight behind them . Bertie 's laughter increased in volumehe continued to stare at Angus ' white strained face and averted eyes . Janie stood below , crouched against the balustrade , her hands still her her face . They carried Bertie into his room , and flung him roughly across his d . It was the handsomest room in the house , with many windows , c softest rug of all , the most pleasant pictures framed on the white walls , and a pleasant fire already burning warmly on the black marble hearth . Robbie lit a lamp . Stuart mopped his steaming face with a dazzling-white kerchief . I le took off his tall hat and flung it on a table . He ran a finger around his choking stock . He exclaimed : " If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blood vessel somewhere , it 'll be a marvel ! Damned young scamp ! He needs a kick in his backside , and a clout in the jaw . " But his rough words , as always , concealed distress . He could not forget Janie , there on the stairs . He fumed . He glared at Bertie , kicked aside one dangling plump leg . He grimaced as he saw the stained striped silk of his own waistcoat . " Dirty puppy , " he muttered , rubbing at Bertie 's droolings with his kerchief . His mouth twitched disgustedly . He stood at the foot of the bed , and cursed Bertie with vigor . But all this was to forget Janie 's face on the stairs . Robbie listened to him with cool amusement . Angus stood near the bed and regarded his drunken brother with bitter moroseness . Stuart glanced at the two young men , then compressed his mouth . He disliked both of them immensely . They were both very thin , and dressed in their funereal black broadcloth . But Robbie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his look of elegance and gentlemanly assurance . Angus , on the other hand , looked like a " damned gravedigger , " as Stuart thought , with considerable vindictiveness . " What do you do with the dog , now ? " he asked sullenly , of Robbie . " We undress him , naturally . " Robbie 's voice was all quiet competence . He hesitated , smiled faintly at his brother Angus . " I 've never asked you before , Angus , but I think I 'd like a little help . " " Not me , this time , " said Stuart . " I 've enough vomit on me now , 1'rt thinking . Careful with him . If I 'm not mistaken , he 's about to puke . " Calmly , Robbie bent and produced the chamber from under the bed and set it on the floor close to Bertie 's lolling head . He and Angus then dragged and pulled at Bertie 's pantaloons , throwing the soiled and fashionable garments onto a chair . These Robbie soon folded neatly in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all serenity . He directed Angus , who obeyed in that grim silence of his . All his actions were remote . He sternly repressed his shrinkings . He was very white . They put Bertie between his cool sheets , after dressing him in his ruffled linen night shirt . There he lay , his handsome hair red and thick on the smooth embroidered pillows , the grin still fixed on his face . But now his eyes were wide open , and their bright blueness was fixed on the lamp . " Ho , it 's night ! " he said with pleased surprise . I lcP243rolled his eyes and looked at Robbie . " Good ole Robbie . Nice boy . Stout Idler . Where 's the day gone , Robbie ? " " In your cups , " said his imperturbable brother . Robbie came close to him and smiled his chill smile . " How do you feel ? Head ache ? " " Damnably , " said Bertie , after a moment 's serious consideration . " Stomach like a ship at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad and happy smile . " Pipe all hands . Southeaster comin ' up . See her pitch , lads . " His face changed , became absorbed and serious . Robbie promptly lifted the china chamber , graced as it was with a wreath of pink roses , and held it near his brother 's mouth . He was none too soon . Stuart retreated to a window and opened it , letting in the cold December air . He closed his nostrils in nauseated disgust . He put his head outside the window , the better not to hear the ugly retching in the room . He looked clown at the dark street , saw the flickering lamps glimmering across the cobbled pavements . The stark trees outside were silvered with the moon . But still Stuart could not shut out the memory of Janie 's ace . He returned to the room . Robbie had left with the chamber . Angusas standing as Stuart had left him , near the bed . He was gazing down t his brother with his pale closed look which told nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pillows , and panted , white and drained , with ; den lips and sunken eyes . The room reeked of sour and vomited whiskey . " Do n't look so damned censorious ! " said Stuart , impatiently . " It 's not matter of life and death , Angus . The lad 's got a good heart . We must ake allowances for high spirits . He 's young , y'know , and thinks it rodigiously manly of him -- But Angus only regarded his brother with bitter steadfastness , and id quietly : " He 's profligate and wicked . He 's a waster and a drunkard. c brings shame to this house , and heartbreak to his mother , and disaceto his sister . There is evil in him , and godlessness and faithlessnessd impiety . " Stuart stared at him with repugnance and anger . " Do n't talk like fool , " he said roughly . " Or a bloody parson . Damn you all , anyway ! y father used to say that every Scotsman was either a lawyer , a drunk-d or a deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Who are you to dge this lad , you white-lipped wee minister ' ? How do you know hat drives a man to drink ? " Angus raised his gray rigorous eyes and regarded Stuart with sombers . And those eyes shone in the lamplight like granite . " Why should Bertie drink ? " he asked , sternly . " What drives him ? He is our mother 's darling . He has unlimited pocket-money . He is given everything he wants . Nothing is denied him . " Bertie , during all this , had been panting noisily on his pillows . Now at Angus ' words he smiled brilliantly , and with childish affability . I 1c nodded his head slowly , and pursed up his lips . " Right , right , " he agreed , in the soft and slurring voice of agreeable drunkenness . " Quite right . Everything he wants . Nothing denied . ' Quite , quite right . Everybody loves Bertie . Bertie has heart of gold . Bertie wants nothing . " Suddenly he laughed and laughed , wallowing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bacchanalian riot in the room . Robbie , in the meantime , had returned to the room , and had replaced the chamber in a handy spot . He wiped his hands fastidiously on his kerchief and glanced at Bertie with impersonal fondness . " Better now ? " he asked , when Bertie paused for breath in his peals of joy . Bertie immediately became serious again . His eyes were gentle as they fixed themselves on Robbie . Then , all at once , they filled with easy tears . He lifted his hand and Robbie took it , chafing it in his small dry palms , " Robbie , " blubbered Bertie , " you 're ma ain brother , are ye not ? " Now his accents roughened , and the old forgotten dialect came to his swollen lips . " I am that , " said Robbie , soothingly . " Now , be a good lad and try to sleep . " But Bertie was suddenly excited . " Yell not turn from me , Robbie ? With the drink and all ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no guid reason for't . Ye understand , Robbie ? " " Of course , of course . Now , rest ye , Bertie . It 'll do you good . " But Bertie could not be restrained . He began to sob , clutching Robbie ' hand with a wet despair . He raved . He accused himself . He wept . His excitement rose , while Stuart watched him in alarm , and saw how darn that pale and swollen face was , and what an ominous color was spreading , through his large full lips. just then Janie entered , creeping in , huddling in her shawl as if mos awfully cold . But her livid face was both tight and drawn , and filled with virulence . Her green eyes darted viciously and warily at Stuart and then at Angus , and lastly at Robbie . She came to the bed , and sat down abruptly at Bertie 's left . She caught his hand from Robbie . She clasped it to her breast , and glared at them all like a sharp and deadly weasel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ,  --  all , " she cried . " Leave me to my lad . You 're noneP245of you doing him good , with your japes and your taunts . The poor lad ! I lc wants to be alone with his mother ! " Stuart 's first reaction was anger , and then he saw her despair , her hopeless defensiveness , her shame and her fear . " Calm yourself , Janie . We 've done what we could for him . " He hesitated . He was full of pity for her , for this new Janie , so cold , so wretched , so broken-hearted . For he knew with the strong intuition of his primitive nature that Janie had at last realized what her son had become , and that she could no longer hide the hideous knowledge from herself . He said , impulsively : " I 'll help you , Janie . I 'll do what I can -- But she screamed at him , her face malignant with remembered hatred and frustration : " We 'll have no help from you , Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bairns to face the world alone ! " " Now , Mother , " said Robbie . His voice was quiet , but it had authority . " You should be grateful to Stuart , who found Bertie and brought him home . " But Janie 's shame was made only more violent at this . She waved one rm stiffly but menacingly at her cousin . " Be off with you ! " she shrilled . Disgusted indignation and compassion warred in Stuart . He pickedhis hat . Robbie shook his head at him slightly , and with amused ology . Angus seemed fallen into some dull despondency and unawaressof his own . He was like some dark ghost unseen by the others , d unseeing . Then indignation got the better of Stuart . He pointed at the recumbent Iiertie , and his eyes sparkled with excited temper upon Janie . " Look at your son , ma'am , and blame no other but yourself for his isgraceful condition ! It 's pampered him , you have , and coddled him , ntil there 's no manhood in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , my good woman , and none else , no matter where , u 'd like to put it , in your damnable evil humor . " I lc paused . His voice had thickened with his rage . " I brought your fasted son home in my own carriage , hauling him from his den like sack of flour . I 've been puked upon by your son , and strained all my rgans . I 'd thought to come to this house today to plead with you to lease your blessed son , Angus , from your commands , and allow him pursue his natural bent for medicine . I 'd planned to plead with you to flow me to assist him , to give him help offered by certain personages Ito can aid him profitably . And yet , for this , I receive nothing but stilts ! " Angus had stirred suddenly at Stuart 's words . He lifted his heavy gray eyes and stared at him strangely . In the wavering lamplight , his face appeared to dwindle and shrink . Janie stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful than her glinting eyes . She cowered beside Bertie , his hand still clenched to her breast . Bertie had been muttering in his drunken delirium , then in the silence which followed Stuart 's words , he spoke out , loudly and clearly , with bubblings of mirth . " I 'm a wise fellow ! " he cried . " The wisest in the world ! You all want something . Everlastingly you want something . But not Bertie Cauder . He is the wise fellow . He wants nothing at all , never anything at all , the darling ! " They were suddenly silent , looking at him . He had fallen abruptly into a deep sleep . His breathing was harsh . But he was smiling . All at once , Stuart 's anger was gone . He felt tired and heavy . He looked at them each , slowly , with frustrated weariness , and irascibility . He saw the chill Robbie , who looked at him with the faintest of smiles . He saw the gloomy withdrawn Angus . He saw Janie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping Bertie . He felt something inimical in the whole atmosphere , something which rejected him with contempt . Then , in quite a shaken tone , he said : " You are a cold , grim and sec tive people , you Scots . " He pointed first at Angus : " It 's always stiffeni your moral backbones you are , with your frightful religion , or plotti and brooding in your cold rooms against better men . " He turned to Janie and Robbie again . " There 's something terrible about you , too much for the likes of me . " He went from the room . He walked down the corridor . A door wad open , and on the threshold stood the young Laurie with her golde smooth hair and her still blue eyes . Stuart hesitated . They looked a each other in the dimly lit silence . Stuart wanted to speak to the gir but he could not . He went down the stairway . He had almost reaches the bottom step when he felt a touch on his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite startled when he saw it was only Robbie . " Do n't mind , " said the young man quietly . " Mama 's upset . Oh , dam it , I 'm not apologizing for her impoliteness . You know Mama , Stuar As for Angus  --  " And he shrugged . Now he smiled a little . " You find it all amusing , I presume ? " said Stuart bitterly . " You , wit your smiles , and your confounded coolness . There 's no heart in you . " Robbie shrugged again . He said : " I do n't find it particularly amusing. , I very seldom laugh at anything . " He smiled again . " I 'm like the Ephe-P247sian philosopher , Stuart , who laughed only when he saw asses eating thistles , in the midst of grass . " Stuart stared at him . His thick black brows drew together . He went away without speaking again . Axons was now one of the eight bookkeepers and office workers employed by the Grandeville Supreme Emporium , having served his appenticeshipin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop had been enlarged to house several high desks and tables , where , tinder flickering oil lamps suspended from the ceiling , the clerks labored at the ledgers and wrote letters . Angus was not yet in charge , though Stuart was preparing him for that position . He worked doggedly , in remote and courteous silence , and was much feared , disliked and respectedby his less august associates . It was nothing for him to work to nine and even ten o'clock at night , all alone , his small brown head bent over the ledgers , his neat pen adding or subtracting rapidly , the white pages turning methodically . If his stern and austere face took on a drained and exhausted look , it also increased in quiet harshness . Sam Berkowitz , whose own office led from the main office , would often pas , . the young clerk and stand near him , unseen , and watch him with sad ' , , , , yes and furrowed face . Christmas came and went . This was one of the periods when Stuart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other periods , it would coninueuntil some chance encounter in the home of a mutual friend , or a meeting on the street , or in the shops , brought them face to face and forced them to speak politely to each other . They would greet each other quite imperturbably , and with genuine smiles of pleasure , and an affableconversation which ignored past unpleasantness would ensue . ' Mien Stuart would call casually upon his cousin , or she would call uponim and his wife , and all would be forgiven and forgotten , until the next time . Stuart had ostentatiously refused to allow his we to include his namen her gifts to Janie at Christmas , though he permitted her and hisle daughter to call upon the Cauder family at New Year 's , the **27;878;TOOLONG of the Scots . When Marvina returned , all golden smiles and placid simpers , Stuart questioned her closely about the behavior of his cousin . ( He was always forgetting that his wife was a fool , who never found anything unusual or disturbing . ) But Marvina would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil and kind . Stuart fumed . Stuart did not carry his rages at Janie to her children . If he met Robbie accidentally , or Angus in the shops or the offices , he might be somewhat stiff and stately . But he would not mention their mother to them , nor show them his displeasure . However , he had been deeply wounded this time , and so it was that for several weeks he did not speak to Angus , and elaborately ignored his existence . The " row " on this occasion had not been confined to Janie and himself . Her children had shared in it , which was unique . They had heard.him ordered from her house like a whining beggar , had heard their mutual vows never to be aware of each other 's presence in the world again . For dignity 's sake , if nothing else , it was necessary for Stuart to be lofty and cold towards Angus , whom he genuinely disliked now , anyway . The frightful North winter was upon Grandeville again , to last we into April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven fe high , bordered every shovelled walk . A layer of mingled ice and snow well-packed and beaten , covered the cobbled streets for at least twely inches . Every roof was weighted and thatched with blazing white , ove which flowed the blue smoke from the embedded chimneys . An iro cold , an almost constant and violent wind , engulfed the city . Every lc days a blizzard would blow up , swirling , blinding , the air choking ! filled with particles of snow like white sand , which cut and flayed th flesh of those unfortunate enough to be abroad . Huge dunes , also san like , would pile up against fences and houses and in open places , carve and rippled by the winds . Then would come an interval of fiery hl cold , utterly calm and silent , with skies incredibly still , and the sno so dazzling that the eye could not look upon it without tears . Every boil would lie immured and petrified in banks of whiteness , the windo blind with white frost , and only the purplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these warrens there moved a life at all . But , during the bright and bitter day , sleighs would appc gliding along the rutted streets with gay jinglings , the occupants cover to the noses with fur robes . The city stirred under its tomb of ice a snow , and emerged , shivering , and went about its business . To ne corners , these winters were unbearable . They lived as far from the grayP249and ossified river as possible , for from those desolate and bleak surfaces came winds like knives and scimitars , flaying unwary skin . It was incredible to almost everyone that summer had ever smiled upon this country , and when the first days of spring appeared with warming sunshine and streets gushing with melted snow , a kind of hysteria seized upon all the inhabitants . For nearly seven months they had endured agonies of cold , of unremitting gales , of blizzards and black cracking nights , of constant struggles to keep warm in their houses . Then , in late April , perhaps , if fate was kind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between heaps of dirty snow , and , if one had acute eyesight , one could discern that buds were actually swelling on the rigid trees . The sight of a robin was good for two columns in the local newspapers . The skies would soften , grow misty and even faintly tender , and though snowstorms would blow up under swiftly darkening clouds , and the windows would again show a layer of frost , one could confidently declare that winter was about over . In May the snow would be entirely gone , except for plaques of blackish ice against the houses which faced north . By the first of June one could rest assured that there would be no more snow until October , and the citizens would leave their houses and plan feverishly for the summer . The winters , however , were so melancholy , so blackly depressing and full of iron hopelessness , that any quarrels , misunderstandings or enmitiesbegun in the seven desolate months would inevitably have to wait for the thaws , to be forgotten . So it was that not until late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did Stuart became aware of Angus Cauder . Even then , he would not have become aware if Angus had not actually entered his office . Stuart was in an ill temper . He had just recently returned from New York , where he had examined a new shipment of laces and velvets and fathers and bric-a-brac from France . The shipment had been in order , nd the freight charges had not been too outrageous . But shortly before aving for New York , Stuart had sworn to himself , and to Sam , that his xpenses should be as economical as possible , that he would attend only his business , and return promptly . No ladies , no dances , no festivities , o jewelry , no extravagance . Sam had gravely approved , though with not much hope . His pessimism was justified , though Stuart had not yet rought him the bad news . But Stuart 's dignity , his refusal to discuss he journey , his stately manners and his conduct in shutting himselfp in his office for hours at a time , justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more florid than usual , and bore the marks of strong dissipation in the dark circles about his eyes and in the furrows about his mouth . Moreover he limped a little , and could be heard swearing painfully behind his door . There was a suffused and gritty look about him , a swollen look , also . His disposition matched . Angus could not have chosen a more inauspicious time to invade Stuart 's office . But he saw that it was indeed a bad time , for Stuart , flushed , heavy of eye , looked at him with impersonal rage . His right foot , unbooted , was extended upon a chair . The ruffles at his neck were open , as if he had been stifling . His flowered waistcoat was unbuttoned . There was an atmosphere of pain , heat and disorder all about him . Angus , who knew nothing about Stuart 's escapades in New York , believed , with the egotism and conceit of the narrow and self-absorbed man , that the black sparkle of distaste and annoyance in Stuart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellicose , was a personal violence caused only by the sight of himself . " Well ? " exclaimed Stuart . His face wrinkled spasmodically as he felt a sharp pain in his hot and throbbing foot . Angus was taken aback . That wrinkling of countenance , he was certain , was caused by his advent , and he was alarmed . But he said with proud formality : " I 'd like to speak to you for a moment , Cousin Stuart . " " Ah ! You would , eh ? " said Stuart , with loud irascibility . " Well , speak up , then . " But Angus discovered that his throat was suddenly dry and tight . It was always hard for him to speak to almost anyone . Stuart , staring at him irately , decided that he liked Angus less than ever . " Pity him , " eh ? What damned nonsense on the part of old Grundy ! " Well , speak up . I 'm a busy man , " said Stuart . He added , with heavy sarcasm : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it is , I can save your breath . You wo n't get it . And that 's final . " Angus said nothing . But an expression almost of torment passed over his face . Stuart regarded him , fulminating . But his subtle instinct w aroused . What was wrong with the fool ? Why did he stand there , if condemned to the gibbet ? Stuart scowled . " Well ! Well ! " he crie " Say your say and be off with you . I 've work to do even if you have n't . Angus put his hand on the high back of Stuart 's desk . For some reason Stuart 's wandering and glittering eye was caught by that gesture . H saw how the knuckles rose whitely in that spare lean hand so heavil veined . Everything about the taut fingers suggested misery and silt : repression and pain . P251Now Stuart heard his voice , faint but firm , not pleading , but full of quiet hauteur : " Cousin Stuart , I believe I owe you an apology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and insensitive . " Stuart raised irritable eyebrows satirically . " An apology , eh ? Well , that 's very nice , very nice indeed . And very civil of you , I 'm sure . But what the hell do you want to apologize for ? " he added , on a rising tone of impatience . " Are you referring to my suggestion that you study with I ) r . Dexter , and your impertinent refusal , and your insults ? If so , I have forgotten it all . Is that enough for you ? " The gouty foot was giving him hell now . His features screwed up with sharp pain . His glance at Angus was fuming . " You have n't reconsidered ? If so , I wish to inform you that I am no longer interested . Go to your precious mama . " Angus flushed . He flung back his head with embittered pride . " No , Cousin Stuart , it is not for myself that I have come here , to hear your ungenerousremarks . " He hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know you to be the most generous of gentlemen . The most kind . You  --  you believe that I have forgotten your past kindness to me . And to my sister . I have not . There have been misunderstandings . But it is not even of that that I wish to speak . " Stuart saw , with acuteness , what agonies this little speech had caused this rigorous young man , for he knew that to such a temperament apology , admission of wrong , was pure torture . For always Angus lived and thought and said only that which he considered righteous and justified . But Stuart was softened in spite of his physical pain and his dislike for Angus . " Well , that 's all very nice , " he grumbled . " I accept your apology , then . Is that all you wish ? " Angus hesitated . He was nerving himself supremely to speak again . He looked at Stuart fixedly . " No , not all , Cousin Stuart . I wanted to talk to you about my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the little lass , then ? " Stuart 's attention as distracted from his pulsing foot . He stared at Angus with interest . Angus hesitated again . The hand on the desk clenched as he forced himself to speak . " There is nothing wrong , sir . " Always inarticulate , he desperately searched among betraying and unfamiliar words for the roper expressions . Stuart had a mind 's eye view of Angus picking up word after word , discarding it with despair , sorting among baskets of fathers as a color-blind man might sort among colored pebbles whosearp edges cut his fumbling fingers . The older man discerned that it must be he who must suggest , if he were to know what Angus wanted . He said with some shrewdness : " Well , if Laurie is not ill , and there is nothing wrong , you need have no worry . Unless you think all is not well with the girl ? " Angus looked at him with flashing but reserved eagerness . " Yes , that is it , sir . All is not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Stuart frowned thoughtfully . " Yes , " almost whispered Angus , " she is unhappy . " " But why ? She looks like a healthy little baggage . Too tall for her age , perhaps . But a lovely face . " Stuart paused , and then he added softly : " But a lovely face . " He wondered why he felt such a sad pang at the thought of Laurie , and such a tenderness . With more gentleness than he had used before he said : " What troubles you about Laurie , Angus ? You were always so fond of each other . She trusted you . " Angus could not answer . His head dropped ; Stuart could not see his face . But he sighed . Stuart leaned back in his chair , and even more gently than before he asked : " She does not trust you now ? That is it ? " " Yes , " said Angus , in a low tone . " You know why she does not trust you ? " Angus looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quite firmly : " I have some idea . I believe she thinks I should have gone into medicine , instead of into the shops . When I was young I used to speak to her about it , and make my plans . Laurie does not know that sometimes  --  circumstances  --  preventone from continuing with his dreams and hopes . " And now he looked at Stuart with desperate and wretched defiance . Stuart shook his head . " I am not going to urge you again , Angus . I shall not argue with you about it . You know what you wish to do , better than I. " " Thank you , " whispered Angus . He was silent a little . Then he said , dully : " But Laurie is still very young . She does not understand . And I- .. I have no words with which to tell her . I never have any words . Laurie  --  is a little hard . She would not understand even if I could explain . Laurie , I am afraid , is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her love that makes her selfish  --  for me . " " I see , " said Stuart thoughtfully . " An intolerant little piece , eh ? " He gazed at Angus with compassionate curiosity . " So , because Laurie believes you have  --  violated  --  yourself , she does not trust you . She isp253vexed with you . I always suspected that Laurie was unbending . There is something of you in her , Angus . You Scots are always like iron . Never mind . To surrender to the inflexible is to add rigor to their tyranny . You must do what you wish , Angus . " He was more curious than ever . He waited for Angus to speak . But Angus only looked at him with sad somberness . Stuart , his intuition putting words into his mouth , went on : " So Laurie does not trust you because she feels you have betrayed yourself . She does not confide in you any longer . Worse , her character is changing under her distrust , and her withdrawal from you . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now Angus ' coldness dissolved . He was all pathetic eagerness and dim fire . " You have expressed it , Cousin Stuart . " Stuart was quite excited now . He even put the swollen foot down on the floor and was not conscious of any twinge . " And this does nothing good for Laurie . I can see that . But what good do you desire for Laurie , Angus , which she will not heed if it comes from you ? " Angus was trembling . He left the desk . Unbidden , he sat down on a stiff chair near Stuart . He was very close to the older man . He seemed to vibrate with his repressed and inarticulate passion . He leaned towards Stuart . His pale cold features were working strangely . " Cousin Stuart , you have heard Laurie sing ? " Stuart frowned , considering . Then he brightened . " I have , that ! A lovely , lovely voice ! And so strong and pure , for so young a girl . But I understand she has teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus leaned even closer to him . In his extremity he put his hand un Stuart 's big knee . Now Stuart 's compassion was very strong . " But Laurie will not sing at her school . Her teachers have given her up . She will not sing at home . She never sings any more . " " She does not sing , eh ? And she will not sing because she is unhappy . There is a grimness in Laurie , Angus . I can see you know that . She is unhappy because of you . Because she is defiant and wretched . Am I right ? " " I believe so . I know it is so , Cousin Stuart ! " Stuart sighed . " But you can not give in to Laurie 's obstinacy and childish ignorance . That is understood . So what is it you wish me to do ? " Angus ' head dropped again . He looked broken and sick . He began to : ak in a mournful and very tired murmur : " There is no love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves her but me . AndP254she will have none of me now . So she will become harder and harder , and more withdrawn , and more obstinate , Stuart . It  --  it will be a kind of death for Laurie , for by nature she is loving as well as strong . " He lifted his eyes and fixed them with desperate pleading upon Stuart . " It will be the death of Laurie 's beautiful voice , Stuart . And it is a voice that should be given to the world . For Laurie 's sake , as well as the world 's . I  --  I can not bear to see what is so wonderful in Laurie die . " Stuart , you know that Laurie has always been very fond of you . She has never spoken much of you at home because of  --  Mama . But I know that she is fond of you , and admires you prodigiously . You could have influence with Laurie . She would listen to you . If  --  if you could urge her to take your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would do what you would ask . " Stuart studied him in silence . Then very softly he said : " What is it I would ask , Angus ? " Again eagerness flushed into Angus ' eyes and cheeks . " That  --  that she should sing for some great teacher you would procure for her , and that if that teacher 's opinion was that Laurie had a wonderfulvoice , worth cultivating , that she should study with that teacher , or go to any school suggested . " Stuart was astounded . He leaned back in his chair . He frowned . But Angus went on , the words now quite tumbling from his lips : " I do not mean that Laurie 's voice should be cultivated just to give pleasure to her family and friends . I mean it should be cultivated for the world . Laurie could be another Jenny Lind . Perhaps greater than Jenny Lind ! " Stuart 's head whirled . He put up his hand . " Wait a moment , Angus . You are suggesting that Laurie be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't believe it of you , Angus ! Where is your piety , your religion ? " And he smiled mockingly . He could not help that thrust , but he was immediately sorry when he saw Angus ' sudden misery . He continued : " I am surprised , Angus . Do not heed me . But you are suggesting that Laurie be an actress , and you know what the world thinks of actresses . I have seen , and known , many in New York . " He smiled with happy reminiscence . " No , Cousin Stuart , " said Angus , with desperate quietness , " I ant not suggesting that Laurie be an actress : Jenny Lind is no actress . She sings in the wonderful operas . She is a great artist . That is what I wish for Laurie . " Stuart was more confounded than ever . He tried to smile . " You haveP255no way to judge , Angus . You can not know if Laurie has a voice like Jenny Lind 's . " But Angus said quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a man of the world . " Stuart , in his simplicity , was flattered . He bridled a little . " We wo n't discuss that , Angus , " he said , almost with coyness . " Let that be for a moment . " He was silent , trying to recall the full measure of Laurie 's voice . It was ridiculous , of course . Most young girls had sweet voices . 1 Ic would not confess it to Angus , but he had never heard Jenny Lind sing , his own taste running rather to music halls and gay soubrettes , whose voices were not usually of the best . He was forced to compare Laurie 's strong pure voice with the rather hoarse but merry croaking of actresses in provocative tights . He did not know exactly what an opera was , either . Perhaps operas preferred voices like Laurie 's , to their own loss . Did opera singers wear tights ? He frowned . If Laurie wore tights , and thus attracted the attention of predatory gentlemen , then he , Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any hopeful gentleman who found Laurie 's legs attractive . He said somewhat angrily : " I ca n't understand you , Angus . Would you enjoy seeing your sister in  --  in tights ? Revealed to the whole world ? " Angus was confused . He stammered : " Mama did not mention tights when she spoke of Jenny Lind . She spoke only of her voice , and Miss Lind 's beauty , and the marvel of her fascination . " Stuart saw that his reputation as a man of the world was in serious jeopardy . He sat upright again , with a stately expression . " Oh , jenny Lind , " he said loftily . " I had forgotten Jenny Lind . Certainlythat lovely lady does not wear tights . It would be beneath her . So it 's another Jenny Lind you would have Laurie ? Without tights ? " " I suppose so , " admitted Angus , still confused . Stuart remembered something . He said alertly : " Apparently you ave discussed this with your mama . She was not revolted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean behind footlights , as an opera singer ? " Angus faced him fully . In a hard and bitter voice , he said : " Mama understands that Miss Lind makes a fortune , Cousin Stuart . Miss Lind as sung for the crowned heads of Europe , for the President of the nited States . She has an almost royal entourage . Mama listened to me cry closely , and with consideration . " Stuart was all intent interest . He smiled . " Well then , you have no cd to trouble yourself . Your mama will procure the proper teacher pass judgment on Laurie 's voice . " ip256Angus twisted his hands together . Then , in low and halting words he told Stuart of the scene between his mother and his sister , and himself . Stuart listened , acutely absorbed in the stumbling recital . When Angus had finished , overcome with misery , Stuart 's thoughts whirled rapidly . " This is a very ticklish thing , Angus , " he said , after a long consideringinterval . " Laurie has asked you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . That is to be expected , when one remembersthat she must recall the fortune Miss Lind is accumulating . And the fame and glory . However , your mama is not quite convinced . Her doubt is enhanced by Laurie 's obstinacy , and her repudiation of you . " If I should go to the enormous expense of bringing a teacher from New York here to listen to Laurie , there is always the probability that Laurie would refuse to sing , or refuse to accept any verdict that was favorable . " Angus held out his hands to Stuart , and the gesture was infinitely pathetic . " She will not refuse , Cousin Stuart . Not if you ask it . She is fond of you . And  --  you must not mention my name in the matter . That would be fatal . " Stuart stared at Angus ' moved and tremulous face . He bit his lip reflectively . " You think I could have any influence on Laurie ? Perhaps you are right . " He paused . " But suppose the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need years of voice cultivation . Possibly in New York . Your mama , you think , would be willing to go to this expense ? " Angus was silent for a moment or two . His features became grim and more embittered . Then he said : " No . She would not be willing . I know that . Not even if she were convinced that Laurie would make a fortune with her voice . I  --  I almost believe that  --  that she would frustrate Laurie . " Now he flushed crimson . He flung up his head . " Not that Mama would mean to be cruel ! Please believe that . It  --  it is just that Mama is a female , and might not understand about the operas . She might believe that it would be  --  immoral  --  for Laurie . " " Oh , do n't be a damned fool ! " shouted Stuart , coloring with his fury , i " You know bloody well that she would oppose Laurie because she hated the lass ! You know she has always hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You are a fool , man ! And a liar to yourself . " He con  --  tinued , with increasing violence : " I thought you meant to talk to nie man to man . If you think you can come over me with your sickly pietiesP257and your disgusting loyalties to your mother , then you can be off and never bother me again ! " Angus sprang from his chair . He retreated a pace or two from Stuart . I le almost turned and ran from the room . But he stopped himself . His love was greater than his outrage . Stuart glared at him . He burst into nasty laughter . " Your delicate mama might think it immoral , ' eh ? " he exclaimed . " Why , you young imbecile ! What do you know about your mama ? You have some maudlin painted-glass picture of her in your mind , or it pleases your confounded vanity to have such a portrait , and to believe it . " He got heavily to his feet , and winced at the agony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous outrage . " Take your fairy stories away , and be damned to you ! Immoral , ' indeed ! I wo n't have a man about me who lies to himself ! Let us be honest , curse you . If you do n't know what your mama is , I can forgive you . But you are no child . You know what she is , or you blind yourself to the knowledge . I can pity ignorance ; I can not forgive wilful blind-ness . " He fully expected Angus to leave him now . But Angus only stood there , shaking , looking at him with despair and agony , with overwhelmingshame . Stuart made a violent gesture with his whole right arm . " I am sorry or you , Angus , for what you are . You love your sister or you 'd never ave stood there like that , while I told you the truth about your mother . es , I am sorry for you . " He paused for breath . His treacherous heart as melting again , for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s weakening sadness . He tried to male his voice stern and harsh when e continued : " You came to me to ask me to help Laurie . I have not said I would ot . I have asked you if your mother would help your sister . You say to would not . Now then , suppose that I brought such a teacher to your ster , and the verdict was good . Suppose , then , I offered to send Lauriea school of music and voice culture in New York , and your mother fused to allow her to go ? What would you suggest then ? " Angus half turned from him . Stuart could see his bowed head , his thin till trembling shoulders . Then Angus said , in a faint and muffled voice : " When Mama is convinced that Laurie will make a fortune with her sire , and the teacher has told her so , then Mama will not refuse . There ould be too much money "  | " Ah , " said Stuart , and then was silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama would not advance the money . She  --  she says she does not have it . But she would allow you to  --  to spend it , Stuart . " " Doubtless . Doubtless . " Stuart 's voice was hard and sardonic . He sat down again . He tapped on the desk with the fingers of one of his big strong hands . He regarded Angus ' averted face and body with increasing compassion . He said : " You have asked me for a great deal , Angus . Have you any idea what this would cost me ? " Angus turned fully to him . Now his face was white and proud again . His gray eyes shone like frozen stone . " It would not be for long , Cousin Stuart . And I would repay you . You see , I am to marry Miss Gretchen Schnitzel when she is seventeen years old , which will be in about a year and a half . Her father has given his consent . " Incredulous , aghast , Stuart fell back into his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The devil you say ! " he ex  --  claimed , thickly . " The devil you say ! " Angus was prouder than ever . He flung up his head , and replied . steadily : " It is quite true , Cousin Stuart . Our betrothal will be announce  --  in June , when Miss Gretchen is sixteen . We shall marry a year later . can then repay you for any expenses you advance for Laurie . " But Stuart was furious again . " Do you actually mean to say that yo will marry that repulsive , lardy , squat young female , you , Angus Cauder ? That  --  that German creature , with the disgusting and odio parents ? The tanners ? " Angus was silent . But his proud and haughty eyes did not leave Stuart 's face . " Where is your pride ? " cried Stuart , still incredulous , still unwillin to believe , still enormously concerned . He could not endure the though " Where is your honor , your self-respect ? What has this young fema but money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no charm She is ugly , hideous . She is the proper daughter of her parents . An . tanners ! My God ! If she had beauty of person , one might overlook h  --  parents , and the tanneries . But she has nothing at all ! My God , Angus ! He got to his feet again , and limped over to the petrified . Angus. put his hand on the young man 's shoulder , and he shook him vigo ously . " Angus . Look at me . Tell me it is a farce , a lie . Angus , I cane . bear it . After all , you are my kinsman . " P259But Angus quietly removed Stuart 's hand , and faced the older man . " It is not a lie , Cousin Stuart . And I must say I take offense at your remarks about Miss Gretchen . " Stuart stood there helplessly , his hands at his sides , his face wrinkling . I le shook his head over and over , numbly . Then he said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus compressed his pale lips . He answered , at last : " I intend to marry Miss Gretchen , Stuart . " Stuart became excited again . " But why , why ? In God 's name , why ? " Angus was silent . Then Stuart had a stunning thought . He caught Angus by the arms . His expression had become terrible . " It 's your mother , is n't it ? Angus , it is your mother 's doing ? " Angus tried to break free , but Stuart held him with painful strength . " I resent your questions , Stuart . It is none of your affair . " The youngman 's voice was faint but steady . " And , if you please , I should be gladif you would release me . " Again , Stuart 's hands dropped . He was very grim . Then he limped back to his chair and fell into it weakly . He put up his hand to cover his eyes . He said : " I see it is all no use . Go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher for her . We must wait for the decision . " He dropped his hand . Angus was still there , looking at him . " Oh my Cod ! " cried Stuart , overcome . " Oh , may God have mercy on you , you wretched young fool ! Go away , for God 's sake . It 's sickening you are , o me ! " After Angus had gone , Stuart was left alone with his murderous and assionate thoughts . He whispered over and over to himself , beating on is desk with his clenched fists : " Oh , the besom ! The black-hearted bitch ! The horrible bitch ! " OFTEN , on Friday night , Stuart would go to Sam Berkowitz ' house . When he went to that house , it was usually because he was sick to death , wildered , dimly frightened and lost . Or when he was fulminating with sneer , and on the search for a sympathetic ear and kind concern . He did m ii find Father Houlihan 's company , on these occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's eternal loving-kindness andP260eternal wisdom and mercy that he irritated , rather than soothed , Stuart , who saw too many instances to the contrary . He preferred , then , when full of impotent rage , to go to Sam 's house , where melancholy lived and patience was leavened with sadness and wit and brooding question . Sam would listen to his raging and incoherentdiatribes , sometimes faintly smiling , often sorrowful , and he would nod his head silently , smoking or gazing steadily at a little point just to the right of Stuart 's head . Then , when Stuart was quiet for sheer lack of breath , Sam would open his Scriptures and read . Stuart did not always understand , but he felt soothed by the cries of the prophets , the laments of Job , the vehemences of Elijah , the sternness of Isaiah . Here was wisdom , pain , sorrow or rebellion from the hearts of the old prophets , and they were nearer the turbulent heart of the Celt than the sweet hopefulnessof the New Testament saints . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon being carried or helped downstairs on Friday nights , where she could preside over her table and light the candles . Earlier , from her bedroom , she would relay the intricacies of Jewish cooking to the small German maid who bustled in the kitchen . Mrs. Berkowitz was especially insistenton the nights when Stuart came . He would watch her as she stood behind her candlesticks , tremulous with age and illness , so tiny , so gnarled and old . He would listen to her murmuring her prayers and her blessings behind the lighted candles , her wizened hands over her facer sometimes a tear or two dropping between her fingers . The candle ! would bloom in the darkness of the warm little room , and Mrs. Berkwitz ' frail and trembling voice would rise in strange words of prayer over the yellow radiance . This ancient and mysterious ritual would kindle another light in the Irishman 's uneasy and violent heart , and his of Celtic blood would be stirred unbearably , as if in nameless reme brance . His strong Celtic imagination would see similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world , following tit waning light of the sun , carrying the illumination into the darkness the earth turned . The trail of the lighted candles was like a chain awakening stars , full of message , of faith , of eternal hope . A thousan thousand dark nights might come , with oppression and fear and Brea and madness , but the candles would stand there , frail but - dauntles like voices of comfort calling to brother and brother across the border of every land , affirming their faith in God , their remembrance of His mercy and love , their belief in ultimate peace and brotherhood . P261Though he had no faith at all , and really no hope or belief in anything , tit uart found a deep and mystical comfort in the lighting of the candles , which not only were an affirmation of God , but a light to the heart and lie eyes of those who sat about the tables . There would be a stiff white loth on the Berkowitz ' table , and newly polished silver , and crystal glasses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , warm and white in the light of the candles . The fire on the hearth , the candles , the seductive odors of boiled chicken and hot yellow soup and dark old wine would give Stuart a sense of timelessness and strength , and he would look about the closed room with the tired satisfaction of one who had found refuge . Mrs. Berkowitz , with her kerchief over her head , and her tiny black eyes twinkling , and her worn face smiling eagerly , knew little English . But she would listen to the grave voice of her son and to Stuart 's angry heated words with the greatest of wisdom . Stuart knew that he must not speak , however disturbed he was , until dinner was done . By that time much of his anger and misery had abated , and he could discuss matters with Sam with more calm , and less intolerence . He would look at Sam 's brown and furrowed face with the tight quiet lips , the gentle wise brown eyes , and his more infuriated exclamations would die away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been very foolish , that he had given significance to things which did not matter . He came , on this Friday evening , still sore and wretched and infuriated rom his interview with Angus . Sam , after one look at his dark and wisted face , led him into the small dining-room without speaking . Then c went for his mother , carrying her downstairs in his arms , while her yes eagerly searched for Stuart . They talked of nothing but casual trivialities during the m al , while rs . Berkowitz anxiously filled Stuart 's plate over and over with yellow oodles and chicken . She was firmly convinced that he had a poor appetite and needed nourishing . Only when he could eat no more would he subside , with a sly smile of satisfaction . She was very tired tonight , so Sam carried her upstairs again while e feebly cried blessings upon the guest over her son 's shoulder . The little maid departed with the dishes and brushed off the white cloth . A February storm was rising . Stuart could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draperies stirred in the bitter gale , and from me crevice under a door came the sharp whisper of icy cold . He drew ide a curtain and peered out into the thick darkness . By the flickeringp262light of a street lamp he saw the whirlpool of little white flakes rushing beyond the faint yellow circle which that lamp cast against the furious background . And then even that struggling circle was almost obliterated by the thickness of the snowflakes . It was a bad night . Within an hour or two the streets would be drifted with hard white dunes , and the air would cut into the flesh like knives . Not a soul was abroad . The street was all desolation . Stuart returned to the fire , abstractedly cursing the Northern winter , and remembering the fur-lined warmth of his great-coat . He heard the distant wailing of a train as it shuddered its way through the choking darkness , and then that sound was abruptly shut off by the gale that swept over the frozen Lakes . It roared over the snug shingles of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night like a terrible voice rushing towards the sky . The fire leapt higher on the hearth . Sam returned , to pour old brandy into little glasses . Stuart and he sat by the fire and sipped the liquor in companionable silence . But Sam watched Stuart with furtive acuteness . He felt the other man 's dark unease of mind , his confusion . " A bad night , " suggested Sam , listening to the wind and the rattling of the window-panes . " It 's always a bad night , for eight months of the year , in this blaste country , " said Stuart , with gloom . He pushed his hand through his thic black hair , and recalled that he had noticed a few more gray threads i it that morning . Now his face was both surly and uneasy , its florid colt ) deeper than usual . Sam saw the discolored pouches under the black eyes , which had lost none of their irate sparkle with the passing of tim and he sighed to himself . " It is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked as i he were alone . " I 'm sick of it . " Sam said nothing . Stuart rose and threw more coal upon the fire wit a brisk rattling . He returned to his seat . " I think , " Sam said , in his slow accented voice , " that we are sick the things in us , or of the things we think we see there . It is our belief i them that makes us sick . If we do not believe  --  " and he spread out hi hands and lifted his shoulders in the old immemorial gesture of his rac which was a combination of humor and sorrow . Stuart looked at him with temper . " God ! " he exclaimed , " you to gibberish ! I presume that if I do not belive in Janie , or the imbecility her brats , they will not exist ! " " If you think that perhaps what you believe of that woman is nP263true , then it will not be true . For you , my friend , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be true , for you . If you think she is a good woman , and her children are good , also , then they will be good  --  to you . " " Oh , damn , " said Stuart , turning from the other in disgust . " You still talk gibberish . It still remains that that trollop is a dirty animal , and that her children are idiots . " Sam leaned back in his chair and looked before him reflectively . " There was a man I knew once . He was a bad man . He was cruel and harsh , and a murderer in his heart . That is what others knew of him , or believed they knew . The evil he did was all about him . One saw it . But there were his wife and children  --  they thought him the kindest and most just of men . To them , he was all that . Who , then , was right ? " " You are getting as bad as old Grundy , " said Stuart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphysical nonsense . " But Sam was still reflective . " It is all a matter of where we stand what view we see . The man on the mountain says : The valley is low . ' The man in the valley says : The mountain is high . ' The man at the foot of the mountain sees a height he can not climb . But the man at a great distance sees only a low-hill . " But Stuart was looking at him irascibly . " Oh , damn , " he said again . " You are a wonderful help to me , Sam . " Sam smiled . When he smiled , the ancient furrows in his tired face disappeared , and his expression was all gay sweetness and amusement . Even his weary eyes danced . " Perhaps you are wiser , " he said . " The more one thinks , the more one loses the outline of reality . You are like a child , Stuart . You see simply . That is why , perhaps , you are wiser . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient . " Let 's get down to facts , " he said , in an angry tone . " Have n't you noticed something , recently ? Our sales are falling off . Fewer farmers are coming into town . The customers are more prudent , and they are buying cheaper articles , and fewer of them . What is the matter ? Where has the money gone ? There is no less money in the damned country . Where is it hiding ? Where has it gone ? " Sam was serious again . " Let us ask , rather : Where has the confidence of the people gone ? ' Something has affected the confidence of the people . What is it ? When you can answer that , during each falling off of confidence , then you can solve the riddle of panics . Sometimes it is but a rumor . Sometimes there is a whisper that crops have failed , or are smaller . Sometimes one suspects the political Party which is in power . But again : it is like the man who looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who looks up at a small mountain and decides it is large . Money is very intangible . It is an imaginary thing . It is at hand if the confidence of the people remains , and it is lost if the confidence fails . I may be wrong , indeed . But I fear I am right . " Stuart stared at him irascibly . " You are still talking gibberish . I only know this : that our indebtedness is enormous , and our sales are falling off . That is the fact we must face . Damn you , sir , and your intangible ' mountains ! Philosophy never put decent amounts on the right side of the ledger , and never made red ink disappear on the wrong side . You can look at things calmly , and talk riddles . But I 'm not calm , damned if I am ! I see bankruptcy staring us in the face if things go on this way . " Sam was very grave . " You are right , Stuart . People are beginning , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as an inevitable thing . But I am no financier . I am no student of business history . I am only a shopkeeper . I know nothing . " He paused , then said , almost as if in apology : " Do you know what I think we should do ? Retrench . Conserve . Economize . Sell what we haf , and buy replacements only with cash . And those replacements small . We should operate in a narrower , a more cautious , circle . In the meantime , we should hurry to pay off our indebtedness , as fast as we can . What do you call it ? Pull in the belt . ' " And he smiled at Stuart gently . He knew , even before Stuart 's face took on a frightened and enraged expression , that what he had said must raise furious resistance in the other man . He said hurriedly : " Please understand me . With no debts , we can afford to make smaller profits . Even in a panic , people must live . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shopkeeper who weathers the storm is a man who has no debts , sells what he can , and lives frugally on the small profits , until the storm passes . He is what you haf said : marking time . ' That is the wise thing : marking time . ' For , inevitably , financial storms pass . There are many wrecks left behind . But the man who has hurried to make himself solvent is not one of the wrecks . " Stuart looked at him , appalled and incensed , full of his old nameless fear . " You talk like a coward , Sam ! It is people like you who make panics ! You have no confidence ! " But Sam said , very gravely : " I haf confidence that the storm will pass , but unless I take care I haf no confidence that I shall not be wrecked . I wish to take precautions . I shut my doors and my windows , and bolt them , so that the storm will pass by with as little damage as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite destruction . " P265Stuart felt in himself the old sick sinking that always accompanied any suggestion of economy or caution . He exclaimed : " Oh , what a nigglingsoul you have , Sam ! What an over-cautious , tiptoeing , miserable soul ! You would count pennies . You would measure out each yard of calico before you buy it , and then buy half a yard . Is that the way great enterprises are continued , and expanded ? By mean little souls who are afraid to buy two yards because they are not certain they will sell them immediately ? By those who have no confidence that a customer has the cash with which to buy two yards ? " But now Sam 's gravity had become stern . He said slowly : " You do not understand me . It is you , now , who are talking what you call gibberish . If a customer does not haf the confidence that tomorrow he will haf two more dollars he will not spend one dollar today . That is what is happening . The customers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , so today they spend one dollar , or nothing . That is a fact which must be understood . Why they fear they will not haf two dollars , I do not know . I haf said I am no student of financial histories . I only know I am confronted with the frightened woman who is afraid that tomorrow she will not haf the two dollars , so she will hoard what she has to buy bread for her family when the next day there are no dollars . " Stuart , in his ancient fear , got up , and began to stride about the room , running his hands through his hair , rubbing his hands together . " You are afraid , " said Sam , watching him grievedly . " You know , in your heart , that ladies in the shops spend fifty cents , not two dollars , for already they fear that tomorrow they will need the money for bread . Yet you will not listen . You will not buy only one yard today because you will not believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not sell half a yard . That is what I am telling you : buy only one yard today , with cash , and pay , if you can , for the many yards you bought yesterday . And quickly . " " Oh , the fools ! " cried Stuart , swinging upon his friend . " Do n't they understand , using your damned idiotic metaphor , that if they do n't buy two yards today they wo n't be able to buy half a yard tomorrow ? " Sam smiled sadly . " Perhaps the poor ladies do not understand economics , " he said . " And , as we deal with the poor ladies , we must cut our cloth to the measure of their fears . " Stuart stood before him , his face working furiously , his color very bad . " All right , all right ! " he cried , with elaborate bitterness . " What is your solution , then ? "   Stuart poked the fire again . Sam 's face was wrinkling with his grave thoughts . Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fists clenching . Then Sam sat back in his chair and stared somberly at his friend . " I haf been wondering , and hoping , " he said . " I haf been waiting for you to talk to me . I haf given you my advice . But I shall not use the metaphors . I shall speak plainly . But first , I must ask you a question : What is your cash , in the banks ? " Stuart flushed . He bit his lip . Then he said furiously : " I can raise But Sam lifted his hand , slowly . " I haf not asked what you can raise . ' I haf asked what your cash is . " Stuart exploded . " In actual cash , damn you , about ten thousand dol-lars ! " Sam stared at him in grave silence . He shook his head a little . Then he said : " And your own indebtedness , my poor Stuart , is over one hundred thousand dollars . " He sighed . He put his little brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untasted . " From the shops , from the last six months of custom , you shall haf but five thousand dollars , " he continued . " That will be nothing to pay on your indebtedness . For , unfortunately , a man must live , also , as well as pay his debts . " Bitterly , Stuart exclaimed : " You are afraid that I will ruin you , as well as myself ! " Sam looked at him , and before that look Stuart colored . " Always , you accuse me of bad things , " said the Jew sadly . " Yet , in your heart , you do not believe it . " Stuart made a disordered gesture . " I 'm always apologizing to you , it seems . I wo n't , now . You know I have a rotten tongue . " He fell into his chair . He clenched his hands grimly on his knees . He glared at the fire , his face twisting . " Oh , damn , damn , " he muttered . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always borrow , again , " he said . " My house is practically paid for . Besides , curse it , have n't we a huge amount of stock on hand , which ought to be worth something ? " Sam appeared a little more eager . " That is what I am saying ! Sell what we haf . Pay off the indebtedness . Buy little more , and that only for cash , when we can . That is the way of pulling in the belt ' until the table is set again . "  | " But you 've forgotten that we have a shipment coming in soon , amounting to at least twenty-five thousand dollars ! " Sam shook his head . " We can not accept it . The shops in New York will buy it , perhaps , on the docks . " He stood up . He said sternly : " I haf meant to tell you that . We can not accept the shipment . " Stuart looked up at him . His face was dark . " Sam , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away . " Yes . I haf the money . For my people . I can not spend that money , to buy goods which we shall not be able to sell , perhaps for a long time . I can not take that money , which belongs to my people . " Stuart said , in an evil tone : " You will not  --  lend -- that money , to save me . And in the final event , to save yourself . " For the first time in many years , he saw anger in Sam 's brown eyes , as the other faced him fully . " You speak of saving yourself , and me , Stuart ! But there would need to be no talk of saving , if you had not been rash , and foolish , with your money ! Always haf I warned you . But no , you would not listen . You must spend . It must be a house of useless treasures , or women , or jewels , or horses , or other lavishness . And now you speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance that does not belong to you , that was gathered slowly , and painfully , for the use of those who haf no hope , not even of life , if I do not use my money for them ! " Stuart , in his shame , was defensively enraged . He shouted : " If I go down , you go also , remember ! Or perhaps you would buy me out , at your own price ! You would throw me out ! " He sprang to his feet . He stood there , violently trembling , before his friend . But Sam only gazed at him with the quiet anger increasing in his eyes . For one moment Stuart saw contempt in them , and then great compassionmingled with the anger . Sam went to a table in a corner and brought out a single sheet of paper . He looked at it steadily , sat down by the fire . He said , not glancing at Stuart : " Here are the figures , my Stuart . Simple figures . They can be understood . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , we can forget them . " For the shops , we haf seventeen thousand dollars , in the banks . That is all . Our indebtedness : it is eighty-two thousand dollars . Our stock in the shops : we haf ninety thousand dollars invested . The stock , it is moving slowly . Slowly , slowly , like a river in the early winter , freezing , until it will not move at all , before the spring . The clerks , they must be paid . The indebtedness , it must be lifted , the payments on the debts made regularly . Next month , Stuart , you will draw as your share less than four hundred dollars . I , also . Yet you haf your personal debts to meet , to the banks . Your mortgages , your expenses . And always the clerks , who live on their wages , which we give them . It is the clerks , just now , of whom I am thinking . " Stuart looked down at him in silence , then he sank heavily back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the utmost gravity . " You haf spoken of my private funds , in the banks , for my people . I haf told you before that if you needed my money , it is yours . I haf a fund  --  it is seven thousand dollars  --  above that which I haf saved for my people . It is yours , Stuart , if you will haf it . If you need it . " Stuart did not speak . He stared heavily before him at a point between his polished boots . Sam sighed . Then he said in a more cheerful tone : " Your ten thousand dollars , Stuart , and my seven  --  it can help you . But only if we do not buy . If we economize . If we live frugally . If we sell what we haf , and buy no more . Until the river melts in the spring , and moves again . " Stuart glanced up at him with the upflinging of the head which told of desperation . " All our profits , Stuart , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must take nothing . Your ten thousand dollars , my seven , this must serve us for our private expenses , until the river moves again . " " My God ! " cried Stuart , " I spend nearly two thousand a month , myself ! How long will the money last me ? " But Sam said with gentle inexorableness : " You must cut your ex penses , my friend . " " But how ? " Sam sighed again . He hesitated . Then he looked sternly at his friend . " You haf showed me the diamond necklace and earrings which you haf bought for a certain lady in Chicago . They must be returned . There will be a little loss . They were twelve thousand dollars , Stuart ? They must be returned . The jeweler  --  surely he will give you eleven thousand dollars for their return , if not the full price . " Stuart glowered . He looked away . " I paid only two thousand down on them , Sam . " Sam 's head dropped wearily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred dollars for their return . Then you will not be in debt . " Stuart pondered this gloomily . Then his fear , like a mad animal , leapt at his throat again , and in the extremity of his panic he jumped to hisP269feet . " I ca n't , I tell you ! I ca n't live like a niggardly beggar ! I ca n't economize ! It  --  it would kill me ! What do you know ? Nothing ! How can you understand a man like me ? " But Sam only regarded him somberly , and compassion again changed his face . He said , looking up at his partner : " Stuart , what is it you are afraid of ? What is it that frightens you so ? " And Stuart said , his words leaping from the dark subconscious depths of him without volition : " I 'm afraid of the world . " He sat down again , and looked at the fire . He said , almost inaudibly , as if he were speaking in a dream , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . I owe you fourteen thousand dollars , which you lent me . It was seventeen . I have paid you three . You did n't speak of it . You have n't forgotten it ? " Sam said softly : " Haf I asked you for it , Stuart ? " Stuart put his hands over his face . " No ! No ! You never would , Sam . " Then Sam said again , with deep compassion : " You are afraid of the world you say , Stuart . What is it that makes you afraid ? " Stuart dropped his hands . They fell between his big knees in a gesture of exhaustion . He stared again at the fire , and his handsome dissipated features were stricken and grim . " I know what the world is , Sam . " " I know too , Stuart . But still I am not afraid of it . I know the worst it can do . But still I am not afraid . When one knows the ultimate , one knows that beyond it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face . " Stuart did not seem to have heard him . The firelight filled the sockets of his staring eyes , and gave them a despairing appearance . He began to speak , and his voice was mechanical , as though those subconscious depths were speaking now through his mouth , without the knowledge of his alert mind : " I was never a very bad lad . I  --  I was somewhat like a puppy . I was ready to be friendly with every man . If a man spoke kindly to me , I loved him . The world seemed a beautiful and exciting place to me , full of friendliness and adventure and goodness . That was when I was a young lad . Even when I saw evil things , and saw the twisted mouths about me , and the nasty eyes , I thought it only an accident . A rare thing . A troubling thing . But not universal . Never universal . I read the lies of the good men who had died long ago . The dignity of man , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . ' They had been said so often that I believed that everyone knew them , and practiced them . They seemed lovely things to me , things universally accepted . Sometimes , perhaps , there were errors committed , but these were committed by only a few who had never heard of the things I believed were true , and understood . Those who were in error were criminals , justly hated and rejectedby the whole world . And I believed all this until I was nearly twenty years old ! " He laughed bitterly . Sam had listened to that grim and monotonous voice with deep and unmoving attention . He waited . " I understood lies . I was an uncommon young liar myself , " Stuart 's voice went on , meditatively . He still looked only at the fire . " But they were harmless lies , never calculated to hurt a soul . Yes , I understood those lies . They were spice to life , or said in kindness , or in merriment , and no one was expected to believe them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to cause suffering or destruction , or spoken out of viciousness or cruelty  --  these I never believed existed . I did not believe it until I was nearly twenty years old ! " Sam still waited . Again , Stuart passed his hands over his face with a tired and rubbing gesture . His skin , after their passage , was mottled and drawn . " I understood the little malices , the annoyance of temper , the antagonismof one mind to another . I indulged in them myself . But I did not believe there were enormous malices without cause , which would set one man against another to the death . I did not believe there were cruelties which came only because one man was stronger than his neighbor , and he wished to destroy that weaker neighbor out of beastlike and reasonless malignance . I did not understand that cruelty and malignance were human attributes as much a part of the nature of men as the color of their eyes and the shape of their noses . I still believed , until I was nearly twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a better part ! " Sam made a faint involuntary sound , but Stuart did not hear it . A sick excitement possessed him . He twisted his fingers strongly together , as if in great pain . He went on : " But there was one thing I did not know at all , until I had grown to manhood . I did not know there was hatred . Oh , there were some lads of my age whom I disliked , whom I avoided , even in England , and when I came to America . I had my fights with these lads , when they called me dirty Irishman , ' and other things . But still , I did not believe in hatred . But now I know that there is only hatred in the world , andP271cruelty , and murderous greed and enmity . I know that every man is set against his neighbor , like a mad wild animal , and that there is no decencyor kindness anywhere . " Sam had the sensation that he was talking to a man in delirium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he said : " My Stuart , have you forgotten Father Houlihan ? Is he one like this ? " He was dimly surprised to learn that Stuart had actually heard him , for the younger man said : " Father Houlihan ? I believe him a good man . But how can I know ? He is good ' to me . But what is he to others ? You spoke to me about the mountain , which looks different to different men from different vantage points . I 've thought you a good man , too , but how do I know ? What do you appear to others ? You and old Grundy are only two men , anyway , and I have met no other good men  --  if you are good . " Sam stared at him , and his own eyes were full of pain . He felt Stuart 's simple suffering all through his own flesh . His heart was weighed down with suffering . Stuart shrugged despairingly , still not looking at his friend . " And so , there it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood . And then I was afraid . You ca n't understand how afraid I was . Then I began to see that a man had only one defense against other men : money . The more money he had , the higher the wall that guarded him against his fellows . That is why I knew I must have money . A very great deal of money . That is why I must have properties : to show other men that the wall is very high about me , and they can never scale it , to reach me and destroy me . " Now he turned to Sam and smiled . It was both a sad and an evil smile . " I 've told a little of this to Grundy , when he tried to come over me with his noble platitudes . He has talked to me of Christianity . ' My God ! As if there ever was any Christianity in the world ! Somewhere I 've read that there was only one Christian , and He was crucified . But I know there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if the story is true , there was only one Christian , and He was God . He could never have been a man . " He lifted his hands for a moment , then dropped them . Again he smiled , and to Sam , it was a touching and very tired smile . " No , He could never have been a man , not even in His flesh . If He er lived at all , which I doubt . There are times when I know , in my cart , that He was only a beautiful myth . Someone invented Him , as they invented the older prophets . He came out of the mind of Jews ; they are excellent inventors of excellence . I have seen that invention in you , also . " Then Sam said a strange thing , but in a clear voice of mysterious relief : " I haf always known , my poor Stuart , that you are a good man . " Stuart stared at him blankly . Then he shook his head numbly , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no significance for him . Sam stood up . He went to his friend , and pressed his shoulder with his hand . He bent over him , and said quietly and strongly : " Stuart , it must be that you must listen to me . I haf said you are a good man . To others you do not appear to be a good man , only to a few . You are only part of the flesh of other men ; you do not stand apart . What is in your mind , and your heart , is in the minds and hearts of others , also . No one is created of a different  --  substance  --  than other men . So what is true of him , in greater or smaller measure is true of all . " If there is good in your thoughts , and this I know , and good in your intention , and if there is kindness in you , and gentleness , and some justice , then these are in others too , greater or smaller . One stone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same earth , though some are of a larger size , and some of a different shape . So , you are no stranger in the world , looking at strange creatures who do not share your flesh . " Stuart looked up at him , and was silent . His forehead wrinkled , as he tried to understand . But he smiled darkly . Sam went on : " There is not only blackness in the world , my poor friend . Let us look about us . We haf invented some measure of law and order . We haf justice . We haf some mercy . We haf some trust in others , and in their word . We haf hospitals and asylums , as well as jails and gallows . Great books are written , and men read them , and think . Even among ten thousand liars , there are a few honest men . There is hope in men for a better world , and even in the hearts of the murderers and the liars there is a hidden belief that the better world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All is still confusion and darkness . But if all men were evil , and there was only evil in the world , there would not be even the little law and order we haf , and life would be impossible . " He went on : " If all men were only evil , then the Scriptures would never haf survived to this day . " He took his hand from Stuart 's shoulder , but still stood beside him . He lifted his whitened head and looked before him , and smiled .   " You haf spoken of your fear . But I do not fear . For I know that other men are like me , even if they are better , or worse . We are all the same . That is something we must learn . When we haf learned it , then we shall haf understood that we haf nothing to fear from each other , that no one would do ill to another except in his fear . It is fear that is the darkness , and the cruelty , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I fear my brother ? ' then the world we dream of shall be here . " Stuart did not speak . But he shook his head over and over . Sam smiled , as if at someone invisible . " I believe , in America , that there will be the end of fear . And then there will be peace and goodnessand the fatherhood of God . Yes , I believe that of America . The time will come . Perhaps not for many years . But it will come . That is my belief in America . " The candles which Mrs. Berkowitz had lighted had burned to their sockets . But all at once , in one last burst of light , they illuminated all the room . There was triumph in that last light . But Stuart saw only the darkness that followed . " I do n't believe in America . I do n't believe in anything . You talk like old Grundy , Sam . All I know is that I am afraid . We must come back to the shops . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be so bad as I think . But there is always a way . We shall find a way . No , it is never so bad as we think . " JANIE sat in the warm ruddy kitchen , and carefully sorted out a heap of her worn but still luxurious gowns . Those that she discarded , after meticulous scrutiny , were destined for the daughter of her cook , Mrs. Gordon . Sometimes she hesitated , then with a quick gesture , she added a better frock of velvet or foulard to the heap . Now that heap , all crimson , purple , blue and violet , stood richly at her small feet . There were few among her own class whom Janie ever trusted . But , with an odd democracy , she trusted her servants , who adored her , particularly Mrs. Gordon . For she was generous to them , and laughed gnrightlily with them , in her hoarse rowdy voice , and was always full of jest and gaiety except when she was abusive . Even then , they found her abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingp274for her , when coming on a housemaid polishing the brass lifts on the stairs , to sit down a step or two above , and begin an interesting and amusing conversation with the girL She would sit there , draped in one of her endless velvet peignoirs , her thin little arms folded on her knees , and exchange all manner of jokes and gossip with the maid . Both refreshed , then , they could continue with the day 's work , parting with friendliness on one side , and deep appreciation on the other . The gardeners were always delighted to see her , as were the stableboys , for there was such an insouciant air about her , such zest , such ribald slyness , that they could count on at least half an hour of fun and laughter . She paid them well , and was generous with them in other ways , such as the granting of a holiday , and a deep interest in their personal affairs . Nevertheless , they took few liberties with her , for they had learned that a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthlessness , which did not pass away too quickly . She enjoyed their company , illiterate though it was . For they were almost always simple and earthy and honestly licentious , and their remarkswere pungent , if lewd . In their presence , she never had to pretend to be a fine lady . She could be one of them , some fundamental roughness and robust crudity in her satisfied and stimulated . However , none of her children overheard any of her conversations with her menials , for these conversations were conspicuous for a lack of reticence and were often highly improper . But sometimes Laurie or Angus might hear the far rich booming of her naughty laughter , and the accompanying shrieks of Mrs. Gordon , in the kitchen , and then the door would be closed abruptly . The servants were great friends with other servants in the city , and after each night off they would return with spicy gossip to pour into their mistress ' receptive and eagerly malicious ear . This back stairs scandal was the light and interest of Janie 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often rewarde. with a velvet pelisse or a silver fifty-cent piece or an extra evening off It was not truly bribery ; it was just that Janie would be so delighted an . pleased that she could not resist the reward , and gave it with gratefgenerosity . The kitchen was her favorite spot in the house . It was a large wid room , one of the biggest under that roof , and the floor was of red til the walls of white plaster . It had a huge sunny window looking out on the back gardens , with a wide window seat full of plump linen cushions . Along the wall hung the many copper saucepans , all gleaming like gold in the brisk light , and against another wall was the huge iron andP275brick stove , fuming warmly , the kettles hissing , the lids lifting under the pressure to emit good rich odors . There were three comfortable rockers in the room , and one was Janie 's favorite , for it was small and well padded , and her feet could touch the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North , and the opened window admitted the sweetest bright wind and the chattering of birds . The trees sparkled in the sun ; the grass was green and vivid . Roses climbed against the white wall of the garden , and yellow marigoldsand purple lobelia and pansies and phlox were mingled in riotous color along the brick paths . A weeping willow tree was like a green and fragile fountain in the center of the garden , its strands floating gently in the moving and radiant air , and far to the right stood a noble elm , its branches gilded with gold . Pigeons fluttered over the gray slate of the roof and over the red shingles of the stables and outhouses , and flew up brightly against a turquoise sky full of wide summer light . All was very still and peaceful . The pans boiled briskly on the stove ; the curtains at the window stirred . Mrs. Gordon moved about heavily , but quickly ; she was a huge fat woman with a hairy mirthful face and little blue eyes shining with malice and wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and about her full pink cheeks with their hirsute sproutings . She had a big and belliosemouth , a nose like a snout , and a billowy breast , and enormous hips welling under her full black skirts . A crisp white apron was tightlytied over her quivering belly . She looked competent and alert , with no onsense about her , and was a prodigious talker , emphasizing her remarkswith gestures of a polished ladle or fork . She was Janie 's best ricnd , and had a rough and ribald tongue and a fund of shrewd tales hat endlessly delighted her mistress . Her tales were never good-natured or kind , but full of lasciviousness and scandal . Mrs. Gordon thought the worst of everyone , and the worst was always biological . Janie sat in her little rocker , and went over the gowns and frocks to be given Mrs. Gordon 's daughter , who was married to a " poor stick of a reature . And , like all women married to such creatures , she had manychildren , of whom Mrs. Gordon was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bastards " to her , though the unfortunate mother was quite gaily wed to her chronically ailing spouse . Laurie 's outgrown frocks ml underwear and pinafores went to clothe the older girls , and her rothers unconsciously contributed to the same family , their garments industriously cut down to fit the numerous male brood . Mrs. Gordon always had a remark ready anent her son-in-law . She watched Janie 's sorting with approval . She said : " You 'd think , would n't you , that a feller that ca n't get out of bed except at the call of nature , and is always whinin ' like a beat dog , would n't have the gumption ! Yet there she is , gruntin ' out a young un every ten months , regular as clockwork , while he lies there , bleatin ' . And she gettin ' out of bed in three days to take in washin ' again ! It 's hell , I tell you , Miz Cauder , it 's hell ! " " I always say that is the last part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be sure , " chuckled Janie . She laid a white batiste frock of Laurie 's on the pile , and picked up her own last summer 's foulard , a pretty blue . She looked very neat and pretty this morning , her red curls piled high for coolness on her small head , her freckled cheeks flushed , her green eyes sparkling with humor . She wore a thin loose frock of dotted Swiss , and her arms were bare to the elbow , below a series of wide crisp ruffles . Below the flounces of the frock peeped her little feet in their heelless black sandals and white cotton stockings . She was goodtemperedtoday . Mrs. Gordon had just finished regaling her with several juicy tales about her neighbors , and she chuckled in remembrance . When she laughed like this , showing her white even teeth , she looked young and gay , and one hardly noticed the web of fine wrinkles beginning to overlay her face and deepen about her malicious eyes . She said : " That 's a fine tale , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls behind the doors . Who 'd think it of the decorous Mr. Cummings ! " " And he a churchman in the best standing , " nodded Mrs. Gordon , with a grin . " And as fine a wife as a man could have , and a pretty girl for a daughter . " Janie frowned quickly . " One ca n't blame him , with a wife like Alicia , Gordon . A priggish creature , with high and mighty ways . I 've never liked her . I 'd thought of her Alice for Bertie , but the lad ' 11 have none of her . And now it 's Robbie , mooning about her , though mooning i hardly the word , he 's so cold-blooded . And Alicia watching them like a hawk , and frowning to herself , as if my lads are not too good for her puling brat ! I should be the one who should look askance , not Alicia , for who are the Cummings ' , anyway ? His father was a tavern-keeper and horse-trader , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas in England , Gordon . Anyway , Bertie shows good taste . None of a horse-trader 's for my aristocratic Bertie ! " And she nodded in grim satisfaction . Mrs. Gordon 's mean little eyes narrowed shrewdly and knowingly on her mistress , and she smirked to herself . She said : " Well , Miss AliceP277is pretty , and her dad 's got a fortune , and Mister Robbie could look farther and do worse . Though there 's not much choice in Grandeville , and perhaps your boys would do better in a bigger town , Miz Cauder . " Janie nodded , and sighed . She pretended to be downhearted , but Mrs. Gordon saw through her pretense . " And there 's my Angus , marrying that tub of white lard in November , Gordon . Oh , that Gretchen Schnitzel ! And her dada 's tanneries that smell to high heaven ! It 's like marryinga stink , Gordon . " " But a rich stink , " said Mrs. Gordon , wistfully . Janie looked resigned , but also smug . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No foolishness about the lad . He 's been well trained . He 's alreadygot his plans . If he can only hold his nose . " " Maybe he 'll go into the tanneries , " suggested Mrs. Gordon . " Oh , God , no ! Schnitzel  --  ( Heavens , what a name ! ) has two lads of his own , you know . And Angus has other ideas . And his mama , too , " she added with a chuckle . She continued after a moment : " Angus will have the lass , Gordon , though I ca n't abide her . Did you ever see such a face ? White and lardy , with little pig eyes , and hair the color of bleached straw . And a nasty nature , too . Dull as lard . She 'll be as big as a keg in a few years . " " Maybe Mr. Angus 'll help with the bigness , " said Mrs. Gordon . Janie giggled . " I have my doubts , Gordon , I have my doubts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd perhaps think it sinful . Everything 's sin , to Angus . Though he never goes to church any more . Like as not he thinks the only proper way to replenish the earth is through immaculate conception , or through the bees , like flowers . " She and Mrs. Gordon went off into a loud gale of laughter , with many supplementary remarks , all exceedingly improper . They rehearsed Angus ' wedding night , with appropriate squeals on the part of Miss Gret- ( hen , and sweatings and agonies on Angus ' , and much shame . Theyere quite breathless for several moments after this . " Now my Robbie , " said Janie , when she could get her breath , " would very judicial with his Alice . It would all be logic , and serious disussion , prior to the event . Alice would be put through a severe catechism , itting there in her nightgown , on the bed , while he walked up and down he bedroom with his hands behind his back , in the best Napoleonic anner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her . Had she ny reasonable opinions on the subject ? Had she come to any sensible nclusion ? That would be my Robbie ! " They shrieked again , Mrs. Gordon taking the time from her pots to sit on a chair , which represented the marriage bed , and to smirk in imitation of the bewildered Alice . She put a huge greasy finger coyly in the side of her mouth , and bridled , and pretended to blush . She threw her apron over her face . Janie was convulsed at this . " That would end the discussion ! " she cried . Mrs. Gordon returned to her pots . " When is Mr. Bertie expected back from his rest cure in Saratoga ? " she asked , casually . Janie glanced at her broad back sharply . But her face saddened . She bent over another frock , and her voice was gentle when she answered : " Next week , I believe . The poor lad ! So big and hearty , who 'd have suspected that he had a lung condition ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sighed . " I never thought , all these years , that he was delicate . But one ca n't tell , even with a fine body like his . I 'd have thought it likelier of that miserable Angus of mine , or even my little wizened Robbie . But never of Bertie , so big and handsome and merry and braw . He writes me , however , that he 's quite recovered , and is just on edge with impatience to see us all again . " " What did Mr. Robbie say , after his visit to Mr. Bertie ? " " Oh , Robbie thinks Bertie is doing excellently . He was quite en  --  t couraged , he said . " Janie sighed again . " Who 'd ever have thought it , so gay and good-tempered , and never a care in the world  --  my darling Bertie . " Her rough voice was sweet with love and sadness , and very low . Her hands trembled above the lengths of the bright frocks on her knee . She blinked for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Mrs. Gordon , who really loved her , glanced at her furtively with deep sympathy . That drunken good-for-nothing ! To break his mother 's heart like this ! But then , he was such a love , he was , and like sunshine in the house . She echoed Janie 's sigh . There was a little heavy silence in the kitchen , and it seemed darker , though the sun still danced on the copper pans on the white wall , and the red tile was ruddier than ever . A fresh new breeze blew through the windows , sweet with summer scents and the odor of the damp grass . The blowing willow lifted its drooping fronds like a green wave , and then subsided . The pigeons cooed softly , spread their wings against the sky . The kitchen was full of the good odors of roasting beef and , boiling broth . A length of taffeta hissed on Janie 's knee as it slid towards the floor . Then , in the distance , came the soft notes of a piano . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so beautiful , soP279rounded , so full and strong , that it seemed like the meditation of an angel . Mrs. Gordon , at the stove , paused in the very act of putting the ladle in a pot , and lifted her head . A look of tenderness stood on her coarse big face . " Ah , Miss Laurie at her practicin ' , " she murmured . Janie frowned . " Does she have to yowl so early in the morning ? " she muttered . She threw down another frock with a vicious gesture . But Mrs. Gordon heard nothing but that perfect and celestial voice , rising and falling on a simple practicing scale , and making of that scale a beautiful sound full of glory and sweetness and gravity . Tears rose to Mrs. Gordon 's eyes . The breeze died . The pigeons were silent . It was as if the whole earth listened . And now the voice became grave and slow , like meditative organ notes , murmuring of angelic prayer . Even Janie was compelled to listen . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grudgingly . " But I doubt she 'll have the ambition to make anything of it . She only took Stuart 's teacher to please him . Not from any desire on her part . He 's the only one who can do anything with the minx . Did n't I hear her , myself , tell him that she would take his teacher , and practice , only because she wanted her voice to be good enough for him ! The nasty little wench ! If she had been even two years older I 'd have clapped her in a closet for that , and minded her like a hawk , and put good tight drawers on her ! She sounded like a mewling lass , all lovesick and languishing . " She got up suddenly and shut the door with a loud and furious bang . The voice faded away behind that door to a deep murmuring . " Yowling , so early in the morning ! " Janie repeated . Mrs. Gordon was annoyed . She said : " Mark my words , Miz Cauder , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's good money in that voice . Janie , however , was not displeased . " I hope so , " she said sourly . " With all that money spent on her . Though it 's not my money . If that fool wants to waste two thousand dollars a year on a teacher for her , that 's his affair . He always was wasteful and quixotic . I do n't know why he does it . " She chuckled evilly . " If he thought that he 'd make a profit on my lass , later , he was damned mistaken . I took care of that , wisely . I made him sign a contract that he 'd expect nothing at all from her later earnings , and he had to sign it before I 'd let the minx breathe a note to his line teacher from New York ! " There was nothing kind in Mrs. Gordon 's hard eye as it dwelt briefly on Janie. 280 " And he boards and keeps Mr. Berry , too , besides the two thousand dollars , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , for your girl ? " Janie shrugged . " He 's beyond me . But he was always picking up lame I birds and putting them in trees . Was n't he after me about Angus , until the lad curtly told him to mind his own business ? Did n't he fume and fuss about Bertie , until I agreed to let my darling go to Saratoga ? With him , Stuart , footing the bills ? " She chuckled hoarsely . " If the damned ass wishes to waste his money on my children , who am I to stop him ? Better my children have some of his reckless money than the trollops of the town . Why does he do all this ? ' I do n't know . A busybody , a meddler , that 's what he is . " " Perhaps he has a good heart , " suggested Mrs. Gordon . Janie snorted . " He 's just a fool , I tell you , Gordon . A snivelling damn fool . Ca n't help doing for others . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be to see him there ! " She flung a dress from her , and stamped on it , involuntarily . " That 's where you 'll find all the do-gooders , in th workhouse , and be damned to them for jackasses and dolts ! " She stood up , shaking out her Swiss flounces . " There you are , Gordon . Five of my frocks , and six of Laurie 's , for your daughter . " She paused . She put her hand in the pocket of her dress . She drew out a roll of bills , and selected one . " And you can give the lass this , from me . With that new baby , and all , she 'll need it . " BERTIE and Robbie Cauder strolled idly together , this Sunday morningalong the banks of the river , on the Canadian side . They had taken th ferry an hour ago , and were now on the way to Frenchman 's Crec where they contemplated hiring a small flat-bottomed boat for a lc hours of rowing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knal sack with sliced bread , cold beef , and a bottle of wine . It was a resplendent early autumn morning . The river , to their righ was a brilliant indigo under a sky hardly less colorful . Grassy bank sloped to the water , fretted with the shade of elms and maples . T latter trees were just turning into great fiery bushes , burning vivid ) against that indigo sky . There was a soft rustling in the still and shin in air , the twittering of birds , the last busy humming of bees . Butterflies . P281yellow as butter , rose and fell gently on the softest and winiest of winds . The river murmured and whispered against its banks . The American shore beyond the waters was sharply etched in clear green , and in the distance the young men could see the squat little ferry steamer plowing determinedly , a toy boat , across the river , its lacy white wake spreading out in a fan across the heaving blue . A high and musical bugle sounded through the silent and radiant air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road was stationed the Canadian garrison . Against the strong indigo sky fluttered the Union Jack , all its colors blazing proudly . The young men could see the gray and ancient walls of the garrison , fretted with sunlight and treeshade . But they saw no one at all . As they approached the garrison , and Fort Erie , white farmhouses and little white cottages were clustered closer together , and the soft Sabbath was made even more silent by the occasionallowing of cattle , the bark of a distant dog , or the cackling of fowl . Now a few gardens faced the road , carefully enclosed in white picket fences . Beyond them burned last roses , zinnias and late summer poppies . Once they heard the creaking of a pump , or the squealing of a gate , or a faint far voice . But still , they saw no one . They passed the garrison . In the yellow dust of the yard three or four Canadian soldiers talked idly together , leaning on their muskets . Their young mustached faces turned with empty curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats , smiled . The soldiers saluted , watched the walkers out of sight . Behind them the Union Jack streamed in the wind . Now they had the rutted dusty road to themselves , with not even a cottage visible , only trees , grassy banks , and the river , and the wide and brilliant air . They had not talked for some time . Then Bertie cleared his throat , turned his sweet and charming smile on his much loved brother . " Y'know , when I looked at that old damn flag there , the Union Jack , It fair touched me . A curious feeling . You 'll think me a fool , Robbie . " But Robbie said coolly : " Why should I ? Patriotism , or chauvinism , is an old emotion . Primitive . Rooted in the race . Atavistic . A survival of the herd instinct . We 'll not rid ourselves so easily of early instincts , Bertie . It 'll take generations of reason and education . Not in our time , I am afraid . " Bertie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gical and quiet disposal of emotion . Robbie hid that emotion , when it vas displayed to him , as one quickly hid offal or any other unpleasantess , for decency 's sake . Bertie , in consequence , was a little depressed . He scuffed his polished boot in the yellow sifting dust . He said , somewhat petulantly : " Damned if I can ever make out what you mean , Rob . I only meant that when I saw the blessed old rag I realized I was far from home . A long way from home . " Robbie smiled with affectionate cynicism upon his brother . But he said , and there was a little sadness in his level voice : " You 'll always be far from home , Bertie . Never mind me , though . We 're out for a holiday , and that 's all that matters . " He was sorry that he had depressed Bertie . But he simply could not help scotching silly emotionalism . Robbie firmly believed that the millenniumwould arrive when men acquired reason , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder man 's mind still groped in the dark subterranean forests of primordial history , like a blind fish nosing amid sunken vegetation and dead roots ! What did that mind discover in the watery and weedy desolation ? Mermaids and seahorses , green monsters and flashes of phosphorescent decay . Sunken minds in shadowyforests ! The two young men were dressed in their Sabbath best , Bertie resplendentand handsome in light gray broadcloth pantaloons and darker gray skirted coat . There was something of Stuart Coleman 's large splendor about him , though he was slightly thinner and shorter than his kinsman . His ruddy bright curls glimmered under his tall gray hat . In his gloved hand he carried a silver-headed cane . His ruffled linen was immaculate and crisp . He had apparently recovered his buoyant health , though there were still dark lines under his gay blue eyes , and a pallor about his mobile and almost constantly smiling mouth . Because he lacked Stuart 's violence and fierceness , his glances were never quick or ireful , but always sparkling and amused or tender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slight lividity about his red mouth , the underlip of which was so full and soft . As for Robbie , he wore his uniform of black broadcloth with startling white linen , plain and glistening . He moved beside his brother , elegant and compact , the figure of aristocracy and judicious neatness . Even it gloves and his hat were black . He carried an ebony cane , with a gleam ing gold head . He walked effortlessly ; his movements were a little stilt and considered . Janie , angrily seeing them depart that morning , h ; nl said ill-temperedly : " There goes my darling with the black , manikin  --  Whatever does my Bertie see in that undertaker ? " There were many others who wondered about that , for surely in the smiling and careless Bertie there could be nothing that would inform orp283stimulate the cold and precise intellectualism of Robbie 's mind . Bertie 's conversation was always gay , light and inconsequential , though never cruel or malicious . He could be amusing , almost always . Perhaps Robbie found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that . They reached the mouth of Frenchman 's Creek , where two ancient fishermen kept the little flat-bottomed boats and fishing tackle for occasionalcustomers . They were sleeping blissfully in their weatherbeaten shack when Robbie pounded on the rotting door , for Saturday night was a festive occasion for them , necessitating all of the Sabbath for recovery . One of them , in a dirty night-shirt , came grumbling to the door , and opened it with loud complaints . The door creaked loudly in the sunlit silence . Robbie smiled at the old man . " Hello , Bob . How about a boat for me and Mr. Bertie ? And some fishing rods , and some worms ? " He and Bertie sat on the warm bench , their backs against the soft rotting wood of the shack , while old Bob pulled on a pair of trousers and swore lustily , within . Then the fisherman came out , stooping and haggard , his matted white hair streaming down to his shoulders . Cursing even more loudly , he carried a spade to a moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dog came out and sniffed at the two young men , who swung their neat legs idly in the autumn sunshine . Robbie leaned back , fastidiously , as far from the dog as possible . But the smiling Bertie scratched the old animal 's neck with his white and jewelled fingers until , entranced , the beast put both forelegs on his knee and fawned on him with drooling adoration . His bleared eyes brightened lovingly ; he rubbed his eldritch head on Bertie 's immaculate knee , slobbering on it to Robbie 's complete disgust . " Ah , the puir auld lad , " murmured Bertie , in his soft rich voice . " It 's . puir auld creature , that it is . A fine auld man , in his last days . " The poor animal was beside himself . He wormed his skeleton muzzle under Bertie 's flowered waistcoat , and tried to embrace the young man with his balding paws . " You 'll have fleas , " Robbie pointed out . " And God knows what else . Look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Bertie put his arms about the dog and hugged him tightly , laughlyevading the kisses from the pale dry tongue . Robbie said sharply , with an anger he could not define except that its quite warm in his cold breast : " He may have a disease , Bert . YouI remember , he had some kind of scurf last summer . Do you want to Suddenly , and with a haste unusual for one who was so precise and considered , he seized the scruff of the lean and dirty neck and yanked the dog from his brother 's embrace . Then , with a well-placed kick from his little pointed boot , he sent the animal howling and sliding from his brother , with such haste and force that its hindquarters and threshing legs stirred up a cloud of white dust . The dog came to a sprawling halt , then swung about for a new charge upon the adored Bertie , its face expressing only bewilderment and pain . Robbie raised his cane threateningly . The dog stopped in its tracks , panting , its eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You filthy devil ! " The dog looked at him , and cowered . Then , dropping its witheredhead and almost hairless tail , it slunk behind the shack , whimpering . Bertie turned to his brother , whose pale dark cheek was actually flushed . He shook his head gently . " You should n't have done that , Robbie . No , you should n't have done that . " He still smiled . But his blue eyes were strangely bright and fixed . Robbie shrugged . He brushed off with a capable small hand the gray hairs that clung to Bertie 's knee . " You have no intelligence , Bertie . If you do n't have nasty sores soon , or worse , I 'll be surprised . " But Bertie , still smiling , only continued to shake his head . He looked at the restless blue river and the distant American shore . Then again , he gently shook his head . His profile expressed nothing . Robbie was very irritated . Abruptly he rose , dusting himself off in annoyance , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the old fisherman with the fluttering white hair , and criticized the proceedings coolly . " Less dirt , more worms , " he advised , touching the battered old pan with the tip of his cane . " We 're not paying for mud , Bob . " The fisherman cursed him without pausing in his work . Bertie still sat smiling on the bench , looking out at the river . All at once , there was an air of desolation about him , in the sunlight . But he was quite cheerfully voluble when he and Robbie were once in the little boat , rowing up the creek . Sometimes he burst into a rollick ing song , throwing back his handsome head . He had carefully removed his coat . The ruffled neck of his fine white shirt was open , and his full , milk-white throat was exposed to the sun . The sunlight shattered on the diamonds on his fingers . He sang , and the water echoed back his voice merrily . Robbie , who would save his exertions for the return journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat and looked idly about him , P285It was strange , the difference in the scene which the two brothers saw . Robbie felt that the warmth of the autumn sun was agreeable on his bared head and shoulders , and the water calmly blue and the sky very clear . But that is all that met his eye , all that impinged on his senses . He was occupied by his own abstract thoughts . But Bertie saw something quite different . The boat glided deeper and deeper into the creek waters , and , as the stream left the turbulent river it became narrower and quieter . Now the still grassy banks sloped steeply to the water , dark , green and transparent and the long fronds of weeping willows swept the surface with frail fingers , their shadows a lighter and more delicate green , airy and intangible . The bottlegreen of water-lily pads floated on the still surface , and their lovely flowers lay like stars among them , full of pure scent . Dragon-flies skimmed through the dim green air , jewelled and brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Now one could glimpse broken fragments of the burning blue sky through the willows . At one place the creek widened suddenly , to enclose a tiny island on which stood a motionless heron , streaked with rose in the sudden down-pouring of open sunlight , unnaturallyvivid against the surrounding gloom . All about the boat sounded the vague ploppings of frogs as they dived from the waterlilyleaves , and as the trees closed over the narrow creek again , and the watery green dimness engulfed the boat , one could hear the shrilling of tree-toads in the hidden damp fastnesses of the woods . Here and there a finger or a flash of light struck the water , hurtingly vivid . And over all was the clear and spectral silence . Bertie was quiet now , though his lips were pursed as if about to whistle . Ie looked about him . His face was quite serious . It was like a beautiful marble face fallen into pure green water , in the shadow of the trees and in the reflection of the stream . He saw things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . His blue eyes were opaque now , and movedore slowly . They found their favorite spot . There was an opening in the trees , nd the bank was less steep , and more gentle and thickly tufted with rass . They pulled up the boat , gathered up the knapsack , and climbed he bank . There , under a clump of trees some distance from the creekthey sat down , leaning their backs against the brown trunks . They were enclosed in motionless , rustling peace , listening to the twitterings and the songs of birds in the thick branches above . They lit cheroots , spread their legs before them , and smiled at each other . " Nice here , " commented Robbie . He opened the knapsack , and withdrewtwo books from it . One was his " Discussions on Criminal Law , " P133nothing but the best opinion of my friends . Do not be so angered , my clear Stuart . I haf said nothing at all . I haf been impertinent , yes , in inquiringabout the security ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still uneasy . " That is why I have come . To talk about the security . You see , I offered Janie a sort of partnership in the shops . " Sam was shocked . He got slowly to his feet . He looked incredulously at Stuart . He could not speak . " Do n't look so much like a hanged corpse , Sam , " said Stuart , with an attempt at a laugh . " I will explain it to you , briefly . " I have intimated to her  --  and it is no lie  --  that an investment of twenty thousand dollars in the shops will bring her at least five thousand a year , more or less . She was very avid about it , I assure you . Her lips dripped greedily . It was very edifying , this female cupidity . You and I draw hardly twice that much apiece , just at this time , from the business , and we have considerably more invested , as you know very well . Anotherpartner , a silent and female one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be welcomed with glad cries . You agree with me ? " He paused . " I see you do n't agree . Well , no matter . Hear me out . " Think what we can do with twenty thousand dollars , Sam . You remember that bankrupt stock in New York , which we can get for a song ? I am going to order it immediately . You remember how regretfully we discussed it the other day , and wished we might be able to negotiatea loan to buy it . Now , we can . I am still waiting for the glad cries . " Sam sat down , slowly . Now his brown eyes were no longer gentle , but penetrating and very somber . Stuart waited for his comment . But he only said , very quietly : " You haf not told me everything , Stuart . " " Well , no , I have n't . Not quite . " Stuart hesitated . He chewed his lips . He did not look Sam directly in the eye . " I need ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need it to pay off that old bastard , Allstairs . At once . I intend to do it . " I will put the whole twenty thousand dollars into the business , and borrow ten thousand of it back , repaying it in a stated sum each month out of my own pocket . Once rid of the ruinous interest which I pay to that usurer , I can manage the payments easily . Janie will receive a sum at stated intervals , herself , as her income from the investment . I am to draw up the proper papers , today . " Sam looked at him steadfastly . " I shall offend you , Stuart , but I must . It is necessary . You repay Mr. Allstairs regularly because you fear to lose your house . Because you fear for your prestige with him . But relievedof that , you will not pay back regularly into the business . And the business will pay Mrs. Cauder regularly , in spite of the prosperity or the decline of the shops . You and I , Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . We can tighten what you call our belts . But she can not tighten her belt . She is a woman , with children . " " Curse you , you are calling me an irresponsible thief ! " shouted Stuart , crimson , covering his confusion with bluster . " You are actually saying that I shall default on my payments back into the shops ! You are implyingI intend to rob you of your damned profits ! " Sam lifted his hand . He said in a clear , firm tone : " I haf told you often , my dear Stuart , that what I haf is yours , when you need it . I do not resent the tone ; I am not angered . I am only afraid . For you . " You will listen to me , please . You and I  --  we can wait . Mrs. Cauder can not . It is to protect her that I speak , and this you know , in your heart . You are in debt , Stuart . You haf debts everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gambling and women . You haf told me yourself . There was that necklace for the handsome lady in Saratoga last year . Haf you paid that yet , Stuart ? I think it is two thousand dollars more . And the horse-racing , Stuart . You can not resist the horses . I know all this . You are angered with me . But you know it is the truth . " " I will sign notes ! " shouted Stuart , furiously . " I will give you all the cursed notes you want ! Turn them over to your usurers ! Sell me out , damn you ! " But Sam only smiled sadly . He shook his head , over and over . " You know you talk wildly , Stuart . You know that if you go bankrupt , I go with you , gladly . What need haf I for money , except what I had planned for my people ? What I haf is yours . But I can not see you ruined . I cannotstand by while you ruin yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , vehemently : " I swear to God , Sam , that you misjudge me . I will pay everything back , promptly . I give you my word of honor . I 've been strapped before . I do n't mind being strapped again . No more debts , personal debts , until the money is repaid . " He smiled grimly . " There is something else , which will assure the payments . I intend to marry Miss Marvina Allstairs . Very , very soon . With or without her father 's consent . " If Sam had been disturbed before , he was distraught now . But it wasP107remembered nothing but the garden , enchanted and timeless , full of sleep . Laurie and Angus had listened to this tale breathlessly . Laurie 's blue eyes were like still fire in the soft dusk of the room . " Did n't the little girl ever leave the garden ? " asked Laurie , and now there were tears of pity for the child who remembered nothing but enchantment and dreams . Stuart hesitated . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the garden for a long time , but she never remembered the days , and there were no nights , except for the pearly mist which drifted through the trees . She was very happy , this child in a dream . She ate of the fruit , and slept , and talked to the flowers and the silent swans , and smelled the elderberry . She looked down the tawny throats of the lilies , and stroked the roses , which had no thorns and never faded . She walked over the winding paths , and gazed up at the birds . And then one day , she found the old sunken gate again . She was very surprised to see it . She did not remember it . She pushed on it and it opened soundlessly . She stepped out onto the rutted road . She looked behind her . The garden was hardly to be seen , now . The pearly mist had fallen over it like a translucent cloud . And from somewhere the little girl heard the wind of Heaven , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundering sound , and it frightened her . She wanted to run back into the warm and silent garden , but the gate gently pulled itself from her hand and closed . She put her hands on it and tore frantically at it , but it would not open . She tried to climb it , but it seemed to grow higher and higher , and to be filled with wounding sharp edges . Finally , she fell down upon the ground , tired out , and memory came back to her , and she wept long and deeply , until she was exhausted . And then she discovered that she was no longer a child , but a woman , full-grown . She got to her feet , and walked away down the highway . And it was winter now , cold and raw , with snow flying and the trees blasted and black , and not a bird to be seen . " Did she find a home , and someone to love her ? " cried little Laurie , quite pale , and very eager . Stuart hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was not clear to him . He wondered , with mysterious intuition , whether he should tell the children the rest . " No , " he said , gently , looking into Laurie 's wet eyes , " she never didp108find a home . She never did find anyone who really loved her . Not as she wanted to be loved , I am afraid . Worst of all , after the garden the world seemed very ugly and noisy and cruel and fierce to the girl . She could never get used to it . And one day she tried to find her way back to the garden and the elderberry scent and the golden fruit of dreams . " She never did . And so she died of a broken heart , in the snow . " Again , he looked into Laurie 's eyes . And then he had the strangest thought . He saw the garden reflected in her eyes . Angus was silent . He had made no comment on the story . Stuart felt suddenly very tired and stupid . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , my love , " he said , and kissed her cheek . JANIE recovered from her influenza far sooner than did her sons , Bertie and Robbie . While the two boys still lay in bed , coughing miserably , and threatened with lung fever , Janie had risen gaily , and was sitting by her window , where she could look out over the greening slope and the river with its churning cakes of ice . She thought the sight forbidding , but her naturally vivacious spirits did not permit of any sense of desolation . Dressed in a rich black velvet peignoir , bordered with white fur , her little feet on a white hassock , she looked with sparkling green eyes upon the water , her busy mind engaged with plots and counterplots . Again , her reddish hair had been tortured into ringlets , and she had applied rouge and powder to her sallow , freckled face . Despite her thinness , the result of her influenza , she appeared quite avid and animated . The April sun came through the bright windows and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost arctic wind , of this Northern spring , but it was safely shut out from her . She looked out , her wide thin mouth , painted and mobile , smiling faintly . For Stuart had requested a few minutes with her . She lifted her mirror and studied her face . Not handsome , she reflected , but spirited and lively , as her dear mama had often said . And full of sprightliness and interest . Ah , if it were not for those freckles , and the big Roman nose with the predatory nostrils ! She arranged her head in the proper attitude to minimize the nose . She had drenched herself with musk , and the deep dusky odor permeated the large and perfectly appointed roomp109with its white walls , iron candlesticks , white doors and fireplace , delicatemahogany chests and wardrobe , round soft rug , white canopied bed and little pale blue-and-rose damask chairs . Her sense of luxury , very well developed , was complacently satisfied with what she saw . Yes , Stuart had done himself well . She glowed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laddie , and one of her own kidney . They would do well together . Her wizened heart stirred with something quite like warm affection and pleasure . Suddenly , she thought of poor wild Robin with his strange and movingvoice , his lighted face and quick wild gestures . Her mouth curled with cruel contempt , her eyes narrowed , and glinted . The feckless fool ! The damned , ridiculous lark ! She laughed shortly , and it was an ugly sound . She had gotten nothing from Robin but four inconvenient and unwanted children . In her youth , she reflected , a girl visualized a man in her bed . When she was older , she visualized money in the bank . But that was when she had acquired wisdom . The door of the wardrobe was half open . Janie contemplated the endless neat rows of her frocks , her gleaming velvets , her purple pelisses , her sable and ermine capes , her silken cloaks . On the shelf above were the boxes that contained her wondrous bonnets , each more ravishing than the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier town , she would soon be the full gay leader . She would teach these boors and barbarians the amenities of polite and elegant society , the civil niceties of good breeding . She saw herself languishing on Stuart 's arm , as they entered a shadowy drawing-room , all the drab ladies envying her her magnificent toilette , all the gentlemen bewitched . So absorbed was she in deciding the gown she must wear upon her first appearance in Grandeville society , that she did not hear Stuart 's knock . It was not until she heard his hearty voice in greeting that she looked up , with a start . Stuart stood in the doorway , a wide grin on his face . He was very uneasy , and covered it with affected gaiety . He came to her across the sunlit floor , and bent and kissed her cheek , affectionately . " Well , well ! Hove pleasant to see you up , and hearty again , my love ! " he exclaimed . He glanced about the shining room complacently , his gaze sharpeningto discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the maids had left a speck of dust on any darkly gleaming surface . Ah , was that the mark of a glass on the bedside cabinet ? He went over to it , bent and scrutinized the mark , put his head first this way then that , frowned , rubbed the mark tentatively with his finger . His browp110cleared . It was only the grain of the wood . Relieved , he straightened up , smiled at the little rosy fire , and returned to Janie with more sincereheartiness than before . She had watched him with her slanted eyes , a nasty little smile on her mouth . Nevertheless , she melted when she saw his beaming ruddinessand handsomeness . He put his hand on the back of her chair , and his grin became somewhat absent and thoughtful . He had something on his mind . He must use a measure of duplicity . Sometimes he thought himself a very clever fellow indeed , shrewd and knowing , and he anxiously wished everyone to believe that of him . However , deep in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . But he envied their serenity and peace of mind . Peace of mind , he had decided ruefully , was given only to idiots and the wicked , those too benighted to have a conscience , and those who had been conveniently born without one . Janie 's gaze was very sharp , and he felt uncomfortable under its tentative reflection . He patted her cheek , sat near her . He took her thin freckled hand . " You are feeling quite well now , eh , my pet ? " " Perfectly , " she replied , in her loud hoarse voice . She coquetted at him . " How good and thoughtful you 've been to me , darling Stuart . I 'm fair humbled . " " Well , now , " he said , expansively , leaning back in his chair and crossinghis long fine legs , " it was nothing at alL I wanted you to be comfortable , in your illness . The children have been well cared for . I 've seen to that . And so we can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he was silent , studying her closely . Could he pass her off as an exalted relative ? Certainly , her toilettes and her jewels and her scents , ( and her money ) were impressive enough . If he could just persuade her to watch her blasphemous tongue , and not to laugh so loud and so coarsely ! He cleared his throat , and smiled uncomfortably . " The Mayor 's wife , Mrs. Cummings , sends you her deepest regards , Janie . She wishes to know when you will be well enough to attend a party given in your honor . Cummings and I are good friends , you know . " Janie , pleased , bridled . She was agreeably surprised , also . " The Mayor , Smart ? How very gratifying ! Please inform his lady that I shall be well enough to accept her gracious invitation next week , at any time . " She paused . " Is she a very handsome lady , Stuart ? And young ? And elegant ? " Stuart thought of Alicia Cummings , short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , the sweetest smile , and no style at all . " She is a lady , " he said , emphatically , and with warmth , as if defendingher from the Janies . " Everyone loves her . No , she is not young . But she is very good . Charitable works , without tiresome piety . It is a pleasure to be in her company , for she is always civil and kind , and genuinely concerned . And very witty and learned . " " No doubt it is easy to be kind to personable young men , and very concerned , " suggested Janie , slyly , licking her lips . All at once , she made Mrs. Cummings appear to be a lascivious old beldame , full of obscene and crafty desires for young men , and possessed of all foulness . Stuart felt suddenly sick and enraged . He turned his inner eye away from Mrs. Cummings , as though she had been offended by his very look . But he controlled himself . He only turned a little livid about his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat muffled : " Mrs. Cummings is very kind to everyone . She is the confidante of every young girl in her circle , and the friend of anyone who needs friendship in affliction . I have heard no word against her . " He wanted to get up and leave the room . He could not endure Janie 's silently laughing face , the flash of her sharp predatory teeth between her painted lips . All at once she appeared hideous and hateful to him , and loathsome . She said , in a horribly soft tone : " I am sure that Mrs. Cummings is a delightful lady , and I shall be overwhelmed to accept her invitation . Please extend my regards to her , and thank her for her kindness . " " I shall , ma'am , " said Stuart , in an unnatural voice . " How would you like to drive with me to the shops , my love ? " he asked . " It is a fine day , and the air will do you good . Wear furs , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The warm sun is deceptive . " " I should like a drive , indeed , " assented Janie , with genuine pleasure . " How thoughtful of you , dear Stuart . " He rose , coloring uneasily . He said : " I 've been in to see Bertie and Robbie . Bertie is very restless , but Robbie still reads his damned book of murders . The rascal is actually making notes ! He draws diagrams . A changeling , that 's what he is . " " A shrewd lad , " commented Janie . " We 'll make a braw lawyer out of that one . " Stuart hesitated . He looked at her with simple earnestness . " I 've been talking to Angus , too . Nearly fourteen , he says . A big lad . Do you knowp112what he told me the other night ? He said that his Grand-da had promised to let him be a doctor . He was to have gone to Edinburgh , to study with Dr. Maclntosh , the surgeon . I 've almost promised to see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " Janie 's face narrowed with dark evil . " A doctor ? " she said . " He has it in him , Janie . He 's the heart of a doctor . Self-sacrificing and devoted . I know it . I always recognize true goodness . There 's some'at of the martyr about him . " " Pious ! " exclaimed Janie , as if that were the most degraded epithet in her vocabulary , and the most shameful . " It 's to the kirk he 'll be goingevery day , if you do n't watch him , and not minding his lessons . " " He could do worse ! " cried Stuart , forgetting his purpose in coming to this room . " I 'll be taking him to Father Houlihan for consolation and advice ! " Janie sat bolt upright in her chair , and her eyes were malignant in their green flashings . " You 'll not make a snivelling damn Papist of my son ! " she exclaimed . " You 'll not have him worshipping idols and bowingto Holy Marys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , God damn it ! " shouted Stuart , quite crimson . " You talk like a fool ! Grundy would n't harm the lad ! He 'll not be converting him ! Grundy 's got wit and intelligence , you besom ! Have you no kind thought or word for anyone ? " Janie was not shaken . She was always invigorated and exhilarated in the presence of screaming voices , oaths and violence . " You 'll not take him to a priest ! " she shrieked . " I shall give him my express command ! " Stuart 's clenched fist opened and itched . He wanted to slap her viciously in the face . He ached to do it . Involuntarily , the muscles of his arm contracted , and the limb lifted . Janie had another idea . She saw Stuart 's involuntary gesture , and she was as excited by it as any wild tigress . " Consolation ! " she screamed . " What consolation , you fool ? Why does my son need consolation ? " She could not resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he 's got a hellion for a mother ! " shouted Stuart , even louder than before . " Because you 've made his life a curse , harrying him and cuffing him , and frightening the life out of him with your bad nature ! " Then , all at once , they were both grimly silent . They panted audibly in the quiet sunlit air of the warm room . They stared at each other unblinkingly . Janie was thinking that she had been a fool , that she hadp113antagonized Stuart , when it had been her express determination to " soften all over him , " and predispose him to marriage . And Stuart was thinking that he had quite kicked over his private applecart , and that nothing could now placate Janie . They both hated themselves , and cursed themselves inwardly . Stuart was the first to recover . He made himself smile . His face was still crimson , and it was damp . He felt the moisture pricking all along the forehead line of his thick black hair . He said , lamely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are fighting and yammering as we did when we were children together , are n't we , Janie ? It makes me homesick for the old days . " Janie , enormously relieved , laughed raucously . " The old days ! ' " she repeated . " Ah , it fair makes me want to cry , Stuart . " And because she was so excited , so stimulated , she burst into genuine tears . Stuart , though he hated her , was not insensible to the tears of a woman . There was a core of weak softness in him . Besides , his own reliefwas so profound that he trembled . He went to her at once , and put his arm about her shoulders , and kissed her red curls . " Ah , come , come , my darling ! You are breaking my heart . Wo n't you forgive me , Janie ? I shall be inconsolable if you do n't . " Janie could almost always detect duplicity . She saw that Stuart was sincere , and her spirits rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a bad thing and merited no kindness from him , and that he had been so thoughtful of her , and so kind , and that he must straightway put her out of his house and send her home . " No , no , " said Stuart , pitying her , and seeing her as she desired him to see her : a homeless widow with four helpless children , thrown upon a heartless world . " It was I who was wrong . This is my house , and you are my darling guest , and my dear love of a Janie . Forgive me , my pet . " They wallowed in their emotionalism . Stuart 's , at least , was sincere . Janie grinned craftily to herself , her face buried against his shoulder . Later , they sat close together , their hands entwined . Janie was all ardor and stimulation . Stuart felt vaguely sick and weak . But he was very kind to his cousin . He could now approach her on the subject of her exalted background . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vulgar new society , my love , " he began . " The people here know nothing of elegant manners , or true aristocracy . You will laugh at their pretensions , as I do . They are raw and ignorant . Also , they havep114the most extraordinary ideas as to what constitutes a lady of the aristocracy . So , they are excessively genteel . They believe that a true lady or gentleman is very mincing and delicate in speech , and full of sublimehauteur and daintinesses , and would swoon at the slightest hearty word . Never having observed at close range any real gentlefolk , they have been compelled to use their imagination . As they are low-bred , they imagine , with malice , how they would treat their inferiors should they have been born to nobility . Some of them are even thinking of pink coats and hounds , but there is an uneasy prejudice in America against British customs , even though the people are of British stock almost entirely . They think longingly , however , of the British ways of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " " How excessively diverting ! " exclaimed Janie , genuinely interested , and full of scornful laughter for these plebeians . " It is pathetic , somewhat , " remonstrated Stuart . " These low-born , ill-bred poor creatures have nothing but their affectations and their hiddendesires to console them for the barrenness of their money-grubbing lives . To each man his peculiar consolation . We must not forget , too , that these pretenders are powerful in America . They are so powerful all over that they can retain slavery in the Southern States , and gouge the workers in their industrial factories , in the North . They browbeat , quell and oppress , in the true way of all low-bred men . It is very sad , though . Someone ought to teach them true gentleness of manners , and the simple kindness of those who are authentically well-born . Someone ought to convince them that gentlefolk are not concerned with money or money-getting . It would be a revelation to Americans . " Janie smiled irresistibly . What a darling simpleton was this Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fell in with his mood . " I see , " she said , gravely , her quick mind already ahead of his . He sighed with relief . " Well , then , should you , Janie , upon presentationto them , be your simple , natural , well-born self , without affectationsand graces , they would immediately condemn you as being no aristocrat . They would look askance at you . Should you speak in your usual robust way , they would be horrified . Should you pretend to no exalted antecedents , and refrain from bragging and exaggerating , they would consider you inferior . You are a lady . But you must fill the frame of their imagination to convince them that you are . You must fall in with their idea of gentlefolk . " Janie , the natural actress , was delighted . " I shall simper , blush and cut attitudes , in the most amazing way ! " she exclaimed . " I shall be sopII5delicate that I shall swoon at a light word , and have the vapors if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most illustrious ancestors , with portraits and ghost-haunted castles , and moats and drawbridges . Let me see : Lady Constance Vere de Vere was my **25;907;TOOLONG ! She was so dainty that she fainted at a loud voice ! " " Splendid , " said Stuart , though with inner doubt . He gnawed his lip . He had not admitted to any Lady Vere de Vere . He must tell Janie about Sir Angus Fraser . Smiling in a somewhat sickly fashion , he confessed to Janie his previous inventions . She laughed uproariously , and slapped his knee so vigorously that he winced . He was ashamed , both of himself and of her . But he was relieved that Janie had understood him so completely , and that she was entering into the play . " I only want them to appreciate you , and not misjudge or deprecate you , my dear , " he said , very lamely . " I want them to do you justice . " Janie winked . " Have no doubts , darling Stuart . They shall adore me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm with your fan , no tripping and showing your ankles , no swearing , no robust remarks , " pleaded Stuart . " None ! " cried Janie , throwing herself back in her chair in the most elegant of postures , and half closing her eyes , and fanning herself with her kerchief . " I shall be the delicate genteel widow , of the purest blue blood , with a voice like an angel , and with fluttering lashes . You shall see ! You shall be proud of me ! " Stuart had his serious doubts . But he sighed with relief , and got to his feet . Janie looked at him , then had another thought . " This Mr. Allstairs you mentioned , lovey . Is he one of the local aristocrats , also ? And his amazing daughter , Marvina ? " Stuart , calling on his easy duplicity again , made himself look her boldly in the eye , and smiled broadly . " Yes , my love . He is the richest man in Grandeville , one of the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meet him . Miss Marvina ? Well , I confess I was at one time attracted by her pretty face . But , heavens ! she is dull , dull ! Like a varnished wax doll . Do be kind to her , dear Janie . The poor girl has n't the wit of a newborn calf . Do not make fun of her . " " You have n't made any commitments with regard to the treasure , Miss Marvina , Stuart ? Commitments that might be misconstrued by the ogre of a father ? " " None at all ! None at all ! As I said , I was attracted , as were a dozenp116other men in Grandeville . But life with an empty doll , I decided , would be a horrible affair . " His spirits soared again . He had come off very well ! Janie was practicallyconvinced . Her sharp green eyes were almost soft . " But you did say , my pet , that you intended to ask for her hand , " she pointed out to him , doubtfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shall we say I 've changed my mind ? " he asked , with false archness . Janie was intoxicated . She had always believed that Stuart was a simple soul , without successful dissimulation , and that he could certainlynever deceive anyone as clever as Janie Cauder . Why , he was a child , a lovable simpleton , a zany . She looked at him coyly , and waited . He knew what she wanted . His body grew tight with repulsion . But he made himself bend deliberately and kiss her on the lips with ardor . He had accomplished his first step . The other would come later in the day . It was worth it . But when he left the room , he could not believe it , in his sickened heart . When she was alone , Janie hied herself to the chest of drawers , unlocked the lower drawer , and , from under billows of lace and fine linen underwear , produced a bottle of whiskey , half emptied . She held it high in her hand , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah ! " she said , richly , smacking her lips , and chuckling with pleasure . She tilted the bottle to her lips and drank deep and long . " Ah , " she said again , on a prolonged respiration of satisfaction . She replacedthe cork , hid the bottle again , with slow and loving movements . " A wee drap is guid for the soul o ' a mon , " her father had often remarked , relating how his father would drink a full glass of whiskey three times a day with his porridge or haggis or boiled mutton . The old man had lived to the fine age of one hundred and ten , and never a morning passed but that , in shawl and kilts , he had climbed the snowy hills to look at his sheep , and to stamp about , vigorous and ruddy , in all the glory of his six feet three inches of magnificent health . Janie , apparently , agreed with her grandfather that a " wee drap " was the elixir of life . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer again and put the key in her bosom . She began to hum hoarsely under her breath , then to caper about the room like a femalep117goat , exulting and laughing aloud , as if nothing could restrain her , her skirts flying about her thin little legs , her red curls bouncing , her face a bright mask of merry evil . STUART brought his finest equipage , drawn by two gleaming black horses , to the gravel side-drive of the house . Harness and wheels glittered in the spring sunshine . The coachman secured the reins , then jumped out . Stuart intended to drive . He stood by the vehicle , tenderly rubbing his hand over the black varnished sides , blowing on the silver lamps , and polishing them lovingly with his kerchief . The horses looked at him sideways , showing the whites of their eyes . He patted their watered-silk black rumps , and pretended to examine the silver harness . Then , satisfied and smug , he breathed deeply of the strong fresh air , glittering with sunlight , and awaited Janie . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , worrying about her maiden appearance in Grandeville public places . Then he relaxed . Janie , as if she had known what carriage awaited her , was all black velvet and purple . Her frock , elegantly draped and restrained , fitted her perfectly . A number of silver chains hung about her neck . She wore a marvelous sable cloak over this elegance and picture of fashion , and black kid gloves . Her huge , black-velvet bonnet had purple violets cunningly peeping out from under its brim , accentuatingher bright red hair . She minced down the white stairs from the doorway , and pleased , Stuart gallantly extended his hand to her . She was the picture of a delicate and wistful little widow , all fragility and modesty . She had even used restraint in the matter of rouge , and under the very slightest coating of powder her freckles were evident , and a little touching in their simplicity . It was only when she grinned wickedlyat Stuart , showing her sharp and predatory white teeth , that the picture became distorted . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat with eyes demurely downcast , her gloved hands in her sable muff . Then he sprang up beside her . He began to laugh . " Do n't put on so much , " he warned , with a wide smile . " Just be a little natural . " She looked up at him , her long green eyes sparkling naughtily , andp118thrust out her tongue at him for an instant . He quite liked her now . This was the old gay Janie whom he had loved , whose wickedness had been so fascinating . " No swearing , remember , and keep your voice low and sweet , " he said , but with fondness . Stuart , himself , was very handsome and dashing in his many-taped brown great-coat , and his tall beaver hat , and his ruffles and gloves . He guided the spirited horses up the grade to the muddy roadway that led into town . He felt very carefree , for some reason . Beside him , Janie was quiet and graceful , but he could feel her repressed vitality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , if she will just behave herself , all will be well . Purposely avoiding the meaner streets , he drove , jingling , through quiet sections under trees still bare and brown , and by hedges still black and twisted . Water ran between the rough cobbles of the road . The plank walks were still sodden . The houses had an ugly and barren look , their red brick or wooden facades grimy from winter rains and chimneysoot . But the wind that came from the Lake and the river was strong and fresh , and had an exhilarating smell , and the sun was bright and clear , and the pale blue sky pellucid . Stuart had warned Janie that this would be a long ride . But she was not bored . She peeped about her with patronizing interest . She thought the town very ugly and muddy , with a raw lack of symmetry and beauty . The tall narrow houses , gloomy on their muddy lawns , were indeed excessively hideous , with cupolas and wooden fretwork and deep dark verandahs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blowing dun-colored cloak , minced along the walks , or children played spasmodically , enjoying the release from winter . Carriages passed , the occupants craning out to stare at Stuart 's handsome equipage , to exchange greetings with him ( as he touched the whip gallantly to his hat ) and to scrutinize the demure little lady beside him , so preciously immured in her sables and carriage robes . This , Stuart informed her , was Niagara Street , so called because it ran beside the river for some distance . It was a street of middle-class people , of the professions and the shops . He sat very straight on his seat , controlling his horses , chatting lightly with Janie , explaining landmarksto her , and pointing to them with his whip . Without stopping his exposition , he bowed repeatedly to the passing carriages , and smiled , his strong teeth flashing in the cool sunlight . Finally , he turned up anotherstreet to lower Main , and pointed down it . " My shops , " he said . Janie leaned forward to peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about which she had spent many long days of ab/sorbed guessing . And then she was quite impressed . The shops filled one longish block , and though uneven , and apparently built at different times by different owners , they had a grand and compact air , the windowspolished and glittering , and carriages drawn up outside . Here all was busyness and comings-and-goings , with house-boys following welldressedladies to the carriages , their arms filled with boxes and bundles . As they slowly passed the first shops , Janie was impressed by the crowded interiors , the activities of clerks ; and the milling bonnets and the constant opening and shutting of doors . She looked at the long gilt sign : " Grandeville Supreme Emporium , " and the red-and-white stripes and the snowy stars of the flag that flew from the flag-pole near the main shop . Stuart was quite flushed with pride and swelling embarrassment . lie ladies on the walks stopped to stare at the elegant equipage . They collected in groups . They watched Stuart grandly offering his hand to the strange little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bending her bonnet so that her face was hidden . They whispered together , furtively . This must be Mr. Coleman 's elegant female relative from England . What sables , what velvets , what fashion and gentility ! They craned their necks to study her wardrobe , and envied her . They tried to see her face , but could catch glimpses only of a red curl or two . The redness pleased them , for red hair was considered the supreme ugliness . Stuart affected to be totally oblivious of the watchers . He seemed tenderly concerned with the little elegant creature , who put her hand timidly on his proffered arm and minced beside him into the rich shop , her velvet skirts flowing about her gracefully , the muff held close to her face as if to protect its delicate texture from the cold wind . They entered the main shop with a stately air , measured and majestic , as if about to go into the measures of a minuet . One of the street urchins , who had been watching , absorbed , broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ladies , with whom it was a principle never to acknowledge the existence of the lower classes , neverthelessbestowed upon the perspicacious urchin the gracious acknowledgment of his demonstration , and were highly pleased with him . They lingered on the walks , discussing the newcomer , and speaking in unconsciouslyaffected voices , as if practicing their grammar and correctness of speech in anticipation . Janie was astounded , in spite of her planned supercilious smiles , at the really elegant and luxurious interior of the main shop , its Turkey-pI20 red carpets , its small , carved , comfortable chairs with red plush seats , the polished mahogany counters , the wide neat shelves with their burdens of a really amazing assortment of fine silks and linens and damasks and velvets , the tables of excellent Limoges and Haviland china , the silver , the assorted Dresden and marble ornaments , the laces and ribbons and scents , and all the other countless objects calculated to seduce the feminine heart . She was pleased by the air of great prosperity in the large shop There were three active gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed polished boots waiting on the crowd of eager and examining ladies . Lengths of gleaming velvet , of shining silk , of glistening linen , lay over the counters , and there was a great and active sound of snipping . Ladies ' hooped skirts billowed incessantly , and with much rustling , from counter to counter . Bonnets were bent together for consultation , muffs lifted to hide whispers and evaluations . Young boys went in and out to the carriages , with boxes and bundles . The bell sounded constantly in the bustle . The china being examined tinkled , and once or twice a lady disputed a price with a bowing clerk . The spring sunshine poured like a cataract through the shining win dows , which were framed in dark blue velvet . There was a warm smell here of discreet sachet and rose-water , and the rich scent of luxurious fabrics . Over some of the chairs the ladies had thrown their tippets and furred cloaks , and the silk linings added splashes of purple and red and blue to the lively scene . Janie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterlycowing these barbarians , but for some time she and Stuart went unnoticed amid the activity . Stuart swelled with importance and complacency . He pressed the little gloved hand on his arm in eloquent and delighted communication . A stout , middle-aged lady in black silk and black fur and a big black bonnet , turned , summoned her waiting boy , and ordered him to pick up some newly wrapped packages for her . She had a sturdy but ex ceedingly intelligent face with bright pink cheeks , twinkling blue eyes , and a humorous fine mouth with one corner chronically turned upwardsin a gently satirical fashion , and a dark eyebrow that followed suit . Her smooth thick hair was quite gray , which gave her face a youthful freshness in comparison . She was all competence and precision of movement , and the ladies smiled at her respectfully as she prepared to take her departure . Stuart caught her eye , and bowed deeply . Gently , he led Janie for- " THE GETTING OF TREASURES " I2Iward . The lady waited , eyebrow and mouth quirking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness . " My dear , clear Mrs. Cummings ! " exclaimed Stuart , softly , " and how are you today ? May I present my dear cousin , Mrs. Cauder ? It is a great honor ! Janie , my love , this is Mrs. Howard Cummings , the Mayor 's lady . " The ladies curtseyed briefly . Then Mrs. Cummings extended her tnitted hand to Janie , who took it in her narrow little fingers . She instantlyhated Mrs. Cummings , whose hand was full and warm and strong . She hated the shrewd kind eyes that estimated her , and the eyebrowand the quirking sardonic mouth . As for Mrs. Cummings , her honest face took on a subtly bland expression , and there was a quick ' narrowing of one eyelid . " How very nice ! " murmured Mrs. Cummings . " My dear , I hope you will like our Grandeville . You have received my messages during your illness ? And Stuart has conveyed to you my invitation to dinner ? " Janie 's naturally hoarse and booming voice lowered itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you , Mrs. Cummings . Stuart has spoken so extravagantly of his dear friends . It was kind of you to remember me , a stranger in a strange land , so far away from my dear mama and papa , and my brothers and sisters . " She paused a moment , to let her eyes fall and a look of sorrow to come over her face . She was all meekness and defenselessness . Then she lifted her eyes again to look bravely at Mrs. Cummings , and to allow a brave smile to touch her mouth . " But I am not going to be unhappy ! That would be impossible , in the presence of so much kindness and civility from dear Stuart 's friends ! I trust I shall not be ungrateful . " Mrs. Cummings smiled , but was silent . Her gaze was fastened thoughtfully on Janie , though it was not unkind . Then she said : " I understand that you have four children , Mrs. Cauder . How very comfortingfor you ! " Janie simpered , sighed , touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cummings , you can not imagine the comfort ! I could not endure living without my darlings . " " You are to be envied , " said Mrs. Cummings , and now she sighed a little , and smiled again . " I have only one child , my little Alice , who is trtt years old , and very frail , I am afraid . It will be pleasant for her to k now your children , Mrs. Cauder . " All at once the good woman appeared uneasy , and a little breathless , which was very startling as she was famous for her poise and composure. to said , hurriedly : " I must truly go . You will remember my dinner ,  | Mrs. Cauder ? And you , Stuart ? " She turned to Stuart as she mentioned his name , and looked at him strangely , and the eyebrow and the mouth were not quirking now . Her fresh color had inexplicably faded . Stuart bowed , expressing his deep gratitude . As he spoke , Mrs. Cummings ' strange look deepened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away . Stuart gallantly opened the door for her . She smiled at him for an instant , a breathless and disturbed smile , and went down the steps followed by her boy , loaded with parcels . Stuart , after a moment 's hesitation , and completely forgetting Janie , hurriedly followed in Mrs. Cummings ' wake , brushed aside her coachman , and assistedher into the carriage . She made a big pretense of being engaged in adjusting her cloak , skirts and bonnet , while the boy loaded the carriage . Stuart 's Celtish intuition murmured dimly . Frowning thoughtfully , he returned slowly to the shop . What had disturbed Mrs. Cummings ? In justice , he could blame nothing on Janie , who had been all civility and discretion . Mrs. Cummings , perhaps , had had a twinge , a sudden headache . Ah , that must explain it ! His volatile spirits rose again , and with a dashing swagger he closed the door behind him and stood again at Janie 's side . She gave his arm a secret but vicious pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking up at him archly . " So , that is our old dear friend , Mrs. Cummings ! " she muttered . " How fond she appeared of you , darling Stuart ! " " She is one of my best customers ! " said the young man . He said heatedly , as if defending Mrs .. Cummings : " Her patronage is very valuable , I assure you , Janie ! I would rather any other lady in the city were offendedbut Mrs. Cummings ! " Janie interrupted sweetly : " I did not offend her , my love . Was I not all primness and respectability ? " Stuart was at a confused loss . Another lady , having concluded her purchases , turned . She was a huge fat woman , dressed in crimson velvet , her cloak bordered with black seal , her muff enormous , her crimson bonnet quite the largest in the shop . She was monumental ; she was shapeless ; she was completelyoverpowering because of sheer bulk . The bonnet framed a pink and white face of distinctly porcine cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repellent expression . Her mouth was thick and pursed in a chronically arrogant and belligerent look , and her short thick nose was like a snout . She jingled with chains and bangles ; her cheeks and forehead were moist . She exuded a smothering scent of musk . Her hair was thick and yellowish and coarse . She was about thirty-eightp123years old , and she gave one an impression of complete insensibility , suspicion , coarseness and brutality . Stuart bowed to her deeply , and beamed , though he hated her for her arrogance and insensate peasantness , her domineering ways and her pretense at gentility . " My dear , dear Mrs. Schnitzel ! " he exclaimed , warmly . " I have not seen you lately . I trust you have not been ill ? " Mrs. Schnitzel stared at him with porcine hauteur , as if suspecting his civil words of some ulterior design . She appeared to swell and bristle . Then she deigned a smile of supreme condescension . " I have been in New York , Mr. Coleman , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lifted her big head impressively , then turned to stare unblinkingly at Janie , whom she immediately despised because of her small and graceful figure and style . Dislike glittered in the tiny black eyes . " Ah , yes , " said Stuart , flushing . " Mrs. Schnitzel , this is my cousin , Mrs. Cauder , just from England . Janie , my dear , this is Mrs. Otto Schnitzel , the lady of the owner of our largest slaughter-house . " The lady bowed with majesty , like an empress acknowledging the impudent presence of an inferior . Janie looked up at that vast swinish face . " Mrs. Schnitzel ! " she began , in a whispering scream of incredulity and mirth , then caught herself quickly . She curtseyed . Mrs. Schnitzel did not curtsey . She swelled even more with her importance and condescension . She moved away like a ship in full sail , her crimson velvet skirts sweeping behind her , her cloak swaying . Stuart opened the door for her , bowed , and then watched the stately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie , whose little face was convulsed . " My darling Stuart ! " she whispered , trembling with merriment , her eyes sparkling irrepressibly . " What an odious female ! Schnitzel ! And what , in the name of God , is that name ? Schnitzel ! " Stuart could not restrain a grin . His Celtish soul hated the Teuton too deeply for repression . " A German sow , " he whispered , in return . " Grandeville has many of them  --  these Germans . A horrible people . Brutish . Slaughter-houses and tanneries and sausage factories . Appropriateto their natures . None of them are accepted in genteel society except a few like the Schnitzels , who are very rich and very pretentious . " " Schnitzel ! " exclaimed Janie . " My dear God ! What an appalling name ! Do they all have such names ? " " Some are worse , like our Schnickelburgers , for instance , " said Stuart.  | " Hush ! We are talking too loud . Would you like to see the other shops now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why does America allow them here , my love ? Such names ! Such faces ! Such --  " Such swine , " added Stuart . His face darkened . He remembered , with anger , that it was Otto Schnitzel who had threateningly advised the Mayor to prohibit the building of any more Catholic churches in Grandeville , and to prevent the coming of nuns into the city . It was Emil Schnickelburger , too , who had insulted poor old Grundy publicly , on the main street of Grandeville , and had splashed him with mud from his carriage wheels . It was Gustav Zimmermann who had ordered Sam Berkowitz to move off the walk into the mud when the swelling Germanwas passing . Sam had not so moved , and the German had refused to pass by him , turning away with an obscene Teutonic oath , and a lifted cane . Stuart was now so disturbed that he decided not to introduce Janie to the other engrossed ladies , though they were eyeing them both furtively . He conducted Janie from the shop , with an air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they went from one to the other , Janie was genuinely impressed . Her eyes blinked thoughtfully . Her manner towards Stuart became more intimate and fond and delighted . Her fifteen thousand pounds were safe , then , from any cousinly fortune-hunter . This vast and prosperousestablishment was obviously not only on a paying basis , but the source of much revenue . Stuart , in spite of her previous opinion , was apparently possessed of an extraordinary amount of business acumen and enterprise . She saw that he had many employees . She saw the streaming carriages . She saw the activity . She heard the jingle of money . It was like a bee-hive about the shops , and Stuart assured her that on Saturday the streets about the shops were impassable . Every barge that came up the Canal was loaded with his goods . Twice a year he went to New York , where he negotiated for the import of the finest European merchandise from England and France , and even from Italy and the Orient . There was no limit to what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wonderful plans , he hinted , but that must wait a little . He had not finished expanding . She saw that not all of this was bombast , but based on shrewd businessintuition . It was a land for dreamers , for bold entrepreneurs , for imaginative adventurers who gambled largely and won magnificently . Her insular soul was shaken. pI25 " You must save a lot of money , my love , " she said , tentatively , moisteningher lips avidly . Stuart hesitated . He smiled down at her patronizingly . " That is not the way to make a fortune in America , my pet , " he assured her . " This is not England , where you laboriously add penny to penny . Many a trickle makes a muckle , ' to quote your esteemed father . No , that is not our way in America . In England , one puts pence in the bank and watches them grow to painful pounds . In America , we put our pounds back into our enterprises , and watch them make golden for-t unes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow little island . One can not estimate things here . One must venture , if one is to gain , and not venture with pennies , but with fortunes . " Janie was shrewd and intuitive , also . She was shaken to her foundations . She saw all the possibilities . Suddenly her fifteen thousand pounds were a meager thing , a miserable drop of water in a golden well that was bottomless . She had thought of herself as an heiress . She was apparentlyonly a poor widow with a mite . Her heart burned with greed . She would be conferring nothing on Stuart with her wretched pounds , he who had hundreds of thousands of pounds in mind . She leaned against him , clinging to him , as they went from shop to shop . Stuart had intended her to be impressed . He had exaggerated . I Ie had hoped , at best , to put her into a state of mind in which she would be amenable to a loan of ten thousand dollars to him . He felt her to be impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been delirious with pleasure . She met Sam Berkowitz in one of the shops , and she stared at him forbiddingly . Not knowing the full extent of his share in this dazzling prosperity , she thought of him as a hanger-on , kept here by the noble generosity of the gilded Stuart . She was very prim and reticent towards him , as befitted a Christian , while he looked at her silently with his hooded and lighted brown eyes , and bowed to her courteously . She did not know that he followed her with his long sad gaze as she swept from the shops , and that he shook his head a little . JANIE ate alone with Stuart that evening for the first time since her illness . The beautiful dining-room was golden with candlelight . Stuart had ordered an especially fine dinner . He plied Janie with excellent wines . Gradually her coldness of flesh warmed . The golden light swam all about her . She laughed louder and louder , sitting there in her best blue velvet and pearls , her curls red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich with ribald jokes . Her glass was never empty . Never had she felt so deliciously free , so fascinating , so full of worldliness and poise , so clever and sparkling . She was in her proper place at last . Her old home was entirely forgotten . Her onerous children did not exist . She had no parents , no memories . She was an elegant lady of gracious salons and waltzes and music and fine toilettes , fascinatinga handsome and beloved companion whom she was about to marry . Because of her exhilaration , she appeared quite intriguing , even to Stuart . How had he forgotten what a gay companion Janie was ? How had he forgotten that one was never bored in her company , and that her effervescent and cruel little malices were so witty ? On a wave of huge and boisterous laughter , they went together into the lovely drawing-room , where a great fire burned and fresh liqueurs were set out . They drank each other 's health again and again . The most tender affection and excitement pervaded them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly she rose , pulled up her flowingand swelling skirts and waltzed about the room , showing her silken knees , and even her thighs , most licentiously . Stuart applauded noisily . Janie cavorted and swayed , kicked and pranced quite gracefully , while Stuart bellowed : " Bravo ! Bravo ! " The children , far up in their beds , listened , and Bertie , in his nightshirt , stole to the head of the stairs , grinning and snapping his fingers . " Mama 's at it again , " he whispered to Robbie , who was indifferent . Angus sighed in his bed , arose and shut the door of the bedroom of his frightened little sister , after kissing her and getting her assurance that she had said her prayers . The servantspeeped in at the revellers and went away , snickering . Janie at last collapsed , weak with laughter and exercise , and sprawled on a damask sofa . She allowed Stuart to take her hand and pull her upright . He bent and kissed her , out of sheer exuberance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great was her ardor that he was suddenly warned . Gently , he disengaged himself and sat near her while she , laughing , smoothed her curls and pulled down her gown . " Never have I enjoyed myself so ! " she shouted , flinging out her arms . " Ah , it 's a rare devil you are , Stuart ! " He sat , not far from her , his hands on his knees , laughing uncontrollably . His black eyes dwelt on her cunningly . It was really a prettyp127little piece , this Janie . His neck felt thick and pulsing ; the veins started in his forehead . What the devil ! She was no child , but a woman older than he , and ready . It was a lewd baggage , knowing and lusty . A night might be pleasantly spent with her , and no one the wiser . She saw his eyes , and a long hot thrill ran over her body . Ah , there was more than one way to skin a cat ! There was no doubt that Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Once involved with her , he could not retreat . Besides , he had the kindest heart . She lifted her arms with deliberate languor and rearranged her hair . Her waist was tiny and neat , in its stays . She regretted that she had not more bosom . Her green eyes narrowed seductively . Stuart moved on his chair . But there was one thing that Janie did not know about Stuart . He was tenacious . He was crafty . He put first things first , most of the time . Later , he would consider other things . He had no scruples . He went to the sofa and sat down beside her , taking her hand . He kissed it gallantly Then , though the fumes of the wine were still boilingin him , his mind became clear . Janie looked at him ardently . She was very silent now . He allowed his face to become thoughtful , even grave . " Janie , my love , " he began , in a serious and considering voice , " you told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . " He shook his head . " That is very little for America . I 've been worrying very much about you . " He cleared his throat , and appeared embarrassed . " Even should you remarry , that money is little enough . I should like to see you possessed of much more . It is the least I can do for you . " Janie sat up alertly , her eyes gleaming in the firelight . She wet her lips in the familiar covetous manner . Her hand tightened in his . " Yes , " she said , softly . " It 's the least I can do , " he repeated , in a firmer voice , as though challenging an unseen listener , who might be very admonishing . " Yes , the very least . So I 've thought of a way . Mind you , I 'll encounter much difficulty . But I 'm prepared for argument and disagreement , and protests . We are a closed partnership . We 've never considered such a thing  --  " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie was tense . " Go on , Stuart , " she commanded . " After all , we are cousins , are we not ? " He sighed , without answering for a time . Then , in a lower and reluctant voice , he continued : " Janie , even though your money was safep128in the banks , consider the interest . Very small . Should you decide not to remarry , you could not live on that interest , in the pleasant manner to which you are accustomed . Not in America , at least , and not with four children . Money does n't grow by itself . You would be compelled to live on the principal . Your fortune would soon go . Who , then , would marry an impecunious widow , with four children ? " Janie regarded him with gray fear . Her eyes blinked . She bit her lip . Stuart was much disturbed . " Do not think it is easy for me to speak to you like this , Janie . I wish I could do something for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , but he protests " The Jew ! " cried Janie , enraged , and beating the sofa with her clenched fist . Stuart winced . He cleared his throat . " Janie , do n't say that . It is n't quite true . But a man has to protect his interests , you understand . However , " and he sat up , quite exultant , " I have thought of a way ! " " Yes ! " exclaimed Janie , her face lighting up with eagerness . " Yes , Stuart ! " He turned to her , and gripped her shoulders excitedly . His hands were strong . His face was alight . He was an excellent actor . He cried : " Janie , would you be willing to invest twenty thousand dollars in my shops ? " A sudden cold wave swept over Janie , an old Scottish caution and suspicion . She leaned away from Stuart , but he still gripped her . She studied his face , and now she was sober . But she could find nothing there but excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , thickly . He could not contain his enthusiasm now . He started to his feet . He paced the room . He struck one clenched fist in the palm of the other . His acting was so convincing that all her suspicions were gone . Her excitement rose again . She sat on the edge of the sofa and watched him . " Janie ! " he cried , suddenly stopping and wheeling towards her . " I will tell you something that no one knows except , of course , the banks ! Sam and I have an income of over fifty thousand dollars a year from the shops ! It is a secret , and I am telling you this in confidence . If you invest twenty thousand dollars in the shops , you will have a handsome income of about five thousand dollars a year , as your share ! If you investmore , the income will be in proportion . And all without touching the balance of your principal . You will be a partner in the Grandeville Supreme Emporium , whose possibilities are limitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
