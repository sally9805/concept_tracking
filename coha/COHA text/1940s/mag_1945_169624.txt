Cutting taxes for the first time in 16 years was too urgent a job for the House Ways &; Means Committee to share it with the public . Last week it took Treasury Secretary Vinson 's tax-reduction program behind closed doors , came out in a record-breaking four days with a tax bill which would 1 ) give individual taxpayers at least a 10% reduction in income taxes , and 2 ) take 12,000,000 lower-bracket Americans off the tax rolls altogether . <P> The finished product was not exactly what onetime Ways &; Means Committee member Vinson had asked , but it was close . The bill provided for a total tax reduction of $5.3 billion ( some $300 million more than Vinson had suggested ) . It also extended to all levels the relief which the Treasury plan would have concentrated mainly in the lower brackets . The committee also rejected Vinson 's proposal for repeal of the excess-profits tax on corporations . Instead it substituted a cut from 85% to 60% and a promise of total repeal in 1947 . <P> Also due to be dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee 's plan , are the $5 " use " tax on automobiles and the wartime increases in excise taxes on admissions , transportation , furs , jewelry , alcoholic beverages , telephone bills and light bulbs . Due to be frozen at present levels ( 1% ) are social-security taxes paid by employer and employe . <P> Proud of its handiwork , the Ways &; Means Committee prepared at week 's end to take its tax bill to the House floor , to push it through under the " gag " rule , which bars the submission of amendments by any but committee members .
