txt Straitjacketing by price ceilings , manpower disturbances and materials shortages are the big hurdles in home building . Those are the blockades 350 Ohio home builders listed here yesterday as their top problems in getting started next spring on a major low-cost housing program . They want to account for 87 , - to 10% of the 450,000 to 500.000 housing units which experts say will be started in the United States in 1946 . The second annual conference of the Ohio Home Builders Association called on the Government to remove barriers to a free flow of materials needed to speed new housing for veterans and the thousands of new families created during the war . While housing represents only about 40% of an new construction planned at this time , it is probably the most important . Larry Hart . president of the Producers Council in Washington , declared . All other types of construction , and even industrial plant reconversion , will greatly delayed . he amid unless the housing bottleneck is broken . He cited the case of a rniddlewestern industrial plant . badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hired because housing accommodations could be found for only 18 of them . Still in the dark on the details of President Truman 's three-point program announced this week for speeding low cost home building , the builders were inclined " to hold their fire " on what effect it might have on their 1946 construction efforts . Mr. Hart , however , expressed majority opinion by saying . " If Government regulations stand in the way of our doing an honest job swiftly , we must see to it that regulations are removed or made sensible " Despite difficulties , he added , the rate of production of building materials has reached now , or will have reached in six months , the 1940 volume which is the goal for 1946 . The construction industry  --  and ' lumber dealers striving to build tip their stocks ? were " taking It on the chin " while the Government this year exported 750 million board feet of lumber in accordance with foreign trade agreements , Paul V. De Vile . president of the Ohio Association of Retail Lumber Dealers informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted the construction-of about 75.000 new homes . He predicted , however , that production of lumber in 1946. barring new strikes in cutting operations , will reach 30 billion board feet , more than ample the amount for anticipated building needs . The dollar volume of private housing construction in 1946 will approximate 32 billion , almost three times as much as in 1945 , with the number of new units to be started numbering 475,000 compared with the 190.000 begun this year , according to a Department of Commerce consultant , Robert L. Whaley . Referring to the Wegner-Ellender-Taft housing bill now pending in Congress , Mr. Hart declared that " legislation will not build houses but free enterprise , given encouragement instead of restrictions and controls , can build them . " He asserted that it is the primary duty of the local building groups to " hold the line " against inflation . If that is not done , he said , there are two alternatives facing the building industry  --  further - government regimentation and restrictions or a buyers ' strike . Either would be disastrous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
