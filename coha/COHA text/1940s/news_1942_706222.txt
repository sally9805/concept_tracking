txt The German High Command is apprehensive of the middle of February as the time when the Russians may well develop the full strength of their Winter offensive , . and they are making preparations to meet the blow by throwing in ahead of schedule fresh or refitted divisions originally meant for . the Spring drive ; according to what may be considered reliable information from Berlin tonight . Although ; the . January military honors have not been all Russian , , especially in the latter part of the month , with the Russians scoring : points ' of tactical . rather than ? strategic value , Berlin military circles concede to the Soviet generals a certain measure of success . At the same time there is a growing tendency in these quarters - to regard the thrusts and feints of the adversary up to now as merely so much " spade work " for more . serious efforts expected later this month . Russian sources reported con tinned advances toward Dniepropetrovsk in the Ukraine and a heavy offensive in the Leningrad ? region , but admitted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . . In view of the fact that it would not be the first " rabbit out of the Russian military hat " in this war , the Germans are now said to be taking no chances and are strengthening certain points with fresh troops that would not have seen the firing line much before April in the normal course of things . The number of divisions thus // NAZI " SPRING ' UNITS SPEEDED TO RUSSIA // prematurely sent to the front is , of course , a military secret , wherefore any estimate is sheer guesswork . But to be of any use they could not be fewer than twenty and there are probably more . To equip and train new units to take the place of those that have gone now to the front ahead of their time , the Army Command is relying on the intensification both of production and the drill of the new draftees , whose ranks are now being swelled by party members who hitherto had what they thought comfortable swivel-chair jobs far out of harm 's way  --  for instance in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dispatches reaching Stockholm from Berlin on the military situation in Russia have been surprisingly frank in the last few days ? the Germans rather emphasize that they have to dig their way through snowdrifts seven feet high and some of the German war correspondents , who also serve as fighting members of their units , have lately been allowed to complain in print that the Russian reserve of manpower is seemingly inexhaustible . This may be the Propaganda Ministry 's way of explaining why " the few remaining Soviet divisions " prominently featured in the Ministry 's war literature of last October are still holding out and are forever being replenished . Another matter that is reportedly worrying the Germans is how . they are going to manage the Spring sowing in the Ukraine ? it is a question of some 5,000,000 tons of gasoline and oil and tens of thousands of tractors , needed only a few months hence . Alfred Gerigk , writing in Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels 's weekly , the Reich , gives the authority for the figures just cited and evidently the problem is where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . In the Ukraine agriculture is , or was , 100 per cent motorized and the Russians in their retreat destroyed the major part of the tractors and threshing machines so that when . the Germarr3 arrived soli work , including harvesting , had to be done by hand . Thus there was no time for the usual Autumn sowing , which had to be postponed until the Spring thaw , which in a normal year would be toward the end of March . Thirty thousand tractors is considered the minimum requirement , even allowing for the possibility of repairing some agricultural implements only partly destroyed by the Russians as they left . - Even the entire Rumanian production would not be sufficient to fill the Ukraine requirement of gasoline alone , as estimated by Herr Gerigk , wherefore it may be deduced that the Ukrainian conquests , so far as dividends are concerned , are going to be more of a " long-term " investment than even the more conservative Germans had expected . The situation could be met by synthetic gasoline production , which in Germany has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both gasoline and horses are needed for the Army 's Spring drive . The Germans are-already offering astronomical prices for such horses as they may still be able to buy from the few neighboring neutrals.
