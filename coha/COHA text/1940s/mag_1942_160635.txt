My Gal Sal ( 20th Century-Fox ) is the kind of bright , tuneful , lighthearted musical that was once Broadway 's dish . It has the authentic Tin-Pan Alley touch-gilded by the nostalgic charm of the nicely naughty ' 90s . It also has so many other good things that it is a rare cinema treat . <P> A warm share of Sal 's appeal is owing to the man it celebrates : genial , sentimental , gargantuan ( 300 lb . ) Paul Dresser , onetime minstrel , most popular song writer of the ' 90s , and oldest brother of lugubrious Novelist Theodore Dreiser ( who kept the original family name ) . Dreiser , who wrote the first verse and the chorus of one of his brother 's best songs ( On the Banks of the Wabash ) , also wrote the story on which Sal is based . <P> Although one of Hollywood 's almost unbearably beautiful young males , Victor Mature , plays the Dresser role , he is generally bearable . Whenever he gets coy , out of character and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty pretty red herring : beauteous Rita Hayworth , who , in Technicolor , singing and dancing her way through eight melodies , is enough to raise hair on the boys in baldhead row . <P> As a pretty , American musicomedy star with a headful of russet red curls , Miss Hayworth meets Dresser on the Chautauqua circuit , irks him to Manhattan , sings his songs , falls in &; out of love with him to the final fadeout . Director Cummings never lets these familiar tactics grow tiresome . Blessed with some truly imaginative and exciting sets , some of the best musical arrangements of this or any other season , a powderbox-full of new dance routines , inspired costuming , he manages to make the gaslight era seem just around a very inviting corner . <P> Because only six of the Dresser melodies ( best : My Gal Sal , Wabash , The Convict and The Bird ) were considered sufficiently undated , Songwriters Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger turned out four new tunes . Any or all of them ( Here You Are , Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fella , On The Great White Way ) should be best-seller-bound . <P> Twentieth Century has been considerably disturbed because Sal 's big secret leaked out : Rita Hayworth 's Grade-A singing voice belongs to Radio Songstress Nan Wynn . Fortunately for all concerned , the voice sounds like Rita . And no pseudonymous voice ever had a more attractive sponsor . <P> Suicide Squadron ( Republic ) is an all-English picture , made in England for Republic 's account . It is an ably written , superbly acted job , whose wartime story suffers somewhat from the fact that World War II has long passed it by . <P> Because the hero ( Anton Walbrook ) is a famed Polish pianist , Suicide Squadron resounds with melody . Its background score , composed by Richard Addinsel , is alone worth the price of admission . The picture follows Patriot Walbrook from gutted Warsaw to the U.S. , underscores his marriage to a pretty U.S. heiress ( Sally Gray ) and her misbegotten attempt to keep him from flying with the remnants of his Polish squadron , reassembled in England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
