" Along the road of death we are driving to the plain of Naples . . . . The worst is over . " <P> So Scottish-born , 40-year-old Alexander B. Austin began his dispatch one day last week to the London Daily Herald . He filed it , climbed into a jeep with three other British correspondents : stocky , thirtyish William J. Munday of the London News Chronicle ; mild-mannered , 38-year-old Stewart Sale of Reuters ; Basil Gingell of the British Exchange Telegraph agency . <P> They pushed westward toward Pompeii 's poppy-splashed , bomb-battered ruins so fast they finally were in the van of the American Fifth Army . At Scafati where a group of American correspondents were also out in front of the troops , they were held up by a rear-guarding German tank . <P> The tank suddenly wheeled and fired . In the blinding explosion Alexander Austin and two of his friends came to the end of the road of death . When the smoke and dust had cleared , only Basil Gingell was alive . <P> Britain 's list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. correspondent casualties had already reached a more impressive total : 13 dead , three missing and presumed dead , 67 wounded . With these figures before him , General Dwight Eisenhower issued a peremptory order : hereafter correspondents will stop driving ahead of advanced combat troops .
