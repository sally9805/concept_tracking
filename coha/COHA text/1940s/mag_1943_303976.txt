Is the life-insurance business getting too big for its 100-year-old britches ? Even some traditionalists , in a U.S. business noted for the especial depth of the moss on its back , are asking such questions . <P> The problem arises because the life insurance companies now have $36 billions in assets - the world 's second greatest pool of private capital ( first : U.S. <P> commercial banks ) . About 30% of their total is concentrated in U.S. Government bonds . Furthermore , 75% of all new in vestments made this year are in " governments . " <P> State laws and sound old insurance practice restrict insurance companies to the gilt-edged , low-income investments . <P> But many economists and most New Dealers are sickened at the sight of such a vast pool of capital not engaged in the prime purpose of capital - risk-taking . <P> In this impasse , some insurance thinkers have been looking for a new , constructive answer . One idea that is causing conservatives to harrumph in the insurance board rooms : that an investment pool for new or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " senior " capital . Effect : a kind of privately owned RFC . Likelihood : little ; the insurance business as a whole is doing too well as it is to be receptive to radical new tinkerings . <P> $133 Billion . For the insurance business is fat . In the first eight months of 1943 , U.S. life-insurance companies wrote $5,531,393,000 worth of new business , more than they had chalked up in any eight months since the 1937 boom . The 67,000,000 U.S. citizens with life policies now own approximately $133 billions worth- 30% more than the total in 1929 , almost five times the national coverage just before World War I broke out . Both the character of the new business and the financial condition of the industry are better than they have been in years . <P> Down Industrials . More people are earning enough to pay premiums quarterly or semiannually . Industrial insurance ( the 25-a-week , door-to-door variety popularly known as " burial insurance " ) is going down , as other kinds rise . Through August of this year , new industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in ordinary and a 19.1% rise in group business . This trend is good for everybody : industrial insurance nets the companies no more , but is more expensive for the same coverage . Thus it has been a politically fruitful target of insurance haters for 40 years . <P> Down Surrenders . Surrender payments this year are at a new alltime low , off almost $150 millions from last year , while requests for loans on policies are also at rock bottom . <P> <P> Up Earnings . War prosperity has increased the value and earning power of many insurance investments , notably railroad bonds . It has also helped the industry get out from under its crushing load of sour farm mortgages and foreclosed farms . During the depression , U.S. insurance companies had to take over 100,000 farms , worth ( on the books ) over $1 billion . By the end of the next crop season , most companies figure they will have disposed of all of them . Increased earnings from such sources arrested-at least temporarily-a 14-year downtrend in the net interest rate of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
