A determined scientist always has new worlds to conquer . Professor Auguste Piccard , who broke the altitude record in a free balloon in 1932 , * is nearly ready to try for the undersea depth record too . Last week 63-year-old Scientist Piccard told the North American Newspaper Alliance about the " bathyscaphe " ( from the Greek for " depth ship " ) , his submarine balloon which will descend into the sea suspended from a steel and aluminum " gas bag " full of lightweight gasoline . <P> Heavyweight . Long planned ( TIME , July 8 , 1946 ) , the bathyscaphe is now about completed in Belgium . Cast as two steel hemispheres ( see cut ) , it is 6 feet in outside diameter . The walls are 3 inches thick at their thinnest point . The professor thinks that they will withstand nearly 6,000 pounds of pressure per square inch-the pressure he expects to find more than 12,000 feet below the surface of the sea . <P> There will be one door ( a thick plate ) and two windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of glass , or the quartz used by William Beebe in his record-holding ( 3,028 ft. ) bathysphere , the windows will be Plexiglas cones with the narrow ends pointing inward . Professor Piccard theorizes that the pressure will squash the elastic Plexiglas windows firmly into their sockets . <P> The steel sphere and its contents will be heavy enough to sink . To keep it from sinking right to the bottom of the sea and staying there , it will be suspended from streamlined aluminum containers filled with aviation gasoline , which is considerably lighter than water and almost incompressible . Fully loaded , the bathyscaphe will weigh about 40 tons . Because the winches of the mother ship can not support this weight , the gasoline and half the ballast must be added after the bathyscaphe is in the Water . <P> Trial Dip . The cramped ( 141 cubic foot ) space inside the steel-shelled coconut will be crammed with control apparatus , batteries and instruments . The bathyscaphe will carry enough oxygen to keep two men alive for more than 32 hours , and chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Powerful searchlights outside the cabin will light up the sea , and allow fish and other bathyfauna to be observed and photographed . Because time for note-taking will be short , a recording device will bring back a running commentary on the dive . The depth ship 's experimental compass will be outside the cabin too , since the earth 's magnetism will not penetrate the thick steel walls . <P> Since radio does not work well under water , the bathyscaphe will use a shortwave sound device lent by the British Admiralty , which developed it for communication between submarines . <P> The descent will be made , if all goes well , in the Gulf of Guinea off West Africa , some time in September . First , Professor Piccard intends to drop the unmanned bathyscaphe into the sea with a pressure-controlled instrument on board to bring it up again when it has reached a certain depth . If it rises as he expects it to do , the professor himself will take the plunge . <P> <P> * 53,153 feet . It was broken again in 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Corps , who went to 72,395 feet in a sealed , spherical gondola like Piccard's.
