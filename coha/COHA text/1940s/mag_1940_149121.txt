Last week the sullen heralds of total war chattered in British skies , but many a British scientist , true to a long and stanch tradition , went calmly on with his researches in " pure " or fundamental science. * One of the purest of pure sciences is the approach to absolute zero , the nadir of cold . Absolute zero is the point at which all random motions of material particles , due to heat energy , are completely stilled . It is calculated at 273.13 below zero on the centigrade scale , and it can be written as simply 0K. , meaning zero on the Kelvin or absolute scale . Scientists have never quite chilled matter to that point , and never expect to . But their approaches to it have shown them a great deal about how the laws of thermodynamics operate . <P> In the region of 1K. ( about - 272C. ) certain substances lose all electrical resistance , so that an electric current flowing around a lead ring , for example , keeps going indefinitely . Liquid helium loses so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against gravity . <P> By means of a magnetic-cycle cooling technique , low-temperature researchers have chilled certain salts to the astonishing temperature of .003K . The method makes use of the principle that magnetization heats matter , demagnetization chills it . After preliminary cooling with liquid helium , the salt is magnetized , the heat thus generated drawn off into a jacket filled with helium vapor ; then demagnetization pushes the substance down one notch further into the cold . But the limits of this method , as applied to the magnet ism of molecules , have been nearly reached . <P> In the issue of the British journal Na ture which reached the U. S. last week , a new approach to absolute zero , suggested by several investigators , was explained by Dr. Charles Galton Darwin . He is the calm , pipe-smoking director of the Na tional Physical Laboratory , grandson of Evolution 's great Charles Darwin . In effect the method is to work down as far as possible with the magnetism of molecules , then continue with the magnetism in the nuclei ( cores ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausibly expect to get down to one hundred-thousandth , possibly to one millionth of a degree above absolute zero . <P> The apparatus will be intricate and the experiment laborious . Says Dr. Darwin : " Each successive stage in producing cold has called for greater efforts and has on the whole produced less results . " But scientists may find that at a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero , certain sub stances become permanent magnets ; they may find nothing . They do not know for sure what they will find , and that is the lure . If England survives they will keep going . <P> * During World War I the late , great Lord Rutherford refused to give up his atom-splitting experiments when his help was sought on methods of submarine detection .
