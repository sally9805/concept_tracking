In a special communique issued from Reichsfuehrer Hitler 's field headquarters late tonight recapitu lating the losses in materiel and Imen inflictea on the Russian armies up to July 1 , ' the German High Command made the following cryptic introductory state ' ment : " It is to be perceived more and more that the destructive battle ' east of Bialystok has brought a decision of world historic proportions . ? Unbelievable chaos has closed over the Soviet Army . " It is interesting to observe that the rest of tonight 's special communique concerns itself . not merely with the Russian armies trapped between Bialystok aria Minsk but with the entire Eastern Front . Even authoritative German quarters profess to be puzzled as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seen i Between June 22 and July 1 the German forces destroyed or captured 5,774 tanks and 2,330 cannon and anti-aircraft guns and destroyed 4,725 planes , 1,392 of them in battles , 112 by anti-aircraft fire and 3,221 on the ground , the bulletin said . In addition , four armored trains were reported destroyed and small ' weapons and other materiel were i said to have been taken in such quantities that several weeks would be required to count them . More than 160,000 Russians were taken prisoner in this period , it was said . Because of the stubbornness of the Russians ' resistance and the ferocity of their attempts to escape when trapped , the Germans reported , the casualties were " many times " larger than the number of prisoners captured . German losses were " on the whole , happily , small , " the official announcement from Reichsfuehrer Hitler 's field headquarters asserted . Russian resistance still is tenacious , and the fighting , according to all reports , exceeds in ferocity any that has occurred since this superdimensional. war began . The turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , it is said here . In the vital sector of the German advance in the area between Bialystok and Minsk , authoritative sources declare , the resistance of the major part of the two Russian Armies reported trapped in a steel pocket was broken .

Bialystok Ring Closed East of Bialystok , the Germans report , they have closed around the Russian forces a ' noose that has been steadily drawn tighter since it was formed on Monday , June 23 .

There are still two smaller pockets of trapped Russians in this same sector in White Russia , it is said . Their annihilation is held here to be imminent . When this has been effected two entire Russian armies will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere and the lines of communication , at least as far east as Minsk , made secure , official commentators assert . Farther south , in Galicia , the German drive into the Ukraine is said to have gathered momentum since the capture of Lwow and to be heading for the Dnieper River ? on whose banks lies Kiev . The Russians are hard pressed in their retreat , it is said here , particularly by the German air force , which is harassing railway lines and other avenues of escape . In this sector , south of the Pripet marshes , German units report that they have formed another pocket , in which sizable Russian forces are believed trapped . The exact location of this ring is as yet unknown , but it is in the Dubno-Luck sector and includes Zloczow .

In a battle that continued two days , the Russians are said to have been defeated and 120 of their tanks captured .

Between the Dvina and the Baltic dispersed remnants of Soviet units also are said to be trapped and , except for cleaningup operations , this whole sector is reported to be firmly in German hands .
