NOW that our soldiers are beginning to trickle home from China , one of America 's favorite myths is in danger of collapsing . This is the China Legend ? the illusion , cherished by nearly all of us , that China is one of the Great Nations , a country inhabited by uncommonly noble and selfless people , and now standing on the verydoorstep of a splendid industrial future . The legend has been nourished all through the war by a stream of unusually competent propaganda , both Chinese and American , and protected by a screen of political and military censorship . Mme. Chiang Kai-shek herself , whose popularity in this country is well known , was one of the most effective propagandists ; and the censorship ( Chinese and American ) was handled so as to prevent correspondents from writing the whole truth even after they had left China . The myth ca n't survive much longer , however , because American troops are bringing back from the Orient too many rough , unpleasant facts . There is , indeed , a real danger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us may slump into a cynical disillusionment about China which can do no good for either country . A TER five months in China the thing that sticks most in my mind is the very dim view , as it was termed , which Americans there took about the country 's future . I ran into this feeling even before I got into China . At the ATC barracks in Calcutta I met a man from the Don Nelson technical mission who was on his way home . As we sat in his room , under the hot straw-mat roofing , he said he was wondering how he would talk when he got back to the United States . " Americans feel one way in China and go home and talk the opposite . Sometimes I think the Hump flight out affects their minds . " I asked what he meant by " talking the opposite . " ! They go home and spread pollyanna reports on China 's future , " he said . " After moaning for months about the situation 's being hopeless there . And calling China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember how a sort of baffled look came over his face , as he added , " It 's been done ? even by members of the Nelson mission . " That was my introduction to the way Americans inside China felt about our wartime ally . I was to get a lot more of the same . One of the attaches of the embassy in Chungking told me one night while we sat in the garden of the Press Hostel that Americans at home ought to be presented with a few comparisons between China and the United States and made to learn them by heart . " They ought to think what America would be like if it were in the same stage of development that China is . The same area . Triple our present population . The railroads the equivalent of two : the New York Central and the Atlantic Coast Line ? 8,000 miles instead of the present 382,000 . We 'd be a country without roads . Well , no , not quite . Paved roads a few hundred miles , and a hundred earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else would be footpaths . " He made a comparison of power and industrial resources . If America were like China she would have less than enough electricity to light and turn the wheels of one city , Detroit . Everywhere else ? kerosene and peanut oil lamps . In the earth no copper for future power lines . And not much oil to come , according to the latest geological surveys . As for industrial plant , there is less of it in all of China than there is in Gary , Indiana . Eighty-five out of every hundred Americans would be men with a hoe , farming a one- to two-acre plot . Most would be in debt to the money lenders or the landlord , with interest at 80 per cent ; and the government would gouge 75 per cent of their crops for taxes . The " good earth " that they farmed would n't be so good . It would be so old and worn out that they would have to collect even human excreta to replenish it . " Tear down the China illusion like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe Americans will understand the remark of an American newspaper executive when he passed through here : ' Get out of Shanghai , and the rest of the country is just one big poorhouse , is n't it ? ' " II D owN in Kunming I met an American supply services colonel who had what was to me a new explanation for China 's dubious future . The Chinese , he said , were " organizationally bankrupt . " " Mind you . " he shook a finger at me , " like everybody else I have my pet Chinese . But taken as a whole , they just do n't seem able to organize and run things . We show them how . They seem to learn OK . We turn the job over to them . When wecome back they 've forgotten , and everything is in one hell of a mess . " In telling me about the ordnance depots and the Chinese supply services , he quoted an old Chinese saying : " It is best to come to disaster by familiar ways , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " It explained , he thought , why if a new way of doing things broke down , the Chinese so often did n't try to do anything . He said General Cheves first explained the depot system to the Chinese . They were keen on it and learned it rapidly . It seemed fatally important just then . The Japs were threatening Chungking . One day , the colonel said , he visited one of the ordnance depots . He found it wrongly located : way off the main road . Then he found that the lead-in road stopped at the village gate . Wheeled traffic from there on was blocked because a stream had been diverted into the road . The stream was there for the use of the village 's chief industry , which was clay-brick making . The colonel walked from there in to the depot . It was eleven in the morning , but the Chinese colonel in charge was in bed . Routed out and asked about the river blocking the road , he said : " Well , they 'll be through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the depot warehouses was not of the best . There was no warehousing plan . So nobody could find anything . Brand new equipment and damaged salvage equipment were mixed . For the machine guns the ammunition in stock was Russian-1931 make , and the wrong caliber anyway . Thousands of unused dry batteries had been kept in dead storage until they were worthless . The rifles were unoiled and starting to rust . The American colonel squinted down the barrels ? they were filthy . He had sent a requisition for oil , the Chinese colonel explained , but it had never been honored ; so he could do nothing . " I had that same problem once , " the American colonel remarked impatiently , " but I borrowed oil . " " Wait a minute , " he said to me . " How would you like to see what I call organizational bankruptcy ? at work ? All right , Tomorrow we 'll go out to Hai Lun Po and look at a hospital . " HE hospital was in a beautiful loca1 tion , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the bottom into a circular pool . Feathery bamboo stood around , and cedars lent a spicy tang to the air . But when we climbed the long stone steps to the temples which served as the hospital , another smell became noticeable . As we ascended it got worse . I looked at the colonel . " I think it 's dysentery cases , " he said . And when we reached the top , the courtyard of the hospital , we knew it was , beyond a doubt . The condition of the courtyard , without rhetoric , was this : the sick soldiers had defecated all over it . It was impossible for us to walk without fouling our shoes . But we did walk , around the building , looking for the main ward . The ground around was saturated with excreta , and along that first building pails of it had been thrown against the walls . I saw no latrines anywhere . The colonel explained that American medical officers had given instruction in the building and importance of latrines , but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit and things did n't get done . I thought it curious that nobody was about . So far we had seen no attendants , doctors , or nurses anywhere . At the main building we stepped over the foot-high threshold and went in . The stench was overpowering , and the general sanitary conditions worse , if possible , than outside . Forty men lay there on wooden plank beds . They had defecated everywhere ? on the dirt floor , against the walls , chairs , the benches that held the beds . A big metal garbage pail stood at one end . While we watched , one man , not yet too weak , got up , tottered down the room and used the pail . " Look at this poor devil , " the colonel said . He lifted up a soldier too weak to move . I saw that the man had soaked through all his clothes and through the straw matting of the bed . " Where 's the doctor today ? Where 's the orderly ? " the colonel asked in Chinese . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . A man had died . Not noticed for two days . Had they received medicine ? No . " We give the Chinese army plenty of sulfa drugs , " growled the colonel , " but somehow in the fantastic disorganization of their medical corps the drugs get lost and damn seldom used ! ' The pipestem legs . The sunken cheeks . The fever-bright eyes . I suddenly had an awful feeling that these men had been put here to die . " What 'll happen here ? " I asked the colonel . " Oh , the American medics will come out , and raise hell , and use DDT all over the place , and force them to clean up , re-staff , and reorganize the whole business . Then , four months later , you come out , and it 'll be in the same appalling state again . " C HUNGKING . Sat up till 2 A.M. talking with X. He here working with Chinese government . Adviser . Consultant . Obviously disillusioned about the job , and very pessimistic about China 's future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This man surprised me , for he used the Kunming colonel 's very phrase , " organizational bankruptcy : ' He was one of the civilian American cultural relations specialists . About twelve were in Chungking , working on public health , metallurgy , soil erosion , and other problems . Today I remember his saying , shaking his head : " One of our men is setting up a system of new industrial standards for China . But we have n't much confidence the work will do much good . We 're afraid that once we go home the usual disorganization will set in and the system be forgotten . " Why did American efforts to set up some kind of organization , whether in hospitals , ordnance dumps , or factories , I used to wonder , all seem doomed to prompt collapse ? One reason , no doubt , lay in the fact that every one of these schemes was so utterly alien to the Chinese . Further , they were established in a hurry , and by " foreigners . " The Chinese , being notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing things ; but , as soon as the American instructor departed , they were likely to slip back into the old familiar habits . The whole idea of large-scale organization is , on the face of it , contrary to the Chinese tradition . They are people of many talents , Pearl Buck and Lin Yutang have frequently told us ? but organization is n't one of them . Precision , systems , the techniques of scientific logic ? all these things simply do not fit into the Chinese thought pattern . - Consider , for example , how China is shackled by its written language . It consists of tens of thousands of ancient ideographs ? in origin , highly stylized pictures ? which are completely incapable of expressing modern concepts . As a consequence , contemporary Chinese books frequently break into English , just because there is no way to express such words as " carburetor " or " electronics " in the traditional characters . The ideographs are a drag on every function of a modern state . Telegrams have to be sent in numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words strictly limited . It is impossible to print a Chinese telephone directory . ( Shanghai 's is in English . ) There can be no typewriters . Moreover , the ideographs compound every error . Where precision is necessary they are worthless . In science they may well keep China behind for centuries . " The language is a millstone around China 's neck , " an OWI man once remarked to me . " Suppose we spent seven or eight years learning part of the alphabet ! " W HY do n't you correspondents say that we think China will never be a great military power ? " an Air Force major growled at me over a vodka and water at the Chinese Combat Command officers ' bar one night . It was another criticism I encountered often . Both the Joes and the " brass " thought of China as a military liability . The suggestion that in the future she would be mighty in arms provoked laughter or anger . The Chinese soldier had been overplayed , I was told , the battles souped-up in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Siang corridor we were told by a G-2 briefing officer ? that the " raging " battles had cost the Chinese armies a total of twenty-four casualties . I was offered similar illustrations from personal experiences until I tired of them . Some , however , had an amusing twist . One captain told me he had campaigned with the Chinese army around Myitkyina . They occupied a town , but Jap tanks would come in at night and shoot it up . The American liaison teams tried to get the Chinese officers to fire on the tanks and fight it out with them , but never could . " Then one day , " said the captain , " they announced they had destroyed the nine Jap tanks . We went to see . There were seven ? outside the city ? lined up and burnt out . But by the Japs themselves , obviously . They stood one behind the other , and one tank 's 37-millimeter gun had been fired point blank right through the tank in front of it . For the ' destruction ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Star . " " Well , " I asked , " how did they win the North Burma campaign ? " " They had a superiority of thirty to one in men . And the American Tenth Air Force wiped out the Jap supply lines . It is true that the Chinese troops who were flown into India for training , feeding , and re-equipment at the American infantry school at Ramghar eventually became much improved soldiers . But it is equally true that the bulk of the Chinese army was starved , barefoot , badly led , robbed by its own officers , and entirely unfit for modern warfare . In spite of her courtesy title as a member of the Big Five , China actually has a military strength about equal to that of Portugal . " But you correspondents , " said a lieutenant from Toledo , " have got America thinking that China is the next great military power in Asia and our invaluable future ally . " Jouncing in to the Red Cross club in a weapons carrier from the Kunming airport I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was probably seventy years old , and a very tart man . Was he optimistic about China 's achieving unity as a nation , I had asked innocently . " You newspaper men ! " he flared . " China is n't a nation . Its people do n't even understand the concept nation . " " Well , " I countered , " what is it , then ? " " It 's 450,000,000 souls whose highest loyalty is still ? as for the past thousands of years ? the family . It 's going to take them a long time to change that , young man . " And why did n't we ( correspondents , of course ) tell Americans that China 's provinces were not just like our states ? Not tied to Chungking as our states are tied to Washington ? The governors of the provinces here did just about as they pleased . " Look at Governor Lung Yun of this province . During the war , while the Generalissimo was supposed to be supreme , when Chiang Kai-shek wanted Lung to confer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunming ? Madame Chiang sometimes , the people said . " Yunnan was Lung 's private principality . Lots of other provinces were the same . MHE foreign commerce expert was one I of several " business authorities " I had seen . He was attached to the embassy , his job being to promote Chinese-American trade . From him I think I half-expected a different view from that the others had given on China 's prospects . This man sat in his office and looked out over the hot August roofs of Chungking and said to me bluntly : " Do n't have too much fancy optimism . " If China was to import and be a great customer for America and the rest of the world , she must export . Just A , B , C. What did she have that the other nations wanted especially ? Once she had had tung oil , silk , bristles , hides , and skins . But nylon came . It was going into more brushes every day . Silk would probably never again be important for hosiery . Oil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for hides . . . the Pips in China had slaughtered animals wantonly . After the war American firms were not coming in here with a blank check in hand . There were now too many imponderables . Political stability here was a factor . And the end of extra-territoriality . Foreign firms would now be under Chinese law and Chinese courts . . . He looked at me significantly . I remembered how frequently I had heard Chinese courts referred to as totally corrupt . " But China needs transportation , " I said . " Are n't we going to sell her railroads , and road machinery , and cars ? " " Some . But her purchasing power is limited . Which most Americans at home these days do n't seem to realize . " When I left he accompanied me to the door . " No , " he said , " her future foreign trade is n't going to do any miracle for China ? body or soul . " UT the gloomiest prophets were the JD Americans of the medical units ? most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles were ethical , they said . She would not go far so long as her leaders ? officials , intellectuals , professional men ? had no social conscience . It was a heavy indictment , but I found some of the evidence unanswerable . I sat in a tent at the ATC air base at Chengkung one night and discussed the matter with a surgeon of the 14th Air Force . Had I ever heard of a public official in China thinking of a public office as a public trust , he wanted to know . " Who runs the gasoline black market in this province , on gas brought in here , over the Hump and through the pipe line , to save China ? The governor himself and two of his sons . " I knew that the pipe line in from India had been bled so systematically that for a while the Americans had closed it down . " Then , " he went on , " there is the case of the wife of a high ? very high ? public official , who brought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when China needed every possible ounce of military and medical supplies . And on another occasion she stripped the U. S. plane that she came in , even to the toilet paper and the linen seat covers , and on landing at her destination ordered the gas drained off into drums , for her private use . " Another American doctor in Kunming talked so that I thought him touched in the head . He had gone through the Salween campaign with the Chinese Combat Command . " A country 's doctors should be first to volunteer in time of war , " he said , " but not the Chinese medical profession . It 's a scandal . The government wo n't even draft them . " He said the army needed at least five thousand doctors . It had , at latest report , 1,686 . There were nearly that many American medical personnel in China . His experiences on the Salween , he told me , had made him lose hope for China . There was the time when he found the wounded of the 115th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river bank dying because the Chinese surgeon had deserted . . . . The day on the Burma road ? between Chefang and Wanting ? when he had a sit-down strike of the Chinese doctors and nurses of the 200th Division . He had two portable hospitals there , standing side by side . One , the 2d Reserve Division 's , was swamped with one hundred and fifty casualties . The other had almost none . He had ordered the wounded transferred to it . The doctors and nurses refused to treat them . Not in their division . . . . He saw the medical officer of the 117th Regiment one day beat the wounded who could n't walk ? with a bamboo cane . To stop it he had had to threaten the man with his .45 . " Here is the monthly requisition list , " he said to me , " made by the Chinese surgeon of the 18th Army at Taoyuan . " From his field jacket he drew out tissuey papers of the kind the Chinese write on . He went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no one who could operate it . Laryngoscopes . No one could use them , either . Cystoscope . Ditto . Sphygmomanometers . Ordered more of them than they did ordinary stethoscopes . Forty-eight wrist watches . Only thirty medical officers in the 18th Army , most of them with wrist watches already . Digitalis . No one would know how to use it . Insulin . Absolutely no use for it .. . " He pushed the list away . " This happened monthly . You can see what was going on . " At Paohsien he had found the shops flooded with U. S. drugs after he issued supplies . At Shanmen the assistant army surgeon claimed that the medical supplies had never arrived . He found that the surgeon had hidden them . Each installationwas always trying to defer treatment : " These malaria cases go to the rear tomorrow . The rear can give them quinine . " One time he gave 60,000 atabrine tablets to a division that was down to 4,000 men . Malaria increased . He checked at the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received them . Only one in twenty had . Some malaria victims had been in hospital two weeks without treatment . He recalled the day that he issued blankets to a hospital 's wounded . They got put on the general 's horses instead . Although they were not isolated cases by any means , I was leery of accounts like these . So one day I went to the highest American medical officer I could find ( he was surgeon-general of one of the chief commands ) and asked his opinion of them . " They are understatements , " he said . C n then there was " squeeze . " I suppose I was told a thousand times that there was no hope for a country where a system like " squeeze " could flourish . " Squeeze , " of course , is a kind of graft . But that does not adequately describe it . It is a way of life in China whereby everyone ? from the coolie in the street to the highest government official ? tries to get his cut ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The ricksha-puller makes the shopkeeper pay for bringing a customer . The servant wo n't let the salesman into the house unless lie gets his " squeeze . " The friend who buys some wrapping paper and string for you overcharges a certain amount . From every cake he bakes the cook squeezes a little sugar and flour and hoards it away . In jail the prisoner has to pay his cell guard to be allowed to go and relieve nature . A banker expects to pay " squeeze " to the financial executives of every company that banks with him . When the Chinese Service of Supply was set up in Kunming , Chungking telegraphed a credit of three billion dollars . Within a few hours the American colonel in charge was visited by a leading banker of Kunming . He had a suggestion . If the American colonel would bank all the money with him , he could arrange things so that the colonel would make ninety-six per cent per annum on it for himself . He explained that it was a regular Chinese custom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a private of the Army Medical Administration Center at Kweiyang said to me one day . " On account of it makes everything inefficient . It 's ' squeeze ' what makes the Chinese always snafu up everything and never on time . " He had seen it at Kweiyang , when the outlying medical units had failed to get their supplies . When the American liaison officers checked up , they found that somebody in the Chinese bureaucracy had started one of the periodic ( and never effectual ) campaigns against pilfering . In this case , the idea was to make an exhaustive inventory at every stage in the movement of supplies . U. S. truck drivers at the pick-up depots were being asked by the Chinese to open every carton and every bottle inside and to count every pill . They refused . The Chinese then set out to do the inventory themselves , breaking the metal straps and glued-down flaps on thousands of cartons . When they had finished , the boxes were connected with gummed paper strips , so they could n't be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper seals ? all in an effort to prevent " squeeze . " Meanwhile , the sick and wounded went without medicine . " It drove us nearly crazy , " the SOS colonel living at Kunming 's Hotel Europa confessed to me . " I 'd say ' squeeze ' slowed up China 's war effort two years . It quadrupled our work . " A division commander , he said , would wire Chungking : " For summer , need ten thousand uniforms . " The quartermaster would have to find out how much he was lying ? " a long process . " He 'd allow him seven thousand uniforms . The assistant QM would have to double-check . He 'd cut it to five thousand . " Or a division commander wires us for funds for food for his men in advance , and then puts the money out at interest . Pretty soon we get reports of starvation among those troops . When one asked forpay for ten thousand men , we 'd give it for six thousand . Then we 'd discover he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men until after a few battles , so he could ' squeeze ' the pay of the dead . " The day I called on the U. S. Army Criminal Investigation Department in Kunming , their latest " catch " was sitting all over the upper verandah floor : thirty or forty thieves from the previous night 's haul . I was ushered into the bureau chief 's office and witnessed a curious scene . A Chinese , in the long silk gown of the well-to-do , stood in front of the desk with hands full of thousand-dollar notes , begging two officers to " take it ? please , please . " The Americans were phlegmatically shaking their heads . " We have this every night , " the chief said to me . " They beg us to hold their money for them , so the Yunnan Procurator 's Court , which we turn them over to , wo n't take it all in ' squeeze . ' " I said I came to ask about " squeeze . " Was it really as bad as the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chief was a Brooklyn Irishman , with a twinkle in his eye . Sure ? they could give me a little idea . The army motor pool ? Chinese staffed ? showed how " squeeze " worked all down the line . A civilian employee hired the drivers . The CID ' discovered he charged $50 U. S. or $40,000 Chinese to every new man he took on : The money was delivered to a shop , its Kunming and a receipt given . The driver was now " hired , " but he had to pay $10,000 to the examiner if he did n't want to be failed in the driving test . Then , to get driving assignments , he had to pay the dispatcher $2,000 . ( No truck to drive , no chance to steal gas , of course , and sell it at $2,400 a gallon . ) The pool now saved 500 gallons a day , for China 's war , because the CID had broken up this particular " squeeze . " Was " squeeze " due to so much poverty ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " One day in December 1944 , " the other officer put in , " six trucks loaded with opium belonging to Ma Tsong-heng , the provincial opium king , were coming down the road near Hsiakwan . Each truck had two extra men in the driver 's seat , armed with machine guns . But the trucks were stopped by a Central Government officer and his troops , who had more machine guns . They took the trucks away . The Central Government is supposed to be death on opium , as its officers know , But Ma Tsong-heng paid this Central Government officer $200,000,000 ' squeeze ' to have the trucks and the opium turned back to him . Moreover , whenever Ma brought in opium , the governor 's second and third sons here always knew it and bought ' a load , for which Ma never collected . That Central Government officer was n't a pauper , and the governor 's sons are not poor . " " Do you think ' squeeze ' worse now than before the war ? " I asked . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief said , " to say that ' squeeze ' takes only 10 per cent . But the supply people here put it at 25 to 75 per cent . An OWI man has experienced cases of 100 per cent . We estimate that only 25 per cent of materiel for the U. S. forces gets to them . " The other officer nodded . " As for lend-lease materiel destined for the Chinese soldier , we estimate only 10 per cent reaches its destination . Squeeze ' gets the rest . " Later I came to believe that what disheartened the Americans most about the system was that the Chinese did consider it dishonest and reprehensible . The OWI man who saw " squeeze " at 100 per cent remarked to me one day : " The people of China do not think squeeze ' is OK , or ' legitimate graft , ' or just old custom . ' They are ashamed of it . As witness : no Chinese will squeeze openly . None will admit he squeezes , and few that ' squeeze ' goes on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ever fights it . It 's like a moral infection to which everyone 's conscience has been immunized . " HERE is some evidence , however , that I China 's conscience is not entirely numb . Even before the end of the war , organizations within Nationalist China ? such as the Democratic League ? were beginning to urge reform . And the reports about Communist China to the north werecan observers , tion there was ridden . Finally , with the arrival of General George C. Marshall in Chungking , the great weight of American influence apparently was thrown into the scales . The result of all these pressures was the Generalissimo 's pledge , in early January , of a whole series of sweeping reforms ? including an end to the one-party dictatorship , early elections , and a general administrative housecleaning . At this writing the civil war between the Communist and Kuomintang armies has ceased ( at least temporarily ) and Chiang Kai-shek is endeavoring to form a new government including cabinet ministers drawn from at least three minority parties .

We are deeply committed there . We are sending China military advisers . We are going to give her a navy ( unless Congress balks at the idea ) and train it for her . An American general , in a private capacity , probably will take charge of building her air force . We have sent our most venerated military figure to Chungking as ambassador , and given him instructions to assume unprecedented responsibility in helping to end the country 's civil war . American experts in finance , industry , agriculture , public health , engineering , and city government are now in China , or will be lager on , to help and advise .

We must realize that China is not a great power and is not likely to become one in the predictable future . Her prospects of developing an efficient industry are , at best , very remote . Her people are no more noble and unselfish than many other peoples , and they have shortcomings which gravely menace their chances for accomplishing , for no one can guess how long , anything that we would recognize as modernization . They have a stubborn preference for the Chinese way of life , whether in politics , sanitation , or repairing a cracked cylinder-block . And our relations ? with them will run a good deal more smoothly if we do n't try to cram the American way down their throats .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
