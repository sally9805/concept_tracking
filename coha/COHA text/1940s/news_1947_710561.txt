txt WASHINGTON , July ** House , by vote of 365 to 11 , passed and sent to the White House today ' a succession bill which would make the Republican Speaker , Joseph W. Martin Jr. , Chief Executive of the United States if President Truman should become unable to complete his present term . Mr. Truman was expected to sign the measure promptly . It conformed in detail to recommendations which he first made to Congress in June , 1945 , after he , as Vice President , had succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House . He repeated them in 1946 , when Sam Rayburn , Democrat , of Texas , was stir no Speaker . After the Republicans had taken over Congressional control early this year he said he saw no reason to change his mind . Before the final vote was taken today Representative Earl C. Michener , Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee , complimented Mr. Truman for standing by the principles he had expressed at a time when succession appeared to involve only Democrats . This included the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , should be in a position to choose his own possible successor as Secretary of State , the present line of succession after the Vice President . Backed by the President The President had recommended , too , that the Speaker of the House take priority over the President pro tempore of the Senate , as obtained in earlier but later revised law , in succession after the Vice President . He pointed out that the whole House faced the electorate every two years and always was elected anew in a Presidential election year and chose its own Speaker , while only one-third of the Senate underwent this people 's choice . His argument was that , next to the directly elected President and Vice President , succession should stem ! nom the people themselves . He held the Speakership to be most representative . With today 's action the House moved to wipe out existing law wider which , following the Vice President , succession would begin n the Cabinet , with the Secretary of State first in line , - followed by // Other members according to the seniority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , was marked largely by legalistic argument , Constitutional questions and a general indication that the voting decision would be overwhelmingly decisive . From the Democratic side , heavily in favor of the Presidential recommendations , there came fervent expressions of hope for continued good health for Mr. Truman , and of apprehension over his apparent enjoyment of speedy travel , by air and by motor highway . These were echoed on the Republican side of the aisle . Speaker Martin surrendered his chair to Majority Leader Charles A. Halleck when the voting time came , and left the House Chamber . ' Being Speaker , he was not required to vote unless a tie developed . In his absence 142 Democrats joined 222 Republicans and one American Labor member in approving the new succession or- ? On June 27 , the Senate passed the same bill , 50-35 , but with much more Democratic opposition . There was only one Republictn vote against the bill in the House today , that of Representative John W. Gwynne of Iowa . Mr. Gwynne wanted a study of the entire succession question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , was dealing with a 1,000-to-1 chance of being necessary , while many other angles of the succession problem invited review . The debate brought out that there had been fifteen Vice Presidential vacancies in American history without a call being made upon the Cabinet for a Presidential successor . However , the debate also was laden with suggestions that if atomic warfare should fall upon the United States , there might be need for a long list of prospects for the Presidency in an orderly line of succession . New Cabinet Posts Included The pending measure adds , for succession , after the Viee President , the Speaker , the President pro tempore of the Senate and the present Cabinet alignment , three new Cabinet officers , the Secretaries of Agriculture , Commerce and Labor . These departments have come into being since the previous revision of the succession law in 1886 . Also voting " no " were ten Democrats , nine of them from the South and one , Representative Donald L. O'Toole , from New York . The Southerners were ' Representatives Thomas G. Abernethy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Winstead of Mississippi ; Burr P. Harrison arid Thomas B. Stanley of Virginia , and Alfred L. Buhvinkle of North Carolina , A. Sidney Camp of Georgia and George H. Mahon of Texas . Mr. O'Toole said the bill was " ridiculous . " " Look at it this way , " he suggested . " When the people vote for a President they elect either a- Republican or a Democrat . Under thin bill they can Choose a Democrat and wind up.with a Republican . This , it appears to me , would be thwarting the will of the people . " As the bill went to the White House , as permanent law unless amended , its most immediate effect is to put a Republican in line for possible succession to a Democratic Presidency . The " possibility , " Speaker Martin , is 62 years of age and unmarried . He was House minority leader from 1939 through 1946 . He is viewed by Washington observers as being " on the conservative side . " On international issues " before Pearl Harbor , " Mr. Martin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments of arms to Europe in 1939 , against the arming of American merchant ships against U-boat attacks in 1941 and against letting them carry cargoes through combat zones . He also voted against Lend-Lease , according to the record . He was against reciprocal trade agreements , ex- , cept in 1943 , when the war was on. , He voted for Selective Service , but supported the proposal to give the volunteer system a sixty-day trial before the draft was used . Speaker Martin opposed , in 1941 , the extending of the Selective Service Act by an additional eighteen months . He supported the British loan in 1946 , and departed from the majority of the Republicans in the House to do so . His domestic voting record is " anti-New Deal " generally , but he , is among the supporters of Social Security and Wage-Hour enactments . He voted , in 1943 , for the Smith-Connally Labor Disputes Bill ; and for the Case Labor-Control Bill , which President Truman vetoed , in 1946.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
