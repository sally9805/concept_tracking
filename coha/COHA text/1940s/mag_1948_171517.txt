Ontario 's legislature was out to encourage the arts ; for the best picture in the Ontario Society of Artists ' show , it offered a $500 prize . But the Peterborough Examiner thought that art in Canada needed a lot more than that . Said the Examiner : <P> " Artists ... do not like to be outcasts , engaged in work which most of their fellow citizens regard as ... outside the range of normal human interests . ... It is not fashionable in our country to be deeply interested in the arts . ... In spite of our high standard of living ( which is usually interpreted as meaning a high standard of eating ) and our much-vaunted educational system ( which teaches our children everything except a love of learning ) , we are still content to live and think on a very humdrum level . . . . Until Canadians discover that thinking can be fun , the arts in this country must expect to fare poorly . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
